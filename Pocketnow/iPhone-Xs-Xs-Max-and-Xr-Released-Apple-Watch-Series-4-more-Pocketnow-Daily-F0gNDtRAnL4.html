announced then we've got to admit
they're gorgeous the iPhone 10 R was
also announced and that brings the same
capabilities for a better price tag yeah
but watch series 4 also made the cut too
with the new display and focused on
health I'm high meadow Iveta and well
fun fact this video was supposed to be
recorded from the YouTube headquarters I
was there today but I guess they didn't
understand that this is parking out
daily and they had to approve the video
in 48 hours let's get through the news
brought to you by Qualcomm the official
news today believe it or not do not
begin with Apple I promise you all have
at least one thing and it's focused on
the new poco phone those of you in the
United States that want to get one you
can but there's a catch it's available
only on eBay right now and it starts at
335 bucks so that's all fine and dandy
but the problem is that there are some
limitations in DRM so you won't be able
to consume content like Netflix for
example and other things that are kind
of weird or you won't be able to consume
Netflix in HD I believe you can learn
more about everything in the description
it is still a great phone now let's move
the spotlight over to Apple because
yesterday was iPhone day and yes we will
be talking about iPhones very soon let's
focus on that new 812 Bionic chip we
thought that the Kirin 980 from Huawei
was gonna be the first processor with
the 7 nanometer architecture no it's
going to be the a12 Bionic that is going
to be available over the next couple of
days already yes it's more power
efficient 30% faster as well there's
just so much going on with mobile
technology one of the things that I like
the most is just the improvements in
photography I am looking forward to that
now let's talk about the new Apple watch
series for believe it or not the company
has just changed the display it's 30%
larger the back is ceramic
there's a new AKG capability in just the
sensors the heart rate sensors on the
back look completely different they look
really cool there's haptic feedback from
the digital crown and well price tags
are rather interesting as the watch is
actually getting bigger to a certain
degree now we've got 49 millimeters and
42 millimeters instead of the 38 that we
had in the back
but the series 3 is still available the
price has actually dropped then you get
that today you can learn more about that
again in the description it's very
interesting that the one more thing at
the Apple event was really the iPhone 10
R and not the 10 s that we're leaving
for last
according to Apple this phone is going
to be for all markets 6.1 inch display
with a smaller footprint than the iPhone
8 plus apparently even better battery
life this new super liquid LCD display
that's got retina capabilities it's got
the 8 12 Bionic it's got a ton of things
it's all fine and dandy but definitely
remember if you're going for that more
affordable iPhone it might be the best
time to list your current iPhone on swap
ah as this phone is slated for October
if you're looking for a more affordable
option you probably buy a better option
at swap out today for the current
iPhones or just list the one you have
and prepare for that one to come and
finally the hot news today are
definitely the iPhone 10s and 10's Macs
where do they get these names 5.8 inch
displays 6.5 inches obviously that
tennis max is huge we've got dual
cameras and apparently improvements in
the display they say that battery life
is going to be somewhat better to the
iPhones and I love the references where
I consider the iPhone 10 to have
terrible battery life but then they
bring improvements to HDR and
photography there's just so much coming
to this phone and then again also so
little this is an S variant it doesn't
really bring major improvements let us
know in the comments down below what do
you think about Apple's announcement
today the fact that they didn't launch
the iPads we were expecting or the Maxis
iPhones an Apple watch in my case I'll
be honest with you I'm going for the 10s
if I have to pick not the next that
thing is huge and the name is just gonna
be a mouthful but leave us a comment
down below we would love to know your
opinion did you know that even if most
smartwatches claim to do Fitness they
either don't do it well or their
batteries don't last as long the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 3100 now
enables a dedicated sports mode
depending on your watch this means up to
15 hours of fitness activities with GPS
tracking heartrate
sensing all working without a problem it
even allows brands to bring their own
science to the fitness experience of
your watch hit the link in the
description below to learn more about
why the new Qualcomm Snapdragon wear
