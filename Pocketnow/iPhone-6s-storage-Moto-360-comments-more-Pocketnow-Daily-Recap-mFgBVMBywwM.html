Nev area better more than you should and
it's not my fault you don't like my name
or yours you look pale I man i know i
need more makeup you need to get a hot
girl doing the show i'm getting tired of
you and I could not agree more that's
right it's that time of the week I am hi
Matt event this is pocket now and this
is the Parnell daily recap the last week
monday was about fitness and smart
watches watch CEO it just announced that
they had a SmartWatch solution but
they'll focus on battery life and not
fitness tracking to give you a better
product than I asked you that was
important to you fitness on a SmartWatch
we had 430 comments we start with now
it's not important because I wear a
Fitbit to track my fitness and I wish I
could agree i have a fitbit the problem
is it does not really track more than
your steps some cases they try to track
other things but the fitbit doesn't
really do more than that and your steps
don't necessarily tell you how much
effort you placed into your calorie burn
of course fitness tracking would be a
use to you Jaime you look like an
out-of-shape stuff little elf all right
no I don't care about fitness tracking
or anything let alone a SmartWatch it's
a fad that will surely pass you know I
thought that at the beginning but then
again in the case of the Apple watch
again there are things that i hate about
it but fitness tracking alone is
something this watch this really well i
feel that there is a future for it they
just have to figure out the price tag on
does they ask you what you thought about
the future moto 360 prices back then the
product was not announced and we had
heard that it would cost above $350 just
like the Apple watch we have 600 11
comments we start with just because it's
all 316 doesn't mean you have to charge
360 end up yeah I do agree i buy a model
362 at that price if there were no flat
tire comes with at least two bands
leather in metal oled battery that can
last for more than two days and a glass
screen that is closer to the panel
itself I would too but then again given
the smart watches in the market right
now you know it's kind of compelling I
do love the 360 in its design and you
know watches have to be about design
first three hundred and ninety dollars
for Moto 360 no thanks I'd rather pay
ten dollars more for the new Moto X this
is the best comment of the day it tells
you just how listed the SmartWatch mark
is right now you can buy a Moto X for
ten dollars more so oh my god I do agree
with you best comment of the week again
Tuesday was about lenovo and motorola to
the layoffs lenovo ended up statute all
their smartphone business into motorola
i ask you we thought about this move we
had 463 comments we start with moto novo
now and no lenovo does some really cool
things and i feel that there is a bright
future for motorola with this change
particularly i had a lenovo i wanted to
destroy the lenovo i had a motorola g2 i
wanted to destroy the motorola do to see
the pattern i'm going to and sad for you
dude i actually like their products as
long as the lenovo does it interfere
with motorola's design and let them keep
making phones but the way motorola has
been doing then I'm fine with that you
know lenovo has some very compelling
designs a lot of thinness a lot of metal
i think that there is a benefit in this
mix particularly because Motorola's
designed even though you know ergonomic
as in really sold well I'm Thursday ask
you live 4k video recording and a selfie
flasher things that are important to you
as these are the rumors that are coming
with the iphone success we had 584
comments we start with 4k apple doesn't
listen to what customers want from an
iphone 4 k was available on android
phone since 2013 and yes I had the
galaxy note 3 one of the first phones
with 4k and I still have not recorded a
4k video in all that time so I kind of
understand why Apple didn't do it or can
an iphone get ready for mass media
coverage of this revolutionary feature
on a phone I hate it when Apple does
that to 4k video is almost a must in
flagship phones nowadays it's just nice
to have but not very practical selling
flash is just useless gimmick yeah I
hate photos with flashes let's just see
if it eventually ends up happening that
would be weird for Apple finally Friday
we talked about some different iphone 6s
rumors particularly the options for
sapphire the option for a rose gold unit
and the fact that the phone will start
at 16 gigabytes of storage yet again and
I asked you what you thought and we had
796 comments we start with I don't care
about color I just want my 32 gigabyte
from the same price as the 16 gigabyte
or similar I think
but Apple is playing a rough game here
black ships are starting at 32 gigs and
some are expandable story gets 16
gigabytes is just plain stupid of course
they're going to keep the 16 gigabyte
model how else are they going to keep
making huge profits without overcharging
for below average specs it's the
consumer if the consumer is willing to
buy it they'll keep selling it and you
were right a lot of people don't really
care about storage a lot of people have
good LTE connectivity with the limited
plans and they just don't care but that
is not the reality for the rest of the
world and it's tough to be you know
spending an extra hundred dollars for
these things 16 gigabytes how many 4k
videos will you be able to record it I
love this comment too particularly
because that's the reality the reason
why I don't use a 16 gig iphone is
because I have a ton of photos I have a
lot of videos i love to play games i
love to carry music and 16 gigabytes has
not been enough for years you barely get
half of that which won't even be enough
for the applications you want to install
I feel that Apple should reconsider I
you know even if they started thirty
dollars more I don't think there's much
more of a price difference but hey
that's just me that's it for the bargain
