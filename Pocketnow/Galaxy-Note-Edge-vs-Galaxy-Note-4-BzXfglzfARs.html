favorite large format smartphone of 2014
but Samsung being Samsung wasn't content
to leave its best phablet be instead the
company has released the Galaxy Note
edge as a specialized sibling a carbon
copy with a quirky quality to its
display I'm Michael Fisher with a
PocketNow comparison Galaxy Note edge
versus galaxy note 4 in a side-by-side
look what gives the Note edge its name
is obvious an extra hundred and sixty
pixels on the right side of its display
angled downward like the leading edge of
an airplane wing we'll get to how the
edge display functions in a second for
this category we're focused on look and
feel and it does give the Note edge a
totally different character than the
note 4 the devices are almost identical
in mass and measurements but whereas the
conventional note feels robust and
balanced the note edge feels strangely
less premium mainly that's thanks to the
asymmetric cross-section of the edge
which makes it awkward to pick up and
hold and then there's the small details
the omission of the note 4 is reinforced
corners and the reduction in champers
from 2 to 1 changes reflected even on
the volume rockers and in otherwise nice
bit of attention to detail by Samsung
the Note edge doesn't necessarily feel
cheap on its own but it definitely
doesn't give off the same quality vibe
as its sibling other Hardware
differences are slight the note forced
screen is a touch taller and there's an
almost imperceptible shift in color
temperature on our review devices which
is probably just variations across
batches battery size has been slightly
trimmed on the note edge as well but it
doesn't seem to affect overall endurance
otherwise these are the same from s-pen
2's health by the same token TouchWiz is
still TouchWiz so if you're looking for
our take on the software here check out
our earlier review of the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 all our impressions remain the
same the biggest day-to-day difference
comes just where you'd expect it to on
the edge samsung has so completely
segregated the display extension that it
basically serves as an independent
secondary screen and it affects how you
use the note edge in
every single display mode one of the
smallest but also most useful
enhancements is the screens night clock
turn the screen off and the edge screen
flickers to life at the lowest
brightness setting reporting the date
the time and the current weather
conditions wake up the display to show
the lock screen and you get the express
me panel alongside a completely
customizable side screen that can show
anything from a stock greeting to an
s-pen drawing to a stock animation to a
custom image an image that rotates as
you move the phone by the way it's
probably the best named feature of the
edge display because it's there to add
an expressive element to the experience
to let you make the note edge your own
if you're not satisfied just choosing
between black and white casing colors
and it's fun unlock the note edge and
you start to see how the added screen
effects everyday usability of course the
note 4 allows you to run Android the way
you want to for us that means folders or
shortcuts on almost every home screen
with the occasional side key panel if
we're going one-handed for a while on
the note edge the added real-estate
means you can offload a ton of apps and
folders to the side ribbon freeing up
room on the home screen for more widgets
or just more open space also on the edge
screen weather health news and quick
tools including timers and audio
recorder flashlights and yes indeed a
ruler that stuff's available even when
the phone is locked and you can also
download custom plugins from the Galaxy
app store for still more functionality
yeah some of this is straight-up Samsung
feature bloat and notifications coming
in on the side screen aren't as easy to
read on account of you know there's
sideways so is the edge screen a gimmick
definitely and if you want a more
straightforward software experience well
obviously the note 4 is the better
choice but look raw utility isn't
everything some of the edges add-ons are
really cool and they're implemented with
a lot of style too plus the fact that
it's all grouped on the side of the
screen gives the Note edge and
unexpected advantage out of the box it
turns out to be quite good for
one-handed use as long as you're
right-handed and careful where you rest
your thumb oh and as long as you don't
mind the
camera UI we're reluctant to dock the
note edges viewfinder because it looks
so much cleaner than the note force but
the same layout that provides that
aesthetic boost also makes the edge
awkward to use when taking photos in
landscape the buttons up top are too
easy to hit accidentally and while
portrait mode is a little better it
still demands a very delicate touch you
can use the volume keys as a shutter
button but you can do that on the note 4
- fortunately the same optics that
impressed us on the note 4 are back on
the note edge performance in all
lighting conditions and all shooting
modes was nearly identical for us across
three days of shooting with the same
brilliant colors and the same smooth
optical image stabilization keeping
things nice and steady more often than
not if you liked the galaxy note 4's
pictures you'll like the edges just as
much and that goes for the front-facing
camera as well you might expect
performance between the two identically
spec smartphones to be identical and in
the case of our snapdragon powered units
here you'd be mostly right that's
talking about the mundane stuff though
general snappiness game performance and
the like more interesting is what
happens when say a phone call interrupts
one of those games the note 4 gives you
a pop-up window that obscures some of
the action while the edge uses the added
screen space to stay out of your way and
when you're using the edge to listen to
music or an award-winning podcast you
don't need to cover up the app you're in
if you want to pause or skip a track
grant it on the note 4 it's a very minor
inconvenience to do the same thing be in
the notification tray but it's more
evidence that Samsung really thought
through the edge screen finally speaking
of speakers let's talk voice quality
callers said they heard slightly more
background noise on the note edge and
standard calling mode and they also said
we sounded a little louder a little
closer to overpowering when using the
edge speaker compared to the note fours
but the difference was very minor and
for all practical purposes these are
nearly identical
choosing between these two phones
probably won't be too difficult for most
folks we find the note four to be the
better more balanced phone both
literally and in terms of features and
day to day use and the edges price tag
also weighs against it but if you are
willing to spend the money the edge
experience isn't so much worse that you
should avoid it either
after all it's a note and the note line
of smartphones is excellent if standing
out is important to you or you want to
spray just a little more Chrome onto a
phone already loaded with it the Galaxy
Note edge gets the job done if you're
looking for a deeper dive on Samsung's
most feature packed note stay tuned for
our full note edge video review coming
later this week and be sure to check out
our galaxy note 4 review here on YouTube
and at pocketnow.com till next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now
captain to phones on twitter urging you
not to go over the edge yeah that was
lame sorry we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
