yeah yeah it's here where do you get
that shirt from the company's name is
RIPT apparel they make some amazing
designs there's more information on link
in the description out daily is
just a tech news video why am I always
here early why can't I stop I'm it what
sorcery are you working on me man dude I
do not know but if it works on girls you
let me know that's right it's that time
of the week I am high memory that I've
this is pocket now and this is the
pocket out daily recap for last week so
on Monday the topic was WWDC we asked
you what do you think about Apple not
launching any hardware and well we have
363 comments no macbooks big
disappointment you know I found a lot of
people complaining about the lack of new
macbooks I am complaining as well I
would like to see something different
and hardware but the fact that they're
waiting just makes my current macbook
last a little longer I'm disappointed
because there is no split screen mode on
the iphone come on Apple's split screen
mode on a small iphone that I don't
think that's ever gonna happen it would
make a lot of sense on the plus variant
though so boring i'm a customer not a
developer give me hardware performance
damn that's called the Worldwide
Developer Conference not consumer
conference I think that's the reason on
Tuesday the topic was the galaxy note
seven not six anymore and I asked you
what do you think about the probability
of Samsung having an event on August
second as the rumors are pointing and we
had another 363 comments it's bad it
will make my galaxy s7 old soon you know
from all the rumors i believe the Galaxy
Note lineup will be different to the
galaxy s7 so I think that's actually a
good thing but that's just me galaxy
note 7 will be the best album ever
judging by some of the rumors I do agree
but I cannot wait to see what we get
because it wouldn't be the first time
that Samsung teases something and that's
not really what we get note 7 will steal
a spotlight from Apple you know I do
believe that the early announcement has
that purpose for the note 7 to have
enough time to dive into consumers that
the iphone 7 plus or whatever it'll be
called will just be too late to the
market
on Wednesday the topic was the one plus
three back then we had the announcement
that was before a review and I asked you
what did you think about the price tag
and everything we had 659 comments it's
compelling but I'll see what the Nexus
springs you know the problem with the
launch period of the one plus three is
really that the fact that we are getting
closer to the fall where we've got
another batch of high-end smartphones so
I do get your point I'm waiting on the
pricing of the Moto Z or for the new
Moto X but the one plus three is looking
pretty good I do agree the one plus
three is a great phone but again we go
back to the point we've got more phones
being announced the thing is i believe
the one plus three doesn't really
compete against these phones it is a
flagship killer and price tag with
high-end specifications it's not even a
premium mid-ranger so i do believe that
it's got a market of its own the camera
bump killed it for me they should have
filled the phone with more battery oh my
god yes I do agree I don't mind the
camera bump but I do wonder why not fill
it up with more battery that's my
opinion as well then on Thursday the
topic was smart flo a probable new
feature that might come to the Galaxy
Note 74 notifications I asked you what
you thought and we had 647 comments Wow
another thing that will drain battery
great just bring back the IR blaster and
give us a 5000 H milliamp hour battery I
don't think it's gonna drain the battery
but then again that's judging by the
information from the patents but my god
yes if they would just add more battery
and give us fact that IR blaster I would
be happy to the note needs to have a
removal back people shouldn't be looking
for beauty they should be looking for
supreme function and spec bump this is
how it should differentiate oh my god
that would be amazing if Samsung would
figure out a way to bring back the
Galaxy Note 2 its early years to what it
was replaceable everything full fledge
specifications that is truly what I
would be looking for but as I stated
earlier that's just me as well then out
7 as a premium powerhouse phone and it
needs all premium things the main
premium thing should be front facing
speakers what would I do with a powerful
phone with one locked or shark speaker I
you know I had not thought about this
but it would be amazing if Samsung would
figure it out truly
juan is really disappointed over the
quality of sound of galaxy s7 for
example i actually do agree and i do
believe that it would be a great idea of
samsung would figure out a way to bring
this into the note true and then finally
friday we were talking about I message
and Apple executive told Walt Mossberg
that there will not be I message coming
to Android and I asked you if you think
that's a smart move for Apple we had 974
comments go cross-platform I want to
switch to android so bad ow I don't
think that I message is enough of a
reason for you to stay on an iPhone but
hey that's just you i guess i really
want I message on Android and it would
be more popular just because of Android
everybody would start using it as their
SMS app to text you know I kind of agree
with this because the beauty of I
message is that it's seamless you really
don't have to care of you using SMS or I
message it just doesn't really matter
because the phone will automatically do
it and right now it's a problem because
it only works for iphone users so yeah
it would be a good reason for even
Android users to use it I don't need I
message when a low is coming out soon
yes allo brings a lot of the features
that I message is bringing to iOS 10 or
backwards i should say because a low was
announced earlier the problem is that
whole problem of having one messaging
application for Android one for iPhones
there are a lot more iphones in the
market and strengths and it just makes
the experience cumbersome so i would not
agree on having a low i wish there was
just one application that all companies
would use and that would make the
experience seamless because switching to
android can be a problem i do get the
points of other people as well that's it
