announced in September 9th as a teaser
sony gives us another teaser of its
products expected for Aoife 2014 and the
Moto X plus one could experiment with
some new materials that are hot I'm
hanging that'll be bettah and when
you're done watching this video please
turn off your computer phone or tablet
and hit the road and have some fun this
is parking out daily let's begin today
with what's official if we could call it
that way a sony has continued to tease
its products to happen at Aoife 2014
we've got this really cool video link to
the description watch the full thing and
you'll notice the different things that
so many plans to promote with its new
products that will be announced one of
these being the Sony Xperia z3 we're
expecting the tablet compact whatever
name they've got to that and a
SmartWatch so a lot of cool things are
coming in September third when that
event happens and we will be covering it
live now one of the vice that we've got
tired talking about here because nobody
can really get it so far as the oneplus
one yes that whole invite system is
really distracting the product and its
reputation but the company thinks that
they should swap the system even though
it's pretty much going to be the same
thing now they're going to move away
from invitations and they're going to go
through pre-orders which means
pre-orders that you have to still wait
for the damn phone to be launched in
your doorstep at some point whenever I'm
just so annoyed that the way the system
is working leave us a comment down below
and tell us what you think about the
oneplus one do you have one now even
though we're not clear as to what HTC
will show is at Eva 2014 there are
rumors of the company has two
smartwatches in production or in the
works and apparently these will be
announced in the next couple of months
or announced that Aoife and launched the
next couple of months now we don't have
any specific details aside from to code
names that are rather interesting ww-why
and CW z I don't know whatever whatever
that means and there are some
specification is in the looks of the
description hopefully HTC will bring its
iconic design to the SmartWatch market
something very very needed up now let's
talk about motorola we know the company
is holding a parallel event to Aoife
it's happening in chicago row
that will be covering this live and
rumors have it that the company is going
to experiment with some new materials
with the it's moto maker service for the
Moto X plus one apparently one of these
new things is going to be denim and no
it's not the first time that we see
denim in a cover sure this is the first
time we see it in a phone in a
production phone so obviously motor oil
is going to figure out how to quote this
thing in a way that it will last
whatever wear and tear you give it so
stay tuned as the Moto X plus 1 is
probably one of the devices we're
expecting the most especially because of
that optical zoom rumor that we've been
talking about and finally for the sort
of disappointing news or rumors of the
day let's talk about the iWatch a
zeppelin rumored to announce everything
on September 9th the iWatch the iphone 6
and everything but rumors have it that
it will be launched officially in your
doorstep until december that's the
previous rumor now the new ones have
that that Apple is not even ready for
December apparently this will happen
until sometime in 2015 which is a first
for Apple Apple has never really
announced something now and launched in
six months later except for the iphone
the original one but what happens is
that obviously the market is flooding
and we really want to see what Apple is
bringing to the case so that leads me to
the question of the day we've got so
many rumors the gear s we've got so many
cool smartwatches coming probably from
HTC in from other companies the Moto 360
etc so would you wait for the iWatch
with this or not because in my case it
will depend on the announcement it was a
