pocketnow.com testing the 1080p video
recording capability of the samsung
galaxy s2 previously we recorded a
sample outdoors and now we're in a
different light situation lower light
indoors and we're also going closer up
on some objects previously we were going
sort of zoomed out and let us know how
the color looks let us know how the
clarity is how my voice sounds of it's
clear we're certainly really excited to
see 1080p video capture come to
smartphones previously we were limited
to 720p but dual-core smartphones are
letting us make the jump to 1080p and
get that higher resolution which is
always nice so we can play it back on a
flat panel or upload it to youtube or
watch it on our computer I'm going to
get really close to this leaf and see at
what point it starts to get blurry seems
good so far and of course every camera
has its limit as to how much it can
focus on a very close-up object so again
this is video sample from the samsung
galaxy s2 let us know how the quality
looks shooting in full 1080p resolution
and check out the full review on
pocketnow.com coming up soon of the
galaxy s2 this is a really cool phone
Samsung's benchmark for 2011 we've got a
lot of things to say about it that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
