pocketnow.com and now we're gonna take a
look at the out of box experience of the
i-mate ultimate 95 oh - I'm gonna start
by taking off this screen protector here
okay
alright now I'm going to open up the
back and put in the battery looks like
there's a little clip here and I'm gonna
put my sim card in first using the 18 t
network since this is an unlocked phone
I can use it on you know you can use it
on t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T any GSM carrier here so
it looks like I put it in this way nope
do I lay it flat first okay that's took
me a minute to figure out what you do is
lay down the SIM card flat and then put
the metal door on top of it so we're
gonna put in this massive battery now so
it goes up first and then it clicks in
like that it's metal this case is
actually metal so that's that's good
good build quality okay it took me a
minute to get the back on there so now
let's turn it on and it looks like near
this leathery texture texture there's a
power button I've got a little vibration
shouldn't mean it's coming on alright
and that took about three or four
minutes now we do the screen alignment
as usual every windows mobile device or
an Eastern time next ok skip that and
here we are see what see what the
today's screen looks like ok it looks
like we're installing some imate
software right now as is the case with
most devices so this will probably take
a few minutes and I could stop it by
resetting the device but I obviously
want to see what I made has included on
this device ok and we finally got all
the software installed so this is the
standard today screen and on here we
have looks like live search built in
everything else is pretty clean which is
good it's not cluttered with a bunch of
crap where trialware or anything like
that this screen looks fantastic you
obviously can't tell over the You Tube
video but it's a VGA resolution let me
turn up the brightness a bit and go into
settings let's see how fast this wow
that was pretty fast pretty fast I'm
gonna go into system and backlight and
Jack this up much better I wonder how
fast the screen rotates
yeah slow very very slow let's compare
it to the the Kaiser here so up I forgot
that the Kaiser opens the other way so
let's try that again get them in focus
okay it looks like the tilt is a little
bit faster but they're about the same
speed so let's let's go into the
programs menu real quick and just see
what we have very fast it's very very
fast Wow I'm and I'm very impressed you
can hear the surprise in my voice so
let's see we've got a clear view PDF I
don't know what that is device
customization screen looks really really
good kind it's taking a while to come up
here a related task is currently in
progress would you like to proceed no
I'll just deal with that later
I made configurator I wonder what that's
all about and are we going to respond I
guess not okay let's move on and the
rest of standard stuff see why wow
that's the wireless manager very
interesting skin on that I'm curious as
to why I have no phone reception right
now perhaps up with a SIM card in the
wrong way I really need to check on that
if I click on the exclamation point says
no service which makes no sense so I'll
definitely have to look into that but
lots more to come on this in the full
review which will be posted later this
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
