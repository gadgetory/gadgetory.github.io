with a throwback to an old Windows
mobile phone made by HTC codenamed
the Star Trek this is an m8 branded
phone flip it open you can see they
called it the smart flip HTC call it the
Star Trek because of this cool
communicator style flip this was really
popular right after the Motorola RAZR 's
made their debut has the same style
keypad on it where you've got this
really nice solid feeling aluminum
keypad backlit with blue in this case
with most Windows mobile phones
you've got your directional pad up-down
left-right with an action button in the
middle two soft buttons home and back as
we've become accustomed to nice thing
about this you've got this nice big
screen up here this ran the standard
edition of Windows Mobile but the good
folks over at xda-developers were able
to hack a version of Windows Mobile
professional onto it as well
no touchscreen but you had the same user
interface and the hardware guts it was
plenty fast enough to run it neat things
about this phone on the face of it
you've got your camera which is a way
facing camera when it's open but down
here you've got this neat little LCD and
I'd love to be able to show this to you
but this mechanism right here
eventually wears out the connection in
the middle so the screen doesn't work
the rest of the phone works great just
nothing on the screen kind of defeats
the purpose of a smart phone in my
opinion but with this external facing
LCD you've got caller ID you've got date
time with your little playback buttons
down here at the bottom track back track
forward and play pause you even got
control over all of your mp3s or WMAs so
really neat on the inside pop the
battery cover off you've got your slot
for a sim so it'll work on any of your
GSM networks no 3G in this phone folks
is strictly edged doesn't even have
Wi-Fi but it does have bluetooth which
you can surf the web over
to find out you've also got a microSD
slot in it this was one of the first
phones that came with a microSD slot
very nice solid other than this one
little design flaw
another great phone from HTC so for
pocketnow.com I'm Joe Levi with a
throwback of the im8 smart flip also
known as the HTC Star Trek</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
