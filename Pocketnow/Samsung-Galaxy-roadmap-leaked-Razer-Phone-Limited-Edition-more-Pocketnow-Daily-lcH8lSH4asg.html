reveals code names for the company's
2018 roadmap there's a new limited
edition razor phone in town but the
differences are significant and it seems
that Apple beat Samsung and smartphone
sales at least briefly I'm Jaime meadow
Iveta and I couldn't wait for this
Friday up until I remember that I have
to work tomorrow
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today have to do with deals of here
in the market for a new laptop the
surface laptop is not necessarily the
one I'd recommend most not necessarily
because it's a bad product but because
it's kind of expensive now in the case
of the m3 model Intel Core M 3 and I
almost got stuck there it's currently
$7.99 and it's going to be on sale for a
limited amount of time you can learn
more about it in the description and how
about if we talk about analytics and
which companies hold the most for 2017
believe it or not Apple was the king of
q4 2017 with 77 million units compared
to 74 from Samsung now for those of you
that find that to be odd it's actually
not it turns out a number I mean the
next galaxies are a few weeks away so
usually iPhone sell more during this
period of time if you want to know the
yearly numbers 315 million versus at 214
yeah Samsung is definitely selling a lot
more phones now let's talk about the
razor phone as the company is launching
a new variant for the Lunar New Year and
if you were expecting major differences
they're actually not it's actually the
same device pretty much only that the
Razer logo at the back is gold instead
of green the same price tag and
obviously it'll launch in certain
markets you can learn more about that
launch of description our unit is
actually on its way I can't wait to tell
you about what I think about that razor
phone now as well the spotlight over to
Samsung as we continue to get more
information getting leaked about the
device in the case of the galaxy s 9 and
that's 9 plus there are already leaked
cases official cases from Samsung that
shows that the Galaxy S 9s 9 plus
actually don't change in design when it
comes to size pretty much if you
currently have a galaxy s 8 it'll fit on
those cases the only reason why you can
use it
is because obviously the camera holes
are in different places but they're
pretty much the same size and this is
actually great I love the size of the
regular size s8 not so much about the SI
Plus which one was your favorite and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with the future roadmap of
Samsung Galaxy devices courtesy of the
leaked firmware of the Galaxy Note 8
Oreo update so as it turns out we've got
the code names for example of the s9s 9
plus which are star and star 2
respectively
we've also got a ton of code names for a
ton of samsung galaxy jay's a lot of
galaxy tablets and seems that that's not
going to die most interesting we've got
the Samsung Galaxy has 9 active which
the codename is funny it's called a star
Q LTE and then again you can see the
full list in the description we still
don't have information on the samsung
galaxy note 9 which is weird but anyways
it leads me to the question today I mean
what are you planning to buy for 2018
are you planning to buy one of these
galaxies in the roadmap or are you
looking into another smartphone and why
let us know in the comments
in my case obviously I have to review
them all so I'd be biased leave us a
comment we'd love to know your opinion
