more as the company finally decided on a
name that doesn't include plus and
instead I phone 10 s it looks like the
three Samsung Galaxy S tens will have a
fingerprint scanner under the display
and Nokia finally has all the tools it
needs to bring some megapixel fun on its
cameras I'm hanging that ravenna and for
those of you that make fun of my jokes
there are some better ones from you guys
in the comments of the pocket out daily
recap this is pocket out daily powered
by qualcomm the official news today
begin with one of the hottest devices
that we're anticipating lately the
oneplus 60 we hear that's already being
certified in Russia and that could only
mean that we are gearing up for a launch
and yes I do agree we are very close to
the 1 plus 6 but I don't mind another
launch I mean I feel that the changes in
the design that I've seen so far are
probably gonna be really cool another
thing that might turn out to be really
cool has to do with Nokia and it's peer
review patents for those of you that
remember all these fans belong to
Microsoft and the company seated most of
not we thought all of these patents were
seated to hmd and nokia recently but
that turns out that not all of them were
there apparently the pure view pens the
ones that allowed for the Lumia 1020 and
the 808 PureView were still in Microsoft
hands and now they're not when are we
gonna get a crazy phone with a ton of
megapixels it's hard to tell but we do
here that could be part of the roadmap
it's got some interesting rumors of the
Sony Xperia z3 we don't know exactly
when we're getting it we've barely
gotten the egg z2 in the egg z2 premium
which I'm still waiting on but we've got
sources claiming that number one we're
not getting a notch on the display
number two that it's gonna remain full
HD Plus which is weird
number three apparently that 48
megapixel sensor from Sony is finally
gonna make a launch in a Sony phone
I'm not saying first but it will come on
this phone question is when this phone
is gonna happen now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 as we've heard
rumors that we're getting three phones
all with different capabilities one of
these will not bring a curved display
which is weird but most interesting the
on display fingerprint scanner seems to
not be a feature of one of these three
apparently it's going to come on all
three phones which I
love I find that awesome that it's a
standard we will see if indeed it
happens we hear that the launch will be
early next year and finally the hot news
today have to do with the iPhone 10 plus
that we thought we were gonna be calling
the plus really it's not gonna happen
that way according to men sheet quote
it's gonna be called the iPhone 10s so
it seems that the smaller one is gonna
be the iPhone 10 I don't know what the
name of the other one's gonna be but
this one is gonna be called the iPhone
10s or XS which would mean excessive
which sounds right according to quo
we're getting other features like
landscape mode on this display and
support for the Apple pencil all this is
great the dual-sim capabilities
apparently will take a little more time
to be launched or not at all we're still
not sure about that one but in today's
question what do you think the name of
the next generation iPhone should be and
don't come up with those like crazy I
can already imagine the ranting comments
that we're gonna probably get about that
but what do you think the name should be
in my case iPhone 10s does seem to be
good but we'll see leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion we'd also like to ask you to
stay till the end of this video for a
reward from our sponsor
that allows this video to be possible
and yes that you know that most of the
technology that has enabled this
industry and even this video for the
past 30 years has been powered by
qualcomm from the modems that outperform
competitors and data speeds according to
Okla ^ the snapdragon 845 on the latest
flagship smartphones there's a reason
why today's top brands choose Qualcomm
