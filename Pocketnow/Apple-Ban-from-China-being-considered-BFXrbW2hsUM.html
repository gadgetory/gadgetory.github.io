the Huawei ban if China decides to
strike back to the US the 2019 iPhones
just received certification in a
database and there are a ton of variants
and if you're planning to buy a Galaxy S
10 you should really wait for a color
option that seems to be in the works
I'm hematuria Vanna and honestly with
this whole drama
if the with the US and China I wonder
what would be a good meme for this show
this is fog and I'll daily brought to
you by brave the official news today
begin with deals to a certain degree if
you're in the market for a smart speaker
the home pod would be the last one I'd
recommend but I know that there are a
ton of people out there that are in the
Apple ecosystem so right now the
certified refurbished black variant of
the home pod can be found for 194
dollars obviously again it's only a
three month warranty but if you're in
the market I mean why not now let's talk
about Facebook and whatsapp the sad
combination I wish that whatsapp wasn't
owned by Facebook think about it is well
whatsapp founders never wanted to
monetize them now they're out Facebook
has now confirmed that a convention that
they're gonna monetize whatsapp through
stories just like what we see with
Instagram stories apparently we're
getting that as of 2020 so let's start
looking for another messaging service
how about that now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 continues to be one
of our favorite phones apparently there
is a cardinal red variant that just got
leaked not exactly sure if it's going to
be an exclusive for any region I hope
that it comes to the United States
whatever the case might be if you're in
the market I would wait for that color
and let's move the spotlight over to
iPhones we've been covering stove iPhone
11 leaks for the longest time the
funniest part is that it just got
certified and euro-asian the entities
and the funny part is there are 11
variants iPhone 11 11 variants and so
obviously there are different variations
of each product depending on what region
because of the bands that have to be
supported so that's the main reason why
there are 11 variants apparently three
of the 10 are three of the 10s three of
the 10s Max and we're straining trying
to scratch our heads over the last two
whatever the case may be
stay tuned
and finally the most interesting news
today have to do with again the China
versus United States the fact that well
we know the band for huawei but we've
already got publications that are
speculating what could happen if things
got flipped over towards Apple if you've
noticed apple stock has been down
repeatedly for the last couple of days
ever since the ban came to effect and
the main reason why is because well
China has already sent out a formal
claim over what's happening to wall way
and the rumors are that this could be
happening to Apple and so worst-case
scenarios have already been predicted by
all analysts Apple would lose 29 percent
of its business meaning up to 15 billion
dollars and this is just in case China
decides to ban iPhones or Apple products
to be sold within China the question is
what happens if China also decides to
ban iPhone production in China which is
also in the table and that could be even
more catastrophic for Apple the question
down below is what do you think I mean
do you think that it's fair if the u.s.
is doing this to Huawei do you think
that it's fair for China to do it to
Apple because in my case I don't
necessarily think it's fair watch our
episode of the weekly tomorrow mainly
because one of the things that I
mentioned is that well it's not like if
China hasn't been banning Google
services from working in China so I
think that you know I don't necessarily
think that banning more US companies
would be a fair thing this is just China
getting part of what's happened since
China started banning us services but
this is my opinion obviously I could be
wrong we would love to know what you
think in the comments down below today's
