pocketnow.com and in this video we're
taking a look at the new version of
opera mini version 5 which is in beta
right now Opera Mini is one of the few
mobile browsers that use a server-side
rendering meaning when you call out for
a web site at first goes through the
server of opera gets compressed and sent
down to your device so it really speeds
up page rendering it's very close and
functionality to skyfire in fact we are
going to compare the two mobile browsers
in a few minutes to see which one is
actually faster so let's start by
turning on upper mobile 9.5 it's a java
application so it loads first in the
midlet manager so i'm going to go to
opera mini 5 beta and it takes a fair
amount of time to start up being a beta
okay so that took about 20 25 seconds
which is a little bit too long for a
mobile browser but again it's in beta
it's not quite finished now the first
view we get is very reminiscent of
Google Chrome so we have a bunch of
thumbnails of websites that we visit on
a regular basis and of course you can
press on one of these tiles to add or
you can dial into one of them let's go
to Wikipedia and take a look at what
that looks like we get a little message
here saying you sure you want to use
data I'm going to click yes and then
it's off right now we're using an evdo
connection at about half strength so
it's not as fast as it could be but it's
still a 3g connection so as you can see
it came in very fast here scrolling and
panning around the page is very fast you
can double tap to zoom and although
sometimes it doesn't quite work let me
give it a try here now you see sometimes
it doesn't work let me try again over
here which is probably one of the bugs
in the beta it does work in landscape
and it flips over the landscape very
fast but unfortunately for devices that
have slide out keyboards or at least the
HTC touch pro you can't use the hardware
keyboard only the on-screen keyboard so
let's do some speed tests and see how
fast opera mini five takes to alert load
certain pages so we're going to sweat
bet switch back to portrait and get a
stopwatch over next to the touch pro and
we're
start off by going to pocketnow.com and
here's the on-screen keyboard it's
pretty good it's nice nicely sized and
of course the text is very small on the
screen you can actually make adjustments
to that and I'm going to tap on the
first entry here and try to hit start at
the very same time if that's possible
and we're trying to go at the same time
ready set go
and here it comes at about 18 seconds a
little bit on the slow side of course we
can pan around the page the rendering is
very good what's really interesting
about opera mini five is that going back
to the previous page for some reason is
very very fast watch this you can kind
of flip between pages at a very rapid
velocity and I've tested this with
multiple web pages each time it goes
back very fast let's test with another
website let's go to engadget this time
and we're going to reset all right we're
gonna hit go at the same time ready set
go and there it comes in one quick burst
at about 17 or 18 seconds again not as
fast as it could be I think skyfire is
probably going to beat it but the
rendering fidelity is fantastic you can
get around on the screen very easily and
everything looks great once it comes
through there are some settings in opera
mini five and if you notice the bottom
bar here it's very reminiscent of opera
mobile 9.5 that is pre-loaded onto a lot
of windows mobile devices now so we can
tap on the little wrench here and get
some settings very easy to use interface
and we can actually have multiple tabs
open by clicking on this area we can
press + and go to say you know BBC News
or any other web page or enter a URL ok
so let's take a look at how fast skyfire
is we looked at two pages both of them
came through in about 17 seconds wasn't
amazing certainly a little bit faster
than Opera Mobile 9.5 so here we are in
sky fire and let's go to pocketnow.com
not configured as your default browser
we'll skip that and to be fair I'm going
to use the on-screen keyboard
here it goes and we're going to try to
get this the same time ready set go
against sky fire is also using server
side rendering to pull down the page a
little bit faster than you would get
with a standard browser like opera
mobile 9.5 or pocket Internet Explorer
and here it is in about 13 seconds and
we get some instructions on the screen
that kind of comes up in the first time
set up very similar in terms of how the
page renders very good double tap to
zoom in kind of thing let's take a look
at how fast it brings up engadget ok
here we go and ready set go
and it's done in about 20 seconds a
little bit slower than opera mini yet I
think that has to do with the slow EVD
connection that I'm on right now it's
not at full strength so overall opera
mini five really is the potential to
replace sky fires the fastest windows
mobile browser this test was a little
bit flawed because we're using kind of a
slow evdo network we don't have a full
signal up here but you can see by the
interface and the way that opera mini
allows you have multiple pages open and
quickly access your favorites that it
really is the potential to be an awesome
windows mobile browser and we're looking
forward to future betas and the final
release of opera mini when it becomes
available and works the way it should
for example the of course hardware
keyboard doesn't work on this particular
device so follow us on Twitter for more
