device melting ice cream sandwich on a
nvidia tegra 3 chip we have a 4.7 inch
Super LCD display it's all about HTC
Sense experience on top so talked about
dropbox integration so now we've HTC One
series you get 25 you three drop box and
you can take pictures in the hotel
upload them to drop option so share
links in emails but the real kind of
power of the 12 is with the camera so
we've got an amazing fabric how many
megapixels it wasn't mentioned in the
keynote the 18 has an 8-megapixel camera
okay and then really quick to launch
open up the app and take a picture and
you can do that in under a second we
have some really cool features which
you'd use the only expect to find on a
compact camera so we have both camera
shutter and the video controls in the
same screen and then if i press and hold
i can take a continuous shot and you can
actually hear that is taking shots every
point 2 of a second
Carly by default that sits about 20 x
can go up to 99 take them in the
resolution I've got the camera set to so
take 99 shots in a megapixel then what i
could do is i can select those i can
delete them i get rid of all of them if
i want to
or choose the ones I like
the really cool features that we have is
that when you take video you can
actually still take stills now once
questioned every time you take us still
is there any shutter sound like the
video is what we've done is we've made
sure shot doesn't sound person for so
and if it all either because I don't in
you is absolutely seamless and then one
of the cool things is that once you've
done stop and then you can go back into
your gallery
play the video again
and then take a still again so if we
miss it play it back in your gallery
take a stick will it take the still at
the four-link megapixel resolution HTTP
so depending on the resolution that you
shoot the video in ok depend on the
quality of the still detecting ok
thank you
how many how many aside from the Tegra 3
quad-core processor how much how many
megabytes of both instead of gigabytes
re-building stories and we get ram so
you get 32 into one x and u 1 gig of ram
ok
any information about pricing spiezio
low and obviously a magnificent
availability in April definitely well
