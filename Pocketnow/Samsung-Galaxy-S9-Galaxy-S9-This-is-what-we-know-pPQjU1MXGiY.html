hottest search term of 2018 is the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 and right it should
it's always been the hottest Android
lineup pretty much every year since its
inception this time the galaxy is even
cooler because apparently it'll fix a
ton of the things that we didn't like
about the s8 along with bringing some
new tricks I'm gonna be better with
pocket now and this is what we know
about the samsung galaxy as a9 and s9 +
brought to you by the vortex Shadow
leather bag let's begin this video with
the most important element that you'll
deal with when you buy a phone which is
the hardware it seems that the galaxy s
9 will looked a lot like the galaxy s 8
but change key elements it'll keep the
same aluminium sides it'll keep the
glass back but finally finally the
fingerprint scanner will be placed where
we wanted to be where we can actually
reach it another important aspect is
that apparently the display will be
asymmetrical when it comes to the bezels
and you know we've been dealing with
notches for the past couple of months so
that makes a lot of sense the top bezel
will be larger to house whatever
unlocking biometric feature there will
be and then at the bottom it'll be
slimmer which actually looks great if
you've seen a galaxy s 8 active it looks
a lot like that another interesting
element is that will finally get
differences between the Plus and the
regular variant being dual cameras on
the + and then a regular one single lens
camera on the regular size variant and
we'll deal with the cameras in a
separate segment now let's talk about
specification snapdragon 845 processor
from qualcomm in addition to the Exynos
98 10 whatever very you'll buy will
depend on which processor you'll get now
another interesting change will be the
fact that we will have more RAM on the +
variants 62 bytes vs. 4 now in the case
of storage apparently will start at 64
gigs expandable and then the typical of
differences in battery most important's
we're not getting a change in battery
apparently 3000 milliamp hour and one
3500 on the other one and for those of
you that are worrying about battery life
apparently these phones will launch with
Oreo makes all the sense and these are
changes in operating system in addition
to some changes in the
ooh new generation ten nanometer process
will apparently bring more battery
efficiency we're hoping on that one
mostly as galaxies are not necessarily
famous for this now so out the price tag
yesterday I got a lot of fire on the
pocket house daily because I forgot to
mention the price let's deal with it now
there are some rumors that came out
yesterday that say that it'll range
between 850 and 930 dollars at least in
the Korean exchange as we only have
pricing for Korea at the moment we're
not exactly sure if this will be the
price for one of the variants or if that
will be the range difference for both
now judging by the way things have
happened with other lineups and other
competitors I don't think that's going
to be the case I think that the plus
variant will probably be a little more
expensive and it could be sold or at
least the selling point will be whatever
changes are coming in the camera
features as again that's another
separate segment mainly because this is
how Samsung wants to price this phone
and it makes a lot of sense but finally
the most important feature of the Galaxy
S design that we've heard of is being
teased by the unpacked event the fact
that samsung claims that it will bring
the camera reimagined this is extremely
important because whenever you've dealt
with a phone like the Google pixel to
excel the camera is everything pretty
much the pixel has made every other
phone obsolete with their approach to
camera mainly through software not
through hardware but Samsung is not
doing that Samsung is actually providing
a new approach through Hardware variable
aperture in the lenses that will range
between F 1.5 and apparently F 2.2 or
2.4 it's been changing the more the
rumors get closer to the launch so
variable aperture what exactly is Samson
bringing here the company has already
launched the phone with this so there is
experience with it the problem is the
phone is exclusive to Asia right now so
we haven't really been able to give it a
try we cannot wait to see what this will
bring to the table there are cases where
we actually don't want all the aperture
you know all the sharp focus that we get
from devices like the Galaxy s8 for
example I remember the galaxy s6 at F
1.8 used to be great that sweet spot or
I could even take photos of
Crescent Moon in the sunset so I can't
wait to see this change but it leads me
to the question of this video let us
know down in the comments what do you
think this variable aperture would bring
to the table or do you think that there
will be more into what this camera will
do that will make this phone unique let
us know in the comments this video is
brought to you by the Vortech shadow
