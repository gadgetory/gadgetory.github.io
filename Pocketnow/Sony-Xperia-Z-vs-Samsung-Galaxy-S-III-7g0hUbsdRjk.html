pocketnow.com here are the sony event at
CES check out the Sony Xperia Z Brandon
minimum to service an awesome hands on
but now we're going to compare it
samsung galaxy s3 let's get to it
alright so just out from aspect
perspective over here on the new Xperia
we're looking at a 5-inch HD display at
1080p versus a more pointy games super
amoled we can't really tell you give you
meaningful regressions on on black
levels are colored but this is a very
very sharp display over there is in
might expect powered by a Qualcomm
escort pro backed up by two gigs of RAM
that's running a 1.5 gigahertz and our
AT&amp;amp;T galaxy s3 here is standing under
international one which is a fourth
powered by the excess quad-core at the
same speed camera 13 megapixel camera
with Exmor RS and HDR videos now Sony is
really really calling that out as a
definitive feature the LTS three packs
an 8 megapixel camera which has none of
them know HDR video really excellent
camera on the s3 but being edged out
spec wise we'll have to see how they
perform on the front a 2-megapixel
front-facing camera with 1080p capture
versus a 1.9 megapixel camera was the
same but 720p on the galaxy s3 cowering
all that 2,400 milliamp hour battery
with something called stamina sony has
software customizations that not only
allow you to save power by shutting down
the data connection but also lets you do
on certain elements like your corporate
email save or your Instagram or whatever
you want to run data the galaxy s3 has
power saving features but they are not
as specific residence first glance as
far as physical bill goes we're looking
at a less than a commuter difference in
thickness with seven point nine
millimeters on the New Mexico's vs eight
point six millimeters on the galaxy s3
Sony is calling this precision ended
here you can see here we've got straight
lines and right angles with a tempered
glass on the front and back versus to go
gs3 is familiar plastic finish that we
have to be a little bit ly for our taste
or some of us have at least also the
experience E is rocking a water
resistant and dust resistant bill
resistant inbuilt to IP standard 55 and
57 not so on the more fragile galaxy s3
a lot of improvements here and finally
we have the we have some nfc-based
customizations built into the new Xperia
Z that allow you to share media between
Xperia devices between two devices and
televisions and stereos etc and on
samsung of course we have a lot of
nfc-based features as well so we'll call
them when are drawn so we can learn a
little bit more about it just to give
you a little idea of an apple on
comparison here because some folks are
into that we know that one two three on
google maps and i'm not going to get a
fix inside here and we might be running
off a cast version of google maps there
so there's also no one of these right
that is a quick level of comparison
obviously we have a more detailed
comparison when we get more access to
the device so this is the samsung galaxy
s3
experienced ear and new here from CES in
