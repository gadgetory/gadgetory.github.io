distracting and your comments
distracting to I could never understand
what Highness says after you say you can
follow me on twitter at I may listen
again man you're gaining weight no your
eyes are seeing things a little wider
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hina be that this is pocket now and
this is the pocket now daily recap from
last week so on Monday I asked you if
you're happy with nokia's return to the
smartphone game there are conflicting
rumors regarding the fact that Nokia
probably does next year and probably
also includes VR headsets we have 157
comments out of which horrible whoop
says I think they're going to be a lot
more cheap Android phone from nokia am i
right and it depends nokia did a good
job with its pricing in the past the
thing is there also a premium company
but remember this is a different nokia
not the same hands of the vision that
they sold to microsoft large review says
nokia has always made great phones an
example would be the nokia n86 that had
a cross-ice camera the only problem was
the buggy OS nokia with android would be
amazing and yes it would be amazing the
no gizzy one tablet has performed great
so far but then again smartphones are a
different animal we'll see the Shogun
says but Nokia isn't really nokia now it
anymore is it their hands of the vision
still remains at Microsoft and yes
you're right this would be a different
company actually and part of the reports
claim that this would actually be a
photon thing where foxconn builds
everything and just straps the nokia
brand on it and it could be an exclusive
to China as well so it's hard for us to
predict what exactly are we getting but
this is not the previous nokia that we
knew on does it ask you what do you
think about LG using a professional
photographer to show was what the LG G
Force camera could do as that was the
teaser add that LG had published them
obviously it spurred some controversy we
have 500 1 comments out of which the fon
says they better tape a freaking DSLR to
the back of that g4 for all that hype
and yes the septum marketing can be an
issue ana shawn says it's all about
advertising we should not always
believed in a teaser like that how can a
phone's camera replace professional DSLR
lens and there's just no way that will
happen so I find good
bad that a professional photographer
would state things like this over a
video but then again you know that's the
price they charge I guess then jason
says the camera on for smartphone is a
very huge selling point too many persons
it's a good idea for LG to market the
phone's camera and yes let's market the
phone's camera and so far in our test of
the g4 it does an amazing job let's just
not say that it's as good as a DSLR
that's just not right or correct or even
possible yet on ones they ask you what
do you think about project Phi Google's
new MVNO service in conjunction with
Sprint t-mobile and a couple of Wi-Fi
stuff because that's the way it's gonna
work we have 620 comments out of which
dan the game says ah why our data
capsule thing and yes you're paying ten
dollars per gigabyte which is crazy we
thought that we were getting sort of
white with google fiber is you pay very
little money and get great service but
ten bucks for a gig even though not
necessarily expensive is not the google
that we expected how is this any
different different carriers yes there
are differences but republic Wireless
gives you some really good deals but
another commoner says project file would
be wonderful if they didn't use tmobile
so unreliable and yes I know a lot of
people that agree with that but then
again that depends on where you live and
that's the cool thing about project
vital move around between Sprint
t-mobile and Wi-Fi so you're not
necessarily stuck the t-mobile and me at
like I have says I don't like Google's
spy as it is $20 base plus ten dollars
per gigabyte that's not really great
republic Wireless wins this round and
yes thank you for bringing that up or
public wireless offers a great deal the
problem is it's not available everywhere
so it all depends on where you are on
Thursday I asked you what is your
favorite mapping and navigation service
as the news were that Apple Amazon and
Facebook we're interested in buying
Nokia here maps which is on sale we have
hundred fifty-eight common set of which
Critch H says I like Maps I have on my
car and true a lot of people do but then
again how do you navigate on a metro or
looking for a place while you're walking
that's the advantage of having it on
your phone that was the question and
Jonas says I use Google Maps the most
Microsoft should buy here maps and that
would be a good point if microsoft
acquired the mobile division from nokia
then why not buy here maps and offer the
service anything is better than whatever
Microsoft can offer so far and mazan
says here maps was best for me into
by on my lumia 920 but europe is still
Google Maps no doubt and yes indeed i've
used google apps from metro navigation
and it is just amazing the same case for
the United States but in my case Latin
America ways is the winner finally on
Friday I asked you why did you think
that the nexus 6 MX is nine had
underperformed as the news were that
Google's q1 results reflected that they
lost money only in that division we have
1052 comments thanks a lot guys out of
which joe bob says verizon because it's
damn big and yes not everybody wants a
phablet good point and then jay says
school could have put some effort into
making this setting screen useful
somehow but no not even enhanced for
built-in apps like the 6 plus or let
alone dual pane multitasking like the
mid series and that's my point if you're
gonna have a phablet I carry Galaxy Note
edge for example the reason why I have
it is because there is some added value
to having such a large display and that
is the real problem while I don't like
the Nexus 6 particularly it's a big
display but it's just the big display
and then tech 1 TV says if Nexus 6 was
for 499 the Google would be richer and
yes I think that was the biggest problem
the Nexus 6 is just too expensive for
what it is and there are so many great
options out there that give you more
things more you know options like
expandable storage and stuff like that
for a better price tag or the same price
tag so I think that Google wasn't really
being aggressive it's like the original
days of the Nexus which is sad that's it
for the pocket now daily recap thank you
