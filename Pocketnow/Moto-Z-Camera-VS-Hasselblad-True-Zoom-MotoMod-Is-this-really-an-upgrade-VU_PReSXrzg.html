the more exciting moto mod announcements
slapping the Hasselblad name on a
product brings very high expectations
for performance our resident
photographer Adam Lane wrote up an
in-depth look at what this system can do
but he failed to answer one key question
will investing $300 in the Hasselblad
true zoom improve on the photos and
videos produced from the camera built
into the Moto Z now for this comparison
we'll be using the better camera on the
Moto Z force and for you specs junkies
you can pause here to see how the tech
compares between the phone and the Moto
mod starting off with some outdoor shots
exposure seems more consistent from the
phone than from the true zoom the
Hasselblad was more prone to blowing out
highlights after focusing we also found
a little funkiness with saturation
clipping the shaded shot of a small
flower for example the phone captures a
lovely image where the Moto mod clips
the color yellow delivering very poor
output and sticking with close-up shots
both cameras feature very similar macro
focusing distances but the z4s has a
significantly wider aperture and
produces a prettier bouquet to depth of
field blur the zoom on the mod changes
the minimum focusing distance and at max
zoom it's well over a meter so
unfortunately that hardware won't get
you closer to your subject for a
close-up shot speaking of the zoom this
is an easy victory for the Moto mod a
telescoping lens handily beat software
cropping the image to get closer but
while you can use that zoom while
shooting video the Moto mod only pumps
out a mediocre 1080p where the z4s
outputs a fairly high quality UHD video
the Moto is also capable of shooting HDR
at 4k and Hasselblad removes that fun
feature entirely from the true zoom for
low-light shots the Hasselblad is just
no competition for the Z force sure the
sensor is a tiny bit bigger and the
pixel size substantially favors the mod
but the Z force aperture serves up a
significant victory in dim conditions
also it's odd to see such stark
differences in white balance where after
cranking the ISO Hasselblad routinely
delivered really orange-tinted photos at
night of course in conditions like these
you'd probably just throw your Flash and
the mod packs a proper xenon burst flash
which handily out powers the LEDs on the
moto this is a bit of a toss-up though
as the more powerful flash again has a
tendency to blow out highlights and
image processing is doing some odd
things with color saturation and white
balance so let's wrap this up where's
that leave us between the Moto Z force
camera and the Hasselblad true zoom moto
mod I was going to produce a fancy chart
but for real folks here's the breakdown
the Moto mod has a great zoom when used
in well-lit conditions and it has the
more powerful flash basically everything
else the Z Force camera will more
consistently produce better photos and
videos this is a very difficult
accessory to recommend when looking at a
$300 price tag and it's supremely
disappointing to see the Hasselblad name
applied to a product which could be
outperformed by point-and-shoot cameras
from several years ago we take no joy in
delivering a negative review but folks
who were hoping for a fantastic
partnership between a reputable phone
manufacturer and a top-tier photography
company should probably look elsewhere
for a more complete look at the true
zoom we'd highly recommend reading Adams
in-depth review on pocketnow.com which
is linked below this video as always
