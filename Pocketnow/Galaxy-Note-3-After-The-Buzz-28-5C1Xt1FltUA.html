new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's take a second
look at the latest in Samsung's line of
epic smartphone tablet hybrids I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow this is
the Galaxy Note 3 and this is episode 28
of after the buzz
we've come a long way from the first
galaxy note no longer just a
surprisingly successful side project the
note family now represents the very best
that Samsung's Android lineup has to
offer
in our full review back in October we
called the device the most capable most
powerful phablet on the market and the
note 3 went on to sell over 10 million
units in only two months whether that
winning streak will continue as the
device ages in 2014
depends on a variety of factors
beginning with hardware as you can see
our our AT&amp;amp;T provided note 3 hasn't
exactly led a coddled life and it bears
the scars to prove it while the look of
the revised styling and materials holds
up nicely
this fake metal is just that fake and it
shows even after a single drop on the
sidewalk as Jaime Rivera noted in his
durability report this is really soft
plastic and it dings quite easily on the
flip side though the faux leather back
cover has held up beautifully over time
at least on our black unit here a quick
Twitter survey showed mixed results with
the white cover with some folks
reporting some discoloration but others
saying no such thing and while it is
possible to scratch the Gorilla Glass 3
up front it's not particularly easy to
do so so overall we're looking at a
fairly typical story on the outside
while putting a case on such a mammoth
phone seems almost ludicrous you might
want to consider it because it's just as
fragile as most modern smartphones
thankfully the note 3's guts were built
to last in each of its incarnations your
region and personal preference govern
which processor hums along under the
hood but in either case you've got a lot
of power there power which should have
no trouble seeing you through a two-year
contract even if you wait until recently
to buy one that said you might want to
think about investing in a spare battery
the included power pack is big and it
impressed us in the initial review
period but over time the note threes
endurance hasn't exactly measured up to
the legacy of its forebears with beasts
like the G flex out there three hours of
screen on time per charge is no longer a
class-leading metric now just to be fair
we have been using almost
every feature of the note 3 during our
review period which included CES 2014
where the ability to swap our packs
saved our butts more than once
so if you're a real road warrior like us
pick up a spare battery or two so you
can stay juiced up even when using the
note 3 to its utmost speaking of power
users its you folks in part that Samsung
is targeting with the note threes
companions SmartWatch the polarizing
Galaxy gear and we've been using it
almost non-stop since ATT sent us one
shortly after its release while the gear
has since been updated to work with
other Samsung smartphones it's
particularly well suited to the note 3
that's because this is a phone big
enough that you don't always want to be
wrestling it from your pocket and with
its latest software update the gear
makes that less necessary being able to
read notification snippets on the watch
is quite handy and battery life
improvements mean you're not charging at
flight as often as you once had to is
the gear still overpriced and most
people would say so yes should you wait
for the second iteration if you want a
more polished product sure but even in
its current form it's a truly useful and
capable companion that adds more utility
to the note 3 experience than most
people give it credit for we saw some
really awesome new software come out of
Samsung at CES but for now that new tile
like interface is confined to its tablet
line our review Note 3 still runs
Samsung's older UI atop Android 4.3 and
well unlike a fine wine it doesn't get
better with age since the note 3
launched we've seen some really
lightweight really elegant enhancements
elsewhere in the Android world some of
it running beautifully on hardware
literally hundreds of dollars cheaper
than the note 3
now lightweight elegant and beautiful
are not words we designed to the note
3's software and compared to the modern
stuff it's starting to feel even more
clunky than before really an update
can't come soon enough
fortunately those negatives are
counterbalanced by the excellent S Pen
no matter how often you use it or don't
it's the best stylus in the business and
the industry-leading multitasking
ability which many manufacturers are now
aping on their own devices but Samsung's
approach is still far superior so
unbalanced that day-to-day experience is
probably best encapsulated by this
qualifier no but is it comfortable to
talk on the note 3 for extended periods
no but the phone call itself is clear
and both speaker modes are serviceable
is it easy to snap photos with a phone
as big as this no honestly it's a real
challenge to keep it steady even with
software stabilization but that 13
megapixel camera can capture some really
nice shots given the chance well you
have an easy time finding a 4k TV to do
justice to the phone's ultra high def
video no but the fact that you can even
shoot in 4k is pretty awesome
is it fun to use stock software elements
like the Samsung keyboard or the browser
no but the beauty of Android is you can
download almost any replacement you want
and the beauty of the note threes
hardware is that 19 times out of 20
it'll run it just fine
so after almost four months the story of
the note 3 continues to be one of XS
when it's not saying no but this is a
phone that's really built to say yes
it's a device for those who value
kitchen sink inclusiveness over refined
minimalism for Tim the tool man Taylor
types who want more power whatever the
cost
and in that respect it delivers if
you're one of those people with enough
money to invest in the note 3 and its
ecosystem you'll find a phablet more
capable than
there that's something we've said a lot
before and it doesn't look like that's
gonna change anytime soon don't forget
