also get a release date for iOS 5 and if
the iphone event just ended why are we
all disappointed all to send more coming
up right now hello everyone I'm hi enemy
better with pocketnow.com and welcome to
the special edition of the Li
review well we're going to talk about
all the things that were cool and what
was not so cool about apples October
fourth events and the iphone that just
got released let's start this off with
the cool finally after four months of
continuous rumors Apple releases a new
iphone to the public sadly there's stuff
to cover here that are cool and things
that are not so cool so we'll leave
those for later we have an iphone 4s so
don't get your hopes up because it's not
really an iphone 4 epaulettes kept the
iphone 4 design though they boosted the
specs dramatically first of all you get
apple's 85 dual-core chip that's
obviously twice as fast as the current
a4 chip and seven times better graphics
performance so that's interesting
because the ipad 2 will bring you nine
times better performance i wonder what
went wrong there it includes a new 8
megapixel camera which improves optics
and a lot of different things though it
will allow you 1080p video recording and
apparently it'll even use the gyro for
image stabilization whenever you're
shooting video really interesting it
also brings a one device for every
carrier design so the phone will
actually work on verizon sprint and AT&amp;amp;T
at the same time those friends coming
soon Sally t-mobile is not the carrier
that will bring the iphone 4s for some
reason most likely with the merger with
AT&amp;amp;T things will get solved there and
well as it stands the new lineup of
iphone 4 s's will bring you a white and
black design and it'll be available for
pre-order on october seven and then on
october fourteenth and stores though
we're not really sure people are
actually going to go crazy over a phone
that looks exactly like the previous
year's model and while you can get it in
16 gigabytes for 200 bucks you can
actually also get it in 32 gigabytes for
300 bucks and then it will cost you a
staggering 400 bucks after a two-year
contract for 64 gigabyte model sad news
on that pricing end well you can also
get the old iphone
for 8 gigabytes and you can also get it
in white and black 400 bucks on both
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T and hey if you still
want to get the cheap iphone 3gs it'll
be available for free don't only in
black and also when a gigabytes on AT&amp;amp;T
n yep you can also bet that'll cost you
two years of a kidney contract and
that's pretty much the new lineup of
iPhones I mean we were expecting
something a little better but we'll
leave that a little bit for later just
hit us up on comments to see if you'll
be in line on october fourteenth for
your apparent iphone 4s we also got an
official date for the release of iOS 5
the first gold master candidate was
released to developers after the events
on October fourth and we can expect the
official Iowa strive to be seeding to
your devices and to everybody as of
October twelfth and it will also include
iCloud now if you're interested in some
iTunes Match llovio sadly have to wait
until the end of October for the United
States though we still have no dates for
when it will be released to other
countries so we'll be waiting upon that
and we'll keep you posted whenever we
get news for other countries now even
though there wasn't one more thing after
the event the mix between a new and
enhanced version of iOS 5 and the iphone
4s is really what took the spotlight
Apple seems to finally be cashing in on
their purchase of Surrey and nuances
dragon dictation technology and the
integrated into iOS 5 though exclusively
for the iphone 4s note that this feature
will not be available to legacy devices
that are be rocking iOS 5 meaning the
iphone 4 and the iphone 3gs series being
sold as more than just voice control in
there actually keeping the name the
service uses artificial intelligence to
not only hear what you're saying but
also knowing what you mean the ass show
people asking their iphones to send text
messages to people or responding to
emails or actually even scheduling
appointments while they're on the go or
even tasks call this more than just
voice control on steroids I do see that
the only key feature for selling the
iphone 4s is actually Siri because it's
hide from that the internals are not
really compelling enough to sell the
iphone 4s in comparison to the aquaphor
it will initially be launched in beta
meaning it will only work in English
French and German
but we're hoping that we'll be rolling
out to other languages in the future
though we sadly don't have any specific
dates for that and before we get to the
not-so-cool section apple also released
two new applications they'll probably be
built in or bundled with your next
generation iOS release one was cards
which we actually liked it's like
hallmark on steroids because it has the
idea of allowing you to create special
cards within your iPhone and all you
have to do is actually submit the card
to Apple and they'll print it out and
actually send it to wherever you want
for price either in the United States or
internationally it was actually a really
cool service because all you have to do
is take pictures or actually build
everything within your iPhone and then
just ship it out it's actually seamless
and interesting and you can actually
also just pay with your iTunes account
really interesting another service
they've released the spine my friends
where he can actually choose to share
your location with friends and actually
also family though not really sure if
you're going to be liking people
stalking you or anything but you can
actually choose who's going to be
getting your information it can also
actually also choose at what times
they're going to be getting your
information or not kind of interesting
bill again this is actually going to be
free so a really a real no-brainer if
you want to give it a try and then think
about if you want to keep it or not
alright so that does it for the cool
let's continue on with the not so cool
this one's really a no-brainer first of
all there's no iPhone 5 everybody was
expecting the thinner design a different
device a larger screen 4G capabilities
everybody was expecting everything from
this next-generation iphone at what we
got was an iphone 4 on steroids kind of
really disappointing because first of
all we didn't get the iphone 5 no new
design people are crazy about the fact
that the 3.5 inch display is actually
dated make sure you read random minimums
recent editorial but how everybody's
disappointed with this release of the
iphone 4s and well aside from that Apple
didn't even release an unlocked version
of these of this iphone for us so first
of all you'll be stuck with either AT&amp;amp;T
sprint or verizon for starters and then
most probably Apple will make us wait
probably a year before we get an unlock
device if ever not really sure what to
make of it but sadly we are disappointed
because well I can actually be flashing
this iphone 4 and say hey I have an
iPhone for us people won't really be
able to tell the difference number two
in our complaints for the iphone 4s is
the fact that it doesn't bring either 4g
or hspa+ in this decade I mean
competition right now is already at
hspa+ some devices are at Elte obviously
they're not perfect some things could be
improved in battery life but sadly Apple
was actually boasting within the events
that currently even those hspa+ devices
are not offering their full potential
that they're only offering 14 megabits
per second and download speeds and
apparently there's this new technology
in antenna design hopefully not antenna
gate that will provide those same hspa+
technology download speeds of 40 minutes
per second on the current generation
iphone for us sadly these also competing
devices are already capable of hspa+
even if the networks eventually bring
the speed those devices are going to be
capable in the iphone 4s is not going to
be capable so sad news on speeds and 4G
LTE not sure what to make of that yet
that does it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high memory
better remember to leave your comments
down below what you thought of the
events and also don't forget to give us
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
