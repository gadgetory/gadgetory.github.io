was recorded with very few issues
despite hi me being in Honduras where he
usually has some Wi-Fi issues and me
being in Manila Philippines where the
Internet can be quite spotty but we
triumph over those issues to bring you a
show that luckily got delayed by one
very eventful day and I say that because
in that one day yep we got the Google
leak Google just went ahead and became
leakers of their own products the
much-anticipated pixel for with their
version of the square or to some people
the stove camera design the pixel team
seems to be applying their impressive
algorithmic processing to more than one
camera now it's exciting all of this
news comes after we discuss a few
further developments on the us-china
trade war and also hallways cancellation
of the upcoming made book which made us
all a little bit sad and then some news
from e3 including the advent of game
streaming by way of Google stadia

pocket now hello everybody and welcome
to the weekly brought to you by Pacquiao
and xda-developers recorded on June 14
2019 with our hosts coming from various
locations around the world I'm on a
vacation of sorts but I am committed to
bringing you the podcast even from
abroad so this week joining us are Jaime
de vera and TK BAE
YouTube audience you're watching the
highlight reel at the moment but you can
get the full discussion by listening to
the podcast in your favorite podcasting
app thank you so much for tuning in all
right I know that everyone has heard so
much about the hallway stuff over the
last number of weeks and the story just
keeps building and building huawei lost
the licenses with Microsoft and Intel
this is actually hurting an actual
device line that we all seem to really
enjoy so I wanted to know what your guys
thoughts would be on this just real
quick I'm gonna cry where would you get
in our alternative that's close to the
mate book X Pro if it wasn't for the
nose cam like which is
one of the main reasons why we got this
logitech Brio just for the podcast and
everything but it was mainly because
using that computer for podcasting was
impossible but but other than that just
give me another device that competes
there is none really there isn't the
market itself benefited from having that
form factor in the thinness I mean when
they first came out with it I was like
wow they can top it off and then they
came up with like the other series right
we have to make poor third matrix not
that just to the pro 13 then there's the
forum in like 14 it goes in it we're a
little bit more of experiments the pro
really was where it was at and I think
even with the updated one the way josh
has it set up with the external GPU it's
literally like a full-fledged system
that you go home you render you do
everything you want to do you guys
mentioned competition especially in
terms of Huawei and I'm actually really
excited to hear from TK from the XDA
side of things about the idea that while
we might be creating their own app store
or they already have their own app store
but they're gonna go all in on it now oh
yeah yeah you know there's a big
difference but the way development works
in Android in the way it works with iOS
iOS you develop for iOS it's easier
people want to work with it and Android
has a big fragmentation issue we already
have that just to start with just having
multiple devices there they're working
it don't get me wrong when when they
have to focus on exactly what they want
they're doing it correctly I just think
it's kind of funny how we came from
there was an era where people would see
that label made in China and have a
certain feeling about the product maybe
they did they thought that the quality
of the product would be subpar and
whatnot but the likes of Oppo Huawei
Xiaomi have actually really fought
against that stereotype now there's a
whole new stereotype that if you have a
product that hits says made for made in
China there's a whole new implication
involved here but with that in mind
Foxconn and Google have moved their
Hardware production away from China
whether both companies got both
countries negotiate or not it's still
gonna happen they're still gonna move
they're part of their production to
India they already move the 6s
production to India that's already done
I mean Foxconn is a Taiwanese company
because at the end they realized that
you know the tariffs will impact the
consumer because who pays for everything
at the end it all gets you know put down
to the customer so my hope is that they
end up you know negotiate
something soon enough that they can at
least work out the details so that it
doesn't end up being as an entire move
more of you know getting more locations
for production in any case did you watch
any of the news anything exciting really
pop out at you from e3 I hate that we
didn't get more information on the new
PS 5 but that's less of a focus it seems
because instead of having a very
powerful console you could have maybe a
laptop like this or even a low powered
low-cost device that just uses your fast
internet connection to stream all of the
Triple A games obviously one has an
internet connection which one and a lot
of commenters were concerned over the
fact that you are going to pay the same
amount of money for a game on stadia
that you would on a Nintendo switch with
the difference that what happens if
you're on a plane like me can you play
your game can you download your game
temporarily like you can on Spotify I
just can't wait for the Dragon Ball game
to come out I just I saw that there was
enough it's like I sorry it just you
know it's just me Kakarot always that DK
is a TK is a simple man he sees Dragon
Ball Z it's like you guys
it's like pre-order please send me
notifications now thank you very much
from the news two episodes of black
mirror stories about cybercrime are all

your personal devices like your webcam
or your voice assistant spilling your
secrets hackable looks to answer those
questions and more each episode found on

using and in season 4 you can see if
these show friendly hackers can crack
smartphones printers even smart kettles

essentials that power your life also
leave your personal data vulnerable and
then learn how to protect yourself from
letting your love of devices put you at
risk listen and subscribe to hackable
today on all major podcast platforms
including Apple and stitcher and I can't
believe that I'm saying this but for the
first time I don't think I remember any
time that a company has actually gotten
ahead of the leaks and have gone ahead
and just released information about a
product that we're all clamoring for by
themselves that's exactly what Google
exactly that's including crap
they own that so well yesterday I was
like whoa what's up with these guys ya
know man finally I mean with with
everything that when the way it went
with the pixel 3xl launch event and all
of the things and everything that was
going around going up to that having
them post that picture yesterday was
like it's like come on welcome to the
game this is what they need to do to get
the buzz I like I don't blame them they
need to get the buzz out right because
their product is not necessarily it's
okay fine the pixel three is wasn't
great phone but it's you know it's got
some great things so I I commend them
for being aggressive about marketing
finally my hope essentially is that did
now that they're no longer a Verizon
exclusive with the three a that maybe
that could carry over with the three
that with the four in the four Excel you
just got a pixel three a Google all of a
sudden gets put onto like the local news
or on the airwaves or on the tweets so
with this leaked of the pixel for do you
end up feeling that phone Envy because
it's no because Peaks been so little
time since the three yes but peak people
that bought the three a are not in the
market for the for exactly just the way
it is know exactly if you bought the
three a and the three a appeal to for
anything regardless obviously and camera
was one thing but you wouldn't
necessarily be like oh I got to spend a
thousand dollars for the upgraded
version it you're happy with it and you
and I'm pretty sure you'll be glad to
have to wait if you want to upgrade
again for you know the for a the before
a excel whatever the end the next
iteration of that that devices it's a
great device it's really priced at the
right point and honestly my only
limitation for that was honestly two
storage options I wish we had something
a little bit more but that was that all
I've really seen that we know is
confirmed from Google is that one suite
that they put out with the back with
that stove camera but there's only two
cameras in there right yeah yeah I
didn't see there was I didn't see a quad
or a triple I saw a double so interested
to see what the secondary lenses its if
it's if it's because I don't they don't
need the secondary lens for depth right
this isn't something that they needed if
anything it may be just an introduction
of a new wide-angle lens which a lot of
us would love to have on the device
maybe I'm just arguing semantics here
but it's one thing for someone who's not
privy to the information to leak that
information but when a company
quote-unquote leaks the information
isn't I call the teaser isn't that call
that
trailer isn't it I think it is I think
it would yeah this is a definitely a
three second teaser for what's to come
we need the trailer yeah so as far as
leaks are concerned like does it does it
does it color your experience with all
of these things because not that Google
is actually being the company that is
going to leak things ahead of everybody
else aren't they sort of adding to this
little phenomenon that some of us tech
reviewers have where we see leaks in
speculation so much that eventually we
get to the launch and we're not
surprised by anything anymore Google's
feeding into that culture now no
generally leaks if anything like you
said it keeps them in them in the news
it keeps them fresh and it keeps people
thinking about them and it keeps us you
know excited about what's to come
otherwise it'll be like the you know we
show up every once in a while like he
says think about it yeah if your Apple
if your Apple and your launch timeline
is the fall and you're the galaxy the
newest galaxy is going to be launched
early that year leaks are gonna be very
convenient for Apple and on that note
