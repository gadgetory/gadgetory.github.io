calling its 2015 lineup and judging by
the looks of the s6 and the s6 edge
materials used an overall feel we can
now truly understand the meaning of
project zero I'm Anton denied and this
is our show for comparison of the galaxy
s6 versus the galaxy s6 edge sure the
company has kept its main design
principles but the new phones announced
today bring a breath of fresh air into
samsung's portfolio the quote new
standard for design craftsmanship and
performance truly shows regardless if
you're looking at the official images or
holding the phones in your hands like we
did gone are the days of plastic for the
galaxy s6 and if we're allowed to say it
we'll say it finally both of these
phones are built entirely out of metal
and glass whether they're prettier than
last year's models is up to you but we
definitely like the direction Samsung's
heading in once you get past the initial
pleasant surprise of the good looks for
these two phones you'll bust out your
chamois to wipe off the extreme insane
amounts of fingerprints collected
regardless of the color option you'll
get used to them eventually from our
short time with the galaxy s6 and the
six edge we can tell you that they not
only look but they also feel premium as
well solid build good ergonomics great
enhance feel overall however the Galaxy
s6 is more awkward to hold than the s6
edge that's not a real surprise because
of the double curved screen which tapers
towards the edges for us personally the
s6 was more comfortable to hold but then
again if you want to be cool among your
friends the s6 edge will turn you into
that in terms of size and weight these
two are very much alike give or take a
millimeter or even less they're pretty
much the same and strangely the s6
weighed six grams more than its edge
sibling at 138 grams they're also both
incredibly thin at six point eight and
seven millimeters for the edge
respectively
Samsung also emphasized the durability
for both models but we wouldn't advise
you to drop a metal
and glass phone oh by the way Gorilla
Glass 4 we've already seen some
scratches on demo units if you want to
know more about each of these two
devices individual he likes pecs and
first impressions check out our separate
hands-on videos will focus on
similarities and differences here and
the similarities far outweigh the
differences screen size resolution PPI
rating processor RAM storage cameras and
even battery give or take 15 million
powers are all the same shared specs
across two devices that's also the case
for most part of the software however
the main difference which is also the
main selling point and probably the
reason you'll spend more cash on the s6
edge is the double edge display or yet
to comprehend or imagine the use for
going with the design but we're also yet
to spend decent amount of time with the
edge the edges are able to display
specific information tailored for the
curved part of the screen like
customizable favorites standard thicker
content notifications time date alarms
and so on the rest of the OS as well as
content just flows over the edges which
is something you'll either find super
cool or annoying if you're coming from
an old edge or like its implementation
chances are you prefer the s6 edge over
the s6 we'll have to spend a lot more
time with both of these devices to
properly assess and test them and form a
solid opinion for now we can tell you
that we're glad to see Samsung improving
in every aspect and not only raising the
bar in specs but actually managing to
beat both its own and some of its
competitors standards in terms of design
build and materials that's going to do
it for a short comparison from the show
floor if you like this video please give
