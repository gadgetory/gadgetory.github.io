pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna take a look at the unique and
interesting features of the Toshiba g9
10 so just this screen on the front and
the fingerprint reader on the side and
some other things that are pretty
interesting
now the screen on the front is an OLED
display so it's very bright it's only
monochrome the resolution is 96 by 39 so
you don't get that much data on the
front but it does show you some
interesting things to start I'm going to
call my phone from my landline here and
you'll see what it looks like when a
call comes through on the front screen
many people think that the front of this
device is ugly and yes I agree that it
is quite ugly it looks like a device
from 1992 or something so let's let's
see what happens I'm calling my phone
right now okay and you see what it does
is it Charles forth the caller ID from
your phone book and the suit associates
the phone number to the name and says my
line cuz I'm calling from a landline and
to ignore the call you press the red and
to answer it you press the green and
from here you'd put it up to your face
and use the speaker here in the
microphone there to take the call okay
now let me go through what you can do
with this external display if we press
the button to the left we can scroll
through our contacts and dial a contact
from the front screen here and it's
showing me that I have a new message
right now so I'm gonna try to get that
away this isn't very useful because I
have about 500 contacts and it would
take me a really long time to find the
one that I want here but if you have a
few contacts that's helpful pressing to
the right will go through your missed
call notifications it'll show you your
next calendar appointment which is
useful we can see if we have an unread
Outlook email we can change the profile
which is cool so we can press the up or
down button to rotate between silent and
normal and vibrate and then we press the
center button to set that if we go over
to the right one more time that goes
back to the time something else you can
do is actually dial from this screen
though it's it's not it's not too quick
of a dialing action if we press the
green call button we get a dial pad and
so I can kind of move the cursor around
the screen and type out a number
although I don't know why I would just
why I wouldn't just open up the phone
folder
call that way because this is gonna take
too long so that's pretty much the the
functionality the of the external screen
it's kind of useful I wish you could see
more information on it it's a very small
screen but I like the I like the fact
that you don't have to open the folder
to answer a call when it comes in
that saves a battery life and certainly
is quite convenient too so let's open
the folder and talk about some more
features when you open the folder the
screen immediately turns on which is
good and it opens to reveal this
excellent keyboard this is actually one
of the best keyboards I've ever used
because it's so large and it just feels
great it's it's basically the same as
the keyboard on the 18 t tilt but every
button is about 20 to 30% bigger so
that's really great the stylus is placed
in a in a very convenient location often
to the right like here and the reason
that the stylus is so long is because
they figure you're gonna hold the device
in your left hand and you're going to be
reaching quite far with the stylus so
you need that extra length let's go into
the Settings menu and take a look at
something I'm going to show you this
device has a fingerprint scanner on the
side here which doesn't offer too much
utility let me show you what you can do
with it so I'm gonna click on the
fingerprint whoops went into the wrong
thing there let me just zoom in on the
screen a little bit so you can see what
I'm doing
I'm gonna click on the fingerprint
utility and this is where we register a
finger so I'm going to register my right
first finger so I'm going to click on
that and what it requires me to do is
I'm gonna try to tilt this so you can
see the whole thing scan my finger three
times so one it says quality's too low I
got to go slower swipe successful swipe
successful and enrollment successful
okay great so that means that my right
index finger is enrolled and then I can
use it to do certain things like launch
programs that's pretty much it there's
no security software built into this so
you can't unlock the device with a swipe
of your finger I'll show you the the
utility in a second and you can also set
your this this biometric pad to scroll
on lists which is
of useful but it doesn't work too well
let me show you if I go into context and
I kind of swipe my finger downward it
scrolls you see that but it's not too
fast it's very precise because you can't
move very quickly and they'll do dialing
something but that's one of the features
of the biometrics pad and let me go into
the program that will allow you to
associate a a program action to a swipe
of the finger so if I go to so as you
can see here if I swipe my left foot um
it will open the calculator program and
if I select the right first finger I can
have it launched let's say Windows Media
Player and I'ma click done done ok main
main battery low gotta charge my battery
but let me show you what that will do
now so if I go and I swipe my right
index finger
guess I didn't get a good swipe there
okay so I've discovered something in
order to launch a program with your
finger get ready for this you actually
have to launch the program and put it in
the foreground so now that if I if I
swipe my index finger
Windows Media Player opens yeah
extremely silly I will never use this
feature why would why should I have to
launch a program to launch a program I
just don't see the use of that so
perhaps you can find some third-party
security software that will utilize this
biometric security pad but out of the
box it static it's very poor support for
any sort of interesting functionality
for that ok so let's move on in the
first video I tried to figure out these
shortcut buttons that are that run along
the side of the device so we have one
for messaging looks like internet
calendar and there are some others here
- such as media player and I couldn't
get them to operate by just pressing
them here well it turns out you have to
press on the dot so if I press on the
dot Windows Media Player launches and of
course if I click on the dot on the
checklist I get tasks it's firmer press
and here's tasks now fortunately all of
these buttons can be customized so if we
go into Start and settings we go into
but buttons they act just like hardware
buttons on any Windows mobile device so
we can go down and we see a right button
one right button - and they have a
little icon and of course you can click
on it and just change the assignment of
that button so that that's useful
because this device really doesn't have
that many hardware buttons on the
keyboard you have camera and and that's
really it so having these shortcut
buttons are quite helpful on the screen
there now something I want you to notice
is that this device is pretty slow
unfortunately I think it's because the
screen has so many pixels did you just
see that the icons took about a second
to load unlike a device like the eye
main ultimate 95o - where everything is
just right there let's go into file
explorer there's a delay with everything
that you do and it gets a little
exhausting to use I have to be honest
about that ok so what I want to do now
is continue the tour of the hardware I'm
going to zoom out a little bit
replace the stylus on the side here we
have a video camera for making video
calls we can't do that in the US
certainly we have the keyboard of course
with a light sensor that will adjust the
brightness of the screen if you want and
turn on the the backlight on the
keyboard when it gets dark to the right
of that we have a soft reset hole very
conveniently placed right in the
keyboard I've actually found myself to
have to soft reset this many times there
were times when I would close the phone
and open it and the screen wouldn't turn
on or it would turn on after about three
minutes that's peculiar so let's go
around the device on the bottom we have
a mini USB port that is covered by a by
a piece of plastic here we have a
lanyard loop here of course the
fingerprint scanner a button to adjust
volume up and down to the right of that
is a dedicated headphone port but it
uses this weird-lookin proprietary jack
it doesn't look like micro USB or
anything like that this device does come
with a converter jack that will convert
this to standard headphones so at least
that's good
on the top we have the slot for the
micro SD card externally place that's
good news okay and to the right of that
is the button to power on and off the
device and of course this micro SD slot
cover takes a minute to get back on and
of course there's the hinge it there is
some spring assist so if I close it a
little bit it will snap shut and again I
really like that sound that it makes
when you close it let's flip over to the
back we have a 2 megapixel camera with
autofocus and it also has an LED fill to
fill light which is always a welcomed
addition here's a speaker external
speaker for speakerphone and and that
sort of thing and finally to wrap up I
just want to give you an idea of the
programs that come installed on the g9
10 see if there's anything unique or
interesting of course we're going to
cover this in depth in the review which
is coming up soon on pocketnow.com so
i'm gonna start by going into the Start
menu and I find that the stiffness of
the hinge is good enough to where I can
press on the screen pretty hard and it
doesn't move so that's good so let's see
what we have here this looks pretty much
standard we have Java applications what
we have here is image to text which is a
little bit of OCR that uses the camera
to convert text that you take a picture
of so in a newspaper or a magazine
business card and it'll convert it into
text on the screen which is pretty neat
we'll cover that more later we have live
search which I installed opera browser
is this opera 9.5 no it's not it's opera
eight-point I think it's eight point six
five let me take a look at that again
you can't see that because it's really
tiny but it is eight point six five it's
the old version of opera which still
does a pretty good job in rendering
webpages but it's nothing close to opera
nine point five and that's pretty much
it I'm gonna go into the settings menu
real quick and let's see everything's
pretty much standard we have the the
fingerprint reader we have video call
settings I can't touch those because
we're in the u.s. I'm going into system
we have master clear which will reset
everything back to the way it was before
going down the list everything is pretty
much standard here let's see how we're
doing on memory right now I know if you
a few programs open we've got 35
megabytes three okay that's that's
decent running programs we have a lot of
running programs right now so that makes
sense the world we don't have that much
program memory running there are left
and over in connections nothing's really
unique Wireless manager hasn't been
skinned it's the standard Windows Mobile
6 Wireless manager which is pretty ugly
but that's ok we don't need a fancy
Wireless manager and that'll do it for
this video again we're gonna have a full
review coming up and we're going to
cover every aspect of this device and
run benchmarks on it you can see that at
pocketnow.com soon that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
