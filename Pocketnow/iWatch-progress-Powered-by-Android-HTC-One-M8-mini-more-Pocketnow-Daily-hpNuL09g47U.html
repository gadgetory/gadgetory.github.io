watch experts for its i watch rumors
have already begun to point that an HTC
One m8 mini exists and reports haven't
that Google is making requirements for
phones to say powered by Android I'm hi
Mary vana and does this mean that I need
a sign that says powered by Miller Lite
this is pocket out daily let's actually
off with some official news if we could
even call them official as AT&amp;amp;T has
continued teasing the fact that they
will be selling the issues padfone x and
this is a great option i mean there are
great specifications it's a great idea
for them to finally bring a pat phone to
the united states look to those computer
for full details on what you're getting
on this tablet but the biggest problem
is that number one we don't have a price
tag in number two we don't even know
when they're gonna sell it they don't
provide any details so we're trying to
get exactly what you're trying to
compete against now let's talk about
nokia and do me a favor hit the link in
the description with this no get eggs
add because i can try to describe it but
you really have to watch the ad the
company is trying to downplay all the
rumors and the concerns of people saying
that even the nokia X runs android it
won't really have all the applications
and the ad brings everybody to ease it
shows almost every single application
that's available that actually matters
in the most hilarious way possible to
the point that I can't stop laughing by
watching the ads so I kept making the
description and tell us what you think
even though I don't think many people
really want to buy that nokia X
regardless of the apps I'll talk about
HTC is I know a lot of you are either
very happy or extremely disappointed
with the One m8 I'm on the list of
people that are mixed but if you wanted
a smaller variant them hopefully the
same phone apparently there will be an
HTC One m8 many horrible name but the
Swedish carrier is teasing that we do
have this phone coming in the future we
don't know exactly when or exactly how
downplayed it's going to be compared to
the One m8 that's even possible but
we'll keep you posted I also about
Google is we've got two very interesting
rumors first of all the company is
apparently already finalizing their work
on Android 4.4 point 3 which is great
though the updates your kind of minor
and obviously these are not necessarily
as significant as you'd expect but even
more interesting is that
there is documentation that states that
google is planning to force OEMs to use
a powered by android logo on the phone
that they're going to be building that
doesn't apply to the amazon kindle or to
the nokia X because these don't really
use Google services but these OEMs that
want to use google play and will
services will have to have this logo
interesting I thought it was open source
and finally for the very interesting
news of the day we've got apple
reportedly trying to hire Swiss
watchmaker experts to be part of their i
watch project and apparently nobody got
the job meaning nobody was really
interested or turn it down apparently
we've got one of these companies HR
departments mentioning that Apple was
trying to do this that that all the
employees turned it down we don't really
understand exactly why because hey Apple
is probably one of the most powerful
companies in the world and still seems
that they turn it down but anyways we
don't really know how this is going to
affect the production of the iWatch
which we're expecting this here but
don't you see the question of the day
how do you think Apple should
differentiate be i watch given the fact
that you see the Moto 360 and that thing
is gorgeous in my particular case I
would think that the smartest thing is
to hire watch experts definitely but
looks are not everything very important
but not everything leave us a comment
down below what do you think friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is Phil

comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
