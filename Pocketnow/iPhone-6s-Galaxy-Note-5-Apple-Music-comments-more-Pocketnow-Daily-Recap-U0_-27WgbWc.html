should I be scared I mean you should
narrate the next world cup alongside
better with mothers and is that because
of how fast i talked waiting for sunday
bear huh that's right it's that time of
the week I am Hine every bit of this is
pocket now and this is the pocket now
daily recap for last week so on Monday
asked you if iOS 9 would make you want
to buy an ipad as of the news are that
iOS 9 brings multi-window support on new
iPads obviously we have 1057 comments
thanks a lot guys out of which shane
says i already have an ipad mini 2 apple
should let split-screen run on a 7th
iPads and up and you get the point
they're trying to make you buy another
ipad then radu says can't the surface
tablet from microsoft do that as well
cuz that looks like a lot like windows
to me and yes but the problem is that
given the fact that Windows has been
able to do this forever and it hasn't
really taken off after windows 8 I don't
know if that's gonna be enough for iPads
either and vices so happy with the
multitasking for ipad although really
frustrated at the same time I really
want split screen view to work on my
ipad mini 2 surely it's powerful enough
i guess this is their way of tempting
you to buy a newer ipad the ipad mini 2
with Retina actually has a less ram they
can use that as an argument but I feel
that it's not the problem i feel this is
just apples with making you buy
something yes ipad air one here sadly
until they ask you if you would ditch
spotify over apple music as we've got
information on restrictions and it
pretty much looks like Spotify in every
way we have 663 comments out of which
Evan says I wanted Spotify I love it and
it's a pain to move playlist and you've
got a really good point there Spotify is
just so cool and so cross platform that
it would be so difficult to leave it I
agree then g3 says everyone is saying
that they'll never did Spotify but I bet
in less than a year Apple music will
have more paid subscribers and Spotify I
will switch and well Spotify has a
little bit of a learning curve and
that's the advantage that Apple has with
Apple music but we'll see you have a
point there but we'll see robson
never I love Spotify it's free unlike
Apple music and I can get the music I
want where I want and what I want PS I'm
an Android user yes as an Android user
you would have that struggle with Apple
music but I don't think that's going to
last long on ones they ask you how
important our selfie photos to you as
the rumors are that the iphone 6s will
bring some sort of a better selfie
camera we have 374 comments out of which
mr. popo says selfies RS and well of
your name is mr. popo or poo poo I'll
take that literally general says
panorama for front-facing camera so
people will start putting their faces on
all angles huh uh yeah I know it sounds
ridiculous but if you don't have a wide
angle lens on that camera the panorama
is not really a bad idea then bc Bell
says selfies are an obnoxious fad that
needs to end it soon and I doubt it will
but i agree with you for me i don't know
i'm not a big fan but i know a ton of
people that are on thursday ask you what
do you want on the galaxy note 5 as
we've got some rumors on its
specification zand we have 780 comments
out of which elaine says 12 core 4
gigahertz CPU 60 gigs of ram one
terabyte of storage 50 megapixel camera
one millimeter thick and dude you are in
the wrong decade ranger says galaxy note
5 should have expandable storage and
should be able to do the google play
edition please i would buy it if it had
those two options and it would be cool
for us to have a google play edition or
at least to have an android skin a stock
android skin that would be amazing
because that's the only way that the
note would work and then Rashawn says
keep the external storage removal
battery but increase battery capacity
and trim down the OS i think that that
is the desire of everybody I love the
Galaxy Note edge because of its
functionality I hate it because the OS
just sucks it is really bad and I feel
that Samsung should really trim it down
somehow but we'll see and finally on
Friday I asked you if you wanted a cutie
keyboard on Android as the rumors are
this blackberry and Samsung on working
on something like this we have 654
comments out of which matt says Samsung
is making a huge mistake if they
actually
least this and you forget that you're
talking about Samsung that company that
came up with the galaxy round in
addition to other gimmicks master Simon
Says what if google acquired blackberry
I wonder how would that turn out it
would be a good idea i just don't see
blackberry doing it a lot of companies
have wanted to buy it and it is just
resilient enough to not want to sell and
Joel Cook says I would probably buy a
blackberry running Android with accurate
II keyboard and I would probably do the
same I was a big fan of BlackBerry's not
necessarily because of the OS it was
really snappy at some point but also
because of the fact that hey the build
quality was great the design was great
and I feel that uh I don't know
blackberry would really benefit on
Android but we'll see that's it for the
pocket out daily we kept thank you very
much for watching a couple of steps of
you why your comments to be featured

stick to the point number three time I
