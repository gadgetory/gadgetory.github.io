what's going on everybody now we're
going to be doing a video today that I
think a lot of you have been waiting for
we're going to talk about the kinds of
daily apps we use and the daily drivers
we use them on now in my case I use the
pixel 3a this is definitely a palate
cleanser of a phone I mean us tech
reviewers we review so many of these
smart phones that sometimes it's nice to
come back to something a little bit
simple generally I hold two phones on me
at all times and the pixel 3a is one of
them while the other device is the
device that I'm reviewing currently but
let's go ahead and jump into it to be
honest when you're using so many phones
on a regular basis you know exactly what
applications you need what kind of
customizations you make and honestly you
don't want to fuss too hard that's the
reason why I don't really put any
third-party launchers on my phones this
is just the pixel launcher after all
this is the pixel 3a so it's pretty easy
to just leave this launcher on and be
happy with it and I do have this
background here that if I double tap on
the background it'll light up to
actually show my logo but I haven't
dimmed out so it's a little bit more
subtle this is via an app called mousse
a I don't even know if I'm pronouncing
that right but Musee is a wallpaper app
that creates a live wallpaper based upon
either a feed of photos or a photo of
your choosing in my case it's obviously
my logo and what I did is I just dimmed
out the brightness of the actual
wallpaper put a little bit of a blur on
there that way it blends in a lot better
mousse a is a very popular wallpaper
application you probably have heard
about it but if you haven't there are
links into the Play Store in the
description below now as you can see my
setup here I just have the folders here
on the bottom and that's how I
categorize everything the first area is
for communications then I have tools
here obviously as a youtuber I have
these two YouTube apps and then social
media and finally one of the most
important parts the imaging now the
applications that I use in the imaging
folder are basically tools for the
different cameras that I use the
Panasonic image app is actually what I
use in order to ensure that I have good
focus on you it gives me a remote
control any second monitor using the
smartphone and I can hit record using
the smartphone if I wanted to you know
it's funny I'm going through my ab
drawer right now I do actually have a
lot of applications I actually have
duplicates in the way I have a couple of
meditation applications one of them I'll
talk about later I obviously have
redundant
applications like the moment camera on
top of the regular camera so that's what
you kind of call app hoarding so there's
not a whole lot of minimalism here
because there are applications here that
I literally use for one specific purpose
but in this video I'm going to talk
about the types of apps that I use more
often definitely more of a daily app
experience this is the game that I'm
playing right now I actually really
enjoy this the first act is free in grim
valor and if you pay $7 you get all 5x I
think it's 5 maybe it's 6 it's super-fun
it works really well even on the pixel
3a and honestly I don't see any
performance losses on here everything
looks really nice and it's a very fluid
gaming experience nice dodge I think
you're going to see something a little
more out of the ordinary and once I jump
into the tools folder there are a few
things here that are obvious Google Maps
is one of them but then you have Google
5 I do use this phone with Google 5 and
the fact that it does an e sim with the
fine network is really useful especially
when I'm abroad now the ECM is really
important because if I'm abroad and I
don't have a sim tool I always have this
phone on me that way I can activate the
Eason and be able to use Google 5 no
matter where I am Amazon Kindle now
there's a good reason for this I'm sure
we've all done the same thing where we
thought we were going to be reading
books on a long flight or even a road
trip only to end up watching stuff on
our phones or watching all of the movies
in the entertainment center well because
of that and I'm guilty of it so much
bringing my Amazon Kindle on long trips
has become less of a priority but
sometimes if I do find myself wanting to
read something I have kids all in the
smartphones but one thing I do like to
do is turn on the nightlight that way
this screen limits a little bit of the
blue light gets a little bit in that
direction of a comfortable Kindle
reading experience and then it's easier
for me to just read to my heart's
content and then finally here the
insight timer now this is a meditation
timer I remember back in the day I used
to use this app before those guided
meditations were available for free it
used to just be a timer like literally
you could even turn on the timer in
Android said 15 minutes and you're good
to go but a timer like this was nice
because it was more soothing it had some
soothing background noises and those
are really nice to be able to come out
of your meditation or at least to know
how far you've gone there are free
meditations inside of here so if you'd
want to know what you're getting into
you can actually do these guided
meditations and honestly most of them
are less than 15 minutes so if you just
want to take a little bit of time for
yourself and actually let your mind
wander or even clear out your mind a
little bit this is a great place to do
it and then I mentioned AB hoarding
earlier there's actually one application
that I can kind of get rid of here HBO
now do you guys know why right most of
you probably saw that Game of Thrones
finale and now the final application
obviously the sponsor of this video is
the brave browser I can head over to the
home pages and it already shows me how
many ads were blocked trackers during my
browsing but what I really wanted to
show off is right up here these are the
brave rewards now I don't have any right
now and the reason why is because I
haven't actually watched any ads that
give me these be 80 tokens or bat tokens
this is cryptocurrency that has awarded
to you when you watch particular ads and
that ad revenue actually kind of goes to
you and this is super interesting
because there are so many websites out
there that have a lot of ads just
sprawled across their page and brave
automatically blocks all of that so you
have a seamless internet viewing
experience at least with brave rewards
it'll give you a notification or it will
actually ask you to watch certain ads
which will then award you some of these
bad tokens and then you just put that
back into the system towards the
websites that you actually want to
support but aside from that it's
basically chrome like there's really
nothing
that's different about it for the most
part other than this rewards apparatus
and the fact that it shows you all of
the different ads and trackers that has
blocked over time and so there you have
it those are the apps that I use
basically on the daily at least the more
unique ones I obviously didn't want to
get into anything that showed my
personal information off or even social
media networks that you know I'm
probably on like Instagram and Twitter
now there's a little bit of
customization involved here a little bit
of specific personal daily applications
and of course that brave browser I want
to give a quick thanks to the brave
browser for sponsoring this video and
yes I do actually use their browser
especially on desktop but it's no harm
done actually putting it on a
for those few times you get into a
browser when surfing the internet in any
case we're gonna go ahead and call it on
this one thank you so much for watching
