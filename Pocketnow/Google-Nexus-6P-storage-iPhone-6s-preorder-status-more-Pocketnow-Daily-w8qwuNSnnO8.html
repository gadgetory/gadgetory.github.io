reportedly peck a lot of storage Apple
already runs out of online stock for the
iphone 6s and iPhone 6s plus and the new
LG class ends up being a class
disappointment I'm hi Mary vetta and I
apologize for all the noise there is a
major thunderstorm but we're back at the
studio this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with LG as we
were expecting a super premium phone to
be announced and what we thought that
was going to be the LG class it turns
out the device was just announced in
Korea with a lesser of the mid-range
specs on a metal chassis we've got other
trusted sources claiming that the LG v10
is still going to be a reality but
apparently that will be the super
premium phone so let's wait other
official news are about the iphone as
those of you wanting or still
considering the iphone 6s and 6s plus
seems that online will not be your best
bet as the company has already ran out
of stock of any of these devices online
and even though the vice will be
launched in stores on friday we wonder
exactly how things are going to behave
with again the device already being sold
out there and how much stock there isn't
source will keep you posted as we learn
more and speaking of official news that
have to do with apple those of you that
have been waiting for watch os/2 on your
Apple watch you can finally get it it is
now available not exactly sure what held
Apple back but apparently it was a major
issue that made them pull back watch
os/2 and then launch the update and then
when you look at the update for those of
us that were using the beta was barely
12 megabytes but anyways the update is
there and well let's just see when the
native apps come along with it now what
would apple news be without us talking
about Samson we've already got analysts
predicting that this quarter in
particular will be kind of bad for
samsung probably worse than the
company's and Alice had predicted
because it seems that the iphone 6 is
performing better than the company
expected that this seemed that it's
phablet line of hasn't necessarily wow
people even though i've seen a ton of
people in bakers over the last couple of
weeks using more samsung phones than
iphone
which is a statement it does seem that
Samsung hasn't done as much as the
company wants let's see in the end when
the quarter results arrive how things
end up happening because again these are
just analysts predictions and finally
for the very interesting rumors of the
day we've got trusted sources claiming
that the huawei google nexus 6p will not
be better than the LG just because of
its size apparently you also will be
getting better storage options
apparently it'll start at 32 gigs and
then 128 gigs and there should be it's
here in the middle 64 gigs probably
which would be a first for any Nexus
device we're not really sure if you're
getting expandable storage and knowing
Google we doubt that that will be the
case but it does leave me to the
question of the day with more storage
options with that lower you to buy the
huawei nexus even though huawei is not
really known for its flagships that much
in the united states or which device
would you pick up that wouldn't be the
case because i really do want a nexus
I'm still struggling if I want a huawei
nexus but if the device is right and the
price is right I might as well
considered that's my case though leave
us a comment down below and let us know
what you think it's as always you know
the drill if you want to get the nose
