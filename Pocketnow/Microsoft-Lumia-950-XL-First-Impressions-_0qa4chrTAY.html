to the good people at clove we finally
get to test Windows 10 mobile on
something a little roomier I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is a very
quick look at the Microsoft Lumia 950 XL
again we owe a lot to the folks at clove
for getting us this review device folks
pay them a visit at clove dot code at UK
if you want one of these for your own
collection the first thing to note about
the 950 XL is that while it is bigger
than the 950 it doesn't feel that much
bigger that's an automatic win for the
XL because it's bringing a bigger
battery better processor and a half inch
more screen size among others some might
even say that the look is classier with
the XL but I'll leave that up to you for
now otherwise all of the Windows 10
mobile highs and lows seem to be
accounted for here from the futuristic
windows hello iris scanner and wireless
charging to the fairly Spartan App Store
and software bugs that remind you just
how young Windows 10 still is there are
little changes here and there the new
side button configuration will take some
getting used to but the most obvious of
the 950 XL advantages is its big screen
size here's where Windows 10 really gets
a chance to shine while you can leave
the Start screen and its default
configuration which doesn't give you any
advantage over the 950 flipping a single
toggle in the settings menu opens up
that quad HD panel to all the tiles you
can dream up this won't be for people
who already find the live tile look too
busy and it's a long way from the easy
glance ability of Windows Phone 7 but if
you can figure out a configuration that
works for you there's room here for a
lot of information making the 950 XL
feel more like a small Windows tablet
than a phone and if you type as much as
you take in the added real-estate gives
you plenty of room to spread out
especially in landscape it's a very
roomy typing experience
so far on day one the 950xl seems very
well named despite the added specs it's
a very similar in hand feel to the 950
with the primary standout being that
added screen size as we hit into the
full review we're going to keep an eye
out for how well the 810 processor
performs versus the 808 and the smaller
phone especially in continuum how much
longer the bigger battery holds out how
much more utility the added screen size
brings and whether all that makes the
excels larger price tag worth it if
there's something in particular you want
us to cover leave it in the comments
below one more time thanks to our
friends at clove for their vise loan pay
them a visit at clove code UK if you
want a 950xl of your own and follow us
