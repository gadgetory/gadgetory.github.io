revolutionary battery life the second
generation Apple watch is already
pointing to an announcement soon it
seems that Yahoo is for sale and bitters
include US carriers I'm hi Mary vetta
and if you like the t-shirts I do too
and there are a ton waiting to be next
this is parking out daily official news
today begin with Google as the company
has just announced that it will continue
the deals for those of you that want to
adopt project 5 you get a nexus 5x 100
99 bucks which is a really crazy deal
especially given the fact that project
phi as a service is really good and it
gives you a lot of bang for buck now
let's will to spotlight over to the HTC
10 we have been covering a ton of leaks
of this device and now we see a full
working unit the full display in white
and well there are a couple of things
that are interesting starting with the
fact that we don't really see boomsound
speakers anywhere seems it will follow
the same design aspects of the one a9
which is not necessarily bad we just
really wanted it we just don't
understand how is HTC teasing that we've
got high quality audio coming and the
front firing speakers are not there
probably something we are missing and we
cannot wait to hear more speaking of HTC
another thing that the company is
admitting to the obsessive about is
battery life we have a new teaser from
the HTC 10 and it points to the company
having worked long hours and working on
the chemistry to improve battery life on
this device this is rather interesting
as the only company that we've really
seen work hard on this is LG in the past
it would be great to see what HTC brings
to the market especially they could
figure out a way to give us more than
one day of battery life but with the
average specifications to the Snapdragon
820 and everything I find that hard to
believe we'll see and for those of you
that are in the market for an Apple
watch you might want to wait as we've
got trusted sources claiming that we
should expect the next generation at
WWDC and hopefully this time it's not
going to be like last year where they
announced that early and then we didn't
get it until later during the year
apparently we should expect an Apple
watch announcement in June and it's
going to be thinner that's pretty much
all we know that it's going to be
thinner we don't know if the same
accessories are going to work with it it
might as well be the case as these are
not at all cheap so let's see what we
get and finally the very hot news today
have to do with Yahoo for those of you
that did not know the company is on sale
and it might as well be as a I don't
think I have checked my yahoo email in
years and I'm sure a lot of people have
is whoa google has really taken over a
lot of the services that may Yahoo
popular at some point up to the point
where the company is currently worth
eight billion dollars at least in its
name and then everything else is just on
a crazy skyfall but even crazier is the
fact that the companies that are after
Yahoo are you as carriers verizon AT&amp;amp;T
AT&amp;amp;T has actually pulled back now we
even hear the google is planning to a
quarry yahoo which makes a lot of sense
given the fact that yahoo CEO is an ex
google employee but hey it leads me to
the question of the day which company do
you feel should acquire yahoo and what
for in my case i would rather say that i
hope it's not google because monopolies
are not great innovation is stirred by
competition we just wish that a company
would figure out a way to compete with
google it was a comment down below we'd
