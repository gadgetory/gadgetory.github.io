pocketnow.com if you like Windows Mobile
you have a new choice the LG fathom on
verizon this is one of the very few
devices that were ever released with
windows mobile 6.5 point 3 kind of the
inner room build of windows mobile
before we see windows phone 7 devices in
the fall of this year if you're looking
for a windows mobile device on verizon
you're considering the HTC touch pro2
the LG fathom may be a good choice for
you it's got a faster processor and it
has that same slide out keyboard form
factor that you'll get on the HTC touch
pro2 so let's do the unboxing of the LG
fathom let's take a look ok so let's
take a look we haven't seen many windows
mobile devices in the u.s. from LG so
I'm very curious to see how this device
fares for those looking for a device on
this play
alright so here's the Box a very simple
horizon box here LG fathom it's got a
very square ish like form factor you see
the buttons on the bottom here
indicative of windows mobile 6.5 point 3
package includes the phone simcard so it
is a world phone you can use it in other
countries and let's see if we have any
specs around the box we don't we'll get
to those later let's open up the device
here and here is the fathom we'll take a
look at it in a moment says fathom kind
of in a raised print their accessories
are probably standard looks like it's
using mini USB very nice the wall
charger really interesting looking wall
charger here very small so you can pop
off the different plugs here and use the
different different plugs for different
countries when you're traveling so this
is a really good phone if you travel a
lot and you need a smartphone to work in
multiple countries some software and
again another sort of plug here let's
put this aside and take a look at the
device alright so here we are let me
peel off this protective coating and get
a pretty good feel for how the device
feels in hand looks like there's a lot
of it on the screen and on the sides
pretty slick the screen is 3.2 inches
it's smaller than the HTC touch pro2 but
that also means that the device is going
to feel smaller in the pocket and
overall feel smaller so let's continue
to peel off tape here 3.2 megapixel
camera no flash back there unfortunately
and again we have this slide out
keyboard looks like it's already been
turned on because it was activated it's
got a nice action it is a spring
assisted up a little bit slow let's
compare this to some other devices then
we'll walk around the device a little
bit more more plastic wrap it's always
fun to tip it off ok so we're going to
compare against the HTC touch pro2
instead of the verizon touch pro2 there
they're basically the same device so the
real differences between this device is
that you get a faster processor on the
LG fathom 1 gigahertz compared to 528
mega
on the HTC touch pro2 so you may see a
difference there and performance will
have to do some tests also the
difference is that the screen size is
smaller on the fat and 3.2 inches which
is quite small compared to three point
six inches on the touch pro two let's
slide out these keyboards and compare of
course on the touch pro two you get this
nice tilting screen the fathom does not
tilt and you can see the buttons are
smaller so it's a smaller device the the
size of the the keyboards are actually
about the same here but you get larger
keys on the touch pro 2 now the screen
on the fathom is resistive meaning that
there is a style is somewhere around
here maybe this is it wow really
interesting location for a stylus
haven't seen one of these in a long time
but if you like handwriting recognition
the fathom will be perfect for you
what's the response of the screen is
quite quite responsive I'm used to using
a capacitive screen by now because you
know hd2 is out the nexus one so it's
going to feel a little bit strange to
those of you that have been come used to
capacitive screens so let's take a look
at this next to some other devices I'll
put away the stylus which seems to not
put in very ok there we go see it next
to another option you have on verizon
for a smartphone the palm pre plus here
so the keyboards are obviously going to
be very different between the two
devices a lot larger and more spacious
here on the LG favim and you get the
backlit here with the d-pad you can help
a lot with navigating around the screen
let's see it next to the google nexus
one much different screen sizes here and
3.2 versus 3.6 and of course the next to
the hd2 which doesn't have any slide out
keyboard we have a massive 4.3 inch
screen another windows mobile device
that actually shipped with 6.5 and
that's six point five point three and
again that six point five point three
means that buttons are a lot bigger
across the entire operating system so
they're all down here it's much more
optimized for touch compared to other
devices that don't use this opera
system see how fast screen rotation
speed is very fast very fast no problem
with that so this may be a really good
option for those of you looking for a
powerful windows mobile device that has
a nice spacious keyboard I think the one
gigahertz processor is going to be
pretty fast and there's not many devices
like this that are coming out anymore
again I think this is the last windows
mobile device that we're going to see
until windows phone 7 comes out in the
fall so get it while it's hot and we'll
have a lot more on this device coming up
soon be sure to give you the video a
thumbs up if you liked it and subscribe
