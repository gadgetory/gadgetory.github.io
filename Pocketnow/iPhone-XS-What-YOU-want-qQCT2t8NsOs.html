everybody it's time to take a look at
your reactions to the previous video
that I did on the iPhone 10s but before
we get into that I did want to state
right off the bat in this video that
this was filmed before the Apple event
this is just a fun way for us to see
what you really wanted to see out of the
phone and then of course you can come
back to this video jump into the comment
sections down below and talk about
whether or not what you wanted in the
phones actually arrived and if it didn't
maybe you can voice out some of your
frustrations about it Josh is loving
being able to talk about iPhones so this
statement while somewhat true is not the
whole story I just like everything I did
use an iPhone 10 for a little while and
even though I wasn't the biggest fan of
the full screen gestures I had a good
time with it it was fine there was
nothing wrong with the experience but
I'm not using an iPhone 10 now a few
comments were just literally lists of
all of the different things that you
wish that the iPhone had and
unfortunately we may not be getting a
lot of those things but it's fun to at
least imagine what a perfect iPhone
would look like some of the lists were
just massive no not touch ID headphone
jack expandable storage dual SIM a true
file manager USB C and you know what I
pretty much agree with all of these
because these are all features that we
can enjoy in other smartphones but if
you're locked into the Apple ecosystem I
can see why it's really frustrating that
there are certain things that are not
available now I want the big display a
resolution bumped to near quad HD 120
Hertz refresh rate faster wireless
charging improvements to face idea and a
stronger wall charger included in the
box this one is pretty interesting
because the stronger wall charger I
think that that is something that odd
the iPhone could use is faster charging
in general because the battery life on
iPhones at least historically from my
experience have not been amazing and we
have a lot of great battery life coming
from Android phones right now like the
note 9 even from the BlackBerry phones
it's pretty obvious that batteries are
starting to get better or rather power
consumption is starting to get better
and of course Apple is good at that but
it would be nice to be able to top up
the phone really quickly when you need
some power this list is just way too
long I'm not gonna go through all of
them but from what it seems like there
are a lot of UI gripes that you have
when it comes to iOS in particular
because a lot of this list of 25
different items has to do with a lot of
user interface stuff like a dark mode
split screen picture and picture multi
window those are all kind of in the same
most of
then were kind of in the same category
they're all about multitasking
multitasking did show up a number of
times in the comment sections as well
after all this coming right here kind of
hits it right on the nose this is what
my usage looks like on an Android device
I tend to have YouTube playing in the
background all the time because I watch
a lot of videos and as far as
productivity goes like no one is going
to argue that an iPhone is incapable of
getting a lot of different working play
tasks done but being able to do more
than one of those tasks all at once at
the same exact time would be pretty nice
and it is an experience that Android has
had for a while with multi window or
dual screen or dual window or even dual
apps from Chinese phones it's something
that Android Android users have been
enjoying for quite a while now speaking
of that display there was a lot of talk
about 120 Hertz refresh rates and I
think this is a trend that is coming up
so obviously there are a lot of hardcore
gamers out there who like to use their
phones for gaming and having a high
refresh rate just makes everything look
a little bit more crisp the other reason
why this is kind of important to mention
is because app developers or game
developers in particular do tend to
gravitate to iPhones and iOS at least at
the beginning of the release cycles so
it's pretty important to have these
games available because if they're going
to show up on iOS they're going to show
up on other platforms and of course
Android already has some phones with 120
Hertz this is one that I'm really into
because I missed the home button on the
iPhone 10 it's something that I really
griped about during my three weeks of
usage on that phone basically I just am
NOT a big fan of the homescreen gestures
the fullscreen gestures rather because
it just doesn't feel all that natural
and it just seems like you have to pay
more attention to the device in order to
do certain functions and I don't think
that you that should be the case across
the board now to be fair that little bar
on the bottom does make it easy to swipe
left and right to get between different
applications quickly but at the same
time it's just something you have to get
used to and I think if you're used to
the navbar or even used to a home button
like a lot of people in the comment
sections were then it is an adjustment
that takes a little bit of extra mind if
the display is everything right now and
that notch is supposed to provide even
more screen real estate then why not do
more with it but like I said in the last
video it doesn't look like touch ID is
going to be returning anytime soon let
alone an in display fingerprint sensor
the reason why is because Android is
adopting it like crazy and given the
trends and given how Apple has been
evolving their products over the last
couple of years it doesn't seem like
they're going to jump
on to that trend anytime soon but if you
don't get a fingerprint reader maybe you
just get a more improved face ID but in
this particular comment I think it's a
little bit hard to have face ID without
the knotch perhaps you can take off the
two sides where there's some extra
screen there and just have a bar at the
top but that's not really the point of
the notch to begin with you need to have
even more screen real estate or at least
that's what Apple wanted when they
created the knotch but the other reason
why the notch is there is to house all
of the bits and pieces that make face ID
possible and kind of putting it to the
point this particular commenter said the
new phones just feel like they are
limited and I don't blame you for
thinking that there are phones out there
that try to be everything to everyone
and not all of them really succeed at
doing that they always seem to falter in
any one particular category as far as
the trends are going right now we're not
gonna get that headphone jack back we're
not going to get USB C even though Apple
themselves are saying USB C is the
future but they're still sticking to the
Lightning port and maybe we're not going
to be getting a display that has a
fingerprint reader in it anytime soon
either I kind of understand where this
sentiment is coming from because in
places like Asia or Europe dual SIM
phones can be really popular and can be
incredibly useful and if the iPhone is
the most common phone in those markets
why not have a dual SIM option it is
something that I find it a little bit
perplexing especially for those
particular markets of course we have to
end it all with price and whether or not
this phone is going to be worth it a lot
of people want that reasonable price
point but it might be difficult to
actually get it with the phone that has
the most features yes there is going to
be a smaller iPhone it may not be an
iPhone 10 like device it might be
something different maybe it won't have
the dual cameras on the back and maybe
it'll be missing some of the features
that you want out of the bigger devices
but it will be a cheaper phone so maybe
you're going to get what you pay for so
while I completely get why all of these
price point comments are hoping that the
phone could be less than 7 or $600 it's
just not something that we're going to
be seeing moving forward with smart
phones especially as they become more
and more premium and yes you can argue
that a phone that is over $1000 but
doesn't have a headphone jack and still
uses a proprietary lightning cable it
might be a little bit hard to sell but I
am really excited to see what the new
iPhones are going to have and what Apple
is going to bring next so you can get
some opinions from myself either here
over at my channel at youtube.com slash
Josh or vergara but we are also going to
have plenty of coverage on the iPhone
here on pocket now as we're going to
have a special YouTube live
that's going to be done right after the
event up in Cupertino and then you can
also see what I'm up to over at my
channel at youtube.com slash Josh or
Vergara where I plan on having my own
reactions as well subscribe to both of
those channels and then make sure you
drop some likes on the videos and also
get into the comment sections to make
your voices heard and with that we'll
see you after the iPhone event tomorrow
so take care everybody and we'll see you
on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
