iphone 6 might have gotten leaked by a
carrier the LG g3 gets launched to the
public and yes it is really hot and
could it be that we're still getting
another variant of the Moto X I'm hi
Mary that I and if you're still
scrambling over yesterday's question of
the speed of light of the spaceship hit
me up on Twitter it's actually a simple
answer this is parking out daily Google
is making a lot of interesting changes
to Google now and it's kind of
interesting that it's trying to do so
almost silently but if we talk about
official news today cool now keeps
getting better with another update they
should be getting on your smartphone
very soon where it includes new ways to
be your weather aside from other cards
within the UI you will now be able to
see more than one city and your weather
information whereas in the past you had
cards you have to swipe back and forth
so stay tuned as apparently we will be
getting more stuff before apple's WWDC
2014 something very interesting now that
we're talking about google is the fact
that even though we are expecting for
the Moto X plus one to be launched by
motorola there are rumors that there is
actually a 64 gig variant of the Moto X
that's in the works it actually got
linked on this print website so could it
be that we are getting even more
variants of the Moto X and could it be
that we're actually sticking with this
phone for much longer or could it be
that the Moto X plus 1 is just the you
know better SPECT Moto X stay tuned for
that is that would actually be quite
cool now talk about Apple as those of
you interested in getting touch ID on
your future iOS device we've got new
credible reports the company is
investing hard on bringing touch ID and
actually a better version of touch ID on
every single iOS device that gets
launched this year so we are expecting
this to come to the future variant of
the ipad air probably the ipad mini with
retina display in the future and aside
from that also the iphone 6 now these
credible sources state that Apple is
investing a lot on its sapphire plant to
be able to deliver this time so um it
could be that the Sapphire production is
actually just focused on this and
speaking of Apple those of you wondering
when is the iphone 6 going to get
launched well it seems that deutsche
telekom has been contacting customers
and giving them the specific date that
they already have
mission from Apple because apparently
they want to get customers to renew
their contracts early the data September
19 which is actually in line with the
launch of the iphone 5s the launch of
the iphone 5 and close to the iphone for
us as well obviously there was a lot
happening on that year the iphone 4s
when Steve Jobs died so stay tuned it
could be that we are going to have to
wait until September 19 and finally for
the very hot news of the day LG has just
launched the LG g3 and in a short word
you can watch our editorial roundtable
you can watch Michael Fisher's full
coverage of this phone this is hot
pretty much one of the first two que
despues to reach the United States it's
got all the bells and whistles that we
want it on the G tool even though we
love the g2 in our review except for the
software but everything's they're
replaceable storage replaceable battery
we've got just about everything that
everybody wants on a smartphone on this
g3 and that leads you to the question of
the day what do you think about this
geez 3 is this gonna be your next
smartphone because uh to be honest with
you i love the g two so much that i did
not want to return that review unit and
if i had to pay for the g3 in all
honesty i'm just waiting for Michael
official full review which should be
live very soon but so far I would be
willing to pay for this phone but leave
us a comment down below what do you
think about and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the dozer Leo
before this video is so mushy follow us
on Paco no comments the script changing
channel as well you'll also follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore iveta please

what you saw I am hanging every better
