and today we're looking at the ascend p1
from Huawei we're gonna do a little
unboxing for you it is a super slim
Android phone announced back in January
it's also my first exposure of any kind
to hallway hardware so let's check it
out ok so here is the ascend p1 s box
here just a single image of the phone on
the front little slimness emphasizing
graphic on the side there's the brand
name there the Huawei brand up top some
serial numbers down bottom and the
feature rundown on the back that's a
very I phone esque box I hesitate to say
because that results in immediate
backlash but it really does remind me of
unboxing my iPhone 3G for the first time
anyway pull that off
we're greeted front and center by the
device always a nice touch let's put
that aside for the moment little finger
hole there to get that out
welcome to Huawei Thank You Huawei pull
that insert out nothing really going on
there and very very minimal stuff going
on in the box here I feel like the user
manuals may have been left out by by who
I weigh when they shipped this to us
thank you for the vote of confidence
Huawei this is the Micro USB cable of
course done up in white and the wall
charger with the Huawei branding
international version here also done up
in white very nice
anyway yeah we are missing the manuals
there so apologies for that but you
wouldn't read it anyway let's put that
stuff aside and here we have the phone
take it out of its plastic sleeve here
now the phone is very very slim at 7.7
millimeters for most of its casing with
a reassuring weight in the hand it's
weird it's only 110 grams so it's even
lighter than the 133 grams of the galaxy
s3 that I've been slamming for not
feeling substantial enough but here on
the p1 the materials somehow
don't feel as tacky now others will
disagree with me and other reviewers
have already disagreed with me on this
it's going to your mileage is gonna vary
here I think the smaller casing design
of the p1 conspires with that with the
weight to make it feel different I don't
know more on that in the full review
once I've had a solid amount of time
with the device anyway let's have a look
at the hardware tour up front 4.3 inch
Super AMOLED display at 960 by 540
resolution qHD isn't exactly
top-of-the-line anymore but that's what
we're working with down below if you can
see the black phones are very very
difficult to photograph with this crappy
camera a kind of old-fashioned styling
on these capacitive Android buttons but
they are at least in the ICS
configuration so that's good up top you
can barely see it probably if you can
see it at all there's a 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera around the side here
we've got the microSD expansion slot I
get some light on it there we got the
power button there around the other side
just a volume rocker and around back
we're looking at an 8 megapixel rear
facing camera with backside illuminated
sensor and a non removable cover with an
interesting materials pattern here under
which is sitting a 1670 milliamp power
battery and while we're talking about
the guts we should also mention that
under the hood the p1 is powered by a
1.5 gigahertz OMAP 4460 dual-core CPU
with a gig of ram backing that up and it
ships with 4 gigs of internal storage in
addition to that microsd expandable 'ti
on the side here radios are a quad-band
GSM and Penta band 3g HSPA+ capable
delivering speeds up to 21 megabits per
second
no LTE here unfortunately so for the
last portion of this video let's give
ourselves a first boot here if we have
enough juice in the device now this is
the first there we go there's little
buzz and there's the highway branding
that's nice speaking of which this is
the first time wow that was fast
there's the first time I've handled a
device from Huawei it's the first time
I'll be exposed to any kind of software
from the company so this is exciting
breaking new ground
at PocketNow so we are alive we have a
drag to unlock option here to get us to
a couple shortcuts very similar to a
when newer motorola skin here on this
drag to unlock make sure we can unlock
and there we are
thanks for watching the unboxing of the
ascend p1 from Huawei as usual and
unboxing this week usually means a

after so keep it locked to pocketnow.com

specific you want to see in the review
video or in the review text piece you

meantime just follow us at pocketnow.com
