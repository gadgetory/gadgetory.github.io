decline after years of success the one
plus three rumors begin to point to
monster specifications on a budget and
HTC has begun to confuse more with its
new smartphone offerings I'm hi Mary
vera and when this video is done you
could probably just follow bb-8 hey this
is parking out daily the official news
today start with deals if yesterday's
moto 360 sport deals for two hundred
dollars we're good enough for you well
it's now with an extra fifty dollar gift
card and at least two of the following
links of the description but in addition
to that if you're in the market for a
regular Android wear SmartWatch on a
budget the first generations n watch is
currently for a hundred dollars but then
if you want those then watch to which I
highly suggest you get it's 130 really
good deals indeed you know one of the
coolest things about using an Apple
watch if not the only one sadly is the
fact that you can easily replace it
straps something you can't really do
that well with certain Android wear
offerings but google has just decided to
do that with its new mode straps which
literally are a different way to replace
your straps you actually have to leave
the pin on the watch lugs and then
eventually you could just snap one strap
on and off and continue doing that
depending on how many straps you have
which is actually very cool it'll be
even cooler if it's affordable we will
let you know when we get a price release
and if you thought that HTC that an
amazing java confusing with its
smartphones and the 10 was it well
that's not the case the company just
decided to rehash the one m9 with a new
one s9 which has pretty much the same
design at the back but then the front
actually brings back boom sound what's
up HTC but you're also getting a
MediaTek Helio x10 processor 2 gigs of
ram 16 gigs of storage in addition to a
1080p display it's definitely not a
phone to go crazy for but hopefully the
price tag will tell you more soon now
there is one company that knows how to
give you a really good smartphone on a
budget as 1 plus the company has made a
lot of hep clients with the oneplus one
the one plus two and now we've got
rumors of the 1 plus 3 we even have full
benchmarks and specification that you
could follow with the links of the
script
but to make this easy for you Snapdragon
820 six gigabytes of RAM and we're not
exactly sure if the storage will be
expandable this time we do hope so but
yeah for those of you asking 1080p is
making a comeback here apparently you
know what let's not even make it a topic
sure there is quad HD but 1080p on that
price tag you know it's it's good enough
in my opinion and finally the very hot
news did they have to do with apple as
its second-quarter results are actually
the first that go on the klein in years
i think ever since the launch of the
first generation iphone and this is
rather sad even though the company had
told us that this might happen this
quarter I phones are down sixteen
percent the ipad was expected it's down
nineteen percent but in the mac which
was on a steady regular rise is
currently twelve percent down profits
took a crazy plunge twenty-three percent
about the only thing that's going well
right now is the company's online
services which are actually a billion
dollars up and okay it's not like if the
iphone is dead the company still sold 51
million units but it leads me to the
question of today what exactly do you
think heppell did wrong with this recent
lineup of iphones the company launched a
larger iphone which is what everybody
wanted the company launched a more
powerful iphone which is what everybody
wanted and yet the company continues on
the klein or has begun this decline
sorry in my case I believe that Apple
really needs to move away from its
current model of not accepting
essentials like for example expandable
storage and selling you iphone so
expensive it just comes to the point
where you're at the store and you know
that be an iphone is six hundred fifty
dollars but then 16 gigabytes is not
enough so people just go crazy go for 64
gigs and then they're like wait a second
i could buy that storage card for twelve
dollars on amazon i feel that people are
starting to feel ripped off in my
opinion but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
