Mahatma Gandhi oh my god
that would be the perfect quote hey man
all this video seems to be suffering
because Diego is cutting some onions
yeah I'd like to agree with that the
shape of this mic on his shirt looks
like there's a notch on his shirt I know
man like I wish there was a better
option but I love this microphone that's
right it's that time of the week I'm
high metal you got this is PocketNow
this is the pocket now daily recap your
comments for last week
on Monday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 the final rumors that there
were three variants finally being
certified I asked you what do you think
about the line that we had specs and
everything we had 390 comments really
awesome lineup can't wait so hyped I
have to agree actually three phones
though I'm I don't know I'm skeptical
because I don't necessarily see much
difference between them but that's just
me I'm super excited about the s10
series the camera is my main draw most
other features on the S and Note line
already seem near-perfect
of the fine perfection if only like I
mean have you noticed what it cost if
you drop any of these phones I wish they
worked a little more on durability cuz
these are really expensive phones to fix
I think all Samsung models are starting
to get confusing
dude that's been the case ever since
they started using the galaxy name for
about everything the Galaxy J and the
galaxy all this oh my god on Tuesday the
topic was 5ge the whole thing about 18 t
using this moniker to define their
network which hasn't really changed I
actually what you thought cuz I felt it
was unethical we have 398 comments AT&amp;amp;T
v GE the e stands for imagination oh my
god
all right this is the best comment like
seriously how about instead of upgrading
to 5g let's bring 4G to the rest of the
country first plenty of areas in this
country that still don't get even that
oh my god watch our pocket out weekly we
discuss this topic a lot mainly because
well even for G not not talking LTE but
like 4G is terrible HSPA+ on agencies
like inexistent I got the 5 GE logo on
my note 9 looks very weird to have and
doesn't seem to be any faster than usual
exactly exactly that's my point right
now even LTE is not really fully
achieved by US carriers so I don't know
I find it to be again deceiving and not
correct then on Wednesday the topic was
the Galaxy S tenant it's ceramic back
barians I asked you what did you think
about this option in addition to other
leaks that were shown we had 366
comments I'm honestly dying to see the
new S 10 I'm not necessarily dying dude
but I'm hoping to see that same thing
brings
more than just the spec upgrade I like
everything that sleek so far except the
prices oh my god have you heard like
there was an option that was like
fifteen hundred dollars according to
rumors I'm hoping that's not the case
but true I get your point
just give us the phone already do it
exactly man we've been covering these
leaks for like a year already you saw a
rumor roundup even go as far as to tell
you where we started covering these
leaks and then on Thursday the topic was
selfies we heard that the Galaxy S ten
was gonna get a boost of 10 megapixels
and was finally able to record 4k video
I asked you how much do you care about
that we had 354 comments I think they
care too much about the selfie camera
when they should focus on the main one
I'm not gonna give you that one mainly
because a photography on the galaxy s is
actually really good I never use my
selfie camera never sad for you buddy
finally I could see my pimples in 4k oh
my god see that is the benefit of not
being a teenager anymore then finally
Friday it was all about the Huawei P 30
Pro we hear for cameras coming I asked
you what you think those cameras are
gonna do we have 355 comments for
cameras it better be able to see through
walls or other things I need a camera
that lets me read minds you're having
problems with your wife girlfriend most
probably the fourth camera is to summon
Captain Planet oh my god I haven't heard
the name Captain Planet in a while but I
don't know man I hope that they bring
back the monochrome I really love that
native monochrome photography but that's
just me if they keep the wide + the
telephoto and the monochrome plus 40
megapixels I think that's gonna be great
but we'll see what we get that's it for
the bargain out daily recap thank you so
