to see the higher end of Apple's new
iPhone models the 5s our own branded
minimum has already unboxed it that
video is here on our channel page and at
pocketnow.com but if you're looking for
a more colorful take on Apple's new
iPhone stay right here I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and behind the
mask here is Apple's new iPhone 5c let's
unbox it okay so the last time I bought
an iPhone it was 2008 and I was waiting
in line at a mall fortunately
circumstances have changed somewhat and
this one got delivered to my house but
the packaging has not changed all that
much at least not in terms of Apple on
the whole this is a plastic box very
very compactly packaged let me go ahead
and slide off this the space mask here
so we can see the device this is the
first time I have seen personally an
iPhone encased like an iPod you can see
the device without even opening the box
that is obviously a fake image there
that's not the actual screen but look
how compact this box is you can hold the
box is it's not thinner but it's like
footprint is about the same size as a
large phablet I mean this is really
really efficient packaging some people
say we get a little too excited over
packaging with our unboxings but you
know when it's this well done you have
to appreciate it and if there's anybody
that does packaging better than Apple
frankly I haven't seen them yet here we
have a little orange dot to call out
where we should begin our unpeeling
process I thought I was going to have to
bring out old Bessie which is not the
name of my unboxing knife but probably
could be if you wanted it to be should
we have a poll forums pocketnow.com let
us know what you think what should I
name my unboxing knife the old timer
which is out of frame for the moment
because I'm focusing on the phone let's
stop rambling I'm excited I'm excited
about this device and I know a lot of
people are less excited and more excited
about the flagship one but I like color
as you can see I got the blue device I
did in fact get a let's pop the ceiling
I did in fact get a case a colored case
for it but I got the wrong color because
I was too tired as you might have heard
on the pocket net weekly podcast so the
device is fully encased in this top
module here and this Wow
this is so high quality okay we're going
to put this aside this is heavier than I
would have thought put that aside for a
second this is my first time unboxing an
iPhone since the Bush administration
this is cool hello yourself there's
nothing else on here I'm just Hello
iPhone 5c a little tour of your of your
hardware features there these are bound
together these appear to be info cards
of course if you want to display your
belonging to the cult of Mac you can do
that iPhone 5c ring sounds with volume
keys home button just telling you about
the device is there a back side of this
yes indeed where you can learn more
where you can get support here is a sim
removal tool very very nice to have and
general iPhone info probably some
warranty stuff rounded corners on this
it's kind of like holding the real-life
version of webOS cards that's kind of
cool anyway you're bored of that already
let's move on oh yes I finally get to
try ear pods for the first time Apple's
new earbud design shipped with the
iPhone 5 so nothing really new to the
marketplace but new to me
all of it packaged beautifully just like
the rest of it this is I this is no
surprise but it's probably the finest
unboxing experience I've had so far
single USB port on this I'm used to the
Moto X is dual USB port plug so I'm
going to be entitled and complain about
that just so I can inject some
artificial balance into this nice narrow
gauge USB cable and man this this is
like a cat bowl it's so well made okay
let's put the hardware aside excuse me
let's put the packaging aside get back
to the phone folks the iPhone 5c is
available in white pink yellow and green
shades as well but since I never got my
wish for a cyan Lumia 920 or 1020 I
decided to go with the blue now it's
still in its protective case here we
just wanted to make clear that I am very
excited about the color if you couldn't
tell already will zoom out a little bit
more just so that we can see what's
going on here
whoo all right that pops off quickly I
probably did it wrong I'm holding it
wrong now the plastic box was joined to
the screen protector so I messed up
before but let's see if we can get a
close-up angle on this peel off here
silence please I wasn't very loud but it
sure was beautiful and therefore the
first time in the state in which I'm
going to be using it is the new iPhone
5c in blue you're tired of me showboatin
so let me take you around the hardware
here my first impressions of this this
plastic are that it reminds me a bit of
a Lumia 920 one of the glossy editions
that is from Nokia it is you know the
polycarbonate that Apple has used is is
high-quality and clearly but it's as you
can see we're already getting some some
fingerprint action there I predict that
in very short order this thing is going
to be just riddled with with hand skin
grease and such
hopefully the color will help you know
fight that trend a little bit but it is
definitely worth noting this is very
very different than the iPhone 5 and we
will be comparing this to the iPhone 5
but a quick hardware tour for you an 8
megapixel shooter around back the same
one found on the iPhone 5 I believe next
door to it and LED flash the Apple logo
the iPhone branding down below not much
else to speak of there flipping it over
a 1.2 megapixel front-facing camera for
face time the battery within is slightly
larger than the iPhone 5 I'm going to go
ahead and power on here while I'm
talking about it but just volume down
volume up and the ringer silenced key
home button down below just like every
other iPhone nothing on this side except
the SIM tray which I will be dealing
with in a moment flip it back around to
the front go ahead and power standby it
up up top and just to take a look at the
bottom there we are
there's our speaker ports a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack and the Lightning port down below
don't know if I call that a USB cable
before but it's not a USB cable just in
case I did
let's power on the iPhone 5c press and
hold we should get Apple's new flattened
UI pretty swiftly here but just to tell
you a little bit more about it slightly
larger battery than we're used to seeing
five point seven three watt hours around
little higher than 1500 milliamp hours
versus the earlier iPhones 5.45 watt
hours or 1440 milliamp hours that's
rated for 10 hours of 3G talktime 250
hours of standby this display is a
4-inch 11 36 by 640 display at 326 PPI
and this phone is slightly heavier than
the the iPhone we're used to at 132
grams a little heavier than the iPhone
5s as well as you can see I have my
hello in multiple languages here and
being prompted to slide to setup I will
select I know there's no sim in there
I'll put it in later my primary language
is English my country region is the
United States and we'll get to the
initial setup later on off camera but
for now I just wanted to give you a
quick look the first iPhone that I have
had in my possession in a very long time
the iPhone 5c it may be the lower end of
the two options folks but we are going
to be covering the iPhone 5c extensively
at pocket now alongside the higher-end
iPhone 5s so stay tuned throughout next
week for that
in the meantime toss us a like if you
enjoyed this unboxing and do leave us a
comment down below if there's something
you would like us to take a close look
at with the 5c or the 5s and be sure to
follow us on social media but most
importantly thank you so much for
watching this has been michael fisher
