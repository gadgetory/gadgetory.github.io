pocketnow.com the HTC Sensation and the
Samsung Galaxy s2 are two of the hottest
Android smartphones of all time in this
video we're going to compare them on
specs hardware software benchmarks web
browsing and a whole lot more so you can
determine which of these super high-end
phones are worth your hard earned cash
let's get through the comparison now
alright so let's get started talking
about price the HTC Sensation is now
shipping in Europe you can bring it in
unlock to the US it will work on
t-mobile for the unsubsidized price of
seven hundred and fifty bucks it's a lot
of money but it's coming to t-mobile in
the US for around two hundred dollars
it's also just going to ship on Vodafone
plus a host of other carriers around the
world at a lower subsidized price but
again if you want to bring it into the
US it's going to be expensive but it'll
work on t-mobile if you want it a little
bit early the Galaxy S 2 also is
available in Europe right now selling
for a little bit cheaper $700 if you
import it to the US it'll work on AT&amp;amp;T
now Samsung hasn't talked about
availability in the US yet but some of
our research has shown that AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
and Sprint are going to get the galaxy
s2 probably in quarter four in the
October November December timeframe
again that hasn't been confirmed but our
guess is still the t-mobile will not get
the galaxy s2 but all other carriers in
the US and a lot of the carriers around
the world will get the galaxy s2 just
like they got the Galaxy S one or just
the Galaxy S as it was called now let's
talk about specifications the HTC
Sensation ships with Qualcomm's brand
new 1.2 gigahertz Snapdragon dual-core
CPU this is the first time HTC a ship to
dual-core CPU you also get 768 megabytes
of RAM for multitasking you get a
gigabyte of RAM plus 8 gigabytes of
storage provided by the microSD card
included in the box now the galaxy s2 is
also Specht with a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core CPU this time it's the Samsung
Exynos processor a little bit different
there we get 1 gigabyte of RAM which is
more than the sensations 768 and
built-in storage is either 16 gigs or 32
gigs depending on which model you go for
which is really cool because there's
also a microSD slot in the galaxy s 2 so
you can expand the storage really really
high if you're looking for the utmost in
the storage the galaxy s2 is the winner
in that respect but other specs they're
pretty similar except for the fact that
the galaxy s2 has a little bit more RAM
than does the sensation in terms of
weight the sensation feels more
substantial higher quality in the hand
it's 148 grams it feels again more solid
but the galaxy s2 is a lightweight 116
grams it's also super thin in fact it is
the thinnest smartphone on the planet
the sensations no slouch it's pretty
thin as well around the eleven point
five millimeter range whereas the Galaxy
s2 is about 8.6 millimeters thick both
of these devices feel very very thin
there they're not very substantial in
the pocket but if you're looking for the
device that feels the most high-quality
you definitely want to go with the
sensation if that's important to you
they're both running on the latest
version of Android version 2.3 obviously
no word if they're going to be upgraded
to Ice Cream Sandwich the hackers will
probably get these devices up to speed
when Ice Cream Sandwich gets released
later this year because these are going
to be very very very popular devices and
popular devices have a very vibrant
development community now let's talk
about the hardware here both are slab
devices you get some sharper edges on
the samsung galaxy s 2 you get a nice
little contoured glass here on the
sensation just gives it a nice visual
pizazz and you also get a hardware
button on the Galaxy S 2 if you're
somebody that likes the click enos the
real feel of a hardware button you'll
definitely enjoy the home button on the
galaxy s 2 HTC went with capacitive
buttons in fact most hdçç devices are
the same they look about the same and
you get that here with the HTC Sensation
both have front-facing cameras
higher spec here 2 megapixels versus VGA
resolution which is not even a full
megapixel a mega pixel equals mmm
pixels if you multiply the resolution
any amount we don't have to get into
that the screen size on both of these
are the same 4.3 inches diagonal but you
get the higher resolution display on the
sensation qHD 960 down to 540 across on
the galaxy s2 you get 800 down by 480
across now contrast is still better on
the galaxy s2 as we're going to see in a
minute thanks to the Super AMOLED plus
panel HTC gives you super LCD which is
also quite good but it's not nearly as
contrast E as what you get in the galaxy
s2 flipping over to the back we can see
both of these have an 8 megapixel camera
both are capable of shooting in full
1080p 30 frames per second which is
quite awesome both have a flash in terms
of battery we've got a smaller battery
on the sensation 15 20 milliamp hours
and on the galaxy s 2 we have 16 30
milliamp hours both of these devices
will get you through the day no problem
if you're using it a lot which is great
but you're gonna have to charge every
day this has you know two two processors
in here of course it's going to use a
fair amount of juice there are the
speakers they're both quite loud on both
devices
looking around the device got the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack both on top
HTC puts the power standby button on the
top Samsung puts it on the side another
cool thing about the galaxy s 2 is that
you can take the device out of standby
either by this button or the button on
the side so you get a little bit of
versatility there it's really nice to
not have to reach up to the standby
button when you're using the Galaxy S 2
okay so let's get into some of the
software here and talk more about how
they compare we're gonna unlock both
devices and you're going to notice right
off the bat
HTC gives you a functional lock screen
we get the weather here and we can also
quickly launch an application just by
dragging the item into the circle
galaxy is to really just plain all you
get is the date at the time so we're
gonna slide that off and I've got
pictures of waterfalls up here so that I
can show you sort of how the screens
compare right off the bat you can see
that the qHD resolution screen makes
everything a little bit smaller that is
because the pixels are smaller we have
256 pixels per inch on the sensation and
we've got 217 pixels per inch on the
galaxy s2 in practice this makes text a
little bit sharper on the sensation
again this is the first time we're
singing qHD resolution from HTC also we
get a 16 by 9 aspect ratio on the
sensation and it's not exactly sixteen
by nine on the galaxy s2 which means
movies look more true to life in terms
of their aspect ratio and the top and
the bottom not getting cut off on the
sensation
okay so let's jump into a picture here
and you're gonna see that although the
sensation is a higher resolution display
they're very very close in terms of
image fidelity in fact contrast is is
much greater much much greater on the
galaxy s2 some people think that the
Super AMOLED here is a little bit
unnatural and and that makes sense but
in terms of sheer contrast for most
people the galaxy s2 has the clear
crisper screen and will shrink this back
and go to the home screens now we've got
two entirely different interfaces to
talk about here we've got TouchWiz on
the samsung galaxy s2 and Sense 3.0 on
the sensation look at TouchWiz so
TouchWiz is comprised of multiple home
screens and you can add and subtract
which you cannot do on the sensation and
we can swipe from screen to screen if we
go into applications this is the Samsung
UI for accessing your applications you
have to go screen by screen like this
but you can also go to ListView if you
want to get a horizontal or vertically
scrolling list I should say let's go
back to grid view now to add widgets you
tap and hold you get this cool little
pop-up you tap on widgets and these are
all of the widgets there of it available
on the galaxy s2 they're pretty good but
they're not nearly as good as what you
get on HTC so HTC we get this carousel
spinning home screen very beautiful
visuals throughout the entire Sense UI I
mean this is really high quality stuff
you really just don't get that with the
Samsung Galaxy S 2 heck the weather
animations even have sounds to them I
mean come on it's pretty good stuff and
of course if you spin this really fast
you got to go really fast they'll start
to shrink in the background and well
well who it's a it's a little animated
feature not that big of a deal so here
are the widgets on the galaxy s2 kind of
simple stuff not simple on the sensation
so I should go down here and we'll go to
widgets and browse all HTC widgets he
had real high quality HTC widgets I mean
interactive widgets that can be a couple
different sizes for example if we go to
say the calendar widget here well this
only has one style but some of these
have a variety of different styles that
you can switch through that's great but
on the galaxy s2 you can actually resize
widgets which is awesome so for example
if we go to thank you weather widget tap
and hold we get a little grid we can
make it bigger and smaller
you cannot resize widgets on the HTC
Sensation this weather clock you can't
resize it
it can only be moved in one sort of way
and in terms of the app tray on the HTC
Sensation it's now / downloaded frequent
and all applications so I really like
the ability to be able to go to frequent
apps so all of your most used apps sit
right at the top on the galaxy s2 you
kind of got to go over your apps right
you can set these panels up and
customize them but it's not as
convenient as being able to jump right
to your frequently used apps on the HTC
Sensation alright and let's talk
benchmarks the all-important so we're
gonna jump into quadrant standard on
both devices I already ran the benchmark
here we got 3226 on the galaxy s2 really
impressive pretty good to hear on the
sensation 1959 the galaxy s2 obviously
smokes the sensation in the quadrant
test but that's only one benchmark so
let's check out some other benchmarks
like smart bench 2011 here the result in
smart bench for the productivity index
on the galaxy s2 3842 on the sensation
2795 Galaxy s2 also wins in the games
index 2274 60
96 let's run one more benchmark Linpack
ok here are the results a little bit
better here on the HTC Sensation
forty-six point two one five megaflops
only forty five point three eight nine
on the HTC on the samsung galaxy has two
easy to get these mixed up sometimes so
in terms of benchmarking powers the
Samsung Galaxy S two wins most of the
time but in terms of it seems sheer
processing power which is what the
Linpack Pro is measuring that this the
HTC Sensation takes the cake
now let's talk about web browsing the
all-important web browsing speed test
that's probably one of the best tests of
the power of the phone especially when
you're loading complex web pages its
dive in to the internet here and we've
got of course that page loaded both of
these have the pinch out to see your
your tab screen and here we are so we
are going to go to pocket now on both of
these so M okay here we go
let's load them we're on the same Wi-Fi
network here okay it looks about it's hi
there the galaxy s2 might have been a
little bit faster let's go to desktop
version see which gets there faster
we've got plugins turn to on-demand so
that there is no sort of slow and is
happening because of Flash content
galaxy has to finish first sensation is
done a little bit after that very smooth
on both a little bit smoother on the
galaxies to a little bit choppy actually
on the sensation we're actually going to
zoom in a little bit double tap to zoom
in double tap to zoom in happens pretty
fast on both let's take a look at text
since we're dealing with a higher pixel
density on the sensation text should be
a little bit sharper it's very very
tough to tell what you get on the galaxy
s2 is blacker texts with better contrast
but on the sensation if you get a
magnifying glass where you have very
very good eyes you're going to see that
the pixels are smaller and thus more
difficult to see maybe we can actually
see this on the camera if we go closer
in
so if you take a look at that it's kind
of hard to determine but text is a
little bit sharper not by much on the
sensation that on the galaxy s2 okay
let's go to a really complex website
with zoom out here
we're gonna go to Engadget the long page
so we're gonna go to end gadget here
just gonna load the mobile version
really quick it's going straight to the
desktop view here on the the galaxy s2
terms of user now what I want here we go
okay so loading and as its loading we
can flick down the page you're going to
see there's no checker boards which is
great that is the same for the galaxy s2
a very very good web browsing scenario
here and actually we're going to go to
classic or actually let's go to HD and
let's zoom in here get a little bit
close to that button make it a big
target and boom
so both loading the HD version of
Engadget again a very smooth scrolling
even as it's loading on both thanks to
these dual-core processors they really
do a great job the Galaxy has to beat
the sensation in loading this page so
the screen rotation speed test real
quick galaxy s2 is faster their Galaxy
s2 is faster they're both do a great job
a tree flowing the column so you can
zoom in and it makes it look nice so we
can zoom out but in terms of sheer speed
it's really no contest the galaxy s2 is
faster let's zoom in again a big target
here and we're going to move it around
and tap it at the same time see again
which one goes faster galaxy s2 1 it
keeps winning what's really nice about
the sensation though is that to stop it
you get a full-screen browsing
experience whereas here on the galaxy s2
you always get the Android notification
bar at the top but in terms of web
browsing there's no question here the
galaxy s2 takes the cake even with the
higher resolution screen which should
make for a kind of better browsing
experience on the sensation both are
very good galaxy s2 is
they come it is extremely fast when it
comes to browsing the web and so we've
got to give the points to the Galaxy S 2
for that so these are two very different
very high quality devices at the end of
the day have their own strengths and
weaknesses if you want the fastest
thinnest lightest Android smartphone out
there it's hard to beat the Samsung
Galaxy S 2 but if you want the most
horrifying the highest quality Android
smartphone that also has a higher
resolution display the HTC Sensation
will make you happy at the end of the
day these are both true winners it just
matters what you value most in a
smartphone if you liked this video

for watching that's it for now
