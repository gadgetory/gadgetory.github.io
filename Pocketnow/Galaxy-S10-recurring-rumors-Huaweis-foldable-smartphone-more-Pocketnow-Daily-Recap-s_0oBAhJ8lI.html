somewhere a kitten dies and know the
reason why you pick this comment view
today I walk into an Apple store but
they do no windows so I left lol lol
indeed I am Vanguard Lavetta and 42
likes proves that I like Hyneman but
fine that's right it's that time of the
week I am Haim every that off this is
PocketNow and this is the bargain out
daily recap your comments for last week
on Monday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy after the fact that Samsung was
quote-unquote a little desperate to
launch it we were given a February time
frame and I asked her I mean do you
really think that Sammy is that
desperate we have 318 comments I think
it's a mistake for Samsung to introduce
another line they should focus on their
s and note premium lines bringing all
new improvements to them my concern is
that there will be features we want but
in the line that does not work for our
use case then the consumer ends up
having to compromise here's the thing
Samsung has been focusing on those
premium lines for years up to the point
where the design hasn't really changed
in a while and that formula hasn't
really worked so I totally understand
why they want to do it but I totally get
your point yes definitely entry you know
first-generation products are you know
they're an issue the fun the cool thing
is you don't have to buy it you could
buy an S next year which is what I would
do with my money wait for that first
batch of products to make consumers go
crazy and then buy generation 2 the
slowdown was expected there really are
only so many people in the world plus
devices are lasting a lot longer now
actually that's not necessarily accurate
there's a like companies are already
preparing for the next billion people
that are gonna be connected and these
people are from emerging markets they're
not from the high-end markets and
therefore that's one of the main reasons
why companies are bidding so strongly on
mid Rangers because Africa is becoming a
market India continues to grow
significantly Latin America has grown
tremendously as well and that's where
people are investing and people in these
countries can't buy expensive phones so
yeah
Samsung worry makes total sense think
about it when moved from Nokia Motorolla
to Samsung how long before we moved on
to oneplus and Hawaii I think what
you're saying is Huawei well it all
depends on how well these companies
compete and I feel companies like
oneplus and Nokia oh man they're
fighting really hard then on Tuesday the
topic was a Samsung Galaxy S 10 and the
rumors of wait for it six cameras four
in the back two in the front I asked you
what do you think the companies thinking
of with this and we had 314 comments
Sammis finally going to add the extra
camera i've been asking for oh my god
i should have read that before i should
have prepared but fine all right six
cameras I'm sure even then women will
not like their fix all right these are a
good fix man yeah definitely uh that's a
good one
can you imagine is there gonna be like a
special bathroom pic camera it's gonna
be an x-ray 3d holographic night-vision
selfie camera selfie camera it is then
on Wednesday the topic was again the
Samsung Galaxy S ten because it's gonna
take over the news very often going
forward we heard of separate launch a
CES at MWC and I asked you if you
thought that was a good idea
we have 375 comments Samsung will launch
the S 10 line at MWC however I don't
think it's smart to create so many
variants of the same phone especially if
two of them will get the same screen
size instead of one being smaller I do
believe that Samsung will launch
different variants but I don't think
they'll launch on every market the
smartest idea would be the launch just
two variants with the same bells and
whistles only with size differences and
at a competitive price that would be I
don't know it's just the the way the
market behaves is so different and it
varies depending on country up to the
point where we see even flagship phones
launched in different markets like India
with different processors just to be
able to keep the price down and so I
don't know man it's it's a very
difficult way to I think these companies
are I'm not saying that they're doing
the right thing because obviously
there's no such thing as a perfect
approach but I feel that what they've
been doing has a point they should
really reveal all of the devices all at
once that would be I don't know I I
think that you're saying they should
pull an apple like for example they
announced the X the 10 are the 10 s
tennis max but then they launched one
first and then the other one later
that's actually not a bad idea true then
on Thursday the topic was Huawei's
foldable product we saw some trademark
names and I asked you
name do you think the company should
pick we had 490 comments because full
d'emic full face was already copyrighted
yeah fine Huawei bender or Huawei bendy
or Huawei clam or huawei book uh Huawei
book that's actually not a bad one
because they have made books of the
Huawei book yeah or the smart book
something like that hey it was my idea
wall way it should be called Huawei
notebook
true I mean why not but that's the thing
like if I feel that that should fall
better into like a like if it were
larger like for example I feel that an
iPad feels like a note pad the design
makes it feel like a note pad so yeah
that's the reason why I pad made so much
sense so I feel that it will all depend
on what the product feels like when it's
done and then finally on Friday the
topic was the Samsung Galaxy F we talked
price tags a possible $2,000 I asked you
what you thought 425 comments actually
hoped that the new foldable Samsung
phone have something like an S Pen
included since it will be a larger
template template and could have some
benefits dude that would be the selling
point if they bring the s-pen to this
product it's gonna be genius why would
someone buy a 2000 dollar tablet for
watching Netflix at home when they can
have a 40 plus inch TV with Netflix
these days think about it dude if you're
in New York City you'll see just how
many people are mobile so it makes sense
to me no not in the price of two
thousand I would expect to get God no
not at that price for two thousand
dollars I would expect to get a hooker
with it dude that is one expensive
hooker man you've got some fancy taste
the point about it is okay
tablets are currently costing 350 bucks
there are some tablets from Amazon that
are really even $80 so if that foldable
phone costs anything over a thousand
bucks forget it it's DOA that's my
opinion
enjoy your hooker man
remember it's Erick or a of the beads
that's it for the pocket now daily recap
