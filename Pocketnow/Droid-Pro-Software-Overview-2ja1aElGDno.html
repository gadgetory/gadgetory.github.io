pocket now calm and so far we've unboxed
the droid pro and we've given you a look
at the hardware of the droid pro now
what would an overview be if we didn't
take a look at the software so let's dig
in alright as promised we are back and
it's time to take a look at the software
on the droid pro now one of the main
things that should be sticking out to
you almost right away is actually the
implementation of the motorola blur
custom user interface that Motorola has
developed here it's something that they
actually do not advertise on the
packaging but it is here and that's
actually going to show right in this
menu down here you're going to have the
up arrow which will bring up the menu
but once you actually swipe side to side
you're going to see those typical blur
icons which will bring you to the
different home screens actually pop
right up now blur may or may not be for
you and this device it's actually a
pretty good combination because if you
are a business user who may travel a lot
it's going to allow you to get your work
done get your business done throughout
the day and then on your off time
whether it be at night maybe on breaks
maybe even during a workday or on the
weekends whatever it may be you're going
to be able to bring in that social
networking and that fun aspect as well
which is what Blair is there to do so
this does really give you the best of
both worlds in that case to show you one
main difference that Blair has at least
on this device compared to many other
devices is going to be actually the
color scheme of the menu now as you'll
see many of the froyo devices this is
actually an android 2.2 so it is a froyo
device it's very colorful when you go to
the settings menu this is just a typical
black and white very plain and simple
keep it straightforward but keep it
happening and that's really what this is
doing right here once again it's black
and white no color whatsoever no fancy
icons just very simple whatever it may
be and just to confirm that actual
software version will let down to the
about phone and we'll show you the
android version 2.2 which will confirm
the froyo implementation here now by
implementing blair over the android
operating system you have the ability to
not only add the android widgets but
Motorola's own widgets as well so if
actually scroll over here these are all
examples of those widgets as you can see
we can actually press this here and we
will go to motorola widgets and you can
see what we have to offer many different
widgets that you really have not seen
before if you've never experienced Blair
but let's say you want to go back to
that experience that you're used to you
can go to your Android widgets and add
those typical widgets as well now
there's a few other very cool but very
useful features on the droid pro that we
want to point out that you typically
don't see on other devices now one of
them if we go to the settings menu will
actually be what's called a quick launch
so if we go to the actual applications
menu here we have the quick launch
buttons now in our Hardware overview we
actually pointed out this side button to
you that is user programmable so you can
actually change it to automatically
launch an application of your choosing
in this case we've actually set it to
use Twitter now you can also choose a
search plus a letter to launch that
application so for example we have
calculator as B and calendar as C so
those are just some quick ones that
we've set up and now will actually give
you a dry run of these so we have the
quick launch button here we're going to
go ahead and press that and Twitter
opens right up the snap of a finger it's
very quick now the same thing we're
plausibly hold down the search key and
press C so we'll do that real quick and
press C and there's calendar once again
very snappy and we'll do the same thing
for the calculator and then there you go
the calculator as well if we want to go
back to twitter we can and it's that
fast so navigating through this device
if you are a power user or if you have
to essentially multitask but switch very
frequently this is great for that if you
have an application that you use
multiple times a day on a daily basis
whatever it may be you can set a
shortcut to get to that application very
easily another is going to be a pretty
creative way to actually lock your
device that you don't accidentally press
a shortcut open up an email or make it
even a quick phone call and that's going
to be essentially a pocket protector
tool that they've included on here now
if we actually go to the display menu
and we scroll all the way down you're
going to see in pocket detection so this
basically locks your device
automatically when it's put into your
pocket now we can just guess that this
use is most likely the ambient light
sensor as well as the accelerometer
to detect the position the phone is at
hence upside down dark whatever it may
be we've actually used this before we've
actually tested we've turned it on we
just basically will take the device put
it right in our pocket and it actually
works fairly well so this is a safeguard
if you are someone who forgets to lock
your phone before you put it into your
pocket but pre-installed apps and
abilities are going to be of course the
3g mobile hotspot you can actually use
this device as a mobile hotspot perfect
if you are an on-the-go user who has to
use this device as a connectivity option
for a laptop computer or any computer
for that matter there's also going to be
the deal on a support so you can
actually stream media from this to a
networked TV that supports DLNA or
another device that supports DLNA and
then there's also going to be the quick
to office which is pre-installed which
will let you open up different document
types as well as spreadsheets PDFs that
sort of thing now if you're curious
about the gaming potential we're going
to go ahead and actually open up a trial
game that's Prince tallness device and
that is need for speed shift so will
actually give you a quick run on how the
gaming performs and we'll actually zoom
in a little bit further here so you can
see the screen now one cool thing about
this game is as you crash your car
actually sustains damage you'll see your
windshield scratch your car will
actually have worse handling it will
drive slower that sort of thing and here
we are about to kick things off now this
is going to put you in a first-person
view of the car you have to actually
tilt your screen to steer and what we
found playing this game is the frame
rate tends to suffer and we hope that
you can see this well enough but as
you'll see it does suffer some framerate
slow down from time to time especially
once your windshield does start cracking
which will actually use some nitrous
directly into the wall so you can see
the windshield crack in here we're going
to purposely keep crashing and the
windshield is getting cracked up again
Mike are performing pretty poorly right
now but as you consider as you continue
to sustain damage you will see the
framerate perform worse and worse now of
course this is only a trial on the phone
is brand new so there could be an update
on both the application
the phone itself to fix this and that is
only one game if you're really someone
who just picks up a game every now and
then to kill some time you're really not
going to notice it if you play games on
a more avid basis you will notice that
frame rate slowed down and it may be
frustrating to you overall navigation to
the UI is fairly snappy there are some
slow down periods when it appears that
the device is syncing up and connecting
to the actual server may be pulling down
contact information through the Facebook
or through the Twitter applications to
possibly give you an update on their
status the keyboard however does perform
flawlessly when typing a message there
is no complaints to be had there it does
feel very similar to a blackberry
keyboard however those have been
successful for a reason if you have any
questions about the Droid Pro please
post a comment on either this video or
on the actual article page on pocket now
calm and if we can we will definitely
try and answer your questions if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up and as always thank you very much for
watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
