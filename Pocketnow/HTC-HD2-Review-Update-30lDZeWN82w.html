pocketnow.com and this is a two-month
update on the HTC hd2 I've been using
this device as my daily driver for about
two months now since the review that we
published on pocket now in mid-november
and I want to talk a little bit about
the experience over the last 60 days
talk a little bit about battery life and
performance how the hardware is holding
up and really how the whole experience
has been in using this device of course
you can't get this device in the US yet
you can import it from Europe it will be
on t-mobile in the USA coming up in q1
of 2010 so I can't get us 3G on this
unfortunately which means that internet
browsing can get a little bit slower a
lot slow when I am NOT near Wi-Fi so
just that little disclaimer to start
things off so the hd2 has always been an
amazing device mostly because of its
screen and also because of its speed
it's got the largest touch screen of any
smartphone that you can buy right now
4.3 inches and when people see this
device they say wow that screen is
massive time and time again without fail
that is their response to seeing the HD
2 and it makes a lot of sense and you
would think that with such a large
screen the device would be huge in the
pocket but thanks to a very very thin
width here it's not the case it's quite
a thin device and most people that pick
this up and play with it for a moment
say wow this device is really thin it
doesn't feel that big which is also
quite great
HTC did a great job at spreading the
screen from edge to edge but you can
really appreciate because there's just a
small strip of buttons along the bottom
which really makes the device all about
the screen so let's talk a little bit
about the hardware
I found the hardware durability to be
top-notch perhaps the best I've seen on
any mobile device I am not gentle with
the hd2 I come home I drop it on the
counter I put it in a pocket where there
may be a key I don't use a case I don't
use a screen protector and yet the
hardware shows no sign of wear and tear
yet I cannot find a scratch on this HD 2
we're gonna walk around it in the second
maybe you can but it's holding up very
very well extremely high build
on the hd2 which is nice to see and I
think that's because it's reusing the
device has real materials the back is
actually real metal so it doesn't
scratch easily it takes a lot to scratch
real metal then you have this rubbery
coating on the top and the bottom which
gives it a good in hand feel and then
the front is glass 100% real glass if I
get a key and tap against the screen you
can hear kind of that pinging sound and
another thing about the screen is that
it does a really good job at warding off
smudges and fingerprints it's got an
anti-smudge coating I did not clean the
screen of this device before filming the
video and you can see that there are
hardly any smudges on the screen even
though I've made several calls today
I've held it up to my greasy face and
nothing has happened to the screen in
terms of getting filled with
fingerprints which really makes a big
difference when you're using the device
because you're not having to constantly
clean it off one thing I did notice is
that the buttons here on the bottom have
a little bit of wiggle to them which is
really not that big of a deal I was
afraid that that may cause lint and
debris to get trapped behind the buttons
but that hasn't happened yet as you can
see the buttons are completely clean but
what you do discover is that this is
actually not five separate buttons it's
one panel of buttons speaking of lint
and debris another problem with a lot of
smartphones out there is that the the
edges don't come all the way or the
screen doesn't go all the way to the
edges so you get debris over here the
hd2 is clean very nice
okay so let's turn on the device to talk
a little bit about the software
experience and sort of the battery life
I've been getting and the performance
I'm running a stock rom this is version
1.4 8 it's pretty much the same ROM that
shipped with the device when I got it
it's running windows mobile 6.5 build 21
8 6 9 gonna turn on the device and again
the response that I get when people look
at this phone is wow that screen is huge
and it really is it's really an
amazingly huge screen and of course it
is capacitive touch so it requires the
lightest bit of pressure to get it to
operate which is very very nice most
where all of Windows Mobile devices
previous to the HD to use a resistive
touch screen meaning you have to use
pressure to get it to operate even
though the resistive touch screens have
gotten a lot better
festive touchscreen on the HD 2 is
fantastic and it also has multi-touch so
if we slide over to say photos and video
and we go to a picture and pinch to zoom
we get multi-touch touch just like you
would get on an iPhone and it's very
precise it's very sensitive it works
quite well and it also works in the web
browser which helps tremendously I've
been really enjoying the HTC Sense UI
which is really just an evolution of
touchflo 3d they gave it a new name to
sort of correspond with what they're
doing on Android the Sense UI means that
you get these colorized icons you get
additional panels along the bottom you
also get this gorgeous weather animation
so the device knows where you are of
course and it will show you the weather
based on the weather conditions and we
can go into what the weather demo to see
what these all would look like so when
it's raining you get a windshield wiper
go across the screen went snowing
there's frost on the screen I can tell
you that the weather animation doesn't
have much of a purpose for me but I like
to see it anyway I don't say oh look
it's snowing and I look out the window
and it's snowing it's not like that it's
more so like hey there's this really
cool animation going on on my main
screen I'm not gonna do much work on my
main screen so it's not distracting but
it's nice to have that's another nice
thing about the homescreen on the HTC
hd2 with this version of sense so you
get these Quick Links so these three
things I do quite often I call my
girlfriend I go to Opera Mobile and I
enter an email very quick ways to access
all of that and of course you can fill
this up with many different items here
that you can quickly action on which is
quite nice something that I found a
little bit annoying is that the hd2 does
not come with the HTC task manager in
the upper right corner that you find on
many HTC devices of course you can get
this from XD developers but out of the
box it doesn't come with that so what
you may end up have happening is that
lots of programs are being built up in
the in the RAM and while the hd2 has a
tremendous amount of system ram 448
megabytes which is more than any mobile
device that i've ever I've ever tested
sometimes the device gets a little bit
slow and I think it's because a backward
background
or tasks is taking up a lot of resources
that said on day to day operation the
one gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor is really fast and it doesn't
lag like I said there are times where
things get slow I've noticed it
especially in the Twitter peak
application
I haven't loaded on a third-party
Twitter application because this is
because this is quite good for what I
need it for but at times Twitter peak
does get a little bit slow and it's nice
to have the integration into the main
screen in terms of battery life I've
been getting a good day and a half of
battery life out of this just quite
remarkable considering how larger the
screen is so at the end of the day on
average I have about 35% battery life
left sometimes around 40 sometimes
around 20 depending on how much I used
it on that particular day so that's
quite good a lot better than the iPhone
that's for sure which often times for me
when I use the iPhone I can't get
through a full day without charging it
so in the last two months
I've really stayed impressed with the
HTC hd2 for me it kind of represents the
ideal device it's got amazing hardware
extremely high quality hardware with a
gorgeous screen enough eye candy but not
too much eye candy and the productivity
that I really need to be as productive
as possible when I am mobile it runs
Windows Mobile it can multitask it can
run a lot of apps it can be tweaked and
hacked to your heart's content
and all while looking really really good
along the way and staying fast with such
a fast processor and a ton of RAM so I'm
really happy with the HD - I wish AT&amp;amp;T
would get this so that I could use it on
AT&amp;amp;T 3G but t-mobile customers should be
happy because it's coming to t-mobile in
quarter 1 2010 so that was a look in an
update on the HD 2 and the experience
that we've been having with it that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
