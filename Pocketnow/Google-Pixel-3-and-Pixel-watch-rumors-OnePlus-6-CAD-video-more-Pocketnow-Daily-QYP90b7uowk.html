time they include more than just two
phones we get more renders of the iPhone
se to 2018 that confirmed the new
features and get more additional renders
with a one plus six showing off the
complete package I'm Jaime meddling that
I do asked me to make a joke about the
shirts I found the coolest one and if
you're interested in any in the
description and in the comments you will
find the link for 10% off
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you want
to get yourself a new iPhone 10 there
are buy one get one free deals in
t-mobile almost you get $700 off if you
buy an iPhone 10 which pretty much
leaves you paying 450 which is
definitely a lot better than paying a
thousand bucks but again it's not
technically buy one get one free then
learn more about it in the description
now let's talk about the samsung galaxy
note 9 as we hear that there will be an
early launch and apparently this phone
will bring a couple of differences
according to trusted sources the first
one is it's 2 millimeters shorter then
the current galaxy note which is great
the no date is it is a large phone and
second I don't know how that's gonna
happen with the rumours of the batteries
getting larger but most important aside
from the early launch is apparently the
fact that it won't bring the on display
fingerprint scanner
it seems that Samsung is going to stick
with this a little longer hopefully
there are other changes we'll see now
for those of you that are wondering
exactly what the oneplus 6 will look
like yes I will be at the event in
London and it's gonna be rather
interesting as I thought that it was
gonna look like the ar-15 Pro and the
CAD render images that just emerged make
it look like if it looks different at
least from the back I mean it seems that
the notch display is coming but then the
back has vertical cameras pretty much
the original leaks that I considered to
be fake are real if this is the case
we'll see another way goes once case
makers get their hands on a design you
can pretty much say it's close to final
iPhone se - once again
case renders yesterday we saw the phone
from the front no touch ID so apparently
face eye
with a smaller notch but today we
finally get renter's of the back where
we see full glass it could be that it
does bring wireless charging
there is no fingerprint scanner back
there to be seen so hey I mean it seems
that this is the way it's going and
finally the most interesting nuisance
they have to do with the Google pixel 3
pixel 3 XL and the famous tipster Evan
Blass who claims that we're getting
these two phones in the fall along with
a SmartWatch from running where OS bear
in mind Evan is really good about leaks
I've known him for years but apparently
we've got other sources claiming that
there are three smartwatches code-named
ling Triton and Sartain what exactly are
we getting here and did I pronounce
these names correctly I don't know let
me know in the comments but in today's
question let me know are you looking
forward to the pixel 3 pixel 3 Excel and
smartwatches because oh my god you know
I've tested every phone this year it's
very hard to pick a good phone sorry to
pick the best phone out of all the
products but the pixel to excel
continues to be one of the best it was a
