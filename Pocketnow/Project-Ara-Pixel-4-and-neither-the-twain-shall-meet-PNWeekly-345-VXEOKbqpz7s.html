have our guests for this week David
Emmel of course you know I'm from
Android authority how has been how has
been your week it's kind of late
tomorrow but we can but we can't confirm
nor deny now based upon stuff he's been
he just said I do have a quick caveat or
disclaimer before we get into the show
proper for this week I want to note that
the Galaxy S 10 unpacked event is coming
up next week and we're gonna have a full
show dedicated to our first hand
impressions
be more than likely yeah well that means
that you'd be on the show again - yeah
let's do it
so as not to spoil any conversations you
can head over to packing.com slash
podcast jump into the episodes rundown
and find links to the rumor roundup for
all of the specs that you expect that
you can't expect rather you can also
read into our first look of what we'll
be covering at MWC 2019 as well we'll be
updating that post right up until we fly
out to Barcelona which is in like just a
little actually in some what week
literally a week from yeah all of that
and more available right now at
pocketnow.com slash podcasts and now
that we have that out of the way let's
get into this week's stories now just
like what last week we are kind of
moving into a more let's say a little
bit more focused format for the podcast
so we have a number of stories here
we're just gonna be talking at length
about all of these things it's not like
a huge amount like 20 or anything like
that we decided to just sort of focus
them down a little bit our first segment
for this episode has to do with Apple
there's a lot of news coming out of
Apple all right my question to start off
I know your answer any of you guys ever
used the air pods I borrowed them from a
friend to use while I was editing a
video once okay you know you wanted to I
try them out so uh I keep forgetting
this guy's name I'll remember soon but
somebody left them in my Airbnb one oh
and I had to fool I had to bring them
and I'm like would you mind if I go in
my try I did I hated them and that's the
end of story
okay that's whiter oh it was slider and
that's whiter yeah I I'm kind of
shameful in admitting that I use them
way more than I thought like as far as
just the product itself it's well
thought out I actually think that
they're decent sounding and I'm very
much stronger you say decent but they're
super convenient and they even work on
Android phones and I was like all right
there you go I'm down I'll use them but
they are hardly anticipated to have I
mean they're the update to the air pods
are really hotly anticipated not only
that but also some sort of wireless
charging some sort of wireless charging
solution for them air power is it
supposed to be called but
surely you're not going to be seeing any
of this hardware at what is supposed to
be a March 25th event
she's a software event right that's what
they're kind of thinking and we do have
a couple of stories regarding that yeah
so the what do you think that March 25
or what would you what do you wish would
be announced at the March 25th event
anyway you know I have to admit that I
don't keep up on Apple stuff that much I
mean I do but like I all I saw was like
a story stream on Twitter about how
there's a March 25th event and how it's
probably software and then how did
they--how did they even I didn't catch
wind of how they even announced I didn't
either I don't get it they haven't sent
out invites yet there's nothing it's
there that's what they're assuming but
but I don't get it it's just they're
March event has always been their
education event to a certain degree last
year cheap iPads yes so will we get our
cheap iPads usually anything that's
oriented towards education but then the
speculation is that there won't be any
iPads here because the rumor is early we
were gonna get the new iPad Mini the
renew the renewed iPad which would get
less bezels pretty much the iPad 10.5
being used for educational purposes yeah
that that those were the rumors and that
and the new air pods now the rumors is
we're not getting any of that I doubt
they would but the thing is like they've
been rumored to be released at every
event that's happened in past six like
if there was any time to do it now is
already too late yeah you know what I
mean so many people enjoy the air pods
they became the subject of a meme
recently oh they're hella mean really oh
yeah I don't follow them I just the
memes are pretty good it's like people
will start Facebook events called like
airpot air pod owners Meetup uh-huh what
feel left out
as a meme though and so then everyone
shows up wearing air pods and it looks
ridiculous Oh everybody walks in wearing
q-tips how yeah the day they got
released I remember I was in San
Francisco and I was walking around the
city and I was just like oh my god we're
robots
now everyone's wearing these things the
only one that I saw was
is if somebody was wearing air pods you
just immediately assumed that they can't
hear anything so so like crazy stuff
would be happening behind them like you
know emergency situations and they'd be
completely oblivious I was the only meme
that I kind of saw which may not be too
far from the truth but they're not very
good at noise like like ambient noise
cancellation they're not really meant
for them they're not really good at
anything
no no can I can I say that a reliable
connection can I say that unless the
year an Apple user unless you're into
that ecosystem if you have an iPhone
they're really cool because you
literally just open them and if you've
never picked so pairing here's the thing
like I yeah yeah no that that's the w1
chip oh did the moonship yeah no the
Terminator - chip no but like okay so I
have to hand it to Apple there are
certain things like for example right
now I just published daily and it's
literally like I just got the file from
Diego I downloaded it on my iPad I
edited everything on Photoshop the the
mobile version whatever
I then air-dropped it to my Mac in
seconds and published that at that level
of convenience and so grabbing a pair of
air pods of you own any Apple product
like for example because if you put
security on your Apple watch the simple
fact that you open your computer because
you have a passcode on your watch if it
detects that your watch is closed it'll
unlock the computer without your hat but
sometimes it's cool those levels of
conveniences are very hard to describe
but it's what makes people like Apple
products like for example walking and
like if I order anything on an Apple
store and I walk close to it if I'm
getting close to that Apple store I
order something immediately my display
will pop up with the order information
just to walk in and pick my stuff up
dude it's like walking into a Vegas
casino and then you get text messages
for that advertisers I am i ordered a
macbook a couple months a month ago and
I returned it I want it I wanted to make
sure you said that but that order
process was crazy like so I ordered it
right
then I got a call from someone that
night that was like hey we're just from
the Apple Store just making sure you
ordered this and we want to make sure
like it gets to you and it'll be there
within a few days thanks and I was like
okay usually people don't call me when I
order things and then I start getting
text messages every day it was like you
order we'll be there in one day you
ought to be there in 16 hours and it was
just like I got constant text message I
don't get anything really I don't get
any of that maybe it's a new you opted
into something problem yeah maybe but it
was weird I've never bought anything and
then had an updated life span racking up
all call it spam I guess so yeah well
the thing is we have a lot of talk about
spending money especially in places that
maybe we're not supposed to because not
only is Apple trying to like make up a
lot of their revenue in various device
centric ways but as you said March 25
seems like it's going to be a software
event and this is one of the pieces of
news out of there Apple apparently wants
to make it so that new subscriptions and
this is that's what it was yeah so new
subscriptions where you have okay yeah
cuz I know a lot of the stuff in the
show is gonna be somewhat controversial
there's a lot to say about just the sort
of that of the show the nature of these
things so new subscriptions for things
like you've got any examples off the top
of your head New York Times Wired yeah
so maybe let's say $10 a month Apple is
going to make an aggregate of all of
that for the news application on their
iPhones and iPads and all that but if
you're going to subscribe to any one of
these publications through the app Apple
one half of that revenue yeah they want
to literally take 550 percent of the
publishers revenue no that's stupid how
unreal is that that's what irony percent
is unreal I mean I know and that's for
apps like general apps we've got berated
for having 30% on the App Store and
Apple wants 50% and everyone was saying
like Tim Cook's gonna come out
originally and say 50 and then by the
time that event actually happens I'll be
like no what are you touching it's not
50 25 so either way though that's insane
that's like basically you're literally
it's like extortion like you do you want
exposure that like Google News
suddenly taking 50% of all like Google
News has existed forever yeah yeah it's
like them just being like yeah we're
gonna take yeah but the problem is
already the problem with Google News is
you can't pay to get in
yeah that's the difference this Apple
news thing is a subscription it's a
subscription and anybody anybody like if
we want it to be on Apple News we could
if we paid but yeah it's a 150 I hadn't
read into that part 50% like okay so
like I think maybe they could take like
10 but like so you think that the 30 for
general apps is already ridiculous yeah
okay yeah no I'm not I'm not I'm not
refuting I'm not necessarily ridiculous
because like Google Google Apple they're
hosting everything yeah like that all
the developers have to make it but
they're hosting everything they're doing
the in-between so 30 is kind of
reasonable actually it's not that bad
like I'm gonna be it could be a little
bit lower but my 50%
especially for publishers you're already
um freak you save 10 so the service will
get some buck for every subscription to
a news web
ok first subscription for a new service
a new service yeah I would say 10 do you
do I do any of you guys ever get past do
you ever pay to get past those pay walls
on major news websites like that so mmm
I pay for Wired but it's a crazy cheap
it's like it's $10 a year and you get
the magazine hmm what yeah so you get
the magazine every month and you get
unlimited that'd that's cool and there's
no ads on their website if you pay that
on the bonus I'll do that because they
they redid their business model like
last year and Nick Thompson is a veteran
chief he was like we're making less than
$10 per person off ads every year anyway
so if we just have them pay up front and
they get unlimited access with no ads
and the magazine which is super cheap to
print hmm that's like really good value
for the customer and it's a better
experience yeah so and they still gave
you four articles a month for free which
is not that many but but if you're if
you're a junkie for that particular
publication yeah yeah and 10 bucks a
year yeah that by the way I just love
the magazine that's why I got it there
you go listeners and viewers that 10
one thing we were using as an example
really that's just a hypothetical
example like it's not actually $10 a
month for New York Times or anything
like that
with no the yeah what yeah to the New
York Times I think it's like I don't
remember no it's less it's less than 10
but it isn't looks like $6 yeah it's
something crazy like that I was like no
that's too cheap for the quality of
their product right I do yeah for sure
like particularly the New York Times man
like I have a lot of respect for their
work you know I think it's just whether
or not people actually pay for it
because of the nature of the internet
well as a crass way of looking at this
move do you think that this is just
their way of trying to make up for like
lost revenue in there it's it's cut its
kind of nickel and diming right like
it's crazy okay yeah okay so look at it
this way if you're if you want to if you
want to have your product and target
target doesn't buy your product it's
like in Spanish you call it con signal
they will rent you the space where your
product is going to be yeah and they
make a commission over what you sell and
depending on how much you pay is the
placement that you'll have this business
model has existed forever show me this
is the way show me is the monster they
they are because I controlled it they
control the App Store yes this is the
way these Chinese companies are so
popular or so or so powerful
let's face it I mean in the case of
Apple they kind of in they didn't invent
the concept online but iTunes is pretty
much like one of the biggest examples of
success yeah and so I don't mind them
getting a cut because building the
infrastructure to be able to make
something like this rare is significant
and in Apple's case their biggest
benefit like I'm okay with it when it
comes to apps because they own the
platform yeah plus they own the
operating system plus they own
everything if they created the egos they
created the ecosystem they created
everything so in their case it's fine
but is it correct for you to write an
article and then free your heed for the
guy that's going to edit
your article you wrote it you spend time
on it yeah but then the guy that looked
at your article and made sure that the
formatting was right and helped get the
thumbnail on it and then publish it is
it correct for his name to be on the
byline no cuz his job is only to serve
the purpose of publishing it but it's
your work rayray so why should I'm not
saying that he shouldn't get credit for
your work I'm saying that it's still
your article yeah yeah so should he get
50% of the credit no no because it's
your article the curator should not be
able to take half yeah of that revenue
from the actual intellectual property
right exactly
Yeah right it's it's like apples doing
very little work in this case also the
fact that the Apple News platform has
existed for a long time yeah it's just
like Google News has also existed for a
long time and they're just reusing their
platform to try to get an additional
revenue stream and like publishers are
already hurting and I'm pretty sure they
know that thing about it is publishers
okay publishers haven't really figured
out something better that's the problem
yeah that is the biggest problem it's
been how many years I mean think about
it Steve Jobs was still alive and I for
me it's like when he came on board and
he showed iBooks and newsstand yes he
showed off newsstand for the iPad when
when the iPad 2 launched and he was like
we really want to protect the New York
Times and we really want to protect the
Wall Street Journal because we don't
want to become a nation of vloggers
that's what he said
we won't you don't want to turn into a
nation of bloggers and I get it like you
know I'm not a journalist
they are so from for me it's it's I get
the point but why get 50% of the cut
yeah well different visions for
different times clearly I'll tell you
this much here's the thing publishers
are not obligated to use Apple and I
wish that publishers would be like you
know what Apple no I get it like I but
I'm not obligated to have my product and
what if I mean why is it now these
publications because you and I are
outraged right now the question is if
they're outraged because if I would
write outrage from my content to be I'll
give you an example rnm cn1 sorry
that they've reached out a couple of
times with them they're like we've got
the sponsorship opportunity and we're
gonna have no we've got this like
platform and it's gonna be really cool
and the revenue split is 50/50 no
questions asked and I'm like I just
don't respond to the email yeah and then
three weeks later they'll write me and
they'll be like we offer visits that we
offer this and what's up and I'm like
yeah I write them I just respond you
said no questions asked Zend yes I I'm
not I'm sorry it's my work right yeah
yeah and you're just getting half of it
for are you serious yeah
I'm like no so I wish that publications
would do that yeah they would be like no
I'm sorry Apple it's great what you did
for the music business but what you did
for the music business has not worked in
the publication business yeah well let's
talk about entertainment then because
not only are subscriptions on news
publications being put into question but
think of it this way
Netflix stars Showtime their video
content
HBO now perhaps imagine going into one
application on an Apple device where you
pay one flat fee and you have access to
all of them so what would the flat fee
be is the question that is a good
question yes but that's a great 30 like
20 a month or something
I don't know because like some of these
are already how much does HBO now HBO
now is already well yeah yeah but they
would have to make a deal yeah that's
it's volume versus price at them but the
problem is it's it's it's a it's a very
different thing it's like how are how is
that revenue going to be split as the
question yeah well that's the thing
Apple apparently if March 25th is going
to be when they announced this kind of
stuff
Apple is actually trying to do this they
are trying to get video subscription
services to opt into a single
subscription model where you basically
have one login one tap pay and you get
all access to all of these ones how
dependable TV right so depending on
matters yeah depending on who the
partners actually are yeah you don't
know what content yes this is the
problem but there's a thing there Apple
is asking for 30 percent from the video
subscription services there 30 percent
30 the same that
get from apps I just don't see how this
would work right because like people
like Netflix and like Netflix raise
their their price by a dollar last year
yeah if they had to write like HBO like
most people on HBO watched like Game of
Thrones and that's kind of it and they
still pay $10 and bill more well and so
like if advil takes 30% like I don't
think that HBO or Netflix is gonna be
like oh yeah the extra volume we're
gonna get is gonna make up for that 30%
I can't see I can't see a lot of those
people doing that especially like
Netflix because they pay a crapload of
money not only for Netflix originals
they pay they paid so much money for
those originals but they also have to
license all of the movies that they have
on their platform at any time from the
distributors like they pay a lot for
that
I don't here's the thing I think that if
Apple continues down their path mm-hmm
Amazon is gonna lay out devourer yeah
cuz I pay one flat fee
yeah it's called Amazon Prime yep it's a
hundred well now it's like 120 bucks oh
you haven't paid in like three years
because I complain about shipments ever
so an extra month a year yeah but that's
a really good example prime video if you
think about it prime is what Apple is
trying to be because Prime has finally
for it yeah because they have short
times they have HBO they have stars
right so they actually have all they
actually are like I don't mind paying a
hundred and twenty dollars a year yeah
year ah year yeah and so you get prime
music you get Kindle books you get a
library yeah you get the Kindle library
ouch but you oh you also get Kindle
firsts you get prime video you get today
shipping you get two day shipping on
everything and it's three bucks or a
block site at most to get stuff the next
day your San Francisco and that's two
hours for free exactly dude you walk
into Whole Foods
yeah and it's cheaper how is Apple gonna
compete with that yeah is the question
and you walk into an Apple store and
your phone shows your order
yes but it doesn't help in any way
because there's still expensive a lot
like it like if Apple came up with a
service called Apple Prime for example
and you know it would be a limited
application Apple ripe biggest problem
okay this is the biggest problem that
Apple has that I think that they can't
see past yes they have a wall walled
garden but they have a product ecosystem
that stretches like four devices yeah
like this is the biggest problem they
have they have a watch they have the
phone they have the iPad and they have
the Mac but then then that's part of the
topic the topic is also within this what
if Apple would decide to actually start
selling all this stuff
what do you mean selling iMessage to
Android now so you buy the phone and
then you have to subscribe to get in it
like that's no it's like if you're an
iPhone if you're an iPhone you get it
but if but of you but if you have an
Android phone you can pay so that's part
of the rumor somewhat - yeah yeah for
those blue bubbles No
okay so you deal with my green bubble I
have multiple people that like my blue
bubbles make them like me less I don't
care I never even because I've never
owned an iPhone well okay first of all I
understand the mentality I yeah i
haven't used iMessage enough to actually
be upset with all that stuff yeah I know
Google Voice so I can't use iMessage but
I don't I don't understand these people
who see a coloring get a kiss yeah yeah
the racist exactly okay before we get
too far into that though are there are a
couple of device things that are coming
up actually one main thing
so apparently Apple even though there
are rumors that the next iPhones are
going to have USB C as its port the
whole not gonna do yes and that's the
other thing it's probably not gonna
happen but in in the rumor of the 2019
iPhones adopting USB see there was the
hope that the charging brake would also
get update to provide fast charging its
no no no 2020
well here's I want you to quick
reactions to this thought it's because
Apple wants to cut the cost of providing
peripherals and accessories see try it
tried it you remember the time when HTC
decided they weren't gonna include the
wall plug the the brick they will just
no able Nintendo did that too
yeah with the with the 3ds they didn't
include a charter that's true we assumed
that everyone had a DS before so they
didn't know that they didn't assume that
was just this morning goodbye effort 20
hours in great PR jargon yeah I I have a
question for you guys some so here's the
thing I remember we had this podcast I
didn't know where we were but we did pop
we did it one of these podcasts in a
hotel room a few months like in London
maybe a year ago London yeah that was at
my altar oh is it an October I think we
talked about I was a five-person caster
yeah yeah I think we talked about
whether or not I'm kokand would drop
this is before they launched the iPad
pro with us BC yeah I was very surprised
that they moved to us BC personally
because they make so much freaking money
an awesome licensing from laning yeah
that I never ever thought they would
move any of their products off of
lightning I thought that they would add
lightning ports to their max and still
have you as VC on their max but also
have like one or two lightning jacks
that's what I was thinking to think
there should be a lightning port on top
of the standard well this lady's just
like reversed USBC right yes same
throughput but a different shape yeah
and that they own and so they makes like
every time a case manufacturer makes a
case that utilizes that Jack they gotta
pay Apple yeah how they make so much
money from that like I'm surprised that
they even moved off the iPad because
they don't want they don't money off of
products they want money off of your
subscription they want they want they
want profits out of everything no oh no
I get like get free money from a case
manufacturer like why wouldn't you know
right well I'd feel like they get that
anyway it's just a matter of like like
one
category of product is just not but they
still make money on everything from the
air point of view like what is what is
the point what is the benefit to them of
moving to us PC I here's the thing that
is a good question I yeah like in the
case of the Mac they what is the point
of the Mac they moved away from Mac safe
you know thunderbolt which was pretty
much only an apple thing they moved the
way out of all of this for you know
Thunderbolt 3 and USBC to a certain
degree it's brought a lot more power to
the Mac I feel that it's something we
haven't seen I feel that the rumors were
that we were gonna get an iPad OS with
the launch of this iPad pro my thoughts
are that the product was ready the
operating system wasn't ready they
couldn't just go back and fix it so
let's just dump iOS on this thing again
while the wall the software Wally a
while the software is ready I think that
Apple couldn't get something
enlightening that USBC hell but but I
feel but I feel that you we won't be
able to see it until that operate
exactly that there's that or maybe
because they own lightning which is
through a USB see Jack mm-hmm maybe they
eventually want to move over their
products over because they know
everyone's adopting lightning like a lot
of laptop manufacturers are putting
better do our Thunderbolt Thunder I'm
sorry that's all not lightning care yeah
a lot of laptop manufacturers are
putting Thunderbolt in their laptops now
and Thunderbolt is owned by Apple
no it's an Intel thing yeah Thunderbolt
is Intel 5 no that's intriguing
lightning and thunder both we need a new
one like rockslide Thunderbolt that's
the reason why I always connected pcs
don't have Thunderbolt what waters it's
an Intel thing we should be caught water
gun until engineer you should know this
alright last one before we go to our
break okay just uh this is about iPhone
users but I'm a part of my my gut
feeling is that everybody is guilty of
this
right now over the last two years of
smartphones just getting better and
better and better has your app have your
app purchases increased now they've
become zero really yeah mine have become
zero what I spend a lot on our services
oh I thought you I thought you're gonna
say in-app purchase they bought a fine
like being Spotify and YouTube TV are
like I guess about five or two dollars a
month Oh baby
well I'm the family plan owner well
apparently 36% more in 2018 is the
amount that people were spending on apps
for iPhone users iPhones yes oh so that
could be in that purchases maybe but
let's look at the breakdown more than
half of it was spent on games I was I
was about to say like there has been
this like resurgence of gaming mobile
gaming because of things well probably
one of the biggest hits that one of the
biggest hits for Apple was having
fortnight on the iPhone before any other
mobile blood I read a story two days ago
that fortnight mobile and iPhone makes a
million dollars a day there yeah
purchases there yeah so everyone else
probably saw that and was like we need a
chunk of that well so that's the reason
why there's even more thought that that
event will be all about services and
software but anyway real quick more than
half was spent on games eight dollars
went to entertainment five dollars went
to music like an increase over the
number of years four dollars and 40
cents to social networking which I think
should be higher personally and
networking social networking apps what
kind of money could be made off social
networking apps oh you mean like buying
things on Instagram maybe or a door or
like add a vast majority of it is either
entertainment or lifestyle so and note
that none of this said news I mean like
maybe because they've made their price
yeah but but you can't make in-app
purchases on Netflix you have to in it
yeah yeah they'll pull which I think
it's the smartest thing it's like
you can build your app you can provide
your services just pull yank people out
of the app take them to the browser have
them pay from the on the browser and
that's it because life's connected it
feels like I'm not paying that company I
it doesn't really matter I mean it's
it's one of those things where it's like
again in the case of Netflix where their
profits are like so cutthroat yeah you
know think about it I just I feel it 30%
is like come on it's a it's a lot and
and it's it's 30% and they're not
allowed to charge differently over what
they charge in their own store yeah so
it's like if it's 999 or 1199 in their
store that Apple I'm not sure about this
but I kind of get the feeling that Apple
forces them to to keep that same number
on their store but then they have to get
30 percent in the cut probably so I
think I think here's the difference on
that on the App Store app store if Apple
did not provide an app store these
developers would have literally nowhere
to host their apps they'd have to host
them on XDA or some or something right
yeah yeah yeah no I think yeah I'm again
that's why I'm saying in the case of the
app store I'm totally four or more to
your point earlier Amazon had an app
store Hey
yeah oh he had a Kindle yeah well they
still have an Amazon App Store you have
to sideload apps on exactly iPhone from
but that is still the alternative Amazon
comes back again
I'm just saying I'm okay with them
charging 30% for the App Store app store
because without a platform you can't
sell your product yeah Netflix has an
incredibly established platform they
don't need Apple mm-hm and so it apples
saying give us 30% and we'll include you
in this thing they have no incentive to
do that because like most of their
markets saturated anyway and everyone
already has the Netflix app from the
Apple App Store mmm you know all right
well I want to make sure that we spend
quite a bit of time on our next few
topics but first we're gonna head to our
break thank you so much for listening to
the pocket not weekly we certainly want
to be making the show if it weren't for
you but we'd certainly appreciate
knowing a little bit more about you so
that we can match you with better
advertisers to talk to you that way we
can continue making the show better
again for you you can take a 10-minute
survey by heading to pod survey comm
slash pocket now we
link your answers to your email address
and we won't spam your inbox plus anyone
who takes the survey has a chance to get
a $100 Amazon gift card
that's pod survey calm / pocket now we
really appreciate your support so first
off saying this very innocently and then
we'll get into the actual meat of the
story how would you feel if the next
pixel phone was modular oh boy how would
you feel about the modular phone coming
at all at this point we're getting
foldables we're getting punch holes what
mod is modular even still a thing I
don't care anymore
I would I would not mind a modular
product if it were like that rumor from
LG were there's the phone and you can
attach another screen to it to extend
its functionality whenever you want to
sort of a little mod no one like that
but there was no moto mod screen ya know
in the case of the moto mods I think
that the design was not practical like
but that's just the way I see it it did
back them into a corner because it was
just that that's the way it has to be
designed everything has to adhere to
that exact same back yeah exactly to
make it compatible well a patent had
become too light that Google filed
despite killing project aura back in
2016 that a modular phone that basically
was oh yeah the diagram is probably
being shown right now as Jules is
probably putting it up there just
basically a screen a bezel list screen
phone that can be put into certain
certain let's say cases and certain bits
of it can be attached to and whatnot
and article an article was coming out
saying that this patent shows that the
next pixel could be a modular how does
this patent show that and now here we
are really patent things constantly yes
so that if any point in the future at
any given time before anybody else yeah
they just it's 50 years that they get to
own it for copyright yeah so original
chance I can tell that Jules picked this
story for us not just because of the
interesting topic of the modular
phone and the patent what else but also
but also because he's here also gave me
an article citing a very a very in-depth
and just very opinionated article by
Stephen no well yeah that one was
referenced as well so we'll give a shout
out to Stephen over at nine to five
but David wrote a critic oh yeah was it
the article that he wrote about that's
how that is our Eagle he wrote about the
fake news that's basically clickbait
yeah because it says here exclusive yeah
Google pixel for could be a fully
customizable public modular yeah yeah so
it's it's a patent guys it is a diagram
of something that is conceptual yeah it
is the LA Auto Show it is a concept car
you will never drive yeah until someone
finally decides to actually make it but
you don't know that by looking at the
concept car you get fifty years on a
patent like of course you're gonna like
have a cool idea and then patent it
because like then maybe in ten years the
technology will be there but that's the
reason why we have infomercials for
freaking crazy products that don't make
any sense there's some one patent today
but that kind of led me to some
questions I wanted to ask you guys I
mean we all work for news news
organizations let's say news websites
the fact that the sensationalism of this
article was so blatantly overblown for
the sake of clicks and let 'ln and mind
you that particular article over at wait
a second but it was written by David no
no David a reaction David wrote a
reaction article to a t3 article this
was the t3 article well let's just stay
away from BG are you will not believe
this so like what would yeah it's just
that we we all in some ways think about
just a way to get the click onto the
news article or onto the YouTube video
YouTube is obviously like the reigned
supreme in terms of clickbait
but I don't know I just I just wonder
what you guys's reactions
or to this type of stuff that is
actually happening within deep parts of
our industry because it's easy to over
blow speculations easy to over blow
leaks and I'm proud to say that you know
every every every personality and
publication that is represented in this
podcast right now is not guilty of that
right you go for the anti I'll go for
the pro your pro yeah I'm gonna let you
guys do that that battery is about to
die so keep talking there's gonna be a
little bit of darkness on the video so
our sorry viewers but we'll get into it
why don't we pause it here and start
again so we could do that too yeah
okay David you were just gonna about
that you gently did it you were just
about to get into your side of this I
don't know III showed her to actually
bring it up bring this topic up because
I know it's like it's like walking it's
a hot lava in a way well it's a
difficult topic but actually very
recently I don't know if you follow like
all the people here and in our club
industry thing on Twitter but it's
actually been kind of a hot discussion
recently with a lot of the Android
bloggers people because specifically
because their sites that have been
bringing up things that are like
creating these sensationalists news hit
pieces that are just like so obviously
untrue but it's so obviously tailored to
get your click and then you read it and
then you're just like why did I just
wasted last 10 seconds of my life
reading that obvious I mean the obvious
things are like there's like a lot of
Forbes articles that are written about
this which is kind of sad because Forbes
used to be a very notable publication
but they also hire for hire people and
this is something that was interesting
to me that I thought about recently
because Steven Holl and David Roddick
whoever in this conversation on Twitter
and they were talking about how it's
almost like it's almost like a dirty
word or like not OK for us to bring up
the fact that there's a lot of like fake
news in our industry and we just kind of
don't talk about it right because like
if we do talk about it it just seems
like not ok but like we should bring
that up because like there's a reason
that like our industry is like not taken
seriously as like legit news because
like because there is a lot of like
sensationalism and fake news and that's
the nature of Internet news media
obviously you made the he made the point
earlier about about Steve Jobs saying
you know we're becoming a nation of
bloggers and all that yeah which I you
know I have to say do you know I sorry
to interrupt you yeah ok the I just want
to make the point that I I see a
distinction between 5
news and clickbait like if you are
literally reporting the news then but in
in a way that you're gonna get click
like but that's the headline in my in my
eyes that's the headline is the way that
you get somebody in right and as long as
you're not blatantly making things up
right because the the headline for this
article could have easily have been
Google files patent for potential for
future modular or smartphone I think the
term the modular smartphone is enough
but they had to put google pixel for and
exclusive yeah yeah so this is this is
where it gets kind of weird like even at
the end they could have said Google
files patent for potential modular
smartphone could it be the pixel for
yeah that could have been
clickbait obviously is that the worst
thing ever
I don't know saying it's an exclusive
and then saying okay I have if they
would listen let's read the title
exclusive google pixel for could be a
fully customizable modular smartphone I
feel like that's misleading also the by
the the what was the term for that again
the the pre I don't know the term anyway
right below it it says looks like the
missing link between project our
subjects thank you looks like the
missing link between project ara ara and
moto mods that's all that's all that's
all opinion being disguised as yeah so I
know I don't feel the title is that
misleading it's not that I'm trying to
defend the guy it's just okay if you've
got a patent you're literally a year
away from the next variant listen it's
not just them like go to almost like we
we're in the the problem with our
industry is it's funny how much I get
comments on the daily where it's like
this is rumor now they but what else are
we gonna how many we truly we see
they're like like like like and
particularly in in are okay so we don't
have this like we don't have the venture
capital
nor do we have like this sea of
reporters we don't go to CES with a
truck full of reporters and a team and
so the problem one of the biggest
difficulties in the way we cover the
news is we're a team of a few people and
as a team of a few people we don't have
that infrastructure to do the
double-checking
you know the whole journalistic portion
of it plus because we don't have an army
of people that's going to be reporting
the news immediately there's a slight
possibility that you're gonna end up
catching the news until later and so
what's the thing I tell you guys every
time the podcast is published I'm like
that title is not seo-friendly oh and I
and I completely agree with that that's
just like the name of the game one it's
it's so we want that we kind of didn't
create the Beast the Beast is called
Google it's called search yeah and it's
called it's it's the whole what's the
problem the problem is that lately ad
revenue is like this is such a big
conversation and revenue has dropped
significantly and people are not making
the same money that they were making
we've we've seen a couple of
publications recently being sold yeah in
and out it's just becoming a common
thing yeah and so you know a lot of
people are being forced to do pull of
BGR which is you will not believe what
happened to this person and it's like
reading the Chum box at the end of each
article all the time yeah you will not
believe the IQ of Donald Trump's son you
know stuff like that and so it's not
that I'm trying to defend them I just
feel that the that the root cause of the
problem is not lack of ethics yeah I
think yeah I think that's a very valid
point I think that it's not lack of
ethics I will give you an example there
have been a couple of Fridays where I'm
like it's a pattern and this is like the
only hot news and I'm at cut out and I
need to film the daily and so it's like
I don't put that in the title nor do I
but at some point I'm like I kind of
like what's the purpose of me reporting
on this yeah if I don't give it an angle
that will to a certain degree you know
provide any sort of value proposition
that that's the thing and so a lot of
what we do is interpretation as well we
read a lot of editorial content that's
opinion based so I do I I do agree I
don't like the whole exclusive part yeah
fine
that one is fine that's an exclusive to
the US pen also that patent was
published at the Patent Office March
31st of last year so had they gotten
their hands on us at the time it could
have been like the pixel three is gonna
be the modular phone which i think is
the thing just jumping into something to
create almost something out of nothing
is my whole thing I'm an advocate as
you've heard me say back when I was
working with you was that if you if you
can't figure out what's important about
this sometimes that's the story it is
valid enough to say guys there's
probably nothing here but it's
interesting to look at this diagram you
see what could have been can you read
the headline again exclusive Google
pixel four could be a fully customizable
modular smartphone yeah literally six of
those words are unsubstantiated so I
think the problem with this headline
though is that it doesn't even mention
the patent well the article itself just
not to discredit the actual work that
was put into this I says Steven over at
9 to 5 said some serious work was put
into making this one patent expound into
so many different things that none of us
know anything about come on there's a
website called Apple Insider and that's
all it does yeah I'm sure that's listen
it's just that's what they do like there
are industries built around this and I
love you know there are certain cases of
certain leaks there are certain
quote-on-quote like leakers that are
famous and they will literally they
won't type in this this product could no
they were like this well we will have
this yeah this phone we'll have that
yeah then there's the other problem
going back to the topic of where is
where is the ethics issue I mean there
are certain leaks and we know this there
are certain leaks that are out of the
control of companies there are others
that are controlled yeah come on yeah
yeah easily yeah there are others that
are controlled and obviously well you
know what's gonna happen if you get the
exclusive what are you gonna do you
gonna choose to see you
you won't report it right the biggest
problem is our industry even if you know
even if there is so much happening very
often there's a good chunk of the year
we're all we survive on are rumors
rumors leaks that's and speculation it's
and speculation so it's it's a very
difficult topic it's just it's very hard
for me to take either side because I
understand the publications that are
struggling I to a certain degree
understand others that I've had to turn
into more click Beatty I mean come on
man this looks like reality TV to a
certain degree yeah it's like it's like
it's like MTV today it's become weird
you know it's about anything but music
yeah and so come on man once you have a
publication like Forbes using clickbait
t titles you realize there's a problem
yeah there's a problem in the industry
as a whole
yeah so I guess what I wanted to get to
and I don't even know if we have like
substantial answers to this question but
do you have any tips for the discerning
reader who might be coming or viewer
though I know YouTube is kind of the
Wild West so let's let's oh my let's
let's just understand that from the
outset but the discerning reader who's
trying to look for just stuff to read
like the things that they should at
least be a little bit diligent to do any
tips for things to avoid not really
things to avoid but just to stay
properly informed rather than just I
guess my tip would be don't buy into the
hype every single time
watch the pocket out daily if you like
to keep up with the potential and the
possibility yeah because I understand
that don't just wait for the announced
because I think like I I've never really
prescribed to I'm not saying that there
shouldn't be room repose and speculation
and leaks and all that stuff I'm not
saying it's a bad thing per se
I just don't prescribe to it I just did
I just choose to let the noise go by me
because I would prefer to just get all
of the right information or rather I'm
privileged enough to be at those events
so I like to actually enjoy the event
rather than sit there and go I saw this
a week ago yeah I think I think I have
the first answer I don't know I like we
have another one over
dispose it that was okay let's do you
think you can replace the light yeah
yeah okay go you can let's take a little
break I'm gonna keep the audio keep
everything recording and keep everything
adding I have the perfect answer for
that
when Latinos are like yeah but I spread
it on Facebook there's also the the
Asian parent conundrum where anything
that the parent heard from a relative
hasn't got to be true oh your uncle just
told me that you don't go just told me
that you know there are gangs running
around just cutting people's feet off
okay and you know you're gonna be next
because for some reason you know like
that kind of stuff or my favorite
example because I'm living it right now
every one of me and ESA's older
relatives
once again taquito just because one
person that they know said hey I did
keto and I'm feeling great
well I want to feel great my mom like
she like you leave it that high it's
fine she thinks that there is a thing
called like starvation mode in your body
and my college they were like you don't
eat for like a day then your body will
start retaining fans and I told em like
mom that doesn't exist and she's like
well my doctor like to me then haha and
I like love your daughter did not tell
you that there's no way your doctor ever
told you that also there's also as I
just remembered something this is gonna
be part of my answer okay I got this is
gonna be so epic also by the way as a
diabetic I have to say a lot of the
things that a classically trained doctor
will tell you is wrong all right I have
a nutrition that I just need to round
this out real quick a nutrition this
once told me after I was diagnosed with
diabetes that I still had to eat at
least 100 carbs a day like grams all
right so I have an answer for grams of
carbs yes I come from a culture Latin
America where you will have people come
to you and be like
yes but I read it on Facebook like of
course there are me years that are like
oh it was on Facebook it must be true
yeah listen I all right we are at a in a
very the word is not shady but we're in
a very difficult crossroad in time where
I used to date somebody you met her I
think you met her too to date somebody
who literally diets depending on certain
things that she reads from people on
Instagram from influencers powerful job
oh my god okay my response is no comment
you can't control what tip you can't
control the information all you can be
is discerning about the source yes and
like for example every single time that
I read an article the first thing that I
do is like Wikipedia source source and I
go to the source and I go to the source
and I keep doing that peeling up until I
go to the base article and I see exactly
because every single publication alone
yeah and every single publication to
provide it their own twist will speak of
the same thing differently yeah and so
my advice is first of all remember it's
the Internet
yeah all right one number two even facts
in certain cases are subjective all
right everything is set to
interpretation I mean so can we can eat
I've seen come on man how much time do
we follow the iPhone 5 leaks the
teardrop iPhone design yadda yadda yadda
and it was all confirmed and boom we got
a very different iPhone 5 and then I'm
gonna give you as we say in Spanish the
way that it went though like I'll flip
the coin around with the iPhone let's
just use one product what the first
generation iPhone have been as popular
as it was if it wasn't for a full year
of leaks and rumors about Apple's new
crazy about Apple's new phone yeah
right they these companies need the buzz
yeah even if they don't want to admit it
this is what keeps their product in the
spotlight because they can't launch a
phone every day they can't make news
every day yeah so rumors are the best
way for them to remain in the spotlight
and for their brand to be repeated and
repeated they're not politicians you
know so there's nothing there's not news
they can't manufacture a phone every day
so how do you keep people locked into
your content with somewhat less summon
up in your color every month yes not
listen dude I think that that's a
fabulous strategy I think it is I think
that that is a genius strategy yeah that
is the smart way to keep in the
spotlight and so I'm not trying to
defend everybody I'm just like we're all
adults yeah there's a reality to this
that we shouldn't have that we can't
we're all adults just because somebody
is saying that something is really good
on Instagram come on man yeah I mean I
will I will bet I respect people that
have gone through four or five six years
of college to know exactly how to
provide me the information which is the
reason why I have so much respect for
the Wall Street Journal and for the New
York Times and for the Washington Post
because there's though everybody in
there studied to be in there that's why
they're there
yeah you know so everything else is like
I could be wrong you know I love what I
do and I'm very passionate about what
about my line of work but you know I'm
I'm not an engineer I know that I get I
am outclassed by other people that
aren't you know so that yeah I mean we
respect where respect is due I still all
back where respect is due yeah I and I I
said by the way another shout out to
David and to Stephen at your respective
websites at Andhra police and also at
9:00 to 5:00 good job good good job
actually like bringing this up because
it's something that deserves to be
discussed and now for the last small
portion of this I actually really like
the way that this is all coming together
let's move from when let's say I'll use
the term a blogger what from when a
blogger does this kind of embellishment
of the
of the truth or embellishment of the
facts and when a company does it so oh
my god we got a little bit of fab g'tok
illegal and on that note yeah it's been
a long road for 18 t trying to create a
5g Network so there's this is this is
the the equivalency I feel like where
you have to kind of read a little bit
further into a story to really know what
the truth is and well that's what
they're praying off of well in a way but
18 t they were saying that their speeds
on the 5g network could get up to 1.5
gigabits which is which is 4G which is
still LT yeah yeah so after a fresh
round of testing they have found out
that the speeds they've seen in the lab
had been brought out to the field the
company announced I had tested a mobile
phone that a mobile phone form-factor on
the network in a field location and
recorded a ping of 18 milliseconds and a
down of nearly 1.5 field with no
congestion and also the image below it
had the file name with the words with
the letters MWC tagged on it so maybe 18
T is gonna come to the show and go look
what we did
but everyone hates them right now why
should not come the only device that has
access to a 5g Plus network though is a
Netgear hotspot nice that's the fine
print is that a very specifically made
product for this very test yeah is
what's able to make it happen thick and
also there is fine print there that also
says this does not reflect current user
experience 5g Plus beads which are there
yeah exactly
there aren't any it's just like I even
like I dedicated a spot on a daily when
I when I saw the information I'm like no
yeah how can you call this 5g what a big
xud that's why and I honestly I I never
celebrate things like this at this time
yeah but let's let's remind our
listeners and viewers that what the
suing are happening right now
all right spray because that yes that is
that is coming up next
funny about this it's like who use a
sprint right oh are here today this is
like these my sister uses so much I
know wrong person to use a sprint I
asked them why and they said cuz I'm
locked into that unlimited playing baby
and I'm never getting off and I was like
well that's why they that's why they
call it only to get bought by t-mobile
and when they do it'll be better well
that's why they call it grandfathered in
because you're gonna be a grandpa
alright so yes Sprint suing 84 the Bri
the rebranding yeah the rebranding of
their 4G LTE dude I'm sorry it's
misleading to 5ge they should not only
be sued by Sprint they should be sued
they should be fined by the Justice
Department and like forced to like in
Europe this would not fly mm-hmm like
there are major consumer like laws in
Europe that help companies not mislead
people well yeah and okay so 18 t users
and roughly 400 markets are seeing the
5ge
icon I mean there you're not I'm barely
getting everyone was giving Apple flak
because for it oh but that's the worst
part yeah so I don't think that the
worst part is the AT&amp;amp;T branding but the
fact that it's being seen on iPhones
which are way way dude like they are way
like if like at least these these
snapdragon 845 smartphones are multi
gigabit capable yeah yeah they are
capable of 1.5 gigabits right now on LTE
if there were such a thing as a network
that would provide them yeah that was
lighter remaining to see something like
yeah yeah
yeah like there are countries that
actually provide beads that they sell
you Estonia yes yes no there are
countries whereas here it's
fantastically you get 150 megabits down
but you have to go to a certain area on
a certain Street and 57th yeah to be
able to get that if that turned out to
be the way that 5g actually rolled out
it would look like when Pokemon go first
came out everyone is just in one area
so apparently Sprint said that a service
dolla scooting sprint said a survey
showed 54% of 18 tees consumers believed
their 5g network is the same as or
better than a 5g network you know it's
weird I didn't think that I would hear
people actually talking about regular
consumers you're actually talking about
5g because we've been going to we've
been like working with Qualcomm and
going covering 5g for the last like four
years yeah and like finally finally
finally it's kind of finally happening
but like I still didn't think I would
hear regular consumers use that word
until like 2021 yeah and I had I had two
different people asked me last week
about 5g and I gave them a little
rundown but one day it's gonna sound
like the British are coming
5g is too slow one day is gonna sound
like the British are coming is 5g really
coming yeah Bhaiji tell me about 5g and
the rest of this quick quote off of that
story is a 43% believed that if they
bought if they buy an AT&amp;amp;T phone today
it would be capable of running 5g so
it's clearly misleading yeah exactly
yeah forty forty three percent is not
small it's like Tomos that a hybrid is
an electric car truly LTE is part of the
components of G right but it's not a
fully electric car Reyes yeah well
honestly sub six gears the the reality
of this one point five gigabit per
second speed is that AT&amp;amp;T actually did
say that people know consumers early
consumers using 5g found that it
delivered over
millimeter wave spectrum which is called
5g plus to them they've experienced
ranges of 200 to 300 megabits per second
and so that's like the lower portion of
LTE yep the lower portion yeah like like
see that's the thing you know what the
problem is this is okay I'm gonna use
the perfect analogy for this the New
York City Subway everybody in New York
says that the subway here is fabulous
because they've never been to Europe
yeah or Japan they've never been they've
that they don't realize how bad the
subway here is yeah
norther they realize how bad carrier
services are and I get right yeah I get
it
Europe is probably the size of Texas and
a little more so being able to connect
all those countries requires a lot less
infrastructure a lot less difficulty so
fine I from I've always defended the
situation in the United States because
it's very difficult for you to provide
such great quality service to such a
large country it is difficult I I have
to say that but don't tell me it's 5g
this ain't helping yeah this is not
helping for exactly yeah don't make it
worse yeah and we've been taught the
heck is 5g evolution like no stop just
stop even Qualcomm does not go as far as
to embellish it like that it's just it's
5g yeah it's just gonna be what's next
yeah and and guess what what's next
involves a lot of what we're using now
yeah yeah like they're trying to make it
sound like it's this completely new
alien thing but yeah it's uh it's it no
matter what on the broad spectrum there
are people companies whoever trying to
get those eyeballs in and I guess an
eighties case they actually kind of
succeeded which is the reason why they
might deserve to be in big trouble
yeah look unless you live in a top-five
major city in the world you don't need
to buy a 5g phone in 2019 nobody it's
like the smartwatches yeah do you need a
SmartWatch no they're just really cool
to have yeah that's the same thing
five G there will come a time where
vehicles will be better interconnected
where there will be more IOT like right
now it's it's kind of a not a good idea
to buy you know into a lot of IOT
devices that are not 5g compatible
because it's one v out there just about
to go obsolete yeah you know I don't
know I like I was like shoot I really
want to buy that new Amazon echo and I
was like no I'll buy the echo dot
because it's less expensive yeah I'll
get similar functionality and you know
because I don't want to go all out on
something that's gonna be obsolete in
the year yeah I am really enthusiastic
over 5g and the capabilities I mean
we've seen the demos we've seen
everything that it brings I really want
into it it's just this is like LT there
are growing pains it's not immediate it
takes time the good thing is you know
this is not like LT to a certain degree
5g needs to piggyback on LTE to exist
therefore it makes it a more simpler
spectrum then in the case of LT where
it's a completely different thing when
compared to CDMA GSM and everything like
LT it was just completely different you
know it required a separate antenna
yada-yada-yada not not the case here
and I can't wait like I can't wait I
can't wait for 5g to come for people
that don't want to make the move to
remain on LT and that will remove
congestion from LTE I'm just gonna say
one thing dear carriers do not do what
you did with HSPA+ aka 4G with LTE have
you ever tried 4G on AT&amp;amp;T not a long
time that's like 1g oh yeah yeah it's
literally if you get a vanilla if you
get a 4G icon on your phone it means
you've got nothing all of these layers
to it you know just to just to put some
ease in the users my over yeah yeah it's
crazy but yeah I think that that was a
pretty pertinent way of putting it down
like you know it's LTE was I felt like
LTE was kind of coming in a trickle all
these companies are trying to like shove
5g all at once and it's just not gonna
work that way but we just live in a time
you need to have everything and you need
to be excited all the time you know
rather than just saying okay well you
know maybe it's gonna come it guys it's
going to come just don't you don't have
to buy into all of the hype right now
and get misled the way a lot of these
people do yeah we'll be doing the same
thing in like a couple years and be like
alright we're on it yeah we're using it
right now it's like oh it's great I'm
