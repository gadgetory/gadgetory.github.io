fish are worth fishing even if you don't
catch one the idea of a new smartphone
platform in 2013 is certainly something
of a longshot but the good people at
Yola seem undeterred by the odds and now
it's time to take a look at their very
first smartphone I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is our unboxing of
the world's first Yola okay so we're not
gonna get the full retail unboxing
treatment here because this is it's not
pre-production hardware its release
hardware I believe but it is not
obviously not the retail packaging one
of things we can learn from the box is
that our review device does not have the
bands that we really need to to see
what's going on in terms of 3G 4G
performance here in the States
I hope we're not confined to just GSM or
GPRS data but we'll have to see this is
just an unboxing we don't go we don't go
that far yet just slide it out of the
package here it's concealed in a
protective pouch we've heard a lot about
yola's new smartphone we've talked a lot
with the folks at Yola limited had some
wonderful interviews with them at some
trade shows earlier this year and put
the device aside let's just see what
comes with our unit here and we're
really excited cuz it's rare that that
we get the chance to spend any time with
a new smartphone platform give a big paw
out of your way so you can see what's
going on this is a power adapter this is
a rechargeable lithium-ion battery with
let's see what kind of rating we've got
on there 7.9 8 watt hours 2100 milliamp
hours not one of the larger packs we've
seen and a USB cable let's put those
aside nothing else is in the box we'll
see if we can pop the battery in the
device the fact that that step is
required obviously means that this
device has a removable user replaceable
battery a big plus for a lot of people
especially road warriors take it out of
its little pouch we do have a screen
protector we get to take off there's the
front of the Yola device come around to
the side here and hopefully get some
focus
as we give ourselves a little bit of
room in a little more light and we can
see the other half back of this device
this particular one is white the front
is black because of the very very
interesting dual sided construction of
this device which we'll talk more about
in just a second so we've had a gander
at the Yola user guide online and found
some directions for removing the back
panel before we do I just want to point
out the very very the only sign of
branding on the whole device right there
little tiny Yola branding in the upper
left hand corner but coming back around
to the back and with a little wider shot
so maybe you can see what's going on we
are instructed to first pry up the lower
left hand side there it goes now the
lower right and the back cover of the
back cover of the phone but also the
back cover of the lower half comes off
this is going to get somewhat confusing
to talk about as we go on the battery's
branded to that's very nice all right
pop that sucker right in there we would
put a we would throw in a micro SIM card
at this point but we're going to wait to
do that I'm gonna see if we can survive
without that step just for now battery
is in display is not turned on yet so
we'll take the opportunity to pull the
screen protector off of here and with
the microphone well positioned to
witness the moment here we go doesn't
matter what phone it is that's always a
fun moment and the very next thing on
the agenda now that we're back around to
the side here is to hit this power
standby key you press it and hope this
display springs to life there it goes
there is the Yola logo little zoom there
actually will give a wide shot to you
this is a 4.5 inch IPS display a qHD
resolution there are 16 gigs of storage
within the device itself
it runs on one gig of ram and you
probably saw under the battery there or
alongside the battery there is a micro
SD card slot for expansion around back
is an 8 megapixel camera those are just
the basic specs so that you know what's
going on welcome indeed
something down there
system language will be English UK
English well I suppose I can live with
that a little extra couple extra vowels
here and there that sounds great
I'll hit accept I could have just slid
aside if I wanted to but I decided to
use the other input method the device is
preparing we see a little notification
indicator down there below the screen
and there's that IPS panel glowing gray
when it means black as we're sort of
used to from LCDs that's fine
looks like the device is booting again
aha
there's our duck down below some of that
looks familiar from our time with it
back in back at MWC and we can select
our favourite colour for initial setup
that sounds like fun
I'm gonna do blue you guys probably
think I'm pretty boring about this
mention that any exposure a little bit I
just think I'm a little boring I'm gonna
do blue now I'll do red why not let's
just do that it'll be fun
oh cool alright now I can accept it or I
think I can just swipe gasp look the
view to the right to go ahead to the
previous view sounds good oh and the
indicator shows you when that's possible
date and time this is interesting minute
hand setting what is it 15 thirty it
looks like good forward time zone that
is not my time zone let's go to oh my
goodness I put in Boston are you gonna
give me that
no how about just Eastern what about New
York hi United States thank you very
much
this is a lot like typing on any other
device with a virtual keyboard except
these colors are just amazing if I had
chosen a different accent color of
course you would see something that is
after my birthday well that's very sweet
of you I'm not gonna do my phone number
right now
I won't set my birthday either at the
moment that's good
I don't have to continue oh definitely
near this area I'm just gonna hit save
and I would like a Yola account that
sounds like a lot of fun but it doesn't
sound like a lot of fun for you guys to
watch we're gonna go into this the
remainder of this setup process probably
and just the general experience of using
the Yola in tomorrow's video our first
impressions after a day spent with
yola's first device the Yola and at some
point we'll learn how to phrase that
properly
at any rate folks that is our unboxing
of the world's first sailfish OS powered
device the very first Yola and at pocket
now our first device running a new
platform in quite a while we're excited
to start getting to know this device
folks we know a lot of you out there are
excited to drop us a comment down below
letting us know exactly what you want us
to cover in the full review because we
really don't have a lot of time to put
this together before we have to send
this demo unit back while you're down
there leaving us a comment please drop
us a like if you enjoyed the video
follow us on social networks like I said
before and if you want to take a look at
the sailfish OS in an earlier form check
out our interview and hands-on demo from
a tradeshow
