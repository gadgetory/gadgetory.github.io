the fiercest competitive markets ever in
the quest to stand out from the pack
some companies make bold moves and
succeed brilliantly others are more meek
and fade into the unexceptional
background still others fill the space
between innovating once and then
endlessly iterating over and over again
then there are those that just screw it
all up
thanks to choices that are either too
bold too meek or just plain old
absolutely insane these are the products
that fall flat on their face they're not
to be mocked but the lessons they teach
should certainly be remembered and
that's what we're here for
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is episode 2 of worst gadgets ever
featuring the Microsoft Kin now folks
this isn't a gift box for a bottle of
brandy or a package of tennis balls
it's the packaging for the Kin 2 now
right out the gate it's plain to see
that Microsoft was trying to do
something different with the Kin line
and maybe that's the core tragedy of the
whole endeavor anyway let's crack this
open and start the autopsy for a new
buyer during the short amount of time
the Kin was on sale opening the lid
revealed an inner capsule much like an
eyeglass case showcasing the device
itself alongside the usual product
literature stamped with the ambitious
statement this changes things between
the packaging and the messaging of the
Kin brand it's plain that Microsoft and
sharp were at one point really invested
in shaking up the market let's take a
look at the device the kintu bore the
same rounded contours as its kin one
predecessor but it throughout the
rounded square form factor in favour of
a more conventional rectangular side
sliding QWERTY it didn't look too bad
from the top but from the side the
almost sixteen millimeter thick device
or a close resemblance to a soap dish it
featured some cool touches like the
engraved soir√©e pattern on the camera
key and the transparent rim
around the phones top half but overall
the hardware was hugely unimpressive the
plastics on the back felt low-grade the
phone felt too light in the hand the
button responsiveness was mushy on the
side keys and not much better on the
keyboard and the slider action was loose
and wobbly feeling a lot like a first
edition Palm Pre our unit even
replicates a problem that plagued some
early palm Prees sliding it open too
aggressively
causes it to power off from these
failings to the hardware specs 320 by
480 display and a 600 megahertz
processor with only 8 gigs of on-board
storage it was clear that the Kin wasn't
going to be a superstar but it was aimed
not at a power user but at a very
particular kind of customer the people
at Microsoft in charge of building the
Kin were the remnants of the company's
acquisition of danger the brand behind
the famous hip-hopper
sidekick one of the earliest and most
innovative lines of consumer focused
smartphones those devices were famously
targeted at teenagers with fun unique
and hip software and the former danger
team brought that feeling to the Kin
software as well the UI design was
clever with a central homescreen flanked
on the left by an app list and on the
right by a phonebook fonts were bold and
all caps and the out of box color
palette was an aggressive neon green
mixed with grey gradients a recent
button down in the lower left served as
a type of on-the-fly recent tasks
switcher the lone physical button on the
face was used as a back key and the
coolest part of the UI a concept we
wouldn't mind seeing on other platforms
was the ever-present green dot on the
bottom of the display it served as a
kind of drop point for shareable items
you could drag almost anything in there
from photos to webpages and share them
with your contacts via email messaging
or what have you it reinforced the kins
nature as a social device a platform
meant primarily for connecting with
people the you I didn't exactly shine on
the kintu's washed-out low res display
but you can see some early touches of
the Zune inspired Metro UI here remember
this was before Windows Phones official
launch and the kintu even bares its own
flavor of Windows Phone branding on the
back but it's also easy to see why some
people inside of Microsoft wanted the
product killed off and never associated
with the company's new smartphone
efforts where Windows Phone is fluid and
responsive in addition to its beauty
the kintu lags almost everywhere and
there are basic gaps in functionality
like the lack of an onscreen keyboard
what really killed the Kin though wasn't
so much that it was a flawed product all
products are flawed in their infancy the
Ken also didn't die because of its
burdensome Verizon data plan as is
commonly believed in reality according
to reports from other news sources the
kins
data plan Fiasco was a symptom of a
larger problem internal strife at
Microsoft that saw two divisions
fighting against each other with the kin
ultimately paying the price of being
sent to market with essentially no
support the kin could have been a great
product some ideas here like the
omnipresent share functionality kin
studio and the emphasis on placing
people first are worthwhile and
compelling but those ideas like anything
else were doomed without the commitment
of their backers the kin one and two are
the adopted orphan children of an
indecisive parent and the kin two
certainly looks feels and acts the part
the big lesson from today's episode
don't have kids if you're not ready to
care for them folks that's going to do
it for episode two of worst gadgets ever
