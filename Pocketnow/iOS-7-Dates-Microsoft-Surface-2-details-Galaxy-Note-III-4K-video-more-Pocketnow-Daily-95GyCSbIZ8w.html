launch date of Iowa seven new leaks see
a samsung galaxy note through with 4k
video recording capabilities and if you
missed the Nokia Lumia 920 on AT&amp;amp;T
there's always the Lumia 925 I'm hi Mary
vetta and a 4k video recording means
more acne being shown on camera I'm
going to stick to 1080p this is parking
out daily listeners day off with the
official news as the Moto maker service
for the Moto X is now available to
everyone you don't have to walk into an
AT&amp;amp;T store to get a special hard to be
able to buy the phone custom-made and if
you're interested in anything that's not
a TNT you can also buy a contract free
as well on moto maker which is right now
if you're interested in getting it on
another carrier wool verizon is getting
it on August twenty-ninth and in the
case of t-mobile that will be September
even though that is not custom-made and
speaking of a TNT those of you that were
worried about the Nokia Lumia 920 being
discontinued out of the blue well AT&amp;amp;T
just answered your prayers as the Nokia
Lumia 925 is going to be its new
replacement pre-orders start tomorrow
you can pick the phone up on sat
tempered 13 for the same one hundred
dollars after a two-year contract
obviously and for those of you that are
interested in more no gift phablet
rumors well apparently Lumia 1520 is
going to be the code name or the final
name of the phone so stay tuned for that
and let's move away from the launches
and start talking about those little
rumors that are out there about the
Galaxy Note 3 first of all we get the
first leaked photograph of the display
and yeah this is pretty much a galaxy s4
on a bigger size that's pretty much the
way it's going to be and even though
we're not getting off the goal image
stabilization a new rumor talks about
this phone getting 4k video even though
many of us won't be able to afford the
first 4k display in the next five years
anyways let's see how that goes now
let's talk about apolis we've got some
conflicting reports about iOS 7 first of
all we did hear the reports that it was
going to be launched on September 10th
which is the rumored date that the
iPhone 5s is going to be launched and
while as it turns now we've got some
other reports that state that the gold
master candidate of Iowa 7 will be
launched on this date which has happened
before but then in the same case you
know there wasn't a gold master
candidate for other versions of I
as well so we still don't even know of
the event is gonna be on September temp
anyways so again these are just rumors
and finally for the I'm gonna call these
interesting news of the day we've got
some more reports of a Microsoft service
to in the works alongside some Nokia
tablets yet I just one more tablets
listen subscription for the full model
numbers but interesting in the case of
this surface it's not going to be
running Windows RT thank you but in the
case of the Nokia tablets these are all
going to be running Windows RT sadly and
it's kind of hard to make anything out
of these rumors but that leads me to the
question of the day are you interested
wand or are considering any windows
tablets right now or in the future
honestly in my particular case I don't
see much buzz after windows tablets it
does seem that windows 8 hasn't been as
hot as we were expecting it to be that

perspectives on this operating system
