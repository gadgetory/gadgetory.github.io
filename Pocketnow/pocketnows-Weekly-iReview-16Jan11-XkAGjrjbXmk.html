iOS 4.3 beta is out and this seems to be
much bigger than just a typical update
and rumors are that the home button will
soon disappear from iOS devices all this
and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi Yvette and welcome to
the pocket nail I review the show we go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices as always let's start off
with the cool well rumors have finally
ended the verizon iphone 4 is finally
out though there aren't many changes
it's not an iphone 5 and iphone v as we
expected it's just a typical iphone 4
with a different antenna design that
does claim to not have the same antenna
gate issues that we saw on the AT&amp;amp;T
version now with this iphone 4 you won't
get simultaneous data and calls because
it's a cdma phone and it doesn't bring a
sim tray so don't expect it to be a
world phone it'll cost you the same 199
for the 16 gigabyte model and the same
299 for the 32 gigabyte model you can
get a pre-order at februari third or you
can also get to buy it on februari 10th
though we're not sure how lines are
going to be there sadly there are better
things on this verizon iphone than we
expected everybody wanted it to be an
LTE device and sadly we did not get that
so not really sure if it's really worth
buying or waiting for the iPhone 5 or 4s
or for whatever in June or we're not
really sure if we can expect this to be
the same yearly cycle that we've seen
with past iPhones in the AT&amp;amp;T you know
area so we'll see what happens well iOS
4.3 beta is out for developers and sadly
we're not going to get many changes
first of all one thing we didn't mention
on the past news post was the fact that
the verizon iphone owners are going to
get a personal hotspot feature that will
allow you to use your phone as a Wi-Fi
router for up to five devices and iOS
4.3 beta brings this feature to AT&amp;amp;T
devices though we're not sure what to
make of it with AT&amp;amp;T given the fact that
not even tethering works and well you'll
also get repeating interval changes for
text
ding so if you currently get an alert
every two minutes just once or twice you
can now choose to get it 10 times 5
times you will also get changes in fonts
for notes and that is pretty much it up
to now we really don't know what to
expect remember this is just the beta
and there are going to be beta tues beta
3 s probably and release candidates so
we'll see you in the end what they end
up releasing yeah we're a smartphone
website and we don't really cover the
iPad much but one of the interesting
things that came with iOS 4.3 beta for
the ipad is for you to be able to switch
between applications and even go to the
home screen with multi-touch gestures
that involve four to five fingers now I
can't imagine myself using four fingers
you know for an iphone screen but one of
the things we do expect probably not on
iOS 4.3 but probably in the future is to
see that the home button disappears and
that will probably be able to navigate
between applications in the iphone with
at least two or three multi-touch
gestures or fingers so really don't know
what to make of it yet again the beta is
just out there on beta one so we'll see
if you know the changes do come to iOS
4.3 for iphone users or probably just
the iPad and continuing on with the iOS
4.3 beta leaks one of the things that we
did see is that Apple switching from the
current power vr GPU to the new x GS 5 4
3 GP you on the next generation iphone
now what this means is improve graphics
performance up to twenty-five percent
and probably could mean better battery
life while playing games or playing
videos or watching images or stuff like
that anything that has to do with the
graphics interface we really don't know
what to expect not really sure if it
will be there again these are just beta
releases and these beta releases include
options for new drivers for this power
vr GPU so not really sure if it's really
smart to move to the verizon iphone with
these new changes coming into the next
generation iphone so again hold your
horses hold your breath not really sure
if you should wait but hey these are new
things that could probably come in
future releases now rumors out there
have Apple working on a new pen that
will allow hovering gestures
control your iPhone we're not really
sure this is new screen technology that
will allow some sort of a capacitive
magnetic finger heat whatever or if
we're just getting new features that
will work with the Apple front-facing
video camera that we use for facetime if
this hovering thing works with the
camera then we could expect it to work
with current generation iphone models
not really sure what to expect but we
have seen Microsoft working on this
technology for windows phone so hmm
competition really like that well that
does it for the cool that's continued on
with the not so cool as expected well
and we were expecting it to happen on
iOS 5 but it seems that iOS 4.3 beta is
not supporting the iphone 3g or the
second generation ipod touch now given
the rocky updates that iphone 3g owners
have had with iOS four point oh and the
next generation releases our advice to
you is try to get another device it
seems that Apple is not caring about
backwards compatibility anymore as they
did with the previous generation iphone
and the updates that happen afterwards I
mean sad news and we'll have you've been
waiting for the carrier unlock feature
to work on iOS 4.2 point 1 or iOS 4.1
essbase bands on the iphone 4 you'll be
sad to know that muscle nerve which is
the current dev team guide as in charge
of ultrasnow it's just confirmed that he
will not be releasing an update to
ultrasnow for these base bands on the
iphone 4 you will wait for iOS 4.3 to be
out or four point two point five or
whatever comes out that brings and
untethered jailbreak solution which is
really bad news for a lot of us that
have been waiting to be able to unlock
our phones again now the baddest part of
this these news is the fact that he said
the same thing back when iOS 4.1 was out
and he said no wait for iOS 4.2 to be
released and nothing happened so not
really sure what's happening to the dev
team lately I think they've been working
too much on PlayStation and not really
focusing on iOS I mean not really sure
what to expect that's it for this week's
show thank you very much for watching
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
