move to reinvent themselves and the
other is the here in a Samsung
self-created phablet category after
spending a couple of weeks with one in
almost three months with the other it's
time to compare them I'm Jaime Rivera
this is PocketNow and this is the Sony
Xperia Z all vs. samsung galaxy note 2
the idea of comparing Sony's latest
Xperia Z L against the full-fledged
phablet is kind of complicated since
these are two similar devices that were
built with different customers in mind
on one hand sony has built the Xperia Z
L in a way that ignores the need of a
bezel in order to give you a 5-inch
display on regular human dimensions so
this is more of a film that anybody
could consider on the other hand we have
the Galaxy Note 2 where Samsung is not
trying to be small nor fit in one hand
on the contrary this is more of a
proof-of-concept product where Samsung
wants to show the world that bigger is
better and so far they have reacted
positively to it when comparing design
and build quality the Xperia Z I'll
probably won the race in giving you a
pocketable 5-inch display but that's it
it's not thinner than the note 2 and
just obviously shorter slimmer and
lighter when it comes to design both
devices are made out of plastic but the
note 2 take Sam or bombastic approach
with its shiny hyper glaze coating where
the Xperia Z OH keeps a more
conventional design and textured back
that reminds us more of the galaxy note
1 since neither of these devices is out
to model for Cosmo none of them feel
cheap in the hand due to their heft the
Xperia does seem like if it could take
more of a beating than the note 2 but
sadly this comparison did not include a
torture test and don't ask for it
overall their differences are clear and
hardware but it's hard to tell you if
one is better than the other since
beauty lies in the eye of the beholder
when it comes to specs off the bat there
is a huge difference in their displays
the Xperia Z L rocks a 5-inch 1080p LCD
giving you a staggering 441 pixels per
inch compared to the 5.5 inch 720p AM
OLED panel on the note 2 which gives you
267 pixels per inch now does the edge go
to the Xperia Z L just because of the
added specs well not really there's
almost no bezel here which is great but
viewing angles are terrible compared to
the note 2 and the note 2 is display
includes support for samsung s
10 which brings you additional pen input
hovering functionality and additional
other features that are pretty much
unique to the Galaxy Note 2 both devices
have two bugle bytes of RAM and they
start at 16 gigabytes of storage
they have expandable storage and the
usual suspects the flagship device would
have except for the fact that the CL
does include an IR blaster that's pretty
much the thing in 2013 and obviously the
note 2 doesn't
they also Rock a quad-core processor
being the Snapdragon s4 pro clocked at
1.5 gigahertz on the CL the note 2 is
running their acclaimed Exynos at 1.6
gigahertz and even though the note 2 is
6 months older than the CL Sony's choice
of last year's Snapdragon doesn't give
you the edge when it comes to up-to-date
processor specifications ask for
benchmark squadron this show that the
Xperia Z L is quite superior than the
note 2 but honestly once you compare
these on day-to-day use even with
intensive applications you to really
don't notice the difference on either of
these devices overall even though these
devices are clearly different there's
differences are quite insignificant when
it comes to specs and even though we do
get the 1080p display on the Xperia Z L
the note 2 does give you Chris detail
even six months after being on the
market and obviously with the S Pen
functionality it does make you wonder if
one gives you more added value than the
other now software is where things defer
dramatically since Sony has enhanced
their UI and a way to embrace the
Android feel and they're trying to look
a lot like Android and in the case of
Samsung they're clearly just using
Android to power TouchWiz but they're
giving you their Samsung experience
regardless of what Android is they want
to give you something completely
different the problem with the Xperia Z
yell is that even though it tries to be
unique in their Sony way well it looks a
lot like Android but it doesn't do a
great job at either being unique or
looking like Android the user experience
is elegant its refined that it's snappy
but it only makes Android look better
and not really work better as moving
widgets around for example is kind of
frustrating and the keyboard is
definitely terrible things that
shouldn't have been fixed the note 2 by
contrast isn't trying to be Android
Samsung's nature UX is a complete
departure from that it's actually its
own UI with Hardware buttons and since
its enhanced for note-taking input it's
definitely focused on giving you a drum
matically different feel samsung also
goes as far as to include smart actions
to try to enhance your experience with
the device or give you different things
that are either better or just will
convolute your experience but with the
clear purpose of adding value to what
you're buying which is a galaxy phone
and they obviously want to make the
galaxy phone something different the
great thing is that this is still
Android so if you choose to keep these
launchers or change them you can do so
whenever you want and overall even
though these devices do keep separate
approaches Samsung does give you the
edge and giving you a bold customization
and sometimes adding value to your
experience whereas sony is a little more
conventional and sometimes not really
giving you the difference that you want
now obviously sony does provide some
enhancements in their multitasking
features with their hovering widgets
which are small applications but that
doesn't necessarily mean that it has a
better edge over the Galaxy Note 2 and
when it comes to day-to-day use I will
tell you that the Xperia Z L does beat
the pants off the note 2 when it comes
to call quality or pretty much any other
phone that I've tested honestly the
Xperia Z L sounds amazing and you really
don't have to enhance anything like you
have to do on the note 2 of you want
better call quality photographs on both
of these devices are honestly good but
you really can't tell the difference
even if the Xperia Z L is rocking a 13.1
megapixel camera in comparison to the 8
megapixel camera on the note 2 the no 2
does provide good photographs probably
second-best in comparison to the iPhone
and the Xperia Z L is well just as good
but you don't really feel something
better on the Z L in any way and the
same goes for 1080p performance as both
devices are great but I really don't
consider HDR video to be superior it is
better but it doesn't bring you a
dramatic departure between one video
recording and the other now battery life
is the obvious spot where the note 2
wins since it has a much bigger cell to
power less pixels on the display and
it's definitely the king of battery life
overall but still on the Xperia Z oh and
the one that we've tested which is HSPA+
honestly well device is good it'll give
you more than a day of battery life so
either of these devices give you
above-average battery life but obviously
the note 2 will win
and speaking of HSPA+ our tests on these
networks were good so far I
these devices will give you pretty much
the same experience fast data speeds
fast Wi-Fi switches all is great bottom
line if you're trying to find the winner
between either of these it's hard since
both these devices are designed to serve
different customers and both perform
almost the same in real-world tests I
guess the biggest question I'd have for
you is if you'd prefer a phone that's
clearly trying to be big which would be
the Galaxy Note 2 or if you want a phone
that is big but it's trying to be small
which would be the Xperia Z L once you
answer that question regardless of which
device you pick you'll be rocking the
latest and greatest of Android and
honestly both these devices are
head-turners so you'll be well served
regardless of which the Bice you pick
that's it for today's comparison between
the Sony Xperia Z L and the Galaxy Note
2 we hope you enjoyed it please leave
your comments down below and your
impressions as to which device would you
believe is better even if you could
consider any of these to be better if
both are actually cool but again follow
