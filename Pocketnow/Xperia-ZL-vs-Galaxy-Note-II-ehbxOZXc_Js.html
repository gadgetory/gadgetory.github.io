move to reinvent themselves and the
other is the here in the Samsung
self-created phablet category after
spending a couple of weeks with one in
almost three months with the other is
it's time to compare them I'm hi Mary
Vera this is pocket now and this is the
Sony Xperia Z 0 vs samsung galaxy note 2
the idea of comparing sony's latest
xperia ZL against the full-fledged
phablet is kind of complicated since
these are two similar devices that were
built with different customers in mind
on one hand sony has built the xperia ZL
in a way that ignores the need of a
bezel in order to give you a 5-inch
display on regular human dimension so
this is more of a film that anybody
could consider on the other hand we have
the Galaxy Note 2 where Samsung is not
trying to be small nor fit in one hand
on the contrary this is more of a
proof-of-concept product where Samsung
wants to show the world that bigger is
better and so far they have reacted
positively to it when comparing design
and build quality the Xperia ZL probably
won the race in giving you a pocketable
5 inch display but that's it it's not
thinner than the note 2 and just
obviously shorter slimmer and lighter
when it comes to design both devices are
made out of plastic but the note 2 takes
a more bombastic approach with its shiny
hyper glaze coating where the Xperia ZL
keeps a more conventional design and
textured back that reminds us more of
the Galaxy Note one since neither of
these devices is out to model for Cosmo
none of them feel cheap in the hand due
to their heft the Xperia does seem like
if it could take more of a beating of
the note 2 but sadly this comparison did
not include a torture test and don't ask
for it overall their differences are
clear and hardware but it's hard to tell
you if one is better than the other
since beauty lies in the eye of the
beholder when it comes to specs off the
bat there is a huge difference in their
displays the Xperia ZL rocks a 5-inch
1080p LCD giving you a staggering 441
pixels per inch compared to the 5.5 inch
720p AMOLED panel on the note 2 which
gives you 267 pixels per inch now does
the edge go to the Xperia ZL just
because of the added specs well not
really there's almost no bezel here
which is great but viewing angles are
terrible compared to the note 2
display include support for Samsung S
Pen which brings you additional pen
input hovering functionality and
additional other features that are
pretty much unique to the Galaxy Note 2
both devices have two gigabytes of RAM
and they started 16 gigabytes of storage
they have expandable storage and the
usual suspects the flagship device would
have except for the fact that the CL
does include an IR blaster that's pretty
much the thing in 2013 and obviously the
note 2 doesn't they also Rock a
quad-core processor being the Snapdragon
s4 pro clocked at 1.5 gigahertz on the
ZL the note 2 is running their acclaimed
ex and Oh's at 1.6 gigahertz and even
though the note 2 is six months older
than the ZL Sony's choice of last year
Snapdragon doesn't give you the edge
when it comes to up-to-date processor
specifications as for benchmark squadron
does show that the Xperia ZL is quite
superior than the note 2 but honestly
once you compare these on day-to-day use
even with intensive applications you two
really don't notice the difference on
either of these devices overall even
though these devices are clearly
different there's differences are quite
insignificant when it comes to specs it
even though we do get the 1080p display
on the Xperia ZL the note 2 does give
you Chris detail even six months after
being on the market and obviously with
the s-pen functionality it does make you
wonder if one gives you more added value
than the other now software is where
things defer dramatically since sony has
enhanced their UI in a way to embrace
the android feel and they're trying to
look a lot like android and in the case
of samsung they're clearly just using
android to power TouchWiz but they're
giving you their Samson experience
regardless of what Android is they want
to give you something completely
different the problem with the Xperia ZL
is that even though it tries to be
unique in there Sony way well it looks a
lot like Android but it doesn't do a
great job at either being unique or
looking like Android the user experience
is elegant it's refined that it's snappy
but it only makes Android look better
and not really work better as moving
widgets around for example is kind of
frustrating and the keyboard is
definitely terrible things that
shouldn't have been fixed the note 2 by
contrast isn't trying to be Android
Samsung's nature UX is a complete
departure from that it's actually its
own UI with hardware buttons and since
its enhanced for note-taking input
it's definitely focused on giving you a
dramatically different feel samsung also
goes as far as to include smart actions
to try to enhance your experience with
the device or give you different things
that are either better or just will
convolute your experience but with the
clear purpose of adding value to what
you're buying which is a galaxy phone
and they obviously want to make the
galaxy phone something different the
great thing is that this is still
Android so if you choose to keep these
launchers or change them you can do so
whenever you want and overall even
though these devices do keep separate
approaches Samsung does give you the
edge and giving you a bold customization
and sometimes adding value to your
experience whereas Sony is a little more
conventional and sometimes not really
giving you the difference that you want
now obviously Sony does provide some
enhancements in their multitasking
features with their hovering widgets
which are small applications but that
doesn't necessarily mean that it has a
better edge over the galaxy note 2 and
when it comes to day-to-day use I will
tell you that the Xperia ZL does beat
the pants off the note 2 when it comes
to call quality or pretty much any other
phone that i've tested honestly the
Xperia ZL sounds amazing and you really
don't have to enhance anything like you
have to do on the note two of you want
better call quality photographs on both
of these devices are honestly good but
you really can't tell the difference
even if the Xperia ZL is rocking a 13.1
megapixel camera in comparison to the 8
megapixel camera on the note 2 then 0 2
does provide good photographs probably
second-best in comparison to the iPhone
and the Xperia ZL is well just as good
but you don't really feel something
better on the ZL in any way and the same
goes for 1080p performance as both
devices are great but I really don't
consider HDR video to be superior it is
better but it doesn't bring you a
dramatic departure between one video
recording and the other now battery life
is the obvious spot where the note 2
wins since it has a much bigger cell to
power less pixels on the display and
it's definitely the king of battery life
overall but still on the Xperia Z 0 and
the one that we've tested which is hspa+
honestly well device is good it'll give
you more than a day of battery life so
either of these devices give you above
average battery life but obviously the
note 2 will win
and speaking of hspa+ our test us on
these networks were good so far either
of these devices will give you pretty
much the same experience fast data
speeds fast Wi-Fi switches all is great
bottom line if you're trying to find the
winner between either of these its
hearts and spot these devices are
designed to serve different customers
and both perform almost the same in real
world tests I guess the biggest question
I have for you is if you'd prefer phone
that's clearly trying to be big which
would be the Galaxy Note 2 or if you
want to film that as big but it's trying
to be small which would be the Xperia ZL
once you answer that question regardless
of which device you pick you'll be
rocking the latest and greatest of
Android and honestly both these devices
are head turners so you'll be well
served regardless of which the vice you
pick that's it for today's comparison
between the Sony Xperia ZL and the
galaxy note 2 we hope you enjoyed it
please leave your comments down below
and your impressions as to which device
would you believe is better even if you
could consider any of these to be better
if both are actually cool but again
follow us in your social network of
choice leave this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I am high memory
but I thank you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
