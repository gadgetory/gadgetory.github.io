we're here at comic-con New York City
see what's going on in the smartphone
world let's check it out
chickens can fly is an awesome platform
husband's work exclusive on windows
though it'll come out later this year by
the developer amused sloth there's a
pretty cool are available in desoto
can't wait Hodgins cam 3 has a really
great for different laboratories where
you get 10 or so different
the Jewish laboratory and
teaching one
type of thing where you're trying to
draw this hospital going down and we'll
try it selectively or try to avoid three
really fun and has an awesome sense of
humor it's also going to be that's been
designed around all the new mako feature
still have custom ringtones in that
my favorite is one sounds like
the not Church
you also have some trials the starfish
that we have
my name where you were right before
better better now almost finish Alicia
must be
rating service and title
that's one
let's take a look at
terminal yeah I'm a big orbital fan yeah
so Jesse's been playing a lot of orbital
just great Brainiac type cerebro being
very puzzled and you can play this
or you can play with somebody on
come together
trying to get the highest court you can
get by knocking into the closet yep
trying to count down from three each
time you more kids another or that
number counts down but as you can see
they also fill up the space
remember on the sides
for this based on how much sleep has
where did you see that one that Jesse
has right on his front porch there he
gets that ricochets below the line is
being over exactly like that seems
reasonable that's your point against
each other it's all about trying to work
the other person so we're pretty wakens
on the pc or so you're actually playing
right now on the same time just like
that before you take 110 and I would
Sarah plant here and I would try to
block his move with a big whore right in
his face oh I was going to try and blast
mine did a really good job if I hit that
bounce stuff I'm done
so I'm just going to try and keep
walking his way out so he screws himself
like your taste for the day there's just
came out this week and this is actually
connects to connectable which is going
here first
any of our connect title
developed by frontiers published by
Microsoft fantastic resolution of the
cats on the spear and infrequently
pickings with the cats to choose your
path
the cool connectivity is there are six
exclusive cats on own
you're over 60 Ken that you can trade
back to your home
cat-rate ending alone safe if they learn
on your xbox will transfer to
you can transfer those back and forth
you automatically go with your allies
like your live ID is that think it's
going to
your phone with your hand
I'm gonna come out
tied together on your phone fantastic
one of the things I love about that
array show yes you have all right so you
can do this thing where you take a
picture and then you can actually upload
it to your favorite social media site so
let's take a picture of Jesse
so I Jesse
alright so I like my picture of Jesse
looks like he's working hard fantastic
you have your little cat you can make
your cat thinner smaller and then you
can change the positions of the cat take
them down on the shoulder you can make
those little tail yeah and then you take
it uploaded to social media and then
grabs forever which i think is worthy
right there that is so you put your
camera way and then really quick to show
you how you would actually transfer this
too so you can see all the different
tricks that you can do here
and then to transfer it you go with
connectivity and then you use a QR code
to go to or from your xbox 360 see you
take a picture of the QR code on your
xbox 360 or not on microsoft tag not a
Microsoft X want to make sure that it
works on all these different so QR code
take a picture of it
to go back for this shouldn't be version
four platforms now just for windows
phone here yep
that we wouldn't make sure that there
was a
and that was the most comfortable way
alright so
developer
and
seen from your rope
is the title by signal it's actually a
franchise on that spot
toy soldiers 13 mountain late last year
of Hudson River Cave &amp;amp; 2
more was part of it
harkee 20
oculi for mini games that were inside
popular
basically three
target your mobile beer bar
we'll show up on the phone
possible
and then there's also some super optimum
going to happen when this game launches
along with
and 20 soldiers
that around yeah
cool graphics images
gallery
the last thing we wanted to show you is
actually
over here from Starfire and they have a
game it's coming
called
title that can be called confusion
Genesis and also talk a little bit about
the companion
and the connection between the two
take away
mr. fusion Genesis more xbla
and also
with an animal there's an online dynamic
universe
mosh make eight players 80 of random
it's going to
I want to keep
lots of attacking players in your world
not populated
traffic while you're doing
five factions in the game
go a little louder in the war zone
attack the other base I'll take care of
the back to try and get in there
so the Windows Phone version of this is
going to be similar to that
here we go with the vent window small
version
it's like a little lower tsk you can
level up centage robots once you've done
that there's three different types of
robots there's a gps a healer and a tank
once you've level them up you can put
them on an auction Harrison trade them
xbla players
so I just try to put some of them out
here for you
so great strategy for your
these guys are the the sentience that's
a that's a tank loved ones the DPS that
was the healer
you level these guys up in here once you
don't you click on the auction house and
they can become the most powerful
weapons in the xbox live arcade you're
actually customizing your able to
transfer these back of one leader to
yourself to make super over here or to
sell and be like this LeBaron of
sentient creator on the phone
but about the marriage of the wrong
well which is what the term velvet rain
they can stand already come up into the
hills
so after I do something on here it'll
show up on the xbox well you can even
transfer these guys these robots in once
you've done that and they can help you
out when you're in here you can actually
see them on your ship that one thing you
would stand attached to your ship to
give your ship up okay go to the auction
house we all love them on there you can
live general suit do they
myself up give them an extra armor boost
also put an arm abuse and all all your
friends well same time anyhow you at you
level the look we're getting to increase
your armor race your help you can get to
go down and take other people's shields
things like that and when you get in
here and you play with your friends you
know you want to try to spread the
skills I
so all your based on covert ops when the
tactical midnight
we'll drive
this boat it's a player multiplayer
online
friends basically two big big bases two
armies attacking each other you got to
take care of their battleship they'll
take down yours the bottle will add Evan
blow
and you gotta take to try and take
supply points and capture points as well
leo
I love that guy
just wanna make my way over to their
base
you got that from the phone
very early on in the starting to come
out of their base trying to come on some
that take these guys down house like it
in its going to get the thicker welcome
to make it heavy
Curtis Ahmed
so just bigger ships in the game which
you can pilot with the cruisers make a
heavier weaponry on them you can pilot
them further into the game
how does the phone one work is it kind
of like a hour spent gamer
more of an RTS it's more of a little
party s game where you're bringing these
guys around from zone to zone and level
you go increasing their skills
collecting things on the way
customizing the option of playing in the
game okay because we're looking earlier
they're super
Benson 7 by the scheme
become
thank you selling
all right thank you very much
that's too
