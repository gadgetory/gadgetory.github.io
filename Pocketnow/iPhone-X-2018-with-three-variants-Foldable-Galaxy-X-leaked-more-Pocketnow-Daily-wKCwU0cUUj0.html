already point to a larger oled display
we get recognized early information that
shows us a foldable Samsung Galaxy X and
it seems that the LGB 30 will come with
some interesting deals when launched I'm
Jaime metally that I and yeah the reason
why I don't like Mondays is because of
how long it takes to get over them this
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals we can not stress
enough how much of a good device the one
plus five is and if you're in the market
for the eight gigabytes 128 gigabyte of
storage variant and that was a gigabytes
of RAM by the way you can actually get a
couple of deals starting with the blit
headphones in addition to faster
shipping options you can learn more in
the description now we don't have a
solid date for the possible launch of
the LGB 30 but we've got some leaked
images to show us that in addition to
getting the phone with whatever deals LG
is going to be offering remember this is
the first LG device that's compatible
with daydream and the way the company is
going to celebrate is by giving you a
free daydream VR and I can't wait to
actually get both we will keep you
posted as soon as we learn more about
the launch date let's move the spotlight
over to Apple and iOS 11 as yes we've
been recommending that everybody updates
iowa's 11 starting with iPads it makes
the experience a lot better but a lot of
users are complaining about both crashes
and just drops in performance with iOS
11 I haven't really experienced any
problems ever since I started reviewing
the iPhone 8 but apparently those of you
is still using iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus
devices are having these issues we would
love to know more about your experience
in the comments so far we haven't really
been able to replicate it on newer
devices and since we're talking I phones
believe it or not the rumors of the next
generation iPhones are already live we
hear that we're getting up to three
iPhones next year and interesting we
hear the two of these devices are going
to have an OLED and then the third one
is going to have an LCD from Japan
display but then the most interesting
part is that apparently when it comes to
tears it seems that the smaller and the
larger ones are going to have o LEDs and
then the one in the middle is going to
have the LCD we don't know exactly why
but we will keep you posted we've got a
full year to figure that one out and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do
the Samsung Galaxy X we've been talking
about Samsung working on a foldable
display forever
we heard that it might make it to the
next generation Galaxy Note but then
again we've got our regulatory
documentation showing us that there is a
galaxy X it's a foldable device but it
looks like a clamshell actually it tries
to be sort of like the old flip phones
that we used to use which is interesting
I know that this is very much loved than
Korea up to the point where there are
still flip phones Galaxy flip phones in
Korea but you know it leads me to the
question today would you like to move
back to having a flip smartphone in my
case hey I wouldn't mind at all so long
as that thing fits in my pocket it was a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion and friends again if you
want to get the news early or make sure

structure our channel as well by hitting
