story every single time the media goes
crazy over every hot new device but
after that review period wears off so
what is the bus behind that new tool you
might still want to buy but that now
faces new competition the thing is in
the real world things don't really
happen that way for most of us aging is
just as in point as the moment you unbox
your product for the first time it's how
that device performs after extensive use
that really matters down the line so
let's do something about it let's have a
second look at the best-selling
SmartWatch in the world and see if it's
still worth being one of the most
expensive ones I'm hanging every event
with pocket now and this is the Apple
watch series too after the buzz the
coolest parts of reviewing gadgets is
that you get to play with most if not
all of them and after the review period
is done you get to pick which one you
want to keep as your daily driver I
think there's no secret that I like
using smartwatches some for their
elegance and others because of how well
they assist me in Fitness but the watch
that I always end up drifting back to is
the Apple watch series - and another
thing that's not a secret is how much I
hated its predecessor like every
first-generation Apple product I didn't
think that I was getting my money's
worth because of how badly the first
Apple watch aged and even today as my
son uses it it continues to prove that
it was definitely a terrible investment
the Apple watch series - is a different
animal choosing to replace the composite
back for ceramic was smart there are no
more scratches to affect the accuracy of
the sensors the aluminum trim still
looks brand new for the most part though
I have noticed something funky happening
with Apple's anodization of devices
sporting 7000 series aluminum after
about a year of use
notice how last year's Apple watch and
the iPhone success are peeling and I'm
worried that it's starting to notice on
series 2 ever so slightly and then the
screen even if thicker than its
predecessor looks ok from a distance but
you won't save it from scratches here
and there
now the reason for all this wear and
tear is actually one of the reasons why
I like this watch the most it's mainly
because of its versatility if you want
an elegant watch during the day just
swap a band for it want to use it at the
gym you can swap another band and this
allows you to keep all your regular
activity match with all your fitness
activity in just one device instead of
having to use different watches
throughout the day oh and take my word
for it don't waste your money on Apple
made bands I mean the white sport band
that came with the watch looks terrible
after a few months in the gym and the
woman nylon band is really good at
catching stains and holding onto them I
was able to find the links bracelet on
Amazon and instead of paying the $500
that Apple charges for it it only cost
me like $70 and it looks pretty much the
same and the company that makes this
band it's also really good about making
a Nike band that looks pretty much just
like the original now the software story
is really were using the watch becomes
mixed I've been using watch OS 4 since
June and things like the surrey watch
phase have proven to be quite useful for
the most part I'm not really digging the
new design of the dock as it makes it
more difficult to remove applications
once you don't care about them but the
concept remains the same one thing that
I do like about this watch is how it
doesn't require third-party applications
to be able to be useful to you in
Fitness and I also like how it
integrates with Nike Plus even if I
didn't really buy the Nike version of
the watch and I also find it pleasing to
be able to close the activity rings
every day I find this whole concept of
the genius about the only thing that I'd
like is for there to be some sort of a
built-in sleep tracker and other basics
like being able to track my nutrition or
other things that Samsung's gear watches
allow you to do out of the box and the
reason for that is because probably my
biggest complaint with using this watch
over the last couple of months is the
whole app paradigm honestly the last
thing you'll ever want to use with this
watch are the applications like
seriously some applications are so
clunky to load that it'll take you less
time to pull your phone out of your
pocket and just launch them
even native applications like maps are
so unreliable that you sometimes have to
launch them twice or even a third time
to get them to track you somewhere now I
won't complain about things like the GPS
the Apple watch Series two considers to
be one of the most accurate watches that
I've used for a run and even if it's
just for the treadmill the watch's
pedometer is on par with pretty much
every phone that I've used for the same
purpose and believe it or not another
thing that I actually find to be very
good as the battery life even after two
hours of fitness activities I find no
problem in ending the day on a single
charge and as for the speakers and phone
calls well you could try to pull a Dick
Tracy with this thing but the speaker is
not loud enough for you to use it in
public for example to conclude I think
that I speak for many in the fact that
this continues to be a great watch I
mean my biggest complaint is really that
it tries to do too much but you can
always just remove the applications that
you don't want and spare yourself from
the clunky experience I continue to
believe that no one really needs a
SmartWatch but this one is actually a
really good one that complements the
basics even though the price tag is kind
of steep the Apple watch series too is a
damn fine Fitness watch and once you
dress it up accordingly you can also use
this watch on a day-to-day and you
actually look very elegant with it this
is one watch for every single use and I
think that that's actually how every
SmartWatch should be
