to expect for the Galaxy S 10 we've got
some more interesting leaks of the
specifications of the sony xperia x III
if you thought that Samsung was going to
launch the first foldable device it
seems that Huawei is up to the challenge
I'm Jaime Rivera and the face you see
here is of somebody that's been dealing
with allergies I apologize but hey let
us know what you think about the recap
in the comments this is pocket out daily
the official Easter day actually don't
begin with deals for those of you that
like the Oppo find X and wanted to get
yourself the Lamborghini Edition yeah
that one that costs fourteen hundred
bucks you're gonna be actually out of
luck
guessing how much time that phone sold
out for seconds minutes four seconds oh
yes so it seems that people actually
went crazy for it I can't really tell
you much about the phone we're still
waiting for a review unit Oppo thank you
please alright now let's talk about
surveys we've got a very interesting one
from PC Mag where well is surveyed
fifteen hundred people and out of them
forty two percent responded that the
phone that they're waiting for most is
the next iPhone forty six percent for
those of you wondering exactly how many
people went crazy for the Galaxy Note
nine that's already in the market ask
for the next few days twenty four and
then everybody else just mentioned other
devices even the LGB forty so this
definitely means something I just I
wonder where people were surveyed cuz I
feel that that has a lot to do with it
now let's talk about Sony we've got two
very interesting rumors coming from the
company as to what to expect from its
next xperia apparently that forty eight
megapixel sensor is going to make an
appearance in this phone as a single
camera at 1080p display apparently no
not the biggest question is when are we
getting this phone last year well I
would say this year it we have to wait
until them W C and then it took a while
for it to launch so we'll keep you
posted I know we've been covering rumors
of foldable displays for a Samsung
device for the longest time but it seems
that Sammy is not going to be the first
company according to some trusted
sources the company that's pretty much
already geared up and patented and
pretty much just ready to do everything
is Huawei we hear that Sami is not going
to make a launch until early next year
and apparently Huawei is ready by the
end of
this one what exactly are we getting
from Huawei I am extremely curious and
finally the hot news that they have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10
definitely the company needs to raise
the bar as we've heard you know the
surveys and sales and everything when it
comes to the Galaxy S 10 rumors continue
that the announcement will be at CES
which I doubt I feel that it's gonna be
more like MWC but specification z' 12
megapixel primary shooter 13 megapixel
telephoto with 3x optical zoom and then
a 16 megapixel ultra wide-angle camera
is apparently what we're getting here
what else comes to the table is hard to
predict but in today's question let us
know I mean what else would you like to
see from Samsung for you to consider
buying this phone next year because
definitely the next iPhones are coming
we would really like to know what you
think in the comments as I'm really
liking the note 9 as it is but if Apple
comes over with some really crazy
photography on the next iPhone that's
gonna be a steep one leave us a comment
