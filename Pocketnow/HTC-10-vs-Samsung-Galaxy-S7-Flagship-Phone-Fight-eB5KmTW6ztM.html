but that doesn't mean an individual
phone can't give Sammy's flagship a run
for its money I'm Juan Carlos bag now
for pocket now and it's time for a
showdown between the galaxy s7 and the
HTC ten walking around the hardware we
have two stunning examples of
manufacturing with many technological
similarities both phones feature quad HD
displays Qualcomm 820 chipsets four
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage
with support for microSD card expansion
12 megapixel cameras and 3000 milliamp
hour batteries looking at design both
companies are playing with light and
reflections large chamfered edges on the
HTC 10 give this phone a unique look
while metal and glass on the galaxy
looks slick and liquidy the HTC 10 is a
little easier to hold on to and is less
of a fingerprint magnet but the s7 is
smaller in every dimension that size
reduction in part due to the galaxy
using a slightly smaller 5.1 inch
display compared to the 5.2 inch screen
on the HTC and though both have the same
resolution Samsung's AMOLED screen
technology is definitely best-in-class
higher brightness and a better contrast
ratio makes this easier to read outdoors
and a lower minimum brightness setting
makes reading at night easier on the
eyes fingerprint sensor placement is the
same for both phones Hardware home
buttons mounted below the display but
the HTC uses an always-on sensor which
is simply faster at unlocking the phone
and is a little quicker at delivering
you to your home screens as you don't
need to physically press a hardware
button whether you prefer having the
back button on the right or on the left
is of course a personal preference while
the aluminum rear on the HTC feels like
it might be more durable than the glass
on the back of the galaxy we can't
overlook the s7 s ip68 water resistance
rating opposite the HTC 10's IP 53
rating this means the HTC is splash
resistant say you spill a drink on a
table but the Galaxy is more likely to
survive being completely submerged
underwater looking at software this is a
back-to-basics year for HTC while this
NT UI is still applied it's the leanest
skin we've ever seen from this company
the notification shade and multitasking
view now largely stock the most
immediate example of customization
visible to the consumer is the vertical
sliding app drawer with top shortcuts
Samsung's TouchWiz has also become more
refined and a little less garish over
the years the galaxy s7 nicely balanced
is pretty Samsung elements against
snappy UI performance still it is
frustrating to have an app drawer which
won't automatically stay alphabetized
after installing new apps HTC has taken
efforts to reduce the amount of
duplicate services pre-installed on the
10 there's no HTC gallery music or
calendar apps for example those are
fulfilled by Google services Samsung on
the other hand still includes more
manufacturer software for services like
milk a Samsung calendar app and s voice
while some people might consider that
value-added software bloat Samsung does
provide a few handy features like the
new game center launcher which can lock
hardware buttons and record gameplay
videos and while we await Android n
galaxy users can already use
split-screen multitasking to have two
apps on the screen at the same time both
phones include a number of gesture
controls to activate the screen and mute
calls but Samsung has a terrific
one-hand mode via triple click on the
home button it's a little less necessary
on a 5.1 inch screen but it gets us
Hobbit handed folks down to the one
thumb usage that you might find on an
iPhone se performance between these two
phones is unsurprisingly close the
benchmarks are pretty close both phones
slide through their respective UI's
quickly both phones multitask like
champs both phones are powerful gaming
devices and neither phone seems to run
as hot as some of our flagships ran last
year consumers using both devices will
be happy with the power available here
moving to the camera there is one small
organ ah Macbeth fit to the HTC s button
arrangement when lining up ground shots
are mounting the phone on a tripod all
controls are on the top of the phone the
galaxy makes it more difficult to reach
some buttons when mounted or makes it
more likely to accidentally hit
those buttons in use especially when
lining up ground shots as for the
cameras themselves HTC is much improved
over previous one series phones but
Samsung features an overall better
refined photo and video experience
sensor and lens performance is quite
close but image processing on JPEGs is
more pleasing on the galaxy in most
scenarios HTC now includes laser focus
assistance which improves focus accuracy
but Samsung's dual pixel technology is
significantly faster and just as
accurate image is taken directly out of
each phone tend to favor the galaxy in
most lighting scenarios and fun features
like panorama shots tend to be better
stitched together on the Samsung a video
follows this same pattern Samsung's
image stabilization produces a smoother
overall float to samples we also have
more options to play with here like 60
frames per second HD video and the slow
motion is finer than what HTC can
produce in the pro mode the galaxy s7
also delivers options to control white
balance and manual focus where the HTC
only provides simple exposure
compensation where the script flips is
on selfie camera performance stills are
pretty close between both phones but the
image stabilized front shooter on the
HTC 10 delivers a nicer video to look at
even though the Samsung can shoot a
higher resolution video on the s7 for
folks interested in doing a little
vlogging or capturing their memories
from that front shooter the HTC 10
produces the nicer output moving to
audio performance this is HTC's domain
playback on these new split boomsound
speakers is more nuanced than what
Samsung can deliver while we're
listening directly to speaker output the
HTC score is a significant win by
pointing the main audio source directly
at your face as opposed to out the
bottom edge of the phone
headphone playback is also a noticeable
win for the ten louder clearer punchier
better dynamic range and lower noise if
headphone playback is a killer app for
you the HTC ten definitely needs to be
on your list of devices to check out and
looking at the various ports on both
phones viewers might have noticed that
the HTC 10 comes with USB type-c in
casual testing USB C doesn't seem to
provide any significant benefit to
operation over the microUSB port on the
Galaxy a transferring a 1 gigabyte file
onto each phone and then moving that 1
gig file back to the PC took roughly the
same amount of time on both phones we're
yet to see what USB C can actually bring
to the Android experience but for now
users will simply get to enjoy a
reversible cable design while this is a
well refined galaxy Samsung is still
king for packing in additional features
and hardware from an always-on display
for notifications to the venerable
heartrate monitor there just always
seems to be more stuff included on every
galaxy device though a small passionate
group of consumers will miss the IR
blasters absent from each phone moving
over to battery life in real-world usage
these two are also unsurprisingly close
both phones lasted past dinner time with
moderate usage and several automobile
multitasking situations in our media
test streaming 30 minutes of HD video
over Wi-Fi at 50% brightness the HTC
drained 6 percent of its battery while
the galaxy s7 drained 5 percent with so
many other Hardware similarities we
might hypothesize that Samsung's current
AMOLED displays more power efficient
than HTC's backlit LCD
however HTC charges significantly faster
than Samsung thanks to the quick charge
3.0 standard 30 minutes on the chargers
included with each phone the Galaxy s7
topped off 30% of its battery while the
HTC managed 44% for folks on the run the
10 will deliver more juice from short
stints on a charger of course the Galaxy
does include wireless charging standard
so Samsung's phone is a bit more
flexible in how it can be topped off
whether you value speed or flexibility
is an important question to ask as
neither have remove
batteries so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us between the HTC 10
and the Galaxy S Evan well this has been
a damn fun fight to produce last year's
HTC's were fairly underwhelming but the
10 gets us back on track
know one single phone can upset
Samsung's market dominance but what we
hope to see our handsets that can spur
on more innovation in competition the
HTC 10 is much better equipped this year
to give Samsung a proper fight as a lot
of this core hardware is similar the
rest comes down to specific usage needs
and subjective preferences metal versus
glass AMOLED vs. LCD sense vs. TouchWiz
do you want a good camera with very good
audio playback or would you prefer good
audio with a very good camera this is a
great problem for consumers to face
choosing between two very good
smartphones as always thanks so much for
