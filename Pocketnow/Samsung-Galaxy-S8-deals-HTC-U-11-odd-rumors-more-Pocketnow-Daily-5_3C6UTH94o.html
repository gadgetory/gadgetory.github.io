paint the pretty picture for what to
expect Motorola is reportedly working on
a tablet that will apparently change
productivity and Samsung has begun to
get aggressive about deals of the Galaxy
S 8 I'm Jaime Rivera and may the force
be with you and hopefully sleep us with
me after this as insomnia is killing
movies reviews but this is Parkin out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you thought that you were too
late to get that gear VR with controller
for the pre-order deals of the galaxy s
8 t-mobile is actually extending that to
May 14th
so yeah you still get the option to get
that gear VR I actually have been
enjoying it so far I think the
controller is really what it was missing
I highly suggest to go to try I mean
it's free but that's not the only deal
that you can get right now for the
galaxy s 8 the company is actually also
bundling a couple of extras if you get
the phone with contract and absolutely
everything Samsung is offering six
months of Netflix to help you consume
that Netflix they're adding that
stand-up cover that you can also get in
addition to a 64 gigabyte memory card
and all this just consider the fact that
you're also getting that gear VR as part
of the deal if you go for the t-mobile
variant I think that it's just getting
better and better now let's talk about
Motorola and tablets and the last time
we have that conversation motorola in
elevated with the first ever Android
tablet and that didn't really go so well
with zoom but anyways we hear that the
company wants to reinvent Android
productivity and the reason why it wants
to is because there are some leaks that
show us this productivity mode where you
can split window multitask on Android
which is something you can already do
but in addition to that apparently you
can multitask applications within the
navigation bar up meaning you can
actually have Android behave like
Windows pretty much I cannot wait to see
what it is I just hope it doesn't flop
again how about if we move the spotlight
over to fit but this continues to be the
company that sells the most wearables in
the world but it's quarter results are
not good at all the company is reporting
40 percent drop in revenue
that is a staggering amount of money of
you consider it but then again the
company's sales are at the same level it
did predict that its sales were going to
be down it's actually better than it
predicted but interesting CEOs argument
is that the company is working hard on a
smartwatch we should expect it very soon
obviously with the whole acquisition of
pebble we can't wait to see what we get
and finally the very interesting and
almost disappointing rumors that I have
to do with the HTC u 11 it won't be the
first time that the company tries to
tell us how things should be done and
does not succeed it did so with the for
ultra pixel camera that took great
photos but it for ultra pixels at a time
when the standard camera was 8
megapixels now we hear that the U 11 is
going to ditch the headphone jack yet
again positive side of the fact that the
Super LCD 5 is making a comeback I love
that display and yeah we get a bevy of
wallpapers but hey it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about HTC ditching the headphone jack
yet again I mean you hold a Galaxy s8
it's got it you hold the g6 it's got it
makes you wonder I mean one is HTC
trying to pull a you ultra again I have
high hopes for the stone being so thin
that it just can't fit but I could also
be wrong leave us a comment down below
