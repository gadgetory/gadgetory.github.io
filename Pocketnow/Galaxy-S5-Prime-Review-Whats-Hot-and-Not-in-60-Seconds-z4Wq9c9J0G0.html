sometimes a few extra letters make all
the difference how much better is the so
called galaxy s5 prime then it's
subprime predecessor the answer in
Pocket now is 62nd smartphone review
starting right now so here's what's hot
all the good stuff about the Galaxy s5
is here again only more so the already
great internals get a bump to truly top
shelf the display manages to get even
sharper without sacrificing battery life
the software packs a few features you
can't find on US models and the casing
maintains the water and dust resistance
that makes carrying the s5 a mostly
worryfree experience here's what's not
hot
that ingress defying casing is also one
of the most boring you can find on the
market the software still has growing up
to do in the looks and usability
departments and basic elements like call
and speaker quality and need some work
oh and it can't take a low-light photo
to save its life the upshot this thing
isn't even available outside of South
Korea unless you do what we did and snag
it from a retailer like 28 mobile if you
already have a stock s5 the prime
probably isn't worth the extra cost but
if you truly need the best of the Galaxy
S line there's no question about it this
is it for 8 more minutes on the Galaxy S
5 prime check out our full review here
