packing.com and you may remember seeing
Joe Levi shows the video about how to
run Android apps
on a Windows 7 PC and it worked very
well with that BlueStacks software which
is invaded and I thought it would be fun
to try it out on a Windows 8 tablet and
see how it works with a multi-touch
especially since a lot of Windows 8
tablets might be coming out later this
year some of you might want to run
Android apps on it so let's check it out
so first off when we have the BlueStacks
app installed it comes up in the classic
environment in Windows 8 and we see this
little window and right now I have the
Amazon App Store loaded and we can touch
to scroll it's a little laggy but
there's our notifications bar now you
have to remember that this is a beta
program right now BlueStacks is in beta
and Windows 8 is also in beta so we have
a lot of potential for bugs and this
particular tablet is an HP TouchSmart TM
2 from that was released before the
first iPad was released so that's kind
of old but we can run some Android
programs let's try that and we can
scroll through here works pretty good
there's our home button there's your map
and it's not super smooth but we can
scroll and it does not work with
multi-touch very well but it works a
little bit so that's pretty cool
when I install BlueStacks I got an error
about graphics drivers so you'll
probably need a better driver support in
Windows 8 when both of these become
available
and when it freezes up you can go down
here and restart while we're rebooting
BlueStacks we can really easily swap to
other Windows 8 apps still get to the
Start menu and then we are back to loose
text let's try this app
you can beat them
that's multi-touch you're working
and we lost Facebook app you will see it
in a small window and that seems to work
pretty nicely so here's your pop-up
keyboard you can type stuff here but if
we want to use the windows 8 keyboard it
doesn't seem to work except for spaces
so a few bugs still in there
here's the Google Search app or works
pretty good and we can go to web pages
and we do have multi-touch zooming
so a little bit of lag but it's good to
see multi-touch support is in there so
that's a quick look at BlueStacks app
for running Android apps on Windows 8
tablets there's still a lot of bugs in
there problems with drivers but it's
pretty cool to be able to actually run
Android apps on a Windows 8 tablet give
us a thumbs up if you like this video
and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
