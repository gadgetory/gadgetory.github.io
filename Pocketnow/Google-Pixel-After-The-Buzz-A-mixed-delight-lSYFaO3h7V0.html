story every single time the media goes
crazy over every hot new device but
after that review period wears off so
what is the bus behind that new tool you
might still want to buy but that now
faces new competition the thing is in
the real world things don't really
happen that way for most of us aging is
just as important as the moment you
unbox your product for the first time
it's how that device performs after
expensive use that really matters down
the line so let's do something about it
let's have a second look at Google's
boldest attempt at making its partners
its own competitors I'm hiding that
event with pocket now and this is the
Google pixel after the buzz I spent the
last couple of months having this odd
love and hate relationship with the
Google pixel after my love affair with
devices like the Galaxy Nexus and the
Nexus 6p both the largest phones of
their time I explicitly decided to
decline the larger pixel XL and use the
smaller Google pixel as my personal
communicator for years this job has
belonged to iPhones given the size and
reliability but after six months of
switching things up I'll admit I am NOT
regretting my decision one bit
for starters using a Google phone has
advantages that other phones don't offer
and software is one of them we're
currently running Android 7.1.2 already
since software updates are never a
problem here the experience even after
so long is still smooth or I can't
really remember the time I've ever seen
this phone stutter and where games play
great even if I then really buy this
phone for that purpose I know some of
you hate the way I arranged icons on the
home screen but the pixel launcher is
really my dreamboat when it comes to
icon density for me having more than
three panes on a home screen is a
problem and the grid on this launcher is
ideal for fitting almost everything that
I want in just one screen and yes
because I know everybody's going to ask
I do know that this is the first phone
to run the Google assistant
but the most I've ever used it for is
really just setting reminders setting
timers and giving me directions to drive
home for everything else the Google
assistant is still not compatible with
most third-party services that I use
like uber for example so until that
happens I will call this a good work in
progress but it is still a work in
progress now the second and most
important reason that I chose that pixel
is my communicator is project Phi in the
United States you get the advantage of
seamless transitions between Wi-Fi and
three US carriers but it's mostly when
I'm abroad of the pixel is most valuable
I think you've noticed that I travel a
lot and roaming on project Phi is
perfect not just because of the cost but
because in countries like China this is
one of the few ways you can actually
access Google services like if you were
still in the United States and then if
you do the math of the ten dollars a
gigabyte of data while roaming this is
actually better than it sounds
see if you haven't really consumed your
US gigs the roaming ones will continue
feeding off your existing plan meaning
it's not starting off another ten
gigabytes like seriously I just spent
nearly a month in Europe from that you
see and my phone bill was a stupid $56
that's actually cheaper than going for
prepaid sim in Spain for example the
third unexpected benefit is that I don't
really know how this phone handles
battery life but it rocks at first I was
skeptical at the major 27 70 milliamp
hour power pack but Android 7.1
optimizations have proven to be amazing
at being able to keep me connected
through a full day of use and I use this
phone a lot and then the fourth benefit
which is another unexpected one and it's
the experience I've had with this camera
Google said that this was the best
smartphone camera in the world and BSO
marks it is that way - at first I
thought that this was just a PR stunt
given the hardware but I'm going to say
that the experience has been awesome so
long as you're not picking about lens
flares since Google hasn't really solved
that yet
I'm just shocked at how quickly this
phone takes a photo how quick hdr+ does
post-processing in the background and
how well software is able to do things I
thought that Hardware just couldn't do
I'm a big fan of sunset photography for
example and I'm just shocked at how well
this phone handles dynamic range
saturation and contrast and then the
same goes for video where the moment you
hit the record button I still find the
effect of instant civilization to be
surreal even if the phone doesn't
include Hardware civilization out of the
box and remember that unlimited Google
Drive storage for photos well trust me I
take a lot of them and I don't know how
this phone does it because I have been
able to survive just well with 32
gigabytes and it's really that concept
that makes me love this phone the most
and things like the camera and the
battery you really don't need to worry
just let the phone do its work in the
background which is the way software
should be for consumers
now what's not so surreal is how the
hardware has aged and notice this would
be my first after the buzz where I leave
this portion last see the aluminum
finish that I praised in my reviews
seems to no longer be so quite black as
areas have faded over time I carry this
phone the sleeves and it seems that the
inner strap has taken a toll on the
champers this phone has also seen two
very hard drops on tile and even if the
aluminum has handled the Falls well this
coloration can be seen everywhere along
the champers this is about that time
where I recommend that you use a case
and I would suggest these options from
VRS design that even add a kickstand I
am amazed at the fact that even after
the two Falls the display is still
scratch free first with all the phones
that I've reviewed but the downside is
that it's really hard to keep it clean
something that's really annoying when
you have a phone with bezels this large
about the only thing that's aged will in
the hardware department is the company's
choice for internals with to 2017
flagship is already rocking the same
processor and even the RAM and storage
options
to be fair and to conclude let's
remember that the Google pixel is not
supposed to be about its hardware Google
is a software company first and for
those of you praising iPhones or how
well the software makes forgettable
hardware look this is exactly that in
the Android space so far I have to admit
this is probably one of the most
delightful experiences I've had with a
smartphone and notice I'm not just
including Android phones on that list
sadly the problem is that forgettable
Hardware is not an easy game to play in
2017 with black ships like the LG G 6 in
the galaxy s 8 just annihilating bezels
and killing it with their new designs
buying a Google pixel at the same price
is kind of a lost battle if Google
decides to drop the price of this phone
I would not mind recommending it at all
but unless your preferences are locked
to great software unforgettable looks

your options for 2017 friends just like
