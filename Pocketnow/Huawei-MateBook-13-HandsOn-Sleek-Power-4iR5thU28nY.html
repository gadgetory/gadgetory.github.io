reviewers crown the huawei mate book X
Pro is one of the best laptops of 2018
sleek design and specs so powerful that
some of the videos in this show are
being edited by one of these computers
now we're at CES 2019 and the company is
showing us new things this is the huawei
mate book 13 we've also got the huawei
media Pad m5 light
I'm home it'll be better with pocket now
with Jools Wang on camera let's dive in
let's begin with the mate book 13 this
one actually stands in between the mate
book ex-pro and the mate book and it
looks slightly thicker but the
difference really is the fact that it
doesn't taper like the other laptops do
there are actually two skews mystic
silver and Space Gray and it's actually
a rather light very sleek looking
computer at least two skews one is of an
eighth generation Core i5 with Intel
graphics 256 gigs of storage and the
other is an eighth generation Core i7
with discrete and video graphics and 512
gigs of storage the rest is pretty much
the same both machines have 8 gigabytes
of RAM 2 USB C ports for data transfer
DisplayPort and charging Wi-Fi 802 a
leaven AC Bluetooth 5 and a 41 want our
battery along with a 65 watt charger
included while it claims nine point six
hours of battery if you go for the
discrete graphics model and 10 hours if
you go for the integrated graphics
obviously things that we will have to
test content consumption is King here
we've got a 13 inch screen at 2160 by
1440 and 3 by 2 aspect ratio that's also
a touch screen to top it off we have
stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support
but you know what's best the nose cam is
actually gone now place in a more
conventional area even if with just one
megapixel one way also includes a more
accurate click that addressing another
one of my gripes with the other variants
we've got Windows 10 home signature
edition meaning very little bloat but
you also get a full year of office 365
included price points begin at 999 and
up to $12.99 for the higher SKU and
launch is apparently on January 29th now
let's talk about the huawei media pad m5
light which has got decent
specifications a sleek design but
probably one of its coolest things is
its family friendly features there's a
Kids Korner app included that allows you
to set a different fingerprint when your
kids unlock it at the Falls tickets
corner and when you unlock it at
defaults to your user gets corner lets
you select applications a time limits
and even an eye comfort mode
and everything else we have Huawei's 2.5
D glass design along with a sandblasted
finish in this space great color that's
actually really nice content consumption
is also great with a 10.1 inch full HD
IPS screen that's very bright
there are also quad speakers Co
engineered by Harman Kardon that the
company claims are plenty loud and
included in the Box is the Huawei M pen
light which also allows you to do a
little creative work with a tablet
internally there's the Karen 659
processor three gigs of ram 32 gigs of
storage and a 7500 milliamp hour battery
that's rated for 13 hours of video
playback the cherry chopper believe it
or not the stylus is included in the box
there is expandable storage and this
tablet begins at just $2.99
let us know what you think about these
products in the comments down below so
far that made book 13 is probably one of
my favorites and this tablet I
definitely want to use for my kids while
you're at it make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one then follow me on
Twitter Hind underscore Yvette on
instagram @ hi meri behna please give

watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
