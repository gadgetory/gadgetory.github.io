attempt to artificial intelligence Apple
takes over smartphone profits as other
companies fall over and remember that
subscription service for the google play
store that nobody really wants except
developers yeah it's happening I'm hi
meri behna and there's nothing better to
honor mondays than to pre-record videos
just for the old times sake this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with windows 10 mobile and I
know we rarely talk about it but hey
Evan blast recently leaked some photos
of a possible Windows Phone that could
probably be the surface phone and
eventually there were some other tweets
that show the parent Lee this wasn't
really a concept it seems that there are
more photos it seems that there are more
tests the question is why didn't this
product get announced in the surface
event will see why now one very
skeptical story right now is the fact
that the google play store is apparently
getting subscription services very soon
the whole prospect of this is for
developers to monetize more from
consumers by offering you their services
or premium services should we say if you
subscribe to their application the
problem with this is that if you're
playing for spotify plus netflix plus
whatever other services you're paying
for the last thing you want to do is to
pay for playing a game or to pay for you
know playing a specific app but it's
apparently going to happen stay tuned or
don't stay tuned if you believe that the
launch of the new retina macbook pro
with us bc connectors when pretty much
everything that apple sells elsewhere
like the iphone does not include
anything that has to do with us bc is
ridiculous it seems that apple kind of
got the memo as well the company has
decided to drop the price tag of
everything that's USBC from the company
meaning if you're looking for any sort
of adapter dongle or whatever it is that
you're going to need to be able to
connect your own Apple products to other
apple products they're around twenty to
thirty percent off you can learn more
than inscription and speaking of Apple
the company is still making money lots
of profits when it comes to the
smartphone business according to some
reason analytics as of last quarter
apple
pretty much made 107 percent of the
smartphone profits now obviously there
is no such thing as 107 percent the
reason why that number is over is
because every other company is reporting
losses including Samsung particularly
with everything that happened with the
galaxy note 7 bad news and finally the
very interesting news today have to do
with Samsung and it's a temp of the
galaxy s 8 to bring another artificial
intelligence service so we know that s
voice is really something you don't
really even care about that somewhere
around your galaxy somewhere well
apparently Samsung wants to try it it
again we're not sure if it's going to be
called s voice again we're not sure what
the parent company is as apple acquired
Syrian then it became a service or we
know google has been using google now
and google voice services forever for
its assistant the question is exactly
what is going to be the backbone for
samsung service and it kind of makes you
a little skeptical mainly because google
is trying to sell everyone this
assistant and it seems that samsung
wants to try it on its own so it leads
me to the question of the day if you
have to choose when you prefer the
Google assistance or when you prefer
another s voice in my case just give me
one service the Google assistant and
that'd be it please leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
