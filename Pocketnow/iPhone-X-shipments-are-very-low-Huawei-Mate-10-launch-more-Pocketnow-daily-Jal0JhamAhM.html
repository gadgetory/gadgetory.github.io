Foxconn but the numbers are not enticing
at all the huawei mate Tennant May 10
Pro go live and impressed with their
features and we get the first leaked and
blurry photos of what to expect from the
razor phone I'm high metal Iveta and I
know it's funny when I've been covering
rumors of a product that I've seen about
a week ago but anyways this is pocket
out daily the official news today begin
with deals but those deals are ending
tomorrow so hurry up if you're in the
market for a Galaxy Note 8 the buy one
get one deals are over tomorrow on
t-mobile and it is extremely enticing we
think about it you can opt in for the
Galaxy Note 8 and another one or pretty
much other galaxy variants you can learn
more about the deal in the link in the
description remember these kind of go
all the time
now let's talk about the BlackBerry
motion for those of you that want to see
that device and full flesh no more need
for leaks I mean BlackBerry's cool they
are already showing as a video of what
to expect from the phone and it looks
grippy and nice from the back I'm still
trying to decide if I like it from the
front with that huge button at the
bottom let us know what you think in the
comments now it's all about iPhones two
things most important number one
analysts are claiming that the iPhone 8
is selling a lot less than the iPhone 7
which is expected as people are waiting
for the iPhone 10 the thing about the
iPhone 10 is that on separate news we
hear that Foxconn has begun to ship
devices to Apple the biggest problem is
guess how many apparently Foxconn has
only been able to produce 50,000 units
that is that's too little for a phone
that can sell more than a million units
in a day so oh it's gonna be pandemonium
when that phone launches I can't well I
can wait to see that I hope I don't have
to deal with that but apparently that's
gonna be the case now let's talk about
the razor phone this is one phone I'm
actually really looking forward to
because I want to see how it's going to
improve mobile gaming but regardless we
see some leaked images dual cameras
black display that's expected but then
it looks a lot like the next bit Robin
we see rounded buttons and everything
and hey it's the next bit Robin team
that has come to Razer to build his
phone so it makes all the sense in the
world we're hoping that they use better
materials and in the case of the next
fit Rob
whatever the case might be again my
biggest question is how is this phone
going to change mobile gaming cuz I'm
not really that much of a fan of what we
have right now and finally the very hot
news today I have to do with the Huawei
make 10 and may 10 Pro I saw a lot of
polarizing comments today over how the
may 10 Pro has lesser specifications
that the made 10 makes a lot of sense I
don't know why Huawei make the jump to
quad HD on the may 10 but not on the may
10 Pro it makes a lot of sense but still
I mean if you see these phones side by
side you really can't tell a difference
I like the May 10 pros taller design and
the water resistance but then we have
the problem that there is no expandable
storage and there is no headphone jack
though always not really famous for
their audio quality anyway still as I
was talking to my friend Ed abang the
advantage with the headphone jack is
being able to connect another DAC to
that so it's very interesting to read
every single one of your comments I
would like to know what you think here
on this video would you by any of these
phones I mean the biggest problem with
Huawei devices is not the quality of
their products the quality is amazing
but they don't really sell that much in
the United States so I'd love to know in
the comments what you think friends
