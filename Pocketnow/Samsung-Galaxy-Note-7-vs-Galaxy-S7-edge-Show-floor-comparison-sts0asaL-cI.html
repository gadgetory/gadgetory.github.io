and now Samsung launches its new Galaxy
Note 7 just to make the debate more
complicated I'm highlighting that up
with pocket now reporting from New York
City and let's take a quick look at
which option might be better
20:16 is definitely Samsung's best year
not just because of the company's bottom
line but because for the first time ever
its products are not just the result of
good marketing whether you choose the
galaxy s7 the larger galaxy s7 edge the
more robust galaxy s7 active or the
latest galaxy note 7 you are guaranteed
to invest in the best of the best now
calling any of these is a better phone
is a tough one instead I'd suggest that
you pick the one that matches your
budget all devices support grade quad HD
displays the best 12 megapixel cameras
in the market ip68 water and dust
resistance and excellent battery life
now if you want to go all out you'd have
to pick either the galaxy s7 edge or the
new galaxy note 7 but the note 7
provides a lot more extras at just the
hundred dollar difference sure both
devices support edge features in the
launcher and both offer sleek curves
that would make anyone drool but with
the note 7 your storage begins at 64
gigs expandable via microSD or as on the
edge you're getting 32 gigs plus
expandability the s-pen may not be a
feature that most people like but it can
be really handy for signing PDFs on the
go or as your surrogate Mouse but this
way on the galaxy note 7 is also
stronger with Gorilla Glass 5 vs.
Gorilla Glass 4 on the edge the note 7
also sports USB type-c which is future
proof though supporting only quick
charge 2.0 means that both devices
charge just as fast probably the biggest
difference comes with the iris scanner
that is only available on the note 7
which comes in handy in the winter of
you're wearing gloves or if you want
authentic ation to default only to you
and not just any other fingerprint
probably the only specification where
the galaxy s7 edge defeats the note is
in the 100 million power battery
capacity difference but we'll have to
wait and judge performance once our
review units arrive the fact of the
matter is that this comparison is very
tough if your budget is limited and you
want a very hot looking phone that
leaves you hundred dollars in your
pocket then the galaxy s7 edge has been
in the market for a while now if you
want a phone that can do a lot more for
just a hundred bucks it doesn't get any
better than with the galaxy note 7
we'll be reporting back very soon with a
full comparison of everything else once
