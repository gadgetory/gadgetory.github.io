fetching shade of lavender lands on
Pocket now's Instagram page greeted by
the triumphant call of better late than
never
yes indeed we're a little late here in
the US so let's get right to it
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is your unboxing and first Hardware
tour the Sony Xperia z2 it won't be
coming to the United States until summer
but we were able to get our hands on one
just the same thanks to the good people
at GSM nation they're one of the first
American retailers to carry the Xperia
z2 and if you want one of your own you
can find a link in the description below
or just visit gsm nation.com and tell
them PocketNow sent you taking a quick
tour around the box we're confronted
with the model number DS 60 503 the
device formerly known as the serious
sony's bevy of brand names is in
evidence here as well from the
triluminos display to the ex reality
engine to the Exmor RS image processing
and beyond this device is available in
three colors but spoiler alert gsm
nation sent us the most interesting of
the bunch which we appreciate yes it's
purple and no it's not subtle in terms
of box contents not much to speak of
that we do have a couple treats in the
form of a set of wired headphones and a
charging dock don't necessarily expect
those in the carrier variants reportedly
coming to the US but it's nice to see
them here nonetheless get those out of
the way and we can have a gander at the
phone
sorry no screen peel this time is there
was no protector in sight but hopefully
the specs and the violaceous beauty of
this hardware will make up for it on the
subject of hardware this is the real
deal folks Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 three
gigs of ram 20 points seven megapixel
camera capable of 4k video a 5.2 inch
display and Android 4.4.2 all of it
encased in a glass and metal chassis
just eight point two millimeters thin
but which is also pretty hefty at 163
grams oh and of course it's water and
dust resistant if this Hardware looks
familiar it should they're looking at
something very similar to Sony's Z 1 and
Z 1s here and everything from form to
fit and finish
vielen hand is right on also carried
over a microsd card slot hardware camera
key and a pronounced power standby
button on the right hand side elsewhere
to this device is largely a variation on
the established theme we've got a lot of
ground to cover in a pretty short time
if we want to get this review going so
we're going to leave the hardware tour
at that once more we want to thank the
folks at GSM nation tweeting at GSM
nation for the review device and we
encourage all of you to leave a comment
down below letting us know what you to
most like to see from our Sony Xperia z2
review and comparison coverage coming
