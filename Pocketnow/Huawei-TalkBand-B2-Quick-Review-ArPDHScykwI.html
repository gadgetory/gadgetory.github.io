well I'm Jules along with the pocket now
and this is our review of the hallway
talk band b2 our Beatty unit came with a
22 millimeter thermoplastic polyurethane
band it has plastic in the name but it's
been made to resist sweat and oils it's
okay as plastic feels and goes but
there's also a leather band option if
that's not your style the module that's
attached to a band holds the device
itself and while it's water-resistant
it's not waterproof so don't go to the
shower with it the manual tells you to
wipe it dry if you happen to get it wet
pressing the one button on the b2 turns
on a monochrome Pima LED touchscreen
which can also be activated by either
raising or violently flicking your wrist
without a GPS the talk band relies on a
6 axis gyro scope and an accelerometer
for measurements using the device is
simple after connecting the talk band
with your phone of choice via bluetooth
and downloading the hallway wear app you
sleep you exercise and you let the b2
track it all for you specifically it can
vlog walking running stair mastering and
biking if you saw my 24 hours video the
talk band b2 had a little trouble doing
all of that it seems that the device can
confuse walking with running or even
cycling given the right conditions I can
verify doubts about the sleep tracking
as well it had me awake for an hour in
which I was actually still sleeping it
takes an hour and a half to charge the
b2 from zero to full and while alway
claims a theoretical 5 days of use I
found myself getting between 3 or 4
without the headset and between one and
a half and two and a half days with some
streaming radio your Bluetooth
connection the number of phones you
connect to the band yes you can actually
do two of them captain two phones and
overall mileage may vary
probably the device out of the tray we
reveal the charging port and the
earpiece listening to media through that
year piece we found audio quality to be
on par with headphone output but the
volume was lacking
even in moderate background noise to not
take a call on the b2 you can long press
the button on the device to take a call
on the b2 you have the option of single
pressing the button or releasing the
earpiece from the tray but the dual
microphone setup didn't provide the best
voice pickup respondents initially said
my voice intermittently got clipped no
matter how close I was to the phone it
took a little bit of adjusting the
earpiece before the caller deemed sound
quality tolerable but still average so
what did hallway set out to do with the
talk B&amp;amp;B - not much but it didn't do not
much that well perhaps if there was GPS
or there were better designed earpieces
maybe it could work at 180 US dollars
though we don't think so quite yet our
hallway coverage continues with the p8
Lite video review shortly in the
meantime if you like what you saw here
