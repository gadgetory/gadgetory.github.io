break with the pixel two issues that
just emerged Apple continues to address
iphone tennis shoes with new software
updates and it seems that the HTC vive
is getting a major update very soon I'm
hey Matt are Iveta
and I know this is late but one video
that's laid is better than no video at
all I think this is a pocket out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for some really
good unlock phones Huawei offerings are
definitely some of the ones that I
recommend most and the company is
offering some Black Friday deals on
Newegg and other companies where you
have devices that are more than $100 off
the list is rather large so you can
learn more in the description
and speaking of products my god
om why is it so late in the year and we
continue to get product announcements we
we need some time off but it turns out
that honor has just teased that there
will be an event on November 28th for
the honor v10 what exactly are we
getting here not exactly sure the teaser
looks interesting we should be reporting
on whatever happens on that day now I'm
sort of the spotlight over to the HTC
vive probably one of the major
complaints about this product was the
resolution of the visor and we have some
trusted sources that are claiming that
there will be an update that will bring
ultra HD resolution here and that
definitely the current vibe will
continue in the market though it will be
a lot more affordable whatever the case
may be a when that's going to happen
it's very hard to predict but I am
assuming CES could be the date now let's
discuss some software update test Apple
has just pushed iOS 11 point 1.2 to the
iPhone 10 and it's iphones and what's
being fixed here is whatever freezing
issues the iphone 10 was having
depending on low temperatures etc the
company never really told us what was
going on the most important thing is you
definitely want to jump on this update
i'm currently downloading it so hey if
you want to hit me up on twitter just to
make sure that everything went well
i'll let you know later tonight what
happens and finally the very
disappointing news that they have to do
yet again with the google pixels but
this time not the Google pixel to excel
we're actually going to talk about the
gold pixel to is apparently the unlock
variant does not bring an unlockable
bootloader
and like really I think this is one
thing you would never expect from an
Android phone made by Google but as it
turns out it seems that the settings
don't allow this yet for reasons we
don't yet understand apparently it could
be a software bug we're not exactly sure
the thing about it for today's question
is really do you think that Google is
tarnishing its reputation with all of
the different
shoes that we've seen with their
products since launch in my case I feel
it does I mean when you launch your
product I mean just take your time and
do something good but that's just my
opinion I would really love to know what
you think about Google lately in the
comments down below
