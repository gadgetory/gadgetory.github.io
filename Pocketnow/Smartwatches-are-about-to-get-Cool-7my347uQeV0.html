what I'd call great you have to charge
them every day companies had to get
creative about power management with
either a secondary screen or none at all
some were either Fitness watches or
luxury but not both and even if most
claimed to help you stay healthy their
fitness services aren't really the best
so when Paul Keim announced that they
had a solution to all of my biggest
complaints I was compelled to fly over
to San Francisco and check it out
I'm highly mentally better with pocket
now and let's talk about the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 3100 platform
so and let's show the architecture of
how a SmartWatch operates was rethought
from the ground up what makes the new
3100 platform special is this tiny
little coprocessor that took 2 years to
develop holcomb has discovered that the
average SmartWatch user only interacts
with the full capabilities of it for
five percent of the time so the company
has developed an alternative for the
other 95 percent the new coprocessor has
the power to make most SmartWatch
essentials work on its own and then
becomes far more powerful in conjunction
with the regular processor this allows
three key experiences that we were able
to see in a concept design at the event
the first is an enhanced ambient mode
powered by the coprocessor luxury brands
really want their watches to stand out
instead of just showing a dead display
and this isn't just an always-on display
that you knew before we're talking about
16 color options a smooth second hand
live complications and even ambient
light sensor support to have the screen
adapt to the light surrounding it this
means that your watch face will look
great regardless of what mode you're in
this also enables a secondary experience
which is called traditional watch mode
if your watch were ever to run low on
battery the wear OS portion of the watch
shuts down but instead of walking around
with a dead watch this allows most of
the features of the enhanced ambient
mode to work meaning you'll still get a
watch face with hours seconds and
minutes and even day complications at 50
percent battery the watch can work for
up to a week on this mode and a crazy 30
days of you decide to go traditional
watch mode when fully charged the third
which launches early next year is a
dedicated sports mode the coprocessor
allows up to 15 hours of fitness
activities versus a regular three that
you get today this includes using both
the GPS in the heart rate sensor at the
same time etc another improvement is
that OMS can now provide their own
algorithms and applications to customize
the fitness experience of using the
watch this opens the door to a new
project stamina that Qualcomm teased for
a major Fitness brand to join the
platform early next year last but not
least welcome affirms its relationship
with Google and Guero
for the rest of the time that your watch
is not idle you'll be able to access
everything the mobile operating system
is capable of I even had a chance to
play with the new ware or Wes and I
really liked what I saw and then there
are other enhancements like an updated
and a C chip that takes advantage of
smaller antennas the power management
system has been simplified the DSP the
sensors etc were all redone to be more
efficient battery life improvements
depend on the battery size display etc
but the company claims that they can
vary between four to up to twelve hours
again depending on your hardware so when
can you get it well the Montblanc summit
two will be the first in October with a
fossil group and even Louis Vuitton
following later this year so yes this is
the Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 3100 I have
to admit I am really excited from the
experience that I had with the concept
design I think that smartwatches finally
had the break that they needed let me
know in the comments down below what you
think and while you're at it make sure
you follow us on social media subscribe
to our channel as well for more videos
like this one you also follow me on
Twitter hi managers quarterly that are
on Instagram at high memory data please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm Jaime but I thanks so
much for watching we'll see you on the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
