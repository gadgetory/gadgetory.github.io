developers with some minor enhancements
some Android source code reveals some
plans for their enhanced camera features
and yes even Qualcomm brings us their
own SmartWatch I'm high memory data and
yeah yeah yeah I missed you guys too
this is PocketNow daily let's say off
with some official news as google has
just updated their windows phone search
application and yes this or another
platform it wouldn't be celebrating but
since poke these companies haven't
really gotten along well with their
whole YouTube quarrel it's great to see
that something has happened I mean
you're not getting google now spill but
at least you're getting the enhanced
voice search aside from the same
aesthetics from the google application
that we currently see on ios and android
hopefully we will be seeing some
enhancements in the future sins you can
finally even log on now with your google
account and speaking of Google we've got
some source code leaks from Android 4.4
KitKat and as it turns out the company
is working hard and bringing as a new
completely revamped service for their
photos which hallelujah I mean that was
greatly needed right now and Kit Kat and
weren't finally getting it barely we're
getting support for raw photographs
which is great aside from a new complete
UI and new api's as well for the camera
the problem is we you obviously don't
know what we're getting it but it's
great to see if they're finally working
on it as the nexus 5 has a great lens
and software it just doesn't match it
now let's talk about Qualcomm and not
about smartphone processors the
company's brand as a SmartWatch it's
called the talk as in toq i hope i
pronounced that right and what makes
this SmartWatch special is that you'll
get an always-on display you'll also get
bluetooth stereo support a second the
fact that it's also got great wireless
charging so they say aside from android
support as well but something we still
don't know what to expect from this
thing it will be released on Cyber
Monday and it will join the crazy price
tag of $350 like the Galaxy gear so good
luck with that now let's talk about
Apple as the company has just rolled out
I OS 7.1 beta to developers which is
really interesting we don't have any
Apple events that are coming or at least
none that we know of and we're getting a
newer point one update which usually has
an event
every single time and apparently the
updates are minor bug fixes but also
some enhancements to notification center
so photostream and some new keyboard
options which is interesting we just
don't know obviously what to make of it
this beta could be leading to a beta 2
eventually so there could be more to
report on this will keep you posted and
finally for the interesting news of the
day analysts are currently pounding the
ipad mini with retina display that was
just launched a couple of days ago I
real be out very soon and will confirm
this in text and in our video but so far
it seems that this tablet has terrible
display quality apparently it's got half
the color gamut of the Nexus 7 yeah half
the color gamut which would be the third
of the color gamut of the ipad air which
would mean the color reproduction on
this thing is terrible so that leaves
this is the question of the day that you
buy an ipad mini with retina display do
you believe this have you tested it out
have you seen this do you feel that it's
worth your money because in my
particular case for four hundred dollars
for that tablet compared to the Nexus 7
I would expect something out of this
world extraordinary not this terrible
thing that they're complaining about so
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
