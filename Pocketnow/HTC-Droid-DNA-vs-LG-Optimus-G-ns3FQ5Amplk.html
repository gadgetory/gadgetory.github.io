has finally broken cover and the 1080p
display on this device is the first of
its kind in the United States but we'll
all those extra pixels slow down its
performance compared to a device with
the same exact internals but a lower res
screen like say the lg optimus G well
I'm Michael Fisher this is pocket now
let's find out so let's talk a little
about those nearly identical internals
Before we jump into a comparison both
the droid DNA and the lg optimus G the
sprint version here feature the Qualcomm
s4 pro at their heart that's backed up
by an Adreno 320 GPU and 2 gigs of RAM
in each case the difference as Joe Levi
points out in a recent article is that
the droid dna's 1080p display has over
two million pixels compared to the
optimist cheese 980 3,000 in theory that
means the DNA has to do a lot more work
to render graphics than the Optimus G
does which means one could expect it to
run a little bit slower does that hold
true in real life well without getting
too scientific let's jump into a few
general comparisons in benchmarks
third-party app load times stock app
load times and page load times in the
browser first up just a quick run
through of benchmarks we put the phones
through our usual battery of tests and
the DNA came out on top in all of them
you can view these in tabular format
pocket now calm but quickly just for the
video here the quadrant standard score
if the optimus G was 5669 the DNA scored
78 44 and 22 benchmark 11 20 6 14 5 14
linpack single thread 177 point to 37 1
91.8 38 linpack multi-thread for 34.7
084 64.6 46 smart bench 2012 4326 4677
and finally SunSpider
1385 point 0 11 48.3 a lower is better
but none that means much to the average
user and truth be told neither do app
launch load times if you put it in so
many words but users do like
responsiveness and when they tap on an
app icon they don't like to wait too
long for that app to load so with that
in mind let's launch a few stock and
third-party applications on each of
these devices now just FYI both of these
devices are freshly booted so we're on
as level a playing field as possible
that said we're running different
Android versions for dot for ice cream
sandwich on the optimus G and for dot
one dot one jellybean on the droid DNA
and each with its own manufacturers skin
on top so from a software sense this is
a little apples to oranges but all these
distinctions will exist on the retail
shelves as well so this is every bit a
real-world comparison first up let's see
if we can launch maps we like to know
that our navigation resources are close
at hand 1 2 3 boom there we go pretty
identical launch on each we get a pretty
good fix on each we haven't selected
location source on the optimus G so
that's why I didn't pinpoint us but the
application launch time is nearly
identical next up is camera on the stock
apps list we want to make sure that we
can get that special shot when the time
arises 1 2 3 boom pretty quick there
there's our HTC or excuse me our LG
tutorial but camera app launches pretty
quickly on each device about a second on
each and finally we're going to go ahead
and launch the browser 1 2 3 boom both
these devices are on the same Wi-Fi
hotspot so this is not a race as far as
load time goes this is just showing how
quickly the browsers can render each
individual page and we do have scrolling
ability on each the DNA doing a little
bit better as far as fluidity while the
page is still not fully loaded let's do
a little pinch to zoom check here
Optimus G showing that excellent
performance we've come to expect from it
just a little lag as it gets the last
bits of the page loaded droid DNA
definitely buttery smooth on the pinch
double tap to column view very very
sharp text there as you might expect
from a display of this kind and there's
the text wrapping in action as far as
third-party apps let's go ahead and just
very briefly check out two popular games
for android jetpack joyride first 1 2 3
boom it comes the launch droid DNA on
top Optimus G at the bottom almost
identical there let's go ahead and touch
anywhere to play will demonstrate that
the Optimus G is in fact a capable
device how can I do both of these at
once that'll be fun volume on the on the
DNA a little bit higher the display also
a little bit brighter in the specific
test but that's not what we're here for
but just checking performance and I died
you want to be careful about dying you
don't want to do that in game will go
ahead and launch Angry Birds Star Wars
to see if we can get that something
similar as far as load time there Rovio
optimist cheese a little bit ahead in
this very quick test but only by about a
second here's our intro yes and D and
there's that action right there and
finally a general usability test if we
go ahead and hop into the app launcher
here you can see that scrolling pages a
fairly fluid experience on both jelly
bean doing its job with the project
butter improvements to make sure that as
a smooth experience over there we'll go
hop into the download category just do
some more of that let's see if we can
get some widget action here we press and
hold on the HTC screen there that is
it's loading the widgets we scroll
through the slightly more graphically
complicated widget action that's nice
bring down the notification tray if we
can apparently have a notification
there's a notification tray up down very
very close to a one to one experience on
each of these devices shortly after a
fresh food and a couple app launches not
a giant surprise but just to demonstrate
that both of these devices are at the
top of their heap as far as performance
goes in
the UI sense so while the droid DNA is
driving over twice as many pixels with
the same hardware we're not seeing much
slow down at all in fact in benchmarks
and in general usability it's equal to
or better than the optimus G in many
respects not all despite jellybeans
optimizations the DNA's you I isn't much
smoother than the lgu eye on the optimus
G running ICS something we've noted
before we'll have to wait a little
longer to fully judge the droid dna's
performance in every usage scenario
watch for our full review in the coming
days but out of the box its software
performance matches the lg optimus G
despite its higher res display
considering the excellent marks we gave
the optimus G and our review that looks
to be great news for potential buyers of
the new droid DNA that's going to do it
for a quick and dirty comparison between
the HTC droid DNA and the lg optimus G
whole lot more coverage coming on the
droid DNA in the days ahead including
our full review stay tuned for that
