pocket calm and this is a tour of G
scroll version 2.0 from mobile SRC
software now if you remember the first
version of this software brought a lot
of extended functionality to the
capacitive touch area on the bottom of
the HTC touch pro and touch diamond
before the only other way that you could
use this area was when you are viewing
the picture you could run your finger
around the outside of the d-pad and zoom
in a little bit but now with G scroll
you can actually use this area for a lot
more than that including launching
programs launching moving around like a
d-pad and other things that that we're
going to go through now so version 2
point 0 adds a lot of extended
functionality from version 1 point 0 and
so the first piece of functionality has
been there since the beginning it's the
ability to swipe your finger along the
left of the d-pad and actually move the
cursor around on the screen so you can
see I'm swiping the left I go to the
left I go down and it'll go down to the
right and this also works in Opera or
Internet Explorer so it's a really easy
way to scroll down a page with a very
high level of precision versus using the
d-pad by like pressing it downwards and
it's kind of nochi that way and it's not
very quick and easy now something else
that has been added is the ability to
launch a ton of different programs with
a ton of different key combinations so
watch this if I tap on the center of the
d-pad gently two times i will open
Teeter if i do it once i get the list of
commands if i do it twice it will launch
Teeter and there it is now let me go
back to that screen you saw something
else underneath of their internet
explorer three taps and it will open
Internet Explorer oops I must have done
two taps only do it again one two three
and here we go Internet Explorer and
like I said you can scroll down with the
the capacitive zoom area now you can
program all of these key combinations to
open any program on your device so you
could have you know two taps on this
button to open messaging or a tap here
and a tap here to open you know word
mobile or something like that there's a
program that i want to show you in here
called the apps which are in its super
it reminds me of the the carousel on spb
mobile shell three so I do the home
button two times to get to that and
watch what happens so now I can flick
between my open programs or i can use
actually the capacitive area to flip
between my programs and what you're
seeing now is little screenshots of
although the programs that are running
right now and it kind of acts as a task
manager so i can close internet explorer
by tapping on this and then i can go to
the next one and i say oh I want to get
to program so I tap on programs and it
expands to fill the screen really really
cool functionality that helps you really
visualize the applications that you have
open and allows you to switch between
them and of course you can get there
pretty easily by doing a double tap on
the home button or however you have it
set up and let me show you exactly how
you set that up so I'm going to go into
the settings for G scroll which has been
improved before it was kind of archaic
and difficult to know exactly what each
function does ok so the first thing that
you will notice about this screen is
that on the right of all of these
commands there's a Help button and
before there were some commands here and
you were wondering what is precision
mode well if you tap on help for
precision mode it will give you a
description so this is much improved and
what the precision mode that you do is
stipulate the functionality of the the
touch sensitivity of the up and down
d-pad action when you're moving through
icons are moving through a web page so
that's a good addition see what else we
have here we have an able opera scroll
mode so that will work in upper mobile
and here's that screen that lets you
specify all of the key combinations that
open certain programs so let me
demonstrate how you add a new one so I'm
going to go to add launch and let's say
I want to have a program open if I press
the home button followed by the center d
pad area so tap tap and I want it to
open let's say calculator so I click
accept and I accept again and now if I
tap home and then Center it will open
calculator just like that so the
combinations are pretty much endless in
in terms of the ability to customize
this the launcher
variety of programs really well done on
the part of the the developer although
something that kind of bugs me is that
the programs get cut off here I would
like to be able to see exactly the whole
path of the the launch action that I've
specified here going over to the right
we've app switcher and that's the thing
that you saw earlier that lets you flip
through all the open applications that
you have and you can specify if there's
a feat in and out or if there's an
animation when you're done finding the
app application that you want and /
process tab lets you specify certain
behaviors / process so if you want one
particular program not to use the g
scroll function you could turn that off
and just add it to the list here so
that's pretty much it for G scroll there
are a lot of ways to customize this
application which is one of the best
parts about it it's going to cost seven
dollars which is really really
reasonable considering that a lot of
windows mobile software is twenty or
thirty dollars for people that have G
scroll one point o the upgrade will be a
five or four dollars when this is
released and by the time you watch this
video g scroll will have already been
released the only thing that i would
really like to see in the next version
of g scroll as a cleaned-up interface if
we go over to the main tab it's still
kind of ugly looking and difficult to
see and understand and especially to go
to the launch tab you can't even see the
program that is going to be launched by
a certain key combination so maybe an
elegant more elegant interface for the
next version of G scroll would be great
but there are a lot of improvements to
this simple utility that help you take
advantage of your the capacitive touch
area on the HTC touch diamond and touch
pro that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
