but which is the better bye I'm Taylor
Martin this is fucking now and this is
the boost max versus the Moto G we've
seen countless budget android phones
over the years but for the most part
they all have come with a series of
compromises last year Motorola showed us
that doesn't always have to be the case
it released the Moto G which doesn't
exactly have the best specifications but
provides consistent reliable performance
and it sells for only a fraction of the
price of other no-contract smartphones
ZTE wants to apply the same concept to
larger smartphones since practically
every so-called phablet to date has also
come with a premium price tag and
over-the-top specs the question is can
the boost max from ZTE compete with a
similarly spect and price device like
the Moto G let's find out from a design
perspective these two phones have very
little in common moto g is a lot like
the Moto X with its quaint simple build
as you would expect any $179 smartphone
to be it's utterly bare-bones with no
Flair just a blank front glass with a
small cut out for the speaker grille and
a removable back plate which can be
replaced with various colored
aftermarket plates for Motorola the
boost max seems to have taken a lot of
its design cues from older HTC devices
except it's made almost entirely of
plastic not metal with a two-tone back
featuring a matte finish silver and dark
grey soft touch accents at the top and
bottom that said it's a very nice faux
metal which is easily mistaken as a
lightweight aluminium and then there's
the question of size the Moto G has a
very manageable 4.5 inch display with
respectable dimensions and weight 120
nine point nine millimeters tall 65.9
millimeters wide and eleven point six
millimeters thick hitting the scales at
just 143 grams the boost max as a
self-proclaimed phablet featuring a 5.7
inch display will be a two handed device
for most it's 30.1 millimeters taller
15.4 millimeters wider and 58.3 grams
heavier however it is 2.2 millimeters
thinner as far as bill quality goes
however we'd rate these two as
comparable they're both incredibly solid
for their comparatively small price tags
the insides are where these two are most
alike the Moto G comes with 8 or 16
gigabytes of storage one gigabyte of RAM
a Snapdragon 400 ships up with a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core CPU a 5 megapixel
camera na 2070 milliamp hour battery the
boost max also comes with one gigabyte
of ram and a Snapdragon 400 SOC the max
inbuilt storage of 8 gigabytes but its
processor is a dual core Krait CPU its
camera is rated at eight megapixels and
the battery is 3200 milliamp hours it
also has a micro SD card slot where the
Moto G does not both have Wi-Fi b/g/n
lack NFC and the boost max has LTE
support but is limited to boost mobile
while the Moto G can be purchased
unlocked and used on gsm networks
globally the real difference here
however is display quality and size both
the boost max is 5.7 inch display in the
moto g's 4.5 inch display or 720p
resolution the respective densities of
those displays are 258 and 326 pixels
per inch and the difference is largely
visible to the naked eye the moto g's
display isn't quite as vivid as some
panels but it's far more accurate and
color reproduction than the boost max
which airs heavily on the warm side the
moto g's display is noticeably sharper
has deeper blacks wider viewing angles
and looks better all around apart from
size and display there isn't much
separating the Moto G in the boost max
but that story changes once you get to
the software and performance the Moto G
originally shipped with jelly bean
version 4 3 but was quickly updated to
KitKat for dat for the boost Mac ships
with jelly bean for that one and that
should mean something to anyone who has
experience with budget Android devices
KitKat has been optimized to run well on
low-end hardware with a minimum
requirement of 512 megabytes of RAM it
only takes a few minutes with each
device see those effects but we'll cover
performance in more detail in a minute
outside the versions of Android these
two devices ship with somewhat similar
software experiences which are very
close to stock Android they feature a
virtually unchanged launcher and each
comes with a small helping of pre-loaded
bloat the Moto G comes with helpful
features like trusted devices and
Motorola assist with pre-loaded services
like Motorola my great help and Motorola
privacy trusted devices allows you to
keep the device unlocked when connected
to select Bluetooth devices to be
concise Motorola has added just a few
features on top of
stack experience to keep bloat down and
boost user experience boost max doesn't
deviate too far from that but it comes
loaded with a handful of bloat from
boost mobile such as boosts on music
store boost zone airg lumen toolbar
kingsoft office mobile ID soundtracking
touchpal ex and swipe the built-in
features include a dolby digital plus EQ
app and what ZTE calls Smart View for a
split screen mode for running two
applications simultaneously this works
with any installed application and works
almost exactly like samsung's multi
window feature the only other notable
changes ZTE has made or to the quick
settings toggles in the notification
shade the lock screen and some custom
icons and widgets so how noticeable are
the benefits of KitKat on the Moto G
lest we forget the Moto G also has a
quad-core CPU compared to the dual-core
CPU in the boost max but it's hard to
believe that these are both powered by
Snapdragon 400 Moto G is smooth snappy
and consistent you can definitely bog
the phone down if you're doing a lot of
app switching and graphic intensive
gaming but the overall experience is one
of if not the best in a budget phone
it's very impressive at first I thought
the boost max may offer a similar
experience but just a few days into
using the phone it was clear that wasn't
the case phone constantly hangs and
freezes when loading apps it stutters
when flipping through home screens or
pages in the app drawer and even on
Wi-Fi webpages and streaming videos take
ages to load other times the boost max
works well but it doesn't take a lot of
effort to conjure up some serious lag
we still haven't done our full testing
of the battery life on the boost wax but
we're already certain it will provide
much more stamina per charge than the
Moto G the 3200 milliamp hour battery
has constantly powered us through a day
and a half with ease the Moto G will
likely need to be charged every day and
the boost max provided you can find some
service well not camera performance
isn't stellar on either of these devices
but when you consider the price they're
not horrible both the moto g's 5
megapixel camera and the boost Max's 8
megapixel camera have the tendency to
wash out images and in certain
situations it's as if the Moto G
artificially boosts colors and provides
unnatural saturation however we had less
trouble with the Moto G than with the
Boost max with autofocus and taking
blurry shots even with the hardware
shutter key on the boost max rest
assured neither of these phones cameras
will blow you away but you can expect a
more consistent and controlled
experience on the Moto G even if the
boost max has more software options in
the start camera app so which of these
budget phones is a better deal it
depends on a couple of different things
like service plans and the preference in
device size the boost max is available
for 299 and currently comes with
unlimited calls text and data for
thirty-five dollars per month boost
service typically starts at $55 per
month and eventually drops to just forty
dollars for unlimited everything the
catch is that boost service is not
necessarily available everywhere the
Moto G starts at just 179 and works on
practically any bring-your-own-device
prepaid service but at the end of the
day the Moto G is by far the better
bargain it costs just over half the
price of the boost Max and it offers a
much more consistent reliable experience
with far fewer performance hiccups we're
hopeful the KitKat update will help the
boost max but we're not sure if or when
that will ever happen thanks for
