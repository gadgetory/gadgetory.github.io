but which is the better bye
I'm Taylor Martin this is fucking now
and this is the boost max versus the
Moto G we've seen countless budget
Android phones over the years but for
the most part they all have come with a
series of compromises last year Motorola
showed us that doesn't always have to be
the case it released the Moto G which
doesn't exactly have the best
specifications but provides consistent
reliable performance and it sells for
only a fraction of the price of other
no-contract smart phones ZTE wants to
apply the same concept to larger smart
phones since practically every so called
phablet to date has also come with a
premium price tag and over-the-top specs
the question is can the Boost max from
ZTE compete with a similarly spec and
price device like the Moto G let's find
out from a design perspective these two
phones have very little in common the
Moto G is a lot like the Moto X with its
quaint simple build as you would expect
any $179 smartphone to be it's utterly
bare-bones with no Flair just a blank
front glass with a small cut off for the
speaker grille and a removable backplate
which can be replaced with various
coloured aftermarket plates from
Motorola the boost Mac seems to have
taken a lot of its design cues from
older HTC devices except it's made
almost entirely of plastic not metal
with a two-tone back featuring a matte
finish silver and dark grey soft touch
accents at the top and bottom that said
it's a very nice faux metal which is
easily mistaken as a lightweight
aluminum and then there's the question
of size the Moto G has a very manageable
4.5 inch display with respectable
dimensions and weight 129 point nine
millimeters tall 65.9 millimeters wide
and eleven point six millimeters thick
hitting the scales at just 143 grams the
boost max as a self-proclaimed phablet
featuring a 5.7 inch display will be a
two handed device for most it's thirty
point one millimeters taller 15 point
four millimeters wider and 58.3 grams
heavier however it is 2.2 millimeters
thinner as far as build quality goes
however we'd rate these two as
comparable they're both incredibly solid
for their comparatively small price tags
the insides are where these two are most
alike the Moto G comes with eight or 16
gigabytes of storage one gigabyte of RAM
a Snapdragon 400 chips up with a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core CPU a 5 megapixel
camera and a 20 70 milliamp hour battery
the boost max also comes with 1 gigabyte
of RAM and a Snapdragon 400 SOC the max
inbuilt storage of 8 gigabytes but its
processor is a dual-core Krait CPU it's
camera is rated at 8 megapixels and the
battery is 3,200 milliamp hours it also
has a micro SD card slot where the Moto
G does not both have Wi-Fi b/g/n lack
NFC and the boost max has LTE support
but is limited to Boost Mobile
while the Moto G can be purchased
unlocked and used on gsm networks
globally the real difference here
however is display quality and size both
the boost max is 5.7 inch display in the
Moto G's 4.5 inch display or 720p
resolution the respective densities of
those displays are 258 and 326 pixels
per inch and the difference is largely
visible to the naked eye the Moto G's
display isn't quite as vivid as some
panels but it's far more accurate and
color reproduction than the boost max
which airs heavily on the warm side the
Moto G's display is noticeably sharper
has deeper blacks wider viewing angles
and looks better all around
apart from size and display there isn't
much separating the Moto G in the Boost
max but that story changes once you get
to the software and performance the Moto
G originally shipped with jellybean
version 4.3 but what's quickly updated
to KitKat 4.4 the Boost mag ships with
jellybean 4.1 and that should mean
something to anyone who has experience
with budget Android devices KitKat has
been optimized to run well on low-end
hardware with a minimum requirement of
512 megabytes of RAM it only takes a few
minutes with each device see those
effects but we'll cover performance in
more detail in a minute outside the
versions of Android these two devices
ship with somewhat similar software
experiences which are very close to
stock Android they feature a virtually
unchanged launcher and each comes with a
small helping of pre-loaded bloat the
Moto G comes with helpful features like
trusted devices and motorola assist with
pre-loaded services like motorola my
great help and motorola privacy trusted
devices allows you to keep the device
unlocked when connected to select
Bluetooth devices to be concise motorola
has added just a few features on top
the stock experience to keep bloat down
and boost user experience boost max
doesn't deviate too far from that but it
comes loaded with a handful of bloat
from boost mobile such as boosts on
music store boost zone airg lumen
toolbar Kingsoft office mobile ID sound
tracking touch pal ex and swipe the
built-in features include a dolby
digital plus eq app and what ZTE calls
Smart View for a split screen mode for
running two applications simultaneously
this works with any installed
application and works almost exactly
like Samsung's multi window feature the
only other notable changes ZTE has made
are to the quick settings toggles in the
notification shade for lockscreen and
some custom icons and widgets
so how noticeable are the benefits of
KitKat on the Moto G lest we forget the
Moto G also has a quad-core CPU compared
to the dual-core CPU in the boost max
but it's hard to believe that these are
both powered by a Snapdragon 400 moto G
is smooth snappy and consistent you can
definitely bog the phone down if you're
doing a lot of app switching and graphic
intensive gaming but the overall
experience is one of if not the best in
a budget phone it's very impressive at
first I thought the boost max may offer
a similar experience but just a few days
into using the phone it was clear that
wasn't the case phone constantly hangs
and freezes when loading apps it
stutters when flipping through home
screens or pages in the app drawer and
even on Wi-Fi webpages and streaming
videos take ages to load other times the
boost max works well but it doesn't take
a lot of effort to conjure up some
serious lag
we still haven't done our full testing
of the battery life on the boost wax but
we're already certain it will provide
much more stamina per charge than the
Moto G the 3200 million power battery
has constantly powered us through a day
and a half with ease the Moto G will
likely need to be charged every day and
the boost max provided you can find some
service well not camera performance
isn't stellar on either of these devices
but when you consider the price they're
not horrible both the Moto G's 5
megapixel camera and the Boost maxes 8
megapixel camera have the tendency to
wash out images and in certain
situations it's as if the Moto G
artificially boosts colors and provides
unnatural saturation however we had less
trouble with the Moto G than with the
Boost max with autofocus and taking
blurry shots even with a hardware
shutter key on the boost max rest
assured neither of these phones cameras
will blow you away but you can expect a
more consistent and controlled
experience on the Moto G even if the
boost max has more software options in
the stock camera app so which of these
budget phones is a better deal it
depends on a couple of different things
like service plans and the preference in
device size the boost max is available
for $2.99 and currently comes with
unlimited calls text and data for $35
per month boost service typically starts
at $55 per month and eventually drops to
just $40 for unlimited everything the
catch is that boost service is not
necessarily available everywhere the
Moto G starts at just 179 and works on
practically any bring-your-own-device
prepaid service but at the end of the
day the Moto G is by far the better
bargain it costs just over half the
price of the boost max and it offers a
much more consistent reliable experience
with far fewer performance hiccups we're
hopeful the KitKat update will help the
boost max but we're not sure if or when
that will ever happen thanks for
