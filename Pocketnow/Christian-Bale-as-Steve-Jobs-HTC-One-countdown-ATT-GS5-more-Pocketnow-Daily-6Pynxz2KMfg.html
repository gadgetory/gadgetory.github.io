in the new Sony biopic 18 ounces its
pricing and deals for the galaxy s5 and
gear lineup an HTC begins its countdown
for its all new HTC One I'm hanging up a
bit and this episode begins in five four
three this is out daily let's
rock say off with some official news as
AT&amp;amp;T is just announced the pricing and
availability for the galaxy s5 and the
gear lineup you get the galaxy s5 for
two hundred dollars after a two-year
contract or six hundred fifty dollars
for the 16 gig model off contract you
can also get the gear two for three
hundred dollars gear kneel or gear fit
for two hundred dollars and if you get
either of these together except for the
gear fit for some reason you'll get
fifty dollars off the price and you'll
be getting these devices by early April
no specific dates but interesting it's
great especially when the all new HTC
One is already coming soon that's right
the other hot phone that's happening the
spring is the all new HTC One the
company has already begun their
countdown for their event on March 25th
you can expect our full live coverage of
everything that's going to happen at the
event expect our teasers in the lick to
the description and obviously we will be
waiting to see if this phone is as hot
as HTC's marketing let's put it out to
be and give it the fact that the old HTC
One was a great phone except for its
camera and apparently this phone's
camera is gonna be better I think they
pretty much solved everything give us
the phone now let's talk about Google
and Android 4.4 KitKat we know that the
company is trying to roll out this
operating system to as many phones as it
can obviously with the whole mentality
but being more power efficient and
everything but it's been kind of a slow
rollout but rumors having that the
company is already working on a new
build just makes things more complicated
for OEMs though we still can't confirm
if this is a new version of KitKat or a
new version of Android altogether it's
coming up on bug checks on Chrome and
everything so stay tuned let's see what
we get now let's her about Amazon and
yeah I know we haven't talked about this
company in a while but we've got more
rumors that the company is already
shopping for the components that will
built its next smartphone and the
reports have it that the company is
planning to bring the smartphone in the
summer to us
and apparently it'll bring us some sort
of really impressive tracking technology
though we still can't confirm that so
let's see I mean hey we can expect
anything from amazon right even drones
and finally for the very hot news of the
day and i would even say the hottest
news of the week we've got rumors that
Christian Bale is trying to be cast for
the sony biopic of steve jobs to play
Steve Jobs obviously and the rumors have
it that both the director and the writer
which are the same people that did this
for the social network you remember that
movie from facebook according to the
rumor these people are not willing to
film the movie if Christian Bale would
not accept so this is really interesting
as yeah these people did a great job
with the social network and we do know
that Christian Bale is a great
methodical easier to the question of the
day how would you imagine Christian Bale
playing the job of Steve Jobs uh and
yeah that sounded weird but that's just
the way I had to say it because in my
particular case you know some people
said that bail looks like jobs which is
good but you know in all honesty I feel
that he is the perfect actor for the job
he is a methodical OTT of respect a lot
of admiration for him and yeah I feel
that that would honor Steve Jobs the
which should be but leave us a comment
down below how do you feel and friends
