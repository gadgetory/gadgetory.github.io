Android Oh is now a public beta for
anyone to try we're going to take a
speedrun through the top new features
we're happy to see in Google's next
iteration of Android a to new
behind-the-scenes updates Google is
getting serious about security play
protect will work in the background of
Google Play to scan apps for malware
even apps that are downloaded from
Google Play and we're always happy to
see improvements to power management
vitals is the next evolution of doze and
will limit access to CPU and radio
resources when an app is in the
background
moving to things we can see Android Oh
improved support for password autofill
here's where we would see LastPass if I
used that but otherwise Google's
autofill will pull your info from Chrome
which is a nice little bit of synergy
the notification shade gets a bit of a
redesign moving some settings and
information around so so that's pretty
cool and another nice bit of user
customization you can change icon shapes
if that's the kind of thing which
bothers you but at the moment it's a bit
inconsistently applied speaking of those
icons Google is trying to give us a
reason to long press on homescreen
shortcuts
you see these dots they're telling you
something requires your attention these
dots are going to be a really big deal
long press and you can see the
notification directly respond to it or
swipe it away
and Google's AI is infiltrating more of
the UI smart copy-paste will deliver
options like maps when you copy an
address it's always going to be
appreciated being able to share
information between apps fluidly and
picture-in-picture is one of the more
visible new features where folks can
minimize a YouTube video shrinking it
down to the small floating window so
folks can keep up with their snarky
movie reviews while doing something else
on the phone that is in theory it's not
currently working on my pixel I'm using
VLC's implementation of this feature now
we've saved the best for last and that's
the new updates for higher quality audio
Google's been promising better audio
since jellybean advanced Bluetooth
codecs are natively included you no
longer have to worry if your phone
supports a PT X or Sony's wireless
standard pretty much whatever your
headphones might use it's probably
included on this list Android Oh on the
pixel does not support improving the
audio quality by adding the
USB DAC this is a major feature we need
if phone manufacturers are going to keep
removing dedicated 3.5 millimeter
headset jacks there you have it folks
Android Oh in a nutshell we've noticed
significant differences between pixel
and nexus with the latter not including
many of the fun I can defeat
but that's ok this is an early beta
which is making my pixel run fairly
poorly anyway now that I'm done shooting
this video I'll most likely roll my
project 5 phone back to nougat what
features are you most looking forward to
and what can Google improve on before
this becomes a finished release drop us
a comment down below as always thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for more reviews like
these and help us out with some carrying
on your favorite social networks for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now some
gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram and
I will catch you all on the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
