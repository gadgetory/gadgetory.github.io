hasn't received a ton of attention from
third-party developers but that doesn't
mean you can't hack and mod the crap out
of it I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is how to install the
xposed framework on your Moto X as much
love as the Moto X has received from the
press and well practically anyone who
has used it there's one side of the Moto
X that's lacking compared to other
flagships of 2013 the HTC one galaxy s4
no three or especially the Nexus 5 the
Moto X has not received a ton of love
from rom developers and the like maybe
that's because the out-of-the-box
experience no Moto X is great to begin
with or maybe the Moto X simply didn't
attract as many developers as others
after all it only became notably more
popular after the $150 offf promotion
and later permanent price cut I digress
if you're looking to get a little more
out of your Moto X you're not entirely
out of luck if the status bar icons or
other idiosyncrasies of the handheld or
driving you nuts
you can fix that in a few relatively
simple steps namely by installing the
xposed framework it should solve most of
your problems without causing too much
trouble but first what is exposed
framework to be concise it's a way to
modify your current AOSP or near stock
Android ROM on the fly something like
CyanogenMod or in this case even the
stock firmware on the Moto X install the
xposed framework choose a module that
has the tweaks you want or need make all
of the changes and reboot the device
many mods can be made immediately
without rebooting the phone enough about
that for now how do you get this on your
Moto X there are a few things to take
care of first exposed framework requires
root access so if you don't have access
to the root directory you will have to
gain root it's smart to perform a backup
of any important data before you move
forward so move all of your pictures or
any other data off your phone and if you
have a DB installed on your machine
simply plug your moto X into your
computer open a terminal window and type
the command adb backup - apk - shared -
all - app and the name of the backup and
press Enter this will take several
minutes to complete once it does you're
ready to gain root access with the Moto
X this can be done several different
ways the most permanent way and that it
voids your war
is to unlock your bootloader by
following the instructions on Motorola's
online bootloader unlock tool doing this
will reset the phone to factory settings
but once the bootloader is unlocked
gaining root is much more simple
there are several toolkits and scripts
for Windows and Mac I found XD a user MJ
Philips 1981's Moto X toolkit for Mac
which works for virtually all Moto X
versions and I downloaded it if you
choose this route plug your Moto X into
the Mac select the option one and the
Moto X toolkit for root menu and follow
the on-screen instructions
the toolkit will install a custom
recovery flash superuser zip and reboot
I then restored my backup and got
everything in order and move forward a
restore of course is optional if you
prefer to preserve your manufacturer
warranty gaining route requires you go
through several steps many of which are
Windows or Linux only you must downgrade
the firmware on your Moto X to version
4.2.2 run J cases Rock my moto to gain
root run moto WP no mo to remove write
protection use the Cydia impactor tool
perform J cases slap my moto route path
then update to Android 4.4 once more
since I didn't use this method myself I
will drop a link to the slap my moto
development thread in the comments below
once you have gained root access it
should be smooth sailing but it's not a
bad time to stop and make an Android
backup in case something goes awry next
you will need the latest xposed
installer apk which can be found using
the xposed XD a thread link below or by
navigating to HTTP colon forward slash
forward slash D elf exposed info forward
slash latest apk in chrome from your
Moto X when the download is complete
install the application and open in the
firmware submenu select install / update
reboot and you should be ready to enjoy
the wonders of the xposed framework so
what can you do once it's installed
install various modules and model way
after doing a little research last night
I came across gravitybox 4 KitKat but
that's just one of the many many awesome
modules gravitybox is essentially your
one-stop shop for customizing the look
of your phone's UI you can tweak the
notification shade the status bar the
navigation bar or buttons the quick
settings page and much much more the UI
of gravitybox is not unlike a settings
menu sift
through the different sub menus tweak
the appearance of all the things you'd
like and reboot again not all tweaks
require a reboot but enabling some
features may so to save yourself some
time and some reboots check through
everything the first time around to see
what will require a reboot personally I
enable the circle battery indicator with
a number reading it the alarm clock icon
change the status bar to a dark gray and
centered the time I shrunk the size of
the navigation buttons in landscape mode
made the quick settings page accessible
from a swipe down from the top right
edge of the display and added a ton of
new quick settings including a toggle
for immersion mode but this is only the
beginning
you can tweak dozens maybe even hundreds
of different settings until your heart
is content my favorite of course is the
advanced reboot menu which actually has
a shortcut for screen recording one of
the hidden features of KitKat for
developers have you tried exposed
framework on your moto X or other
Android devices what are your favorite
