Park geun-hye calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started this application is called
crazy snowboard and is a free game
available in the android market the
object of the game is create really cool
tricks while you're writing your snow or
down the hill and now we'll just wait
tool the game starts and will continue
down the hill and to make some cool
tricks all you do is move your finger
let's see there we go did some oh darn I
did land correctly so we'll continue
down the hill and make some couple more
tricks and when you get more points you
can unlock other features and other
snowboards and players and stuff like
that on the game daily strip is a free
application available the android market
that gives you a daily comic of your
favorite comic strip so right here I've
Garfield so we can view that if I life
it can also pick many different other
comic strips so let's that I want to do
a pic Hagar the horrible i can click on
here and wait for that to load and we
have that funny little character go down
here and we can pick the our favorites
and I have family circus selected there
and it says mommy isn't it time for us
to gets nestled all snug in our beds gem
miner is a puzzle game available the
android market there are two versions
available a lite version and a paper
version which costs about two dollars
and eight cents so the object of game is
to move your little minor here through
the mine to collect various items so
let's say that i wanted to collect some
coal I've moved down into the ladder day
of some coal I've got some cold air go
back and apparently if I hope I didn't
make it because one of the rocks fell on
my head so now I start at the beginning
a lot of results is a great application
if you want to know the lottery results
of your specific state so we have
practically every single state in the
entire country and change my state that
is of course if your state does play the
lottery we can try Tennessee here and
we'll just leave to let loads there are
two versions available a free version
and a paid version which costs 99 cents
and doesn't have any ads so here we have
the results for multiple state lotteries
and the
tennessee state lotteries themselves so
perhaps you have that winning ticket in
your pocket and you might not even know
a choc cake is a free application
available in the android market that has
hundreds of stores that have many promo
codes and also coupons available in this
application the cool thing about this is
you get resorts for doing various tasks
like try on clothes posting to Facebook
and all that other great stuff you can
also redeem these rewards let's say you
wanted to take a cruise on the princess
cruise ship but even if you don't buy
something you can just try on clothes at
a retail on occasion and it will give
you points so you can redeem these for
one of these rewards so this has been
another episode of the android
