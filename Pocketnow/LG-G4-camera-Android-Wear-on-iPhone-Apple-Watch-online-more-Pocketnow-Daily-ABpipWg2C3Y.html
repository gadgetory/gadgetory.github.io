that we should expect for the LG g4
Apple watch sales policies have changed
one more time and not for the better and
believe it or not android wear might
expand to support iOS i'm high memory
that I and is it just me or has today
breezed faster than expected this is
pocket out daily there is one thing to
love about LG is that the company is not
about rumors they love to make things
official and such as the case of today
the company has just announced the
camera modules that we should expect on
the LG g4 and we've heard about the f
1.8 aperture lens coming to the new 16
megapixel shooter that is now official
the cool thing about the shooter is that
you get eighty percent more light than
the already good sensor that we had on
the g3 so these are good news but even
better you get an eight megapixel
shooter at the front firing camera with
the IR sensor that you also get at the
back so you apparently get better color
tones etc can't wait to test it out
can't wait for the event now official
news that are not necessarily good are
from Apple as the company has just
announced that the Apple watch is going
to sell online only in its initial batch
apparently the company is certain that
there is so much demand for the watch
people going crazy online and stuff that
Duff there won't be any watches at
stores you go see it you to go try it
out but you can't fight you have to
order it so three orders tomorrow are
the best way to go and also keep in mind
that even though you order online or
whatever you can still go to a store
after you pre-order give it a try see if
you like it and if you don't you just
cancel your order you get your money
back it's the cool thing about the
United States that since we are talking
about smartphone cameras one that kind
of disappointed us was a the HTC One m9
camera and it seems that the people of
Taiwan have already noticed this and
they are apparently preparing a software
update that should ship next week
depending on your carrier and apparently
it will fix the camera issues that you
currently have the One m9 we will report
back as soon as we learn more now how
about samson even though we know that we
are still six to seven months away from
the galaxy note
I'm we already hear rumors on its
display panel apparently this will be
the first 4k display for a smartphone if
other companies don't beat it to it
apparently the company is working on a
5.9 inch 4k display for the galaxy note
5 and then the Galaxy Note edge revamp
will have a 5.7 inch 4k display as well
really interesting we are very much
happy with the 2k or you know a quad HD
display on the Galaxy Note 4 so we can't
imagine what Forte's going to look like
I don't think we're gonna even be able
to notice it but hey technology is
growing and finally for the hot rumors
of the day reports from trusted sources
claim that Google has been working on an
android wear application for iOS that it
is currently almost ready to be
submitted to the app store and that yeah
that is the next way to go for Android
wear to become cross-platform and this
is really interesting because
particularly we know that Google it's
not that it doesn't care about Android
but we know that the company does care
about expanding Google since that is the
core business and one cool thing about
Android wear is that it's everything
about Google now which means that if it
expanded to iOS that would make sense
and yes apparently you'll get the google
now cards it will connect to your Google
application on iOS and it should work
pretty much the same way it works on
Android that we don't know about music
controls and stuff like that but it does
lead me to the question of the day do
you think that Android wear becoming an
iOS thing would a cripple the Apple
watch in any way in my case I believe it
won't I believe it will help Android
wear but then again it all depends on
Apple approving the application which I
doubt it will but leave us a comment
down below what do you think friends you

news earlier before this video is filmed
