reveals a lot of information to look
forward to the iPhone 10 in gold just
made an official appearance and it
wasn't from Apple and if you're having
battery issues on your Apple watch
series - you're not alone
I'm hi Mary that I'm reporting from Rome
and if you want to see what I'm up to
make sure you follow me on Instagram
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals as the
essential phone seems to be that gift
that keeps on giving if they're in the
market for a good smartphone right now
it's at 399 on Amazon and it just
continuously gets deals it's still a
great phone not the best camera in the
world but for that price tag I think
it's really hard to compete with it now
this is one thing that I really don't
understand I mean we just came from MWC
we saw the xperia x z2 and the company
just silently announced their new egg z2
premium which is the phone we were
expecting to see at MWC welcome
snapdragon 845 in addition to all the
bells and whistles and most important we
have dual cameras coming from Sony this
is a monochrome sensor with a ton of do
processing names that you know Sony is
famous for let's just see that they
actually take advantage of the cameras
that they make because they make those
sensors now for those of you that have
been noticing issues with your Apple
watch battery in the case of the Apple
watch series - up to the case of the
battery inflating and pretty much
expanding your display I highly suggest
you look forward to talking to Apple
because you will be getting three years
of three repairs for that watch make
sure you take it to an Apple store that
means the battery is definitely unsafe I
don't recommend you continue using it
until you get it checked
and speaking of Apple if you remember
when the iPhone 10 was beginning to
emerge in leaks we saw three colors the
white the black and there was this blush
gold unit that we never saw and well now
it made an appearance on the FCC not as
lush as we saw in the leaks this is more
just a regular gold but apparently the
rumors are that this is going to be a
limited-edition iPhone 10 meaning
I hope the price tag doesn't go any
crazier just for the color
and finally the most interesting nooses
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
Note 9 I can't wait to see what this
phone is gonna be like I'm really
enjoying my time with the Galaxy S 9
plus and s9 as it turns out if you
remember the code names for the s9 were
star of the code name for the Galaxy
Note 8 was great
this time the codename for the Galaxy
Note 9 is crown what is the crown of
Samsung Galaxy smartphones going to
bring is it going to be better specs it
has to be more than just an s-line plus
with an S Pen in my opinion but what
about you in the comments let us know
what do you think Samsung is going to
bring as the crown of their smartphones
what do you think the feature is going
to be in that case I don't know I hope
they bring more RAM I hope they bring
more usability and some feature that'll
make it a vanguard phone as it used to
be that's just me leave us a comment
