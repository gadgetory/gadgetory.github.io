pocketnow.com the skyfire mobile browser
is now available for your iphone and
ipod touch it allows you to play flash
video in the browser there's a lot of
caveats to it though and we're going to
cover all of that in this video so let's
take a look so starting off skyfire will
cost you two dollars and ninety-nine
cents of the sky fire caused us the
early adopter discount implying that the
price is going to go up in the near
future maybe 25 dollars or so by the end
of this video you'll know if you should
be spending your money on sky fire or
waiting until it gets a little bit
better so sky fires main claim to fame
is that it can do flash video it can't
do any other kind of flash so you can't
play flash games or interact with flash
sites that have any level of
interactivity it's video only and we're
going to talk about that in this video
so first let's talk about how skyfire
fares as just a general-purpose browser
here we on here we are on pocket now I'm
going to go to the main page we're to
see how long it takes to load I'm on a
very fast Wi-Fi network here usually
this page takes about five or six
seconds to load in Safari let's see how
it does in sky fire
voice that was about 15 seconds so about
two times longer maybe three times
longer than safari we can flick down the
page performance is usually good when
flicking down the page once in a while
it gets stuck and you may see what I
mean now let's go to a page that has
flash content we can double click to
zoom in and it nicely reflows the column
we can also use a multi-touch sometimes
if it wants to behave so let's zoom in
on this headline and take a look at some
of the Flash content that is included in
this particular post so we're gonna tap
on that it's going to load the permalink
there now let me talk about the buttons
along the bottom while that's loading so
we have a button + button here just like
you get in Safari you can add a bookmark
you can share it use Facebook quick view
this one over here is pretty cool it's
kind of like a rate related content tool
and if I tap on it the button will
intelligently look at terms on the page
and within this page we had some content
about the droid two so it picked that
out and if we tap on droid two it will
take you to another page that will try
to query the web Twitter and YouTube and
all kinds of places for information
about this term kind of a cool way to
get more information about something so
here we have a video of the droid to
some pictures of the droid to some news
swipe to the right to filter it out by
videos or trends tweets or images so
just a cool feature if you want to find
more information about a particular
topic so we're going to dial back here
and see how the page has progressed so
here we are on the page and when you get
flash video on a particular page the way
that skyfire tells you is that there's a
little picture of a video down here if
you tap on that it will bring up a
preview of the video and when you press
play it's going to play it in the sort
of skyfire video player and we're going
to cover video with another site one
that has more action because this
particular video doesn't have much
action so let's go to the tab management
and we're going to open up a new page
and the new page defaults to my dot
skyfire com which will show you some
well optimized sites that you should use
when you're using skyfire so if you're
south park studios which is a place
where you can go to get all episodes of
south park is optimized so
we can go into landscape although
sometimes it takes a good three or four
seconds for skyfire to respond and let's
try to watch an episode of south park
here so i'm going to press play looks
like i missed that that's on a carousel
zoom in go down to any old episode here
and let it load up now again we see an
hourglass down here it's going to turn
into a video sign implying that we can
actually play some of the video on the
page here still thinking I guess I'll
continue along the bottom since we
stopped with the related video there's
the pop-up we also the tab management
this is your bookmark manager and of
course the back button so here we are
will click press play and try to play
this this video of South Park rendering
video on the skyfire player for the
Flash content takes a long time
sometimes up to 30 45 seconds in fact
sometimes I wish I would just stick to
the Safari browser because that uses the
dedicated YouTube player it takes you
out of Safari but it's still a lot
faster than this is so I'm going to I'm
going to come back when this is ready to
go so you can get a sense for the video
quality of this flash player in sky fire
and about 30 seconds later it says
unable to play video now this has been
happening all day with South Park's to
do so we're gonna have to go to another
site to show you what the video
capability looks like so again we're
going to open up my sky fire calm and
scroll down to one of these let's go to
say mtv music videos those are flash
base so we can presumably watch a music
video here on the iphone so it's a
loading and we've got some things going
on let's try to find some music videos
so then zoom in over here I see it says
full episodes maybe we can see an
episode of the jersey shore or something
like that so nice you're going to stop
it because it's taking a little bit too
long so we're in tap on full episodes
see where that takes us there's a little
Settings button up here and from here
you get a little drop-down you can load
the page as desktop or iPhone view turn
on and off private browsing and go into
some basic browser settings so here we
are full episodes let's zoom in world of
jenks and let's try to play this video
right here on the iphone so it says
video requires latest flash player and
it looks like the Moodle video icon is
going to pop up because you get the
hourglass so that's good okay so here it
is video we're going to press play and
see if we can watch this episode of
world of jenks it's flash video on the
iphone here's another instance of where
the video is not playing so it looks
like we're not going to have good luck
today and getting this to work although
this is probably indicative of sort of
the the beta likeness of this program
it's not really ready for prime time
we'll give it one more attempt at
another website will go to abc.com which
has some video of course
here we go we're going to watch episodes
again so try to zoom in a little bit and
tap on that let's see what we can do
here Dancing with the Stars sure why not
all right it says you know back here it
says download the free ABC Claire to
watch the ABC shows on your on your iPad
I don't have an iPad here so I want to
actually dive into this video although
usually when you see this screen it
means it's not going to play so I'll cut
back in a second and maybe it'll play
but probably not okay good we're going
to get some video here finally Dancing
with the Stars it is buffering and
loading hopefully the focus clears up a
little bit and let's see what the
quality is like with Dancing with the
Stars flash video through sky fire let's
take a look
following episode is presented with
little diversions by North America's
number one rated ski resort okay so here
is a commercial which should give you a
sense of the video quality the quality
got to tell you is very poor it's very
pixelated in fact looking at youtube
videos through safari is a far superior
experience to looking at flash video
here on skyfire screen rotation is slow
overall we can't recommend that you pay
money for skyfire right now its buggy
it's slow it doesn't play flash video
that well it doesn't let you interact
with Flash content you're better off
sticking with safari for now and waiting
until this gets better because right now
it's just not ready for primetime so
unfortunately we can't recommend skyfire
please thumbs up to this video if you
liked the idea of flash video in an iOS
device and thanks for watching that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
