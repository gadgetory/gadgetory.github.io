patents but the results weren't as
expected you can get the current Galaxy
gear for half off at certain retail
stores and things seem ready for the MLB
to make your baseball experience a lot
cooler I'm high memory that I and the
sad part about mixing meds with this
weather is the fact that you can't drink
on a Friday but this is pocketnow daily
let's actually off with some official
news as surprisingly most retail stores
I've considered they want to drop the
price on the Samsung Galaxy gear you
remember used to cost you three hundred
dollars and now you get it at best buy
for half off which means one hundred
fifty dollars which is original pebble
territory which is great it's a great
price point for the galaxy gear and then
again you could also get a cheaper price
at AT&amp;amp;T though it's not as sweet as the
best buy deal but then again the
question is will you be willing to buy
the galaxy gear now when the galaxy gear
2 is already being too now let's talk
about Apple and Major League Baseball as
we heard the rumors of both companies
working on bringing ibeacons into 20
baseball parks and as it turns out Los
Angeles and San Diego's parts are now
fitted with I beacons for their first
game which is happening on March 30th
and what makes the school is if you have
an iPhone obviously these ibeacons are
capable of detecting your phone and
sending you information the question is
exactly what information are you getting
we still don't know so hopefully we'll
get more details soon now let's talk
about Samsung is the company has just
patented a signature unlock feature
which is definitely coming to the Galaxy
Note lineup and obviously you get face
to unlock you get slide to unlock
another different ways to unlock your
phone but your signature is always
something that is easily faiqa bowl if
your signature is easy and still it's a
good option to have though obviously
they don't know how reliable it'll be so
let's see when this will be launched and
let's see if it's good enough and
speaking of Samsung the company's CEO
met with Tim Cook which is Apple CEO to
discuss patents if you remember a judge
ruled that both company CEOs needed to
meet in order to find an amicable
agreement to their patent lawsuits which
by the way has happened twice now with
this one and again the companies did not
reach an agreement even though this has
been planned for the last
full of months they did not agree on
anything so March 31st will be the date
for the next trial let's see how that
one goes and finally for the very hot
but also boring news of the day because
we've been talking about this for years
already it seems that Microsoft will be
launching Office for iPad before June
and this is really interesting because
we've been hearing these rumors for
years and now Mary Jo folly is shining
in and saying that even though Steve
Ballmer had decided to delay office for
the ipad for the all touch on Windows
Office to launch first it seems that
office for the iPad will be ready first
and obviously with the whole leadership
change it seems that there is a change
in heart and the application that's
ready first will be launched first then
Office for iPad is rumored to be the
first one and we still don't know if
this will be in office for 365 beriant
as we see on the iPhone or not but I
want you to the question of the day uh
what Office for iPad make you want to
buy an iPad because you know obviously
it's not a really good productivity
tablet already but you know so far in my
particular case honestly I don't like
productivity on tablets period and
depending on how powerful this
application is I might consider it but
leave us a comment down below but this
lure you away from a windows tablet and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is still machine follow us on Park

channel as well you'd also follow me on
