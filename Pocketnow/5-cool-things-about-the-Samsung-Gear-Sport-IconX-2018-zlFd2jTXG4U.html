technology by our sides at all time
mobile technology is booming and if

industry Full Sail University offers

ready to advance your development skills
check out the mobile gaming graduate
program through full sales project
launch program students receive a
Macbook industry software plus iOS and
Android devices if you're ready to
compete in this fast-growing industry
visit Full Sail dot edu slash YouTube to
learn more even if smartwatches aren't
as popular as companies would want user
adoption continues to grow the primary
usage has proven to be Fitness at an
impressive 92% and one of the major
players continues to be Samsung the gear
s3 was one of my favorite watches of
last year and it isn't going anywhere
Samsung has decided to complement it
with a sporty-er solution that's just as
fancy I'm high mentally that I with
pocket now and these are five cool
things about the Samsung gear sports and
that's not the new gear icon X 2018 as
well
first of all most other Fitness watches
look just like Fitness watches I think
the gear sport is the only one that you
can actually dress for the occasion it
brings a beautiful stronger 316l
stainless steel case and it's space
model where competitors make you start
with aluminum we also get a round design
for this to look more like a regular
watch where other options don't really
blend in swap a band for workout swap
another 20 millimeter band and just make
it fancy and sure you have all of this
in the Samsung gear s 3 the difference
is the fact that in Fitness size does
matter the lighter the watch at the
better for a run for example the icon X
offers the same benefit instead of
looking like a strange pair of ear plugs
from science-fiction movies we have a
petite design that blends just as well
with workout clothing as much as it does
if you dress up second is that one of
the things that I like most about your
watches is software and features and how
the company pulls it off I don't know of
other watches that calculate your
calorie intake or water intake or
caffeine even major competitors don't
calculate sleep as well as the gear
lineup and I love how widgets on the
user interface are customizable the
rotating bezel is also more convenient
when your hands are full of sweat to
navigate around and I feel the same way
about the icon X 2018 just pull them out
of the case and they connect
automatically operate them fully with
taps on the hardware which is fairly
simple and most important I've tested a
bevy of full wireless headphones that
compete with the icon acts yeah none of
these sound good if you want great audio
you're pretty much narrowed down to the
icon X 2018 or the Jabra elite sport as
your only options number 3 the most
important the fact that the gear sport
is a very powerful Fitness watch I'm not
gonna bore you with specifications but
what you do care about is the fact that
you've got 4 gigabytes of storage to
sync your music and that I've been able
to nail over 2 days of battery life
which is the reason why I can use this
watch for sleep tracking the icon X also
includes 4 gigabytes of storage though
the user interface to be able to use
them on standalone with music is kind of
cumbersome still one of the most
important things is that you have the
option something you don't
finding competing devices and best of
all it's rated for five hours of battery
and then the case provides an extra
charge and I've been able to get that
over the last couple of days of use
number four are the partnerships really
at the moment the only watch where you
can get Spotify to sync is the gear
sport and I'm talking about being able
to download songs to your watch and
leave your phone at home something handy
since you don't have LTE on this watch
and streaming only works over Wi-Fi
Under Armour has also partnered with
Samsung so whatever servers you have
like for example my Fitness Pal will
also be able to work with these devices
number five and most important is the
growing ecosystem and notice that I
haven't focused on things like the
accuracy of the heart rate sensor that's
mainly because I haven't been able to
test this watch enough to be able to
give you a full review at the moment
these are my initial impressions of
using it for the last couple of days so
far I have noticed similar figures to
products like the Apple watch series 3
but again I do need to test more of the
watch what's most shocking to me is how
Samsung has grown when it comes to its
approach to fitness Samsung health
offers features that are second to none
at the moment and the coolest part is
that you don't really need a galaxy
phone to be able to take advantage of
this these products even work with an
iPhone but again we need more time for
