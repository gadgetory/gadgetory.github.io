smartwatches you can find today and
there's only a $50 difference between
them but despite their surface
similarities these Android wearables are
targeted at two totally different types
of customer I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is LG G watch R
versus Motorola MOTO 360 since these are
both Android wear devices they're
powered by essentially identical
software and you can see our review of
the platform at pocketnow.com the
differences here come down almost
entirely to hardware the Moto 360 is the
picture of minimalism with an unadorned
a stainless steel cylinder of a casing
and a display reaching almost all the
way to the edge with a small cutout on
the bottom for a sensor and equipment
Bay the G watch are by contrast doesn't
make any pretense of restraint it's
stainless steel casing features huge
shoulder like brackets for the watch
band and a wide bezel with minute
markers even its side button is bigger
and despite or maybe because of its
chunkiness its display is smaller let's
talk about those screens for a second as
you can see the G watch ours is
perfectly round lacking the flat tire of
the 360 s display LG's is also sharper
and it uses P OLED technology instead of
the motos IPS panel OLED makes much more
sense on a wearable if you prefer to
leave the screen in ambient mode all day
because only the active pixels are
consuming power to achieve similar
efficiency that 360 has to turn its
backlight down so far that it's much
harder to read about the only advantage
of the Motorola display besides its size
is the ambient light sensor that adjusts
display brightness on-the-fly
the G watch R doesn't have that despite
its superior screen in almost every
other way the G watch R is the more
pedestrian of these to the band it ships
with is leather but it feels much less
premium than the 360s soft whore Wien
leather band
the G watch our charges via hardware
connectors and a nice magnetic cradle
but the 360 beats it out with a more
elegant wireless charger that also
doubles as a nightstand LG bundles many
more custom faces with the G watch but
that's about as far as the customization
goes meanwhile Motorola offers an app to
tweak the fine details of many of its
watch faces and the company just this
week announced new watch bands in
multiple sizes and materials even more
customizable watch faces two different
casing colors and a moto body suite for
greater health and wellness tracking now
there's nothing stopping LG from
following suit with its software or
eventually its hardware but for now if
you want more customized ability the
Moto 360 is the way to go day to day as
smart watches these perform almost
identically despite having completely
different guts from processors to
batteries the G watch are came out of
the box very responsive and long-lasting
to boot making it about 36 hours between
charges with ambient display on and
after a few software updates the Moto
360 can now match that with none of the
sluggishness or short battery life that
plagued its early days both our ip67
rated for water resistance and both
benefit from an ever-growing ecosystem
of watch faces and apps at its heart
then this comparison is about cosmetics
and use case the first issue is almost
entirely subjective some will prefer the
chunky burly look of the G watch our
while others will appreciate the sleeker
more understated Moto 360 but the
cosmetics play into the utility because
the G watch R is more rugged looking I'm
less concerned about damaging it so it's
the one I would pick for an away mission
to a hostile hiking trail it whereas the
Moto 360 would be my preferred companion
at a fancy dinner
so unless you're buying entirely on
specs which I never recommend there's no
objective winner or loser here if you're
Bear Grylls
you'll probably favor the G watch R if
you're James Bond the Moto 360 is
probably the better bet be sure to let
us know which one you are leave a
comment down below telling us which
watch you choose if given the chance

wear devices here on YouTube and stay
