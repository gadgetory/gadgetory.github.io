calm and this is a software review of
the sony ericsson xperia play and this
is the unlock european version so it may
be different from the versions that come
to the states so let's get started
so the xperia play is running Android
2.3 along with the sony ericsson user
interface that includes the timeline and
if i go here i can view my timeline this
allows me to update my status through
facebook and twitter directly from my
device and i can also view what my
friends have posted as their status
updates so I want to just go here and I
can select my events I can go here and
add a new message if I like they want to
change my status I'll just go back home
we slide to the right we get the media
player which of course all these widgets
can be rearranged to the exact way that
you want them to be arranged so I have
some photos here so I can view a photo
if it like that it took on the device
the camera does not work too great and
I'll show you that in just a few minutes
and we can also be listened to some of
the media here I have a song that I
started playing and the speakers for
this device are phenomenal like it's
probably the best speakers that I've
ever heard on any mobile device it
sounds just like a regular stereo system
that you would that you would pay
hundreds of dollars for so we can go
back we can go over here and give you
the clock which is also just another
widget and we can also get tips and
information go down here we can add
things to these folders on the bottom so
we can add our media go down here and
change our messaging I don't have any
text messages in there right now you can
also go to our contact list and let's
just click done and I'm sure that it'll
try to show my phone number one of my
phones here so I can view my contact
list and I can also do my favorites and
go to the call logs so let's go back and
let's see what else do we have we have
the phone so this is the dialer
unfortunately we still are unable to get
a speed dial setting to come up on this
device so hopefully Android or Google
implements that in the future because it
would be nice to just start dialing and
have a name come up like it doesn't
certain HTC devices so we'll just go all
the way to this side we have our
PlayStation pocket which shows are
recently played games and tells get more
games and we also have these other
widgets which allow us to turn and turn
off radios so if we click down here we
can use some of the live wallpaper that
included and it only comes with a very
select few it comes with the generic
android live wallpaper along with a
classic PSP and the original PSP live
wallpaper so we can just go back and you
can change the colors on those live
wallpapers so if I go down here I can go
to my applications and I can rearrange
them based upon the my own order I can
change them to alphabetical which I have
set right now most use and recently used
which is a great thing to have recently
installed I should say so it's nice to
be able to have the applications where
you exactly want them based upon your
own preferences so I have the alarm I
have my browser which this device
already had flash 10.1 installed and I
upgraded that to 10.2 we have our
default calculator but it is reskinned
to the xperia a user interface kind of
style so we can just go back we have our
calendar it's pretty big and like how
this calendar is set up so I can view
the months and the days like also be my
events we have the camera application
and the camera on this device does not
work too great it wouldn't take photos
in low-light very well and whenever had
it set to auto flash it always like over
exposed photos so I I'll show you that
in the final review but we'll just get
this for now and we also have our clock
which is the default clock on every
Android device that's out about now and
we have a context with chirag saw the
email Facebook this does include
Facebook installed on it so you can also
upgrade that through the market we have
our galleries we can view our photos and
this is the same gallery that comes on
every Android device that's coming out
these days so we can view a photo here
in zoom and zoom out and change the way
that that's displayed so just go back
home with our applications can also get
gains I'll show you that in just a
second and go to our gmail our google
search our latitudes y'all seen our live
where manager which this is pretty cool
because if you plug in a headset you can
predetermine which application it's
going to launch so if I wanted to I
could have it launched the music
application based upon if I just plug in
the head
or headphones or whatever so we just go
back we have a media server which allows
us to sync wirelessly with our computers
over a network connection so all of you
is click this little button and it will
turn on and then I can add or delete
photos or media to and from the Xperia
Play so let us go back ever messaging
our music which we already saw on the
first widget we have our navigation
which is the same navigation that comes
on android 2.1 and above wherever news
don't whether we have a basic version of
Office sue this isn't the pro version
let's see if I have anything on here I
think I had one thing maybe not okay so
this is just an office viewer if you get
the pro you can edit things we have our
places we have our play down which
allows us to play media over the
playstation network so you can download
things and i'll but i haven't logged in
yet so let's go back and get playstation
pocket which shows us the same thing
that we saw on the beginning we should
see all of our recently played and our
recently added games we have a post card
which allows us to send Emma mms
messages in the form of a post card also
allows you to add geo-tagging
information go to our settings we have
our setup guide which is this is pretty
in-depth to set up so it just shows you
practically everything that you need to
do to set up the xperia play we'll just
go back support information allows you
to search for anything we can sync with
the playstation network and the sony
ericsson network i should say we have
google talk which is a basic android
application allows you to forward phone
calls to and from your device we have a
few more games and the timescape we've
already seen track ID which allows you
to it's kind of like Shazam you can
record audio and then it will listen to
it and then it'll show you exactly what
artists and track an album that is
coming from also a voice search and
Xperia Play and YouTube so let's go to
the xperia play and i'll show you how
some games work on this device so it
does come with five games of course
we're predicting that when it is
launched in the states it will come with
better games another theory is that
this device maybe the like predecessor
to the NGP the psp2 that's coming out in
the future that does allow for the
screen touches and also a better
controls because the other NGP device
has these two joysticks but there are of
course our joist exempt touchpads like
they are in the xperia play so let's go
into a game here we'll try bruce lee and
i'll show you how the gameplay works ok
so we can either select through the
menus on our d-pad here or we can also
use the on-screen so let's just choose
yes will touch the screen and let's see
here just go to play and I think it's
easier to select using the touch screen
than it is to use the d-pad or just go
to arcade and let's see here combat
settings eligible fight and now we can
begin playing this game and it's a
pretty simple fighting game ok so the
video graphics are really good the
rendering is excellent it's a far
superior to the PSP and let's see how we
can try fighting this guy because I
haven't played this too much so we'll
see and the gameplay works really well
that buttons are accurate and precise so
let's see here continue playing and
let's just try a different game so
another cool feature is you can just
slide out the gamepad and then it will
bring up your Xperia Play you can change
that in the settings by going here and
change it to if you want it to activate
or not so crash bandicoot is a ps1 game
that's been ported over to the Xperia
place we don't really need to see that
this is a pretty neat game I don't think
it's available on the PSP at least I
haven't found it it might be available
on me like a UMD just so you'll see how
the steam works in this game it does
utilize the touch pads down below so we
can steer and all that other great stuff
let's see can bypass all this
okay so we can either play with the
touch pads down below so we can steer
with the touch pads and they're pretty
responsive they're not the best let's
see here I think it's a little bit
easier to use the d-pad wall of steering
this event vehicle so let's just go up
and down now we want to attack something
so let's see here going to continue and
if i want i can shoot something over
here and the game continues on like this
and you have to be various missions to
the campaign so we'll just go to another
game okay so here we are on the sims 3
and 4 this game we need to use both the
touch screen and the device controller
so let's go here let's say what I want
to move my guy I want to select some
place outside I'll have a move around I
can also use one of the buttons to have
the the camera pan torts and I can move
the camera around with the touch pad and
I can also use the directional pad you
move it around they want to change the
view I can do that just by going here
and I can change the view using the
touchpad this touchpad doesn't really do
much for any of the games except for
that star battalion game so let us go
back home so to get more games all we
have to do is go down here until get
games and there's only about four other
games that are available when I
downloaded three of them because they
were free and they're just demo so we
can just go back so if we go to the
settings we can go to about information
view that the devices running Android
2.3 point to which is a little bit older
than the version that was released for
the nexus one and the nexus s can also
go back one thing that is missing from
this XP really is the ability to turn
off the automatic light sensor so if I
go down here I can change the brightness
but I can't turn off the automatic light
sensor even if I go home and go over
here I can still change the brightness
but it doesn't turn it off like any time
that I had moved the device in a various
angle as you don't know if you can see
that but the the brightness is changing
so frequently that it becomes rather
irritating possibly down here the
settings and this particular unlock
device does have Wi-Fi hot spots
available that you can use over your 3g
connection unfortunately in the United
States we do not have a 3g capable 920
100 bands okay so one final thing that
will do is we're going to run a quadrant
standard benchmark testing
let this load so let's run the full
benchmark and I'll be right back and
we'll see how it compares to some other
devices okay so they xperia play if you
got a 1584 on the quadrant standard test
so that's a much faster than a nexus one
running android 2.2 so this has been the
software review of the sony ericsson
xperia play if you like our videos make
