pocketnow.com and this is part 4 of the
video showdown between the black check
two and the motorola q9 global both on
the 18 teen network i'm going to start
off with the blackjack two here we're
going to do a typing speed test and i'm
going to type the common phrase the
quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
if you remember that from typing class
so i'm going to create a new message and
i'm not going to put a to address there
and i'm going to watch the clock for an
even number then i'm going to begin and
go okay that was nine seconds and let's
check the accuracy the quick brown g fox
jumped over the lack sea dog okay so i
didn't get it completely right I've
never typed this phrase before except on
a desktop computer ok and here we are
with the q 9 global i'm going to do the
same thing go into the messaging
application go into email type new no
address and i'm going to type the quick
brown fox jumped over the lazy dog i'm
watching the clock wait till it gets 25
seconds and go
and that was nine seconds also let's
check the accuracy hopefully you can
focus here the quick that's not spelled
right brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
so it looks like in our unscientific
test here the keyboard seemed to be
about the same in terms of accuracy and
and quickness though perhaps it's
because I'm behind a camera here and
it's kind of awkward that that happened
I'm actually surprised because the Q 9s
keyboard is far superior from a comfort
perspective at least than the blackjack
two I mean it's got these nice little
raised keys if you can kind of see that
here so that you can feel where each key
is and you can kind of slide your
fingers around on the keypad to get to
the letter whereas the blackjack 2 has
these notches and there are large spaces
between the keys I've gotten used to it
a bit though there's no doubt in my mind
that I like the q9 keyboard better it's
just a matter of personal preference and
and and feel I I guess so in this
department the Q non-global wins the
best keyboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
