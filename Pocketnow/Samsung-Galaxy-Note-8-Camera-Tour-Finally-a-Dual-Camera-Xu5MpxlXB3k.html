dual-camera party but it's okay to
arrive after your competition if you
bring the goods a standard view a zoom
lens and a portrait mode this story is
starting to sound familiar does Samsung
deliver here's a quick camera tour for
the note eight brought to you by D brand
this is currently the most popular setup
for dual camera phones a standard field
of view and somewhere around a 2 X zoom
popularized by Apple Samsung isn't
rocking the boat much and responding to
the iPhone competition but there are a
few refinements worth mentioning first
we have to disavow Samsung's marketing
claim of this setup including a
wide-angle camera and a zoom the main
camera sensor delivers a pretty normal
field of view for a phone a touch wider
than an iPhone maybe but it's certainly
not as open as dual camera phones that
offer almost panorama wide shots the
core photo experience is exceedingly
similar to the SI though in our early
impressions the additional controls for
live focus samsung's portrait mode
stickers and vics be vision take up
precious real estate on the main
viewfinder this app is starting to get
cluttered and for those that are looking
to maximize their photography investment
here there will be some memorization for
where other settings live for example
the muscle memory for the shutter button
is a gripe we carry over from the s8
press and hold on the button to burst
but if you slide slightly it'll activate
the zoom I've personally missed numerous
toddler activity shots because of this
gesture hidden under the most important
control on your viewfinder or trying to
slide a setting in manual mode only to
accidentally flip to your selfie camera
it's something you need to get a feel
for and will likely cause you to miss a
shot if you haven't practiced that
action while the navigation is becoming
a bit cumbersome the feature set is
about as complete as we should expect on
a flagship product excellent manual
controls fun auto modes and filters dual
pixel autofocus and now some extra reach
thanks to the second sensor the
equivalent of a 2x zoom adding optical
image stabilization proves too
be a significant benefit zoom sensors
are compromised by smaller apertures so
smoothing out handshake helps the camera
use a longer shutter to compensate and
UHD video is noticeably smoother than
non stabilized zoom cameras on the
pocket now team we generally prefer
ultra wide-angle cameras but this zoom
delivers better results than its
competition so hopefully we'll be more
inclined to use it live focus mode is
Samsung's flavor of software background
blur using the telephoto lens is the
main image and combining data from both
cameras for depth information it's more
flexible than Apple's portrait mode
working similarly to the Huawei Leica
cameras we've reviewed in the past like
Leica the effect can be manipulated in
post though the zoom sensor pushes you a
little farther away from your subject I
couldn't quite pull off a rear camera
selfie on the show floor an easy feat to
perform from an iPhone or honor when we
were back in our Airbnb early
impressions with the note 8 Samsung
reinforces why we still consider this
manufacturer one of the better
all-rounder camera options it's not
without some frustration feature creep
and design clutter but it's already
shaping up to be a solid performer for
the second half of 2017 which is good
because the camera competition this year
is going to be brutal and if you're one
of those people who will roll around in
the dirt to get the best shot you
probably also appreciate being able to
keep a good grip on your phone

from scratches and give you a little
more texture to hold on to your
