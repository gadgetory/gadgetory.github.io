smartphone looks like I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is the
Samsung Galaxy mega 6.3 unboxing as if
smartphones were not already large
enough Samsung went and announced two
new phones earlier this year the Galaxy
mega 5.8 and this one the Galaxy mega
6.3 as you can see the box is very
similar to all the other Samsung devices
that we've seen lately the Galaxy Note
8.0 the s4 so you've got this woodgrain
background and they're printed with
Swink so they are eco friendly which is
a good thing
but without further ado I'd like to get
into this box and see exactly how large
this phone is we can hit the box open
and it takes up almost the entire box
that is enormous let's take it out we'll
set that to the side for a quick minute
and if we look in under this little flap
we've got your typical reading materials
this actually comes with a four gigabyte
microSD card with a SD adapter extra
tips for your earbuds and of course the
earbuds themselves which are the same
ones you get with any other Samsung
device it comes packaged with them the
wall adapter USB and this gigantic
battery it is actually enormous it's
actually only 3200 million hours and
it's much larger than what you see on
the galaxy note 2 which is 31 hundred
milli amp hours but this one is much
larger so let's take this out of the
packaging here set that to the side and
we're going to stuff this up back in the
box just throw it in there I'll move
that around alright so here I will give
a quick tour the device will rip that
off on the back you've got the same
camera hump this is an 8 megapixel
camera there's your LED flash this is
your power button along the right edge
that's your IR blaster headphone jack
volume
and of course your USB slot on the
bottom and then on the front we've got
the same earpiece home button menu and
back and if we can let's just take this
off so we can get a look at how big the
display actually is it's enormous it
stretches almost edge to edge there's
very very little bezel there on the
sides and it is just an enormous phone
it is huge I've actually got the note 2
here for a comparison it is big it is
enormous
the display is 6.3 inches diagonally
four with a resolution of only 720p so
that's not 1080p like you'll see on
others this one suffers from the same
problem you see with most smaller
tablets is it's got 720p as a max
resolution so the bright side to that is
that it doesn't come with a AMOLED panel
which would mean it would be pentile and
it would look like it has a lower
resolution this is a TFT panel so it's
720p at T of T on the inside there is a
1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon 400 chipset
that's a dual core it has the 3200
million power battery 1.5 gigabytes of
RAM and this is the 8 gigabyte model as
we saw on the box
there's no LTE either this is the HSPA+
model and I believe that's it so we're
going to pop the battery in just quickly
show off how big the display is because
I don't know if the the camera is doing
any justice try this out here let's give
it a second to boot up and we'll do a
quick tour you've got the same faux
texture material on the back here and
around the front as you see on the
galaxy s4 which is nice you have a
unified branding and design and let's
see if we can get some color on the
screen and see how big it really is yeah
look at that that is that is enormous
let's do a little comparison here yeah
the screen is giant
it is huge so that has been an unboxing
of the Galaxy mega 6.3 stay tuned for a
lot more coverage on this over the next
week or so I'm Taylor Martin and I'll
see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
