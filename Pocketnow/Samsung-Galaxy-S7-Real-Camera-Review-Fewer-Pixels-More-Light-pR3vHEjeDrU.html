watching a phone review and when the
reviewer gets to the camera section all
they post are a couple of terrible shots
while riding the camera off because it's
not on their favorite phone don't you
want to know more about a phone camera
than what you might learn from a handful
of mediocre HDR shots let's do something
about this we live in an age where the
only camera a person might own is the
one bolted to the back of their phone so
shouldn't we review that with the same
attention we might give a standalone
camera there's more to smartphone
photography than just megapixels and
selfies shooting in real-world
conditions we're going to cover color
saturation exposure optics image
stabilization bouquet low-light focusing
video and any other fun features the
manufacturer might have packed on I'm
Juan Carlos bag now for pocket now and
here's our real camera review of the
Samsung Galaxy s7 brought to you by deep
brand buckle up folks we've got a lot of
ground to cover and we're going to move
pretty quick first a little housekeeping
the galaxy s7 is utilizing a one over
two point six inch 12 megapixel image
sensor with a native aspect ratio of 4
by 3 the lens has a huge aperture of f17
and a fairly y 27 millimeter equivalent
field of view with hardware optical
image stabilization our review unit is
an ATT branded model powered by a
Qualcomm 820 and utilizing a sony image
sensor I shot samples at full resolution
and will be cropping to show a closer
look at details and this video is being
uploaded at UHD resolution to match the
highest quality output from the camera
any adjustments made to the image will
be detailed in the upper left corner of
the frame starting with exposure and
saturation it shouldn't come as any
surprise that most photos in daylight
are going to be overexposed by around
1/2 a stop at least and while Samsung
has dialed back some of the saturation
pop they've been known for in the past
output from this camera can still easily
be called juicy or punchy blues greens
and browns look lush and the sensor does
a fantastic job of handling color
gradations like moving from a dark blue
sky to lighter blue then to the green
grass nor do we see exaggerations on
rust or wood colors white objects in the
Sun are obviously the hardest to expose
for and I was excited to see that in
auto mode Samsung is now consistently
using more
of a spot metering than a matrix or
average system tapping on the brightest
part of this calla lily the camera is
ignoring darker background information
and we're retaining quite a bit of the
flowers texture moving to warmer colors
like yellows we start to see information
loss to this combination of juicy
saturation and overexposure hot spots on
this hibiscus destroy the crinkly
texture of the petals reds are always
the hardest color to expose for on
digital sensors and they can prove
problematic here in sunlight lots of
small details in these Bougainville
blossoms are gone the color starts
sizzling fearing more into purplish or
magenta territory dialing back the
exposure can help a little but really
you need to jump into the s7s Pro mode
and set up a custom color profile when
facing this kind of scene overall we get
terrific dynamic range though that might
be difficult to see sometimes because of
this philosophy of producing bright
photos dialing back the exposure even
just a third of a stop will often retain
more detail in highlights without
creating too many issues for shadowed
areas of the frame average JPEG files
are between three and five megabytes
with RAW files eating up around 25
megabytes of storage
considering the reduction in resolution
even the JPEG files are retaining quite
a bit of detail and doing a little light
editing is certainly not out of the
question
it's difficult to point to the lens or
the lower resolution but when pixel
peeping the output from this camera is a
little on the soft side we get good
contrast but on our review unit we do
see subtle deformation on street lights
and nighttime shots taking a quick look
at the raw files there's tons of
information to play with and you can
pull quite a bit of info out of shadows
and highlights but pixel level details
still feels a bit dull applying
sharpness we just can't pull the same
kind of clarity out of these raw images
that we might from cameras like the
Lumia 950 and even the LG v10 in similar
situations can offer more detail from a
lens which is more prone to distortion
and aberration we've seen numerous
comments from people disappointed by the
more square-ish aspect ratio though even
accounting for the crop to achieve a 16
by 9 image you'll still end up with
plenty of resolution to play with for
most conditions it's not likely you'll
be viewing these images on a 9 megapixel
or higher display that's a slightly
higher resolution than a UHD TV the main
complaint or compromise here is zooming
and cropping the galaxy s7 should be
treated a bit more like a camera with a
fixed aperture prime lens as much as you
can if you want to zoom you should zoom
with your feet will show more of the
zoom image degradation a little later in
this review the huge f 1.7 aperture also
introduces some issues for specific
situations first of all most phones with
larger apertures now will have some
issues with lens flares and internal
reflections like these little floating
UFOs here the other issue is found in
macro shots the depth of field blur you
can create when getting close to your
subject is absolutely gorgeous but the
field of focus this aperture creates is
razor thin even on small objects it was
difficult getting a whole flower in
focus this tiny blossom is smaller than
my pinky nail and we see some fringing
and ghosting along the edges of the
flowers it's already falling out of
focus to be sure the aperture is a huge
help in low-light shots but there are a
few compromises for other styles of
photography Samsung has been touting the
dual pixel technology of this sensor
claiming it's the fastest and most
accurate focusing for any phone and I
think they might be right in our
focusing test here I was not able to
physically move my finger fast enough
from one part of the screen to the other
to actually tax this sensor it's
remarkable performance and the actual
focusing action is noticeably smoother
than the twitchy focus we've become
accustomed to on previous Samsung's
it now handily competes for accuracy
with laser assisted focusing options and
is almost always faster if there's a
criticism to be had it's my pet peeve
about miss focusing reporting I wish
there was better confirmation for focus
I really enjoy green and red boxes to
let me know I might not have locked onto
my subject trying to lock on here I just
get the same gray circle I get in every
single situation I was really too close
as the minimum focusing distance is
actually here a red indicator would have
been nice to let me know that I didn't
actually lock focus white balance on the
s7 veers warm in daylight but not to a
point of disruption I feel the color
here represents the scene well moving
the shaded shots I'm happy to see the
tone remains on the warmer side even
though these shots are in shade this is
still Southern California and the s Evan
avoids the trap of overcompensating with
a colder out put another gripe I have
with most Android
cameras is how they process HDR photos
high dynamic range means we should see
more details in darker and brighter
areas of our frame but more often than
not Android HDR just becomes a shadow
brightening mode the s7 often Falls for
this trap
making darker elements in the frame
brighter but highlights either remain
the same or get worse I'm not a huge fan
of HDR processed images in general and I
feel more often you can land a better
looking photo with a quick exposure
adjustment but it's frustrating to see
the SM and simply exaggerate the already
bright photos the camera takes panorama
performance is absolutely fantastic
improving even on the note 5 a sideways
scan through a scene showcases wonderful
stitching even on fine details like
these power lines exposure is handled
terrifically as you'll probably be
looking at the Sun at some point during
a pan through a landscape and it is also
kind of fun looking back through the
motion photo video which is created from
that panorama I don't spend a lot of
time on selfie cameras but Samsung still
has one of the better options for a
front-facing shooter get a decent 5
megapixel resolution a nice wide field
of view where it's easy to line up a
shot of you and your background and the
video mode is fantastic for delivering
quad HD resolution Samsung's beauty
modes might be getting out of hand
though all of these various controls to
alter your face shape eye size and to
purposely blur the frame produce
horrific Lee plasticky unflattering
results Samsung is taking a gamble on
reducing the sensor resolution they lose
the marketing bullet point of having
more megapixels but can point to better
low-light performance indoors their plan
would seem to be working the shot was
taken handheld at one tenth of a second
in fairly dark conditions and we get a
reasonably well exposed image it's not
too far off the mark from the same shot
lit by a single desk lamp though
obviously this has more than twice as
fast a shutter speed throwing the flash
will help in better freezing action for
your shot helpful for situations where
people might be moving around but the s7
does a fantastic job of harnessing
available light in nighttime situations
the spot metering can sometimes trip you
up here on the street scene I focused on
the billboard and the entire shot is too
dark focusing on the business sign below
the billboard gives a better overall
result but then blows out the bright
Street sign on our creepy tunnel shot
lens flare
chromatic aberrations from the
streetlight are a bit distracting but
the information retained around the
tunnel is excellent considering how long
the shutter was held open where white
balance veers warm in daylight the s7
lands a bit cooler at nighttime
especially on objects lit by yellowish
artificial lighting this creepy gate is
something of a halfway point between the
white of the gate and the ugly yellow of
the security light adjusting the white
balance in the exposure can get us a bit
closer to what the scene looks like in
real life on this walkway shot we can
clearly see the differences in color
temperature between these two security
lights and again the s Evan showcases
excellent dynamic range as the blown out
hotspots under each lighter fairly small
pixel keeping again though the noise
reduction here is turning fine details
into watercolour smudges moving to
extremely low light situations
last year's galaxy s6 would often just
refuse to find focus in situations like
these the s Evan does not suffer the
same issues sure this is a terrible shot
and you should probably use your
flashing conditions like this but
Samsung now joins LG in being able to
focus properly on the subject with very
little available light manual controls
are terrifically helpful in pairing the
s Evan up with the tripod it's
wonderfully easy to pull off long
exposure shots you can shoot up to a 10
second exposure for all your streaking
tail light needs though I do wish we
could shoot longer as some competitors
allow for up to a 30 second exposure now
moving over to UHD video we're saving
around a 50 megabit per second video
file and we can expect file sizes
between 350 and 375 megabytes per minute
of footage plus the time limit for UHD
has been increased to 10 minutes per
file the galaxy s7 adds the ability to
manually focus in video and to adjust
white balance but we don't get shutter
speed control which would be nice for
those looking to shoot super crispy
action while shooting video we can take
a better look at the zoom action there's
less resolution to do aggressive pixel
resampling and as you might imagine
pushing to the farthest reach of the
zoom creates a blown-up image degrading
overall quality this is one area we're
having more pixels to play with would
obviously improve the final results
video also gives us a great look at
image stabilization the galaxy s7 has
optical image stabilization for all
shooting modes
so even while recording UHD video though
this icon is greyed out you can still
see the slight jello effect from the
lens elements trying to compensate for
my footfalls happily this effect is far
more restrained than what we might see
from LG and Microsoft when shooting
1080p video at 30 frames per second we
can also employ software stabilization
which crops the frame now I'm usually
not a fan of both hardware and software
stabilization being used at the same
time but Samsung has done a great job
balancing the lens distortions against
the pan and scan software compensation
we get a nearly ethereal floating
tracking shot which approaches the
software stabilization of the iPhone and
which avoids the buzzy nasur jerkiness
we might see from the LG v10 on the
whole the phone keeps up well with
higher resolution video and faster frame
rates there are the occasional dropped
frames but action for the most part is
fluid the 60 frames per second mode
creates super slick video which we can't
show off here but through the magic of
editing we can use it to create a high
quality half speed playback audio is
also top-notch excellent stereo
microphones paired with a conservative
but effective noise reduction filter
delivers some of the best audio I've
ever heard from an Android device
attesting exposure transitions moving
from dark to bright and back the galaxy
s7 is a little twitchy er than previous
galaxies the exposure and white balance
still bloom pleasantly very even-handed
changes with barely perceptible steps in
altering ISO and shutter speed but the
autofocus is jumpier as exposure changes
it's more prone to hunting around than
last year's phones were Samsung still
leads in this test but competitors are
closing in on similar exposure
adjustments and calmer autofocus
performance checking out low-light video
it's almost always brighter than it
needs to be sometimes by almost a full
stop spot metering can at least make
sure that you're exposing for what you
think is important but more often than
not producing the brighter scene just
means more noise than we really need
lastly the slow motion setting on the
galaxy s7 is excellent 240 frames per
second video at 720p resolution it's
almost at the level of iPhone and Nexus
6p quality and the only issue keeping it
from reaching that top tier is I'm
seeing a few more dropped frames from
the galaxy than I do on those other two
competitors even though it's not the
best this is a lot more fun to play with
than last year Samsung's in LG's so
where does that leave us with the camera
on the Samsung Galaxy s7 it would seem
we're approaching the limits of the half
inch camera sensor faster than we hit
the wall on third inch camera sensors
Samsung's experiment here is focused on
speed and low-light performance judged
by those standards samsung has largely
succeeded this camera performs very well
in challenging lighting conditions and I
don't think a faster camera has been
created in terms of launching the app or
in auto focusing to achieve those goals
though we do see compromises elsewhere
software output then we're usually
accustomed to from a galaxy more
chromatic aberration and lens distortion
and as I'm a huge fan of shooting macro
pics I can't say this is my favorite
camera for getting really up close to a
subject the wider f1 points have an
aperture possibly contributing to my
personal issues focusing fast enough to
prevent missing the shot landing good
photos indoors with natural light and
pushing low-light situations to their
limits this is where the s7 excels to be
sure this is a very good camera and even
with some of these compromises the s7
will likely land in the top five of our
favourites for the year for the most
part I had a lot of fun shooting with it
and only occasionally with
pining for the features or settings I
enjoy on Lumias and LG's as
manufacturers focus on specific goals
though we savvy consumers should start
to walk away from the idea that any
phone company can create a faultless
