tried HTC and valves game-changing VR
headset in the time since it's gotten a
new name better hardware and well it's
been delayed but it's still just as
mind-blowing as before I'm Michael
Fisher with pocket now and this is a
hands-on look at the vibe pre the vive
pre is the updated version of the
original HTC revive i tested nearly a
year ago the device that single-handedly
made me care about virtual reality the
pre edition is sleeker and more
lightweight with a single wire
connecting it to a computer instead of
the thick harness of the prototype
there's a camera now providing a window
to the outside world and a means of
keeping you from walking into objects
via a new feature called chaperone the
vibes accessories have also been
upgraded the wall-mounted sensors are
now simple boxes with standard tripod
mounts and the handheld controllers are
super lightweight more ergonomic and
wireless to boot these improvements make
the vive pre much more accessible as a
consumer product still selling the vibe
is bound to be anything but easy for HTC
and valve if virtual reality is an
incredibly difficult product to pitch to
people who haven't used it and with
simpler cheaper competition like oculus
rift gear VR and Google cardboard out
there it telling people that in addition
to buying a high-end gaming computer
they've got to mount sensors to their
walls and devote a whole room to this
device while that only adds to the
uphill struggle our entire ground team
got to try the vibe at CES and even
after a year of me waxing poetic about
the product these concerns along with
the very real danger of tripping over
the wire during a walkabout gave some of
them pause the vive experience is still
a singular one it's the only mass-market
VR product that lets you literally walk
around the room you're standing in both
physically and virtually being able to
roam the virtual space to get a
different perspective on the mid air
painting you've drawn or to move around
your imaginary office to make messes of
different things or to try to see the
entirety of the whale you're swimming
with underwater
that more than anything is what makes
the vibe special it adds a degree of
immersive pneus that's just not there
when you're sitting in a chair wearing
one of the other visors de vive demo
area at CES made it clear that it's
still blowing minds literal shrieks of
delight could be heard as one woman
explored the underwater shipwreck I
wrote about last year and if you don't
have a whole room to devote to vibe it
can also serve as a more conventional
desk-bound vr headset when needed I
demoed it with the space combat
simulator elite dangerous and it was
impressive though I still prefer the
stand up mode with over a month to go
before pre-orders open and no firm word
on pricing there are still plenty of
variables when it comes to the vive pre
and of course we'll have to see how it
performs in the real world when we take
it for a full review for now even after
a four-month release delay and rumors of
a high price tag I'm still much more
excited for the vibe pre than I ever
thought I'd be for a VR product and
given my teammates reactions and a
chance encounter with two other CES
attendees on my plane ride home if both
of whom were almost as effusive in their
praise as I was the first time I tried
it I know I'm hardly the only one this
