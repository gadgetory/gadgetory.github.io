over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's take another look at one of the
most polarizing Google phones ever I'm
Michael Fisher this is the Nexus 6 and
this is episode 46 of after the buzz in
retrospect the Nexus 6 seemed to define
an upper level of acceptability for huge
phones in the main strand like Captain
Picard consumers seem to say this far no
farther I very much doubt we'll see many
more gigantic phones like this hit the
mainstream and not much on the hardware
side has changed in the seven months
since we reviewed it aside from a
problem with the back covers peeling off
on some devices which is a shame on such
a pricey phone it's still the hulking
mass in the hand the dense anchor in the
pocket
no smartphone launched into wide
availability sense has even come close
to this phone's displacement if it were
a ship it would be an ultra large crude
carrier the physical manifestation of
the human preoccupation with size I'm
not one for skinny jeans but on an
article of clothing with even slightly
below average pocket size well the thing
takes up some space to understand the
downside of this kind of scale just try
using the Nexus 6 with one hand open any
app that puts it back arrow or context
menu in the upper left corner of the
screen and use your right hand to try
selecting it ever notes a good example
because saving a note requires you to
use that function and not androids back
key at the bottom same with Google Docs
use the phone one-handed enough and you
might come close enough to dropping it
to make you want a protective case which
will of course only make the thing
bigger
fortunately the upside of oversized is
still pretty cool there's so much more
acreage on this nearly 6-inch display I
tend to stick with a fairly minimal home
screen but there's enough area here to
go pretty information dense if you want
to you've got space to spread out on a
keyboard is sharing photos with parents
won't instantly make them dive for their
glasses and of course watching movies or
gaming is much more immersive oh and I
still have yet to use another smartphone
with front firing speakers this loud the
HTC One m9 delivers more nuance yes but
in terms of sheer amplitude the Nexus 6
blows it away
internally the Nexus 6 is aged quite
well the Snapdragon 805 within it might
have seemed a little long in the tooth
by now were it not for the thermal
troubles attributed to its successor as
things stand the 805 seems just dandy
and it continues to perform well with
the help of three gigs of RAM kudos to
Google for future proofing in this
regard ditto on the wireless charging
which is a much bigger deal nowadays
thanks to Samsung making so much noise
about it on the Galaxy s6
on the whole the Nexus 6 Hardware holds
up nicely and so does the software
finally it was a bumpy road getting
there though as we've said a few times
before Android 5.0 was no picnic even on
the capable hardware the Nexus 6
unfortunately 5.1 has ironed out most of
those initial stumbles and our early
experiments with Android M on this
monster are promising so I'd sure like
to see Google rip off that mean take
inspiration from Apple's reach ability
as Microsoft recently did for Windows 10
mobile also it would be great to see
multi window multitasking finally added
to stock Android or at least smart use
of multi column views when you switch to
landscape in certain apps a big screen
like this just feels wasted if you can't
take full advantage of it Motorola did
liberally borrow from itself here it
adapted the always listening voice
command feature of the Moto X for the
Nexus 6 and being able to trigger it
with the screen off is still a very nice
convenience ambient display is another
Moto X transplant but this one never
really worked as elegantly or reliably
as it did on the smaller phone and
updates haven't really changed that the
camera remains largely the same as well
which is to say it's okay just looking
at the end results might lead you to
believe it's above-average you can
really get some pretty nice shots out of
this thing given the right lighting and
the 13 megapixel image size means you
can do a little digital zoom too without
losing too much detail and though the
selfies are only 2 megapixel they're
also fairly good the problem is the
process of taking a picture once again
the phone's size plays against it the
lockscreen camera shortcut is tough to
hit with a thumb and that problem only
gets worse if you're rushing to get a
shot
the Google camera app has gotten some
updates to be faster in HDR mode but
it's still laggy at points and it's very
slow to focus meaning you'll be retaking
a lot of photos and asking people to
restrike a pose pretty often and the
focus drift remains in camcorder mode
too which makes for frustratingly blurry
videos so even though the camera is
capable of some really nice output it's
not the most fun smartphone to shoot
with fortunately the Nexus 6 does give
you plenty of time to try to get that
perfect shot because it's battery is
well and truly cute sure we've seen
bigger Power Packs sense but they're few
and far between no Google doesn't pay me
to say this but my favorite new game is
in breasts which between keeping the
screen and GPS on all the time is a real
power sucker I can still play it for
hours and hours with the Nexus 6 before
recharging at more conventional use
usually gets me about five hours of
screen on time between charges now we
were disappointed with that performance
in the review and to be honest that
figure should still be higher with a
battery this huge I still miss the 10
hour screen on time I got out of last
summer's huawei ascend debate too but
given the super high-resolution display
here we can sort of forgive that
especially considering the abysmal
battery life of some of the recent
competition probably the area this phone
has aged the most is in terms of its
positioning its price with increasingly
capable offerings at ever cheaper price
points the market has changed around the
Nexus 6 a recent round of discounts has
helped but it's still not as affordable
as previous Nexus offerings which is
still an issue for some people combine
that with a size that turns some
consumers off and you can see why
certain folks are stoked about the
rumors of a Nexus 5 resurrection slash
sequel this coming fall a smaller
simpler and probably cheaper handset a
nexus phablet might have been inevitable
in some respects but it's definitely an
acquired taste
the thing about acquired tastes is that
sometimes once you acquire them it's
tough to go back to anything else thanks
to a tee we've had a Nexus 6 loaner at
the pocket
now offices for a while and between
review devices I keep coming back to it
as weird as lollipop can be as
inconsistent as the camera is and as
clunky as the hardware can feel at times
some things about the Nexus 6 are just
really alluring as long as you've got
two hands available it's comfortable to
use material design makes for a very
slick looking software experience
without the need to theme and if the
size really bugs you you can pair it
with a SmartWatch so you don't need to
take it out of a pocket as often if
you're considering a nexus you owe it to
your wallet or your pocketbook to wait
until the fall at this point even if the
next generation devices don't do it for
you it's likely the Nexus 6 we'll see
yet another price cut at that time but
if I needed right now to pick a tablet
replacement phone that hadn't last me a
while the Nexus 6 would be even higher
on my list than it was back in December
I really like it and oddly I like it a
lot better than I did seven months ago
maybe I'll even use it to finally take
the plunge and try project five but
that's another topic for another video
