and i'm here with the samsung nexus s 4g
for sprint and as you can see right here
got your 4g settings try to turn on 4g
and this 4g is obviously wimax not LTE
as as with verizon nexus phone which is
exactly right so I'm not sure if 4g is
working we'll have to the buttons are in
place here and interesting that the home
button is all the way on the right and
the back buttons all the way to left so
these buttons are different than most
Android handsets it's not super in
Berlin ok so 4G network connected so we
now have a network connection let's go
to the browser this one has for my
mother picking both feet google has a
different screen
well
yes
fools
Jenkins
ok so that was super quick loaded this
page right away
rotations good
can anything
go back home to see it's a little harder
to reach over there when you're doing
this with your left hand
now we've obviously seen all this
hardware before you see we've got the
curved front glass display got reduce
camera on the back think it's 8
megapixels don't don't quote me on that
though back looks a lot like got many of
the many of the the galaxy s variants
that we've seen
so here we've got the notification this
way
take the barn
so let's see if there's anything else we
can test it for jion with here
now hidden Netflix or anything
unfortunately
google search
oh they're asking you to pay for this so
this is actually the only page we can
see here sure why they would do that
so scrolling is really smooth you know
everything is basically the same nexus s
debt that we've seen before except with
that you know that benefit of 4G so this
is definitely going to be a popular
addition to Sprint's lineup for no other
reason than because it's got naked
Android so to speak meaning that there's
no there's no manufacturer you is too
late over so you know it's going to be
less bloat and probably going to make
the system run a little faster so this
was the nexus s 4g from samsung it's
coming to sprint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
