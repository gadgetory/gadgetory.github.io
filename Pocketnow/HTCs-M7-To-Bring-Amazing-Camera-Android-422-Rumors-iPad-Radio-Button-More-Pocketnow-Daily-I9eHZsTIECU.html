release date HTC prepares a new camera
and sound experience for the m7 and
Amazon Oh amazon is now offering coins
I'm hi Mary vetta and no I don't have
any brick devices just yet but this is
 out daily for those of you
waiting for android 5.0 key lime pie
where though seems to be a little bump
on the road just before that apparently
Android 4.2 point2 will be released
mid-february and then we could probably
expect key lime pies to happen later now
there are no specifics on what we could
expect on 4.2 point2 but damn that name
is a great tongue twister now apparently
HTC is planning for more than just an m7
launch on februari 19 there are new
rumors that their new camera technology
which is being dubbed ultrapixel is not
only on par with every single camera
that's great right now but apparently
it's also as great as the 808 PureView
camera which is 41 megapixels which
means we'll probably get some pixel
doubling but we sadly don't get any
specifics on what we should expect
except for the fact that it'll be great
and we'll see about that apparently
sound experiences are also getting good
but since HTC lost their stake on beats
audio I wonder what that means they
tuned so iOS 6.1 has brought a new
mystery to the table I Pats are now
showing a new radial x button that's
currently being hidden and the question
is what is that we all know that Apple
is apparently working on bringing the
new service to compete with Pandora
Spotify but we sadly don't know what to
expect yet and given the fact that Apple
usually has their music announcements
until the fall it's kind of hard to tell
why iOS 6.1 includes that though we
remember iTunes Match was launched at
WWDC so it could probably be that we
could probably get something earlier
we'll just keep you posted we don't know
when that could happen now on the other
hand some analysts that barons now have
a new prediction that says that Apple's
apparently working on a 5 inch phablet
to be launched by the end of this year
and I'm not really going to even go into
specifics this is going to be a really
small news post analyst of brooms just
write this down not going to happen
and finally for the ridiculousness of
the day amazon is now releasing a new
service called amazon coins to be
launched in May and yet as if the human
race hasn't already spent the past five
decades trying to get rid of coins in
order to get paper bills amazon is not
releasing a new service you could
actually buy in advance for you to be
able to pay for amazon services which
makes no sense at all when you already
have amazon one-click buying I'm trying
to figure out what's the point here but
that leads you to the question of the
day how big is amazon right now in your
buzz radar how big are they I mean
seriously they completely lost their
stake in my buzz radar with their Kindle
devices this year I've completely even
forgotten there's a kindle tablet out
there but leave us a comment down below
do you really care about amazon right
now and if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet roll make sure you
follow us on pocketnow.com and make sure

it up thanks for watching and stay tuned

jailbreaking your iOS 6 device city has
been completely down lately but we're
waiting for that to get better for us to
record more videos
