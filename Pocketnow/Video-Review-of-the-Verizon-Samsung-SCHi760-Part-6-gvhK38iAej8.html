pocketnow.com this is part 6 of the
video review of the verizon samsung i760
today i will go over some of the verizon
and samsung specific software in
settings included on the i760 let's take
a look at the today screen we've got the
samsung digital clock plug-in we've also
got the verizon wireless plugin which
allows us to access the wireless manager
directly and this is a verizon
application that allows you to manage
the different communications features on
the phone and allow you to turn
everything off for flight mode we also
have a little link to get applications
which will take you directly to the hand
ango website where you can download
applications over the year to be
installed on your i760 now let's look at
the settings so if we look at the
personal settings the first setting that
you'll find that is different from most
other windows mobile phones is the skin
setting this allows you to modify the
different phone skins easily I mean it's
also possible to do this with
third-party applications but this is the
included settings applications which is
a very nice little feature under system
we've got the data connection
application which allows you to set
tether a laptop either by USB or by
bluetooth I found that the speeds were
actually lower on the Bluetooth than the
USB and since this phone does not do
evdo revision a which is the faster
version of evdo it's actually slower
than most data card you could you you
can purchase from verizon
but the speed is definitely still
acceptable in his downloads upward of
one megabits per second in uploads in
the three to 400 kb range you also have
a little sound equalizer which allows
you to actually manipulate the sound for
the headphone jack but this only works
for the headphone jack and does not work
for Bluetooth enabled headsets we go
over to the bluetooth settings you'll
find that there's some additional
settings you can set up a printer which
is something that's not part of the
standard wooden window mobiles of
Bluetooth stack and there's an obe x ftp
profile available under bluetooth given
the current constrained memory models of
windows mobile i found the best part of
the i760 is the available storage and
program memory at boot time without any
user application or data installed on
the system you have about the 64
megabytes available and almost 30
megabytes of program memory available
this is up plenty of memory to run many
programs without having to do a soft
reset every couple days like is required
on some devices all in all I find this
phone to be very powerful I mean you may
debate me on the looks with the keypad
and the fact that it is a very
utilitarian looking device but it really
gets the job done and is a very nice
windows mobile phone and is extremely
solid I've really only had to soft reset
it when i was doing installed or
changing settings I think Samsung and
Verizon
a winner here it would just be nice for
it to be a global phone but the rumors
are that samsung and verizon will come
out with an i860 in the future which
will have both cdma and gsm capabilities
that's it for this review and I'll post
my likes and dislikes in the near term
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
