and we're looking at the touchflo 3d
interface on the new HTC diamond now
first off you get to this clock screen
says call history and then there's a one
appointment list there date time I was
up here if I flick it like that you get
to see to counter appointments but
that's it that's all you get look down
again got clock now down here you got
your two soft keys bounine programs up
here is the regular start menu and these
icons here if you press on the one
selected tells you what it is so that's
good because this one looks like msn
messenger this one looks like another
instant messaging program this one has a
letter so that's probably email this one
looks like a globe so maybe that's maps
but kind of ambiguous icons but if you
press this and I scroll it actually
tells you what it really means
now here's the people
there's add a new one you can flick by
flicking that way or you can tap on the
select one and then roll down and then
it flips through them all to get to the
one you select it see that again
so that's people and you can instantly
call your favorite people there you can
also swipe like this it will go to the
next section which is messages and it
shows text messages this icon up here is
not labeled so we don't really know what
is turns out that makes a new message
down here you can access all messages
and the menu brings up a finger friendly
menu 3 items new replying delete and you
can flick like that to see other
messages
you can go back
if you tap on that it will open up the
threaded text message view windows
mobile 6.1
next icon is messaging see that there
this opens a big envelope with a little
preview of the newest messages you can
flick like this to switch between emails
or it's going to open that
and these are two email accounts right
here so you can see flicks flips around
and animates a lot up here is another
icon that is a new message and here's a
menu that gives you three options new
email accounts or send and receive
there's no reply button there and over
here is inbox which will bring you to
the regular list these are just previews
that suz shows the sender the subject
and couple lines of the message next
icon turns out to be internet it's a big
icon here for lunch browser that open
opera and we can flick like this and it
shows some bookmarks as well as the
YouTube application next icon notice how
these icons are moving this is the one
in the middle now kind of in the middle
but they're never in the same place
twice so you really can't develop motor
memory
the photos and videos panel shows little
previews of your photos this button over
here launches the camera if you want to
take more pictures this one opens the
video player or video camcorder if you
want to record a video and you can look
through pictures like this down here is
album that will open the HTC album
program or you can do a slideshow with
pictures so I just saw before I tap on
that it comes to a full-screen picture
I can zoom
notice the accelerometer is switching
orientation very quickly our next icon
is a music notes that's our music player
you can play music like that
you see it's working up here it's a
little
magi music you can flick like this but
this is supposed to animate however none
of my album aren't synced through
windows media player only the songs that
were included on the hard drive actually
worked with this with the album art I
haven't really figured out the right way
to get album art to work here but it
definitely doesn't come through via
sinking windows media player so that's
problem down here is a menu shuffling at
playlist those comments over here's a
library this brings you to the HTC audio
manager interface now this is I really
don't like to sell you see these icons
down here they're all kind of ambiguous
you got music notes you got music notes
you got all sorts of things you have to
tap on it to figure out what it means
artists okay playlist all songs really
hard to understand here and what's worse
is there's no scroll bar here so I don't
know how long this list is and I've only
seen what five items turns out you have
to flick and you have to flick and
there's no way of getting to like the
end of the alphabet really quickly you
got to do all this you got to keep going
you guys keep going flick-flick
flick-flick flick-flick hook it's just
like an iphone flick flick flick okay
there we are finally
alright
so that's pretty annoying you got
playlist those are synced
here again there's no search
nope no search
so
you just gotta flick to find the song
one hears now it's flipping see that's
how it's supposed to flick
see if there's no I'll mark between
sizes as a flick
well whatever next icon over here you
can tap them you can slide them you can
slide the whole panel that's your
weather up windshield wiper so you can
assign a number of cities here there's
Brussels knockers and it's very animated
very cool looking
this menu allows you to add more
locations update it change the
temperature
now this is another problem but no
scroll bar I don't know how long this is
I'm going to find the United States so I
gotta flick flick flick biblebob still
going and still going this is a huge
pain really annoying oh I missed it oh I
missed it
now there's no search so I don't know
what cities here are going to be here if
I search for Scarsdale I got a search
and do all this flicking
keep going keep going out too far nope
it's not listed so now what you gotta
guess to what city is going to be here
there's Yonkers
so that's a bit annoying those are some
iphone features brought over and next
icon well let me show you this first
back in the weather switch to wither
this is 5 day
that shows you the forecast
extra settings then it uh there's five
items but it turns out there's another
one it's sitting you can't tell it you
can find it it's not scrolling
wallpapers sound data sync
communications data and lasts icon
there's programs so you got nine
programs right here you can remove one
that's gone and then you can add one it
shows you the list programs here you
have to flick
again kind of annoying
that's back down here is all programs
which gives you a list in alphabetical
order and you can flick to find your
other programs to open
now you also don't know this but you can
flick this to another panel of programs
again nothing indicating that that is
possible so that's the whole touchflo
interface it's all one big today's
screen plugging so if I go to the river
start menu
you'll see in the today it's just this
is it that's that's everything touchflo
3d I can shut it off they'll go back to
normal windows mobile 6.1
but you can actually get around this
without going into the windows mobile
old style interface if you don't like
that but I do it's nice ok that's enough
foot touch flow for now this is a plane
