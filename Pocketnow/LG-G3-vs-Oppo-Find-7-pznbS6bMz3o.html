manufacturers highest and on the market
so which one would you choose the phone
made by a company that already has a
history of making good smart phones or
the phone from a relatively young
manufacturer that wants to prove itself
on the market that's what we'll try to
find out in our LG g3 versus Opel find
seven comparison coming to you right now
Wall Street the Oppo find 7 like we've
never seen or touch the Oppo find 7 a
though we already have an extensive
review of it since the two fine sevens
are identical on the outside will
reiterate our feelings and thoughts from
the 7a Opel brings a fresh design and
the build that has premium written all
over it
from the quality of materials to the
exceptional sensorial reward you get
when you hold it to the nice combination
of curves and straight lines there's
little not to like about the Oppo find 7
exterior add to that what we think is
probably the coolest notification LED on
the market today and you get yourself a
very attractive phone most of your
friends will ask about until they hear
the name Oppo usually followed by who's
that the LG g3 on the other hand needs
no introduction it is the best that LG
has ever made by far its metal imitating
plastic curved back every small bezels
and Mac Mountain buttons will surely
turn heads we have more thoughts on the
g3 in our extensive review both here on
youtube as well as on pocket now both
phones are exceptionally built and a
pleasure to hold if five inch plus
phones are your thing and if your hands
are large enough despite both having 5.5
inch displays the fine 7 is taller wider
thicker and heavier than the LG g3
that's not to say the fine 7 is obscene
and its own bezels around the screen are
fairly small though the g3 wins here
adding to the extra height is also the
fact that the fine 7 uses capacitive
below the screen buttons while LG went
with an on screen button approach
however those looking to get the largest
screen and the smallest form factor will
probably sway towards the g3 between the
two the fine 7 is using Apple's own
color OS based on Android 4.3 think of
it as a heavily
- mice Android experience something
which you unfortunately find on the g3
as well with LG's own user interface
running on Android 4.4.2 kitkat on this
unit which we are comparing right here
to that extent we believe that the user
interface is the weakest point of the g3
while it is not so intrusive and why not
somewhat better-looking on the fine 7
the styles and user experience
approaches couldn't be any more
different opposed icons while custom for
most default applications are
skeuomorphic can be like well on the g3
it's a complete mess combining squared
icons with branded icons
despite the user's ability to change the
icons for shortcuts on the g3 however
you can run certain apps in windowed
mode as well as side by side while the
option is not available on the find 7
and another thing that she won't be able
to find on the Apple phone is the
ability to customize the home key row
down on the bottom from the looks of it
to its functionality the cameras on both
phones are able to generate results that
would please almost every occasional
amateur photographer while neither of
the two excel in low-light conditions
the g3 and its optical image
stabilization coupled would laser
autofocus assist
seems to produce better results
capturing more light outdoor images are
good and we mean it about the only
difference we found was the way these to
handle white balance put the fine 7
being sometimes easily thrown off
otherwise images are sharp with good
contrast details and colors overall the
OIS and the g3 offers a smoother
experience while the lack of
stabilization on the fine 7 will require
you to hold your phone very steadily in
certain scenarios despite backing a sony
exmor backlight sensor this lack of
stabilization is also visible while
recording video there's no clear winner
in this particular department both
shooters deliver good results if you can
live with your exposure and white
balance changes sometimes completely off
during your capture audio however is
clear and crisp undefined 7 and the LG
g3 is in our opinion overdoing the noise
cancellation a little bit often cutting
out ambient noise completely between the
words and we are
the video recording capabilities of the
Oppo find 7 comparing it with the LG g3
let's see how optical image
stabilisation kicks in on the g3 the
plan 7 doesn't have it so we're just
gonna walk around here see also at the
same time how white balance exposure and
other stuff is being auto adjusted now
let's just move in for a close-up right
here so we can see focus on the fly
suppose you're there some problems on
the find 7 but we'll see more the
quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor
clocking at 2.5 gigahertz on both phones
this is doing a great job and keeping up
with all tasks however the 2 gigs of ram
on the g3 will make it stutter sometimes
in LG's own user interface while color
OS is not a problem for the 3 gigs on
the fine 7 playing demanding games is
also not a problem however be warned
that both of your phones are likely to
overheat after extensive sessions of
gaming we have problems running asphalt
8 on the fine 7 the app kept on crashing
but Need for Speed Most Wanted offered
the same immersive and great gaming
experience on both devices this is
really almost console like gaming when
it comes to the displace of these two
phones we're looking at 2k quad HD
screens on both we are certain you won't
fully see the difference between quad HD
and Full HD in your day-to-day tasks
that being said the pixels are there and
they shine with high resolution content
the fine sevens display is warmer and we
have to say we prefer it over the cooler
shades of the g3 with that being said
the g3 screen is somewhat brighter than
the display on the fine 7 16 gigabytes
in this particular g3 unit should be
enough but the fine 7 has a total of 32
gigabytes which is even better luckily
if you have a huge library of documents
music pictures or video you can expand
storage on both phones with the help of
a micro sd
if you listen to music often on the
phone you'll love the speaker on the
fine 7 it's as close as it can get to
HTC's boomsound on the One m8 and we
mean it the audio generator has enough
highs and lows with that added which
you'll really find pleasing LG packed a
1 watt speaker on the g3 but it is no
match for the stereo speakers on the
fine 7
that also translates the better
speakerphone performance when in a coal
and since we're talking about phone
calls those we thought to report a good
audio quality on both devices in terms
of battery life it is too early for us
to apply as we need to collect more data
over the next couple of days from the
fine 7 both smart phones feature a 3000
milliamp hour battery and since the two
devices have comparable specs we were
surprised to see that after running all
tests for this comparison the g3 had 47%
left while 28% was showing undefined 7
screen so what do we really have here a
film from China and a phone from South
Korea both the best at LG and Oppo have
ever built both with exceptional specs
on paper in real life neither of the two
disappoints and they all have their pros
and cons if you prefer a smaller form
factor with the same screen size goodies
like customizable soft buttons laser
autofocus knock on window then side by
side apps built-in wireless charging
than the g3 is probably your option
however if you like a modern clean
design cool notification light great
speakerphone performance double the
internal storage more ram and an
exceptional built in addition to oppose
fast charging technology the Oppo find 7
should be your choice needless to say
the day to day test performance is on
par and it really shouldn't be a
deciding factor for you everyone thank
you very much for watching the LG g3
versus Oppo find 7 video if you've liked
it please give us a thumbs up if you
have not give us a thumbs down I have an
aunt in the United Front pocket now stay
tuned for more on all the social media
channels for PocketNow as well as on the
website because we have lots more
coverage including a lot of giveaways
thank you very much again till next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
