5c with this year's iPhone 10 or at
least one variant we get rumors for an
impressive display coming to the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 and the honor 10 just went
global and boy it's a beauty I'm high
metal Yvette I'm reporting from London
definitely looking forward to what gets
announced tomorrow at the oneplus event
and I know I forgot the t-shirts this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for the new LG g7 it's very interesting
that if you're in Canada
well phones are extremely expensive over
there but you get the benefit you get a
43 inch 4k TV now there are some
conditions you won't get the TV just yet
but it's a 43 inch TV LG like really why
can't we get that in the United States
now let's talk about the honor 10 that
just got announced in London sadly we
were too late to be able to participate
in the event but our unit should arrive
before I leave and my god yes it looks
like the Pitts when he pro at least in
the essence of what the product is but
it's got a couple of extra little things
that are unique like the approach the AI
is different specifications obviously
carrying 970 in addition to other bells
and whistles it's a really good phone
can't wait to tell you more about it
when our unit arrives
now following Apple's battery problems I
highly suggest that you swap your
battery if you have an old device
there's a recent video that's going
viral in all the news outlets in the
United States where somebody in a repair
shop was missing another phone and then
an iPhone success just exploded out of
the blue we still don't have details
over exactly what happened or Apple has
not pronounced any information just yet
but for 30 bucks guys please go swap
your batteries now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 as we hear that the
company plans to bring an even better
display the well pretty much next year
we hear of a W quad HD plus display
that'll pretty much double the pixel
density of the current Galaxy S 9 the
only interesting part is we wonder
exactly what the company will do about
battery optimizations is currently the
galaxy has 9 is shipping with full HD
Plus instead of quad HD even if it's
capable I will keep you posted as soon
as we learn more
and finally the most interesting news
they have to do with the iPhone 10 2018
and the color options is we've got some
trusted sources claiming that Apple
plans to bring the strategy of the
iPhone 5c to a certain degree we hear if
colors like blue pink and yellow and at
least the case of the LCD iPhone which
is the device that's planned to be the
most affordable interesting part is that
according to the rumours $800 is going
to be that more affordable and then the
other phones are going to cost over a
thousand bucks and sadly because of the
quarter results in how well Apple sold I
think we're stuck with the price tag let
us know in the comments what you think
do you like the idea of more color
options because in my case I like the
whole idea of the red iPhone for example
I just hate that they had not launched
at the same time and so you end up
buying a phone and then you end up
figuring out if there's a color that you
like more later leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
