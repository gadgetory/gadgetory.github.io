pocketnow.com we're going to take a
hardware tour of the verizon hub on the
front you've got the 7-inch touch panel
we've got a mute button then a volume up
and down the cradle for the wireless
handset and on the right-hand side of
the unit we have a speaker on the top of
the unit we've got a little area to
place the stylus for the touch screen
and in the back of the unit that's where
we plug in the stand it's a little big
for the size of the unit and it makes a
little awkward to place on a desk just a
lot of width that I think was
unnecessary in the design on the side
you've got the headset jack and then a
USB connection which I couldn't find any
information in the manual about there's
actually another USB connection on the
back of the unit same no information in
the manual then we've got the ethernet
jack and the power supply but I'm going
to use it as a wireless unit since
wireless is built into to the verizon
hub on the handset it's just your
typical wireless handset it's got a
headphone jack on the side or a headset
jack i should say and volume controls up
and down powered on right now it's out
of range because the base is not plugged
in but we're going to go ahead and plug
in the base and go through the
initialization process now I've cut down
on the time of the initialization
process just to give you a brief
overview but it's a wizard that
essentially walks you through you get
the pic whether you want a wired or
Wireless a connection
I picked wireless and then it searches
for the wireless access points that are
near I pick up the one closest to me and
then mine is secured so I put in the key
but we'll skip that and once it connects
to the wireless access point or to the
network it checks and does an update
once it's updated then you go through
the reboot process so this is the
initial startup and this takes about 15
minutes to complete the boot process is
a little slow it takes about two to
three minutes to boot the unit up from a
cold start so the first time you boot up
the unit you get a message about 911
service this uses a 911 which is
different than regular 911 since it uses
a relay Center to get the information
over to the 911 there's also a backup
number feature so that if your broadband
connection or the voice over IP system
goes down all calls are automatically
routed to the backup number which should
usually be your cell phone once the unit
is booted it always comes up to the home
screen the home screen has your time
which is automatically synchronized the
weather which you select the city you
want to go to and you have the option of
having multiple cities so you can scroll
through then your message indicators
which show you if you have any
voicemails or calls that you didn't
answer as well as access to the phone's
functionality whether you want do not
disturb another functionality will dig
into all this functionality in some
future videos that I'm going to do
regarding all the software available on
the verizon hub and figure out how this
unit integrates with verizon's wireless
phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
