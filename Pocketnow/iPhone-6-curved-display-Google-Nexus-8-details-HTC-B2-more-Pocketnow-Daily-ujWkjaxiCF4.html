6 with a curved display we've got
details on the code name of the future
nexus 8 and evelyn samsung's seem to own
one hundred and six percent of the
smartphone profits even if that number
is not possible I'm pretty memory that
and that'll blame odd numbers on a
Friday we all want to go home right this
is parking out daily let's begin today
with the official news as you remember
yesterday where we wondered what LG was
planning to do with that 5.5 inch
display with for caterers illusion and
everything well the company has just
announced the lge sigh FL in Japan and
yeah that Sifl has nothing to do with
the United States except for one thing
as you remember we talked about a couple
of weeks ago this esai was the basis for
the g2 last year so apparently this is
the basis for the g3 and yes we're gonna
have a great display and aside from the
fact that we also have more leaks on the
g3 now we have a back cover being shown
there's this interesting sensor and if
you're wondering what it is it seems it
will help for low-light performance
which was already great on the g2's stay
tuned now it's talking about Google as
we get new information of what to expect
what the nexus 8 we know that this is a
tablet that's coming from HTC soon at
least we're hoping for that to happen
but we have the code name apparently if
somebody's been watching too much
finding nemo or the little mermaid as a
the code name is floundering just about
every other Nexus product has had a fish
named this one is flounder so stay tuned
hopefully those speakers front firing
will be frowning as well and speaking of
code names another company that takes
real names extremely seriously is HTC we
remember the butterfly from last year
which became the droid DNA and we
already have rumors on what to expect
from the butterfly 2 which is being
codenamed be too apparently it will have
the same specifications of the HTC One
m8 not the ma Prime that we've been
talking about and this one will
apparently have the camera that the ma
doesn't have obviously the butterfly
will be slated for Asia and eventually
we will see a variant here though it
would be interesting if that butterfly
is the buryin that'll bring us the 18
the One m8 prime god I'm sorry guys I
just get confused with these names
now let's talk about some interesting
numbers as we have a new study from
smartphone profits globally listen to
this and apparently Apple and Samsung
both owned a hundred and six percent of
the smartphone profits and you're asking
yourself how could there be a hundred
and six percent of a number that's
already existing there should only be a
hundred percent and out of that
companies get a chunk of that and
according to the analysts it seems that
the reason why is because the rest of
the companies are losing money like HTC
blackberry and just about everybody else
they're losing so much money that that
extra percentage comes to these
companies the bet number is in real that
number is incorrect I leave us a comment
down below what do you think about this
number and finally for the interesting
news of the day we get some leaked
photographs of an iphone 6 dummy with a
curve display now you remember that
Apple's been testing curve displays
because apparently that is the concept
that they plan to bring to the iphone 6
and interesting we hadn't really seen
this in the marcos we hadn't seen that
the design of the phone is curved but
now it seems that the only thing that
will be curved is the display itself to
make it more comfortable for you to hold
it to your face when you're talking but
that was just a question of the day what
do you think about curve displays do you
think that these are gimmicks are not in
my particular case I haven't really
found the phone that actually makes it
comfortable to have curves I have the
Galaxy Nexus I had the Nexus S before
that I haven't tested the the g flex yet
I have seen it I have tried it out but I
don't find it any more comfortable than
anything but leave us a comment down
below what do you think and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is still
mushy follow was I'm out comment
subscribe to youtube channel as well can
also follow me on twitter hind
underscore to be better let's give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi mera better thank you very
much for watching we'll see you next
