when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity this commenters going
nuts and defenders and attackers and
it's just a huge explosion for about a
day and then everything disappears
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of review to see how they
feel after a couple weeks so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device when it's a couple of weeks
after release and not shiny and new
anymore I'm high memory better with
Parker now calm this is the iPhone 4s in
this episode to factor the buzz
so as Michael mentioned in Episode one
we do our best to thoroughly review a
device and one or two weeks but
obviously you're gonna be stuck with it
for two years with your contract so it's
always great to revisit them and see if
they're really worth the investment now
I carry two devices as my daily drivers
but the iPhone 4s has been my top one
for the past four months and there are a
lot of really good things you should
know about it first off let's go through
hardware the iPhone 4s is not the
best-selling smartphone in the world
just because Apple really pushed
hardware to the limit here the device is
beautiful slim and feels great in the
hand even if the screen size is kind of
dated now that said Corning Gorilla
Glass means strong but it doesn't mean
indestructible I've treated my iPhone
for us well always using a sleeve and
never sitting it bare on the table or in
my pocket but still there are minor
scratches in the back anyways it has
fallen only once and you'll notice how
the plastic edges Bend depending on the
surface it falls on and the stainless
steel does feel it too now a friend of
mine also had his device fall once and
look at what happened to the back I
replaced for him
my advice to you is get a case and don't
push your luck stay away from Apple's
iPhone bumpers though they look good the
first week but the materials won't last
the fact that there's only one iPhone is
actually good in that department since
there are a ton of cases you can choose
from for just one device the same thing
goes for accessories depending on your
taste when it comes to color I do regret
buying the white model if the terse
fingerprints better than the black one
but dents are pretty much invisible in
the black model also choose your case
wisely if you go white I recommend
neoprene since any fabric cases may
leave lint in the glass border and there
is no way to clean that up the home
button also suffers from dirt and lint
in the edges reselling a white iPhone
can be challenging when compared to the
black model now replacing the back cover
is dirt simple and buying back cover
replacements can cost you as low as $10
on eBay replacing the front screen is a
nightmare though so beware of that those
eBay parts are good in most cases but
don't look for
wine parts anybody claiming on eBay that
the parts are genuine is probably lying
to you if you're out for genuine parts
one of the cool things about Apple
products is their Genius Bar they don't
only answer questions and they don't do
repairs actually if something's wrong
with your phone within the warranty
period they'll give you a brand new
device for free so in my case my iPhone
4 had passed with the home button after
10 months that could happen to this one
tool and I just took it to the Apple
store and they swapped it within the
warranty period but let's say you
smashed your device or for some reason
you're out of warranty and you have a
problem with it well for a fee they'll
actually swap your phone it's 120 bucks
for the 16 gigabyte model 160 for the 32
gig and then 200 bucks for the 64 gig
now 200 bucks is a bit steep so that's
when Apple Care Plus comes in this is a
64 gigabyte model I'm not gonna pay two
hundred bucks for a swap that's a lot of
money so you can pay for Apple Care Plus
which is $100 you extend your warranty
for two years which will pretty much
cover your contract and then if you
smash your phone or any accidential
problems happen to it you pay 50 bucks
for incident you get two incidents and
you get a brand new phone right there
kind of makes sense when it comes to my
overall user experience I'll say I'm
very satisfied my old iPhone 4 suffered
from antenna gate issues after its first
fall but this one hasn't at all the
screen even though small for today's
standards is still one of the best
screens in the market that said the
screen size is very helpful for
one-handed operation and applications
truly are optimized to make each pixel
count still watching a video in this
thing feels crammed then Safari on iOS
is one of the best browsers in the
market but I'm not a fan of so much
panning and zooming as a phone it
performs as it should
great for phone calls decent battery
life after iOS 5.1 and theta speeds on
HSPA+ are great now the high point on
this device is the camera it's just hard
to beat the combination of great optics
with good software to back it up
like in any smartphone low-light photos
are tough to get right but it's hard to
beat photos on this device with the
right lighting 1080p video is superb it
definitely won't beat a DSLR or a
professional camcorder but it shoots far
better
video than most consumer camcorders and
that even includes a 1080p Canon Vixia
that I used to have photos and video do
take up a lot of storage though so the
ability to choose your storage
configuration is great high graphic
games take up to two gigabytes of
storage so I decided to go for the 64
gig model where I can have all my music
library games and photos but that'll all
depend on your needs when it comes to
software iOS isn't for everyone
power users like you and me will easily
be bored with the snap grid of icons
just moving from side to side but sadly
for you and I we make a very small
percentage of the market everybody else
out there is going for simple and
reliable and that's where iOS delivers
they'll sound like Tron right now but
the grid is still appealing for people
that come from feature phones kids and
even senior citizens I spend my time and
applications more than choosing them so
my boredom is compensated by that others
saw this through a jailbreak and even
their iPhone shine because it's pretty
much impossible to bring an iPhone once
you go wrong with the jailbreak just put
it in DFU and you're set now focusing on
the pure iOS experience there are cases
were built in applications like email or
far superior to competitors even though
the OS is 5 years old Safari for example
may not be the best browser but the
reader feature alone makes the tiny
screen worth the sacrifice the software
keyboard is another feature that shines
for me I've become faster in typing on
this thing that even on the old
blackberries that I used in the past
text prediction is awesome and as funny
as it may sound I've come to the point
where I'm not even looking at the screen
as I type since the phone will probably
correct my mistakes 80% of the time as
long as you remember where the a is and
where the L is for example when it comes
to Siri each user relies on it
differently I only use it to remind me
of things or probably set appointments
anything that'll save me the need of
entering it myself will probably be my
only reason to use it I love it that you
can actually lift your phone to your ear
and the iPhone will launch Siri by
itself but sadly it's still a gimmick
for many people and then there's
third-party applications where no
platform has come close to beating iOS
and even though developers complain
about
apples painful requirements to get
applications pushed I won't complain as
an end-user I do enjoy apples control
freak mentality if it means that
applications will look good and work
well another advantage I enjoy about iOS
is that software updates don't depend on
your carrier country or even your device
in some cases you can be certain that
your device will be eligible to newer
versions of iOS well through your
two-year contract and that will actually
help for the resale value too so bottom
line but I still recommend that you buy
an iPhone 4s even though it was released
more than six months ago the answer is
absolutely again this is not the
best-selling smartphone just because
it's a great performer with great
software and looks that appeal to most
average users and even power users like
you and me just make sure you get a case
for the device to last those two years
though and in some cases if you want to
compare with the iPhone 4 and even the
iPhone 3GS my advice to you as 8
gigabytes are not enough for an iPhone
definitely that's the reason why I tell
you don't go for the iPhone 4 stick to
the iPhone 4s and the next generation
iPhone will probably not be released
until six months from now so it's
probably a good time to take the plunge
of you haven't this has been jaime with
