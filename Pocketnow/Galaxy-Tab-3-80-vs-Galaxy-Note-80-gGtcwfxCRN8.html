on the market from Samsung and there's
quite a bit setting them apart so let's
find out which one is right for you I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Samsung Galaxy Tab 3
8.0 vs Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 the
Galaxy Note 8.0 was announced back at
MWC in Barcelona and released in April
we gave it the full review treatment
shortly after its release our own Taylor
Martin calling it nearly the most
complete package in a mid-sized tablet
he'd seen by contrast the Galaxy Tab 3
8.0 is a new tablet launched just a few
weeks back it lacks the S Pen and
premium branding of the note aiming
instead to bring a solid Android tablet
experience to lower price points but is
the $80 price savings worth the features
you'll sacrifice let's find out as we
touched on in our unboxing video earlier
in the week the new Galaxy Tabs Hardware
is smaller than the note eights in every
dimension some of these differences are
superficial there's only a 1/2
millimeter gap in thickness and the
tablets are essentially the same height
it's in breadth where the hardware gap
really stands out with the note 8.0
over 10 millimeters wider than the Tab 3
8.0 since these devices make use of the
same size display the extra beam of the
note is found in its bezels which are
far thicker than the tabs now on a smart
phone this would mean that we preferred
the tab slim bezels being in vogue on
palm size devices but on a tablet we
actually like having the extra leeway to
rest our thumbs so the note eights added
girth isn't just forgivable but
preferable even if it does impact
one-handed usability somewhat the note
is also wider in order to accommodate
the S Pen Stylus that gives the device
its name we'll touch on the S Pen again
in software but for now it'll be enough
to say that the stylus and accompanying
Wacom digitizer on the display are
present on the note and absent on the
tab both devices are made from Samsung's
trademark polycarbonate finished in a
glossy hyper glaze coating and accented
with faux metallic touches that recall
the galaxy s3 in the case of the note 8
and the galaxy s4 in the case of the tab
3
due to its more slender build and ever
so slightly sharper corners the tab puts
out a slightly more modern vibe while
the more curved note almost evokes retro
memories of an old TV set or something
while neither feels particularly durable
due to the shiny plastic construction
the upside is that they're both light
enough to use for long stretches without
getting uncomfortable even one-handed in
terms of specs there's a lot of common
ground here each device packs a 5
megapixel main and 1.3 megapixel
front-facing camera and each offers 16
gigs of on-board storage augmented ouvea
micro sd to an additional 64 gigs
battery size is comparable north of
4,400 milliamp hours there's an IR
transmitter off to the side on each unit
and each tablet features a 1280 by 800
TFT LCD display at 189 PPI the pixel
density is pretty low on each one of
these panels unfortunately Samsung
compensates for that with a software
palette rich in color and the special
reading mode to increase the contrast
and sharpness for books and magazines
and web pages still screen junkies
should look elsewhere the biggest
difference in specs can be found under
the hood one of the few hints at the
Note 8.0 is more premium positioning in
the lineup the note is powered by an X
and O's 4412
Samsung's quad core SOC running at 1.6
gigahertz and backed up by two gigs of
RAM the Galaxy Tab 3 has to make do with
to fewer cores as it makes use of the X
and O's for dual at 1.5 gigahertz and
backed up by 1.5 gigs of ram and one
might think that that horsepower
difference translates to decreased
performance and software as well but
that's not really the case here at least
not normal use each tablet runs Android
jellybean 4.1.2 on our AT&amp;amp;T note 8 and
4.2.2 on the Wi-Fi only Tab 3 with a
heaping helping of Samsung's TouchWiz
software slathered on top as on every
Samsung Android device the third-party
UI effects every layer of the OS
delivering a net software experience
that at this point is much more Samsung
than Google in flavor in exchange for
the added utility of features like smart
stay the TV remote control and multi
screen multitasking the skin brings some
added ponderous nests to the OS on each
device weighing it down with a bit of
lag here and there and sometimes it's
just a nuisance like when waiting for a
home screen widget to load other times
it's more frustrating like jumpy page
loading in the browser such stutter can
be found on each of these devices but we
found it much more forgivable on the
note 8 thanks almost exclusively to its
S Pen Stylus now we've talked
extensively about the s-pen in our note
8 and Note 2 reviews so here it's enough
to briefly state that the add-on is much
more than a stylus it's a navigation
helper it's a shortcut assistant it's a
memo taker and it's an in disposable
companion for everything from creating
quick and dirty game plans to injecting
some added fun to photos and images and
with Samsung's growing catalog of s-pen
focused apps the possibilities are only
growing using these tablets side by side
we were struck by how often we preferred
the note 8 thanks in large part to that
s-pen one thing's for sure though you're
not going to buy either of these tablets
for their cameras while outdoor shots
can actually come out quite nice in full
5 megapixel resolution especially with
vibrant or high contrast subject once
the cameras move indoors sharpness and
saturation decrease significantly while
outdoor shots are comparable between the
cameras the note 8 wins the indoor
performance contest hands down due to
its more accurate color reproduction the
Galaxy Tabs photos all exhibit this
purple cast indoors that's pretty ugly
that was a surprise given that the tabs
viewfinder software is actually the more
modern version from the more recent
galaxy s devices while the 18 note 8
that we have is still stuck with 2012's
interface we may see improvement of the
optical situation with software updates
but no amount of software tweaking is
likely to make these cameras outstanding
on a brighter note audio performance is
pretty solid given the size of these
devices though the speaker ports are
located along the bottom edge of each
unit the sound produced is loud and
clear
now there's not much in the way of base
or tonal range and you do need to hold
each device a certain way to avoid
blocking the speaker ports with a thumb
but you should rest easy knowing you can
watch Netflix or YouTube or
streams and music without straining your
ears and you won't need to keep a
terribly close eye on the battery meter
while you do it either in our testing we
found that each tablet delivers pretty
excellent battery life stay tuned for
our full review of the tab 3 for more
info but for now assuming you take the
bare minimum steps of disabling
extraneous features and keeping an eye
on your display brightness each of these
tablets should easily last a day or more
of moderate to heavy use in Wi-Fi mode
as similar as they are aesthetically
these tablets are actually targeted two
entirely different fire segments Samsung
is pushing the Galaxy Note 8.0 as a
Productivity device at work at home and
on the go while it's positioning the
Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 as a powerful tablet
that's been simplified so anyone can use
it so here's the deal if you're really
pinching pennies and you're not looking
for an avalanche of features the Galaxy
Tab 3 8.0 will probably suit you just
fine as a mid-range Android tablet in a
small slim package but if you're
thinking at all about splurging or using
a tablet for more than casual browsing
and email checking the Galaxy Note 8.0
is the clear winner here primarily due
to the added horsepower of its quad-core
processor and the increased utility
offered by its S Pen Stylus it's better
faster and stronger than the Tab 3 and
only a little bit bigger to boot if
you've got the extra 80 bucks it's
probably the smarter choice
hope you enjoyed the comparison folks we
do have a full review of the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 coming up very shortly
