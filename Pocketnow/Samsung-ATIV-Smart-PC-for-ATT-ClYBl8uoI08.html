pocketnow.com here at CES in Vegas still
you can believe it this is the Samsung
achieve smart PC for AT&amp;amp;T the branded
version of the tablet we saw an ephah
and let's check it out very quickly now
you'll notice due to the pronounced lack
of fan holes on the back and the giant
Death Star logo this is not only an 18-2
version but this is the a-team smart PC
the standard edition not the pro so it
is running Windows RT the desktop
operating system we know a lot of from
our time with the surface not much new
as far as Windows 8 runs and honestly
aside from the LTE inclusion there's not
a whole lot here but just to go through
11.6 inch HD display at 1366 by 768
Samsung is claiming exceptional battery
life at nine point four hours of video
playback and as you recall from our time
of the service we had we were up and
waiting for apps to launch so we're just
gonna try and launch just a couple apps
here that see if we can find some that
don't necessarily require network
connectivity back the home screen
there's gonna hop into the game hub here
we are connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot but
it has been there's are spinning circle
we've become familiar with not too much
whole time on this device we don't know
how much exposure this has gotten on the
floor top into video
the spinning circle is something that we
have just gotten so tired of seeing on
the surface but once again it's a demo
floor model
there's our AT&amp;amp;T hub this is obviously
something you're not going to see on the
one and no SIM card inside there once
again something we saw a diva plug in
the tablets of the dock connector here
it is not too difficult to plug in
notice the release over there we can
close the device this reminds us very
much of a plastic version of aluminum
devices convertibles like the HP Envy x2
obviously a very very different fit and
finish on this samsung devices and the
brushed metal the faux brush metal that
we're familiar with from devices like
the achieve s and the galaxy note 2 etc
ejecting a simple matter of pushing the
button and we're back to tablet mode so
just a quick look at the Samsung
achieved smart PC 480
with built in an LTE for the United
States
