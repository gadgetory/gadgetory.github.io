pocket now calm and we're going to step
outside with the samsung omnia two in
the review and i'll put a link in the
sidebar i mentioned how the AMOLED
screen is fantastic indoors creates
really good contrast really dark blacks
but outside the screen has very very
poor visibility it kind of has a milky
white coating which cuts down on the
contrast dramatically so I'm going to go
outside now and try to show you sort of
what that's like right now we're on
automatic screen brightness so the omnia
has a fair shot at doing all right so
we'll be back in a second when we go
outside okay so here we are outside in
the Sun we are in the morning sun so
it's not as bright as it would be in the
heat of the afternoon and as you can see
the contrast on the screen is quite
horrible there seems to be a milky
coating over the entire screen it may be
difficult to see out here but in in very
bright conditions even modestly bright
conditions the screen is very difficult
to see I kind of have my back to the Sun
so that's actually helping the phone a
little bit but if the Sun was beaming on
the omnia two you'd have a lot of
trouble seeing what's on the screen so
that's it for now a little demonstration
of the omnia two outside in sunlight
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
