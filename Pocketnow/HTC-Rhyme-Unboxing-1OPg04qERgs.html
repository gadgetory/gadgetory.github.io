today I will be unboxing the new HTC
Rhyme designing devices geared towards
women should be a pretty easy thing
right you just make it pink or purple
throw a couple rhinestones on it and
voila but is it a wise decision to
separate phones into the categories
phones for boys and phones for girls the
problem with the industry is that all
Android phones seem to be geared towards
men because honestly that's the
demographic that's most likely to buy an
Android phone
why would females rather buy an iPhone
and an Android phone HTC is said that
this phone is not geared towards women
only and anyone can enjoy it but I think
they may have got onto this marketing
strategy a little too late in the game
well let's rip it open and see if I
think it measures up to what they claim
I'll be making another in-depth review
for this device in this video it's more
of a first impression or if you will be
hardware only this phone's codename was
the Bliss which sounds a little more
girly than its official name arrived
it's available on Verizon with a
contract you can pick it up for about to
enter box I think it's a great price
especially considering all the
accessories that it comes with it for
free this is the docking station
obviously you can charge your phone from
it it's got speakers for you to play
video or to make your alarm louder
everything is nice and color-coordinated
everything's this plum color awesome
I love her balls there's the charm this
connects your headphone jack and it's
reinforced the idea would be to angle
this outside your perch this little
thing lights up when you get a call our
text message the cool thing is if your
phone gets lost in your currency just
yank on the cord and pull it right out
we're gonna give this a stress test so
it's got a frequent 7 inch display VGA
front-facing camera and this is a 5
megapixel camera right here this is cool
thing called action first scene which
automatically takes five pictures with
instant shutter that's nice and unique
it also does a 720p HD video battery is
not removable it has four gigs of
on-board storage space then comes an SD
card
it comes with the egg cake this is a 3G
phone it's not 4G capable it's got a 1
gigahertz Snapdragon processor those two
things will make it a little less
appealing to the male audience out there
especially the super geeky ones oh wow
that's snaps
a cute little boot screen
I have a evil 3d here with this one's
got a 4.3 inch screen so pretty good
difference there now I have very large
hands for a woman but um women tend to
have smaller hands so it's easier to use
a device that's small so this is running
Android 2.3 and it's the first phone
with a new sense 3.5 so new look
distance you can see there's a new clock
and weather here these little you know
it's got the carousel look to sense I am
not that into sense I know a lot of
people love it but this version I'm not
too shabby it's got a little some things
okay so like I said before the little
charm here lights up glows white and
this is supposed to be reinforced so I'm
going to try to come off on it pretty
hard for that to come off so well thank
you for watching the unboxing I will be
giving you a more in-depth review of how
this foam works for me in a few days
just my first impression of The Rime I
think they may be alienating their male
audience for a few reasons but stay
tuned to find out the towel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
