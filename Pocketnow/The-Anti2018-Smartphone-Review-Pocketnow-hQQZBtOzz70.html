one of my favorite phones of MWC 2018
the design and the features just felt
iterative considering all the smart
phone trends that we've seen and yet
when I decided to use one a lot of my
opinion actually changed but notice I
said a lot I'm high metal even with the
pocket now and stick around for our full
review to tell you why so for all of you
that joined me in criticizing the trend
the phone's getting thinner and lighter
for no particular reason or for those of
you that don't really like notches on
your phone this video is for you the
Sony Xperia z2 is literally the anti
2018 smartphone it's not thin and light
at all and I'm having a hard time
understanding some of the design choices
the new approach is now curvier than
ever with the intent of making it more
natural to handle but the result is
quite the irony yes I do love the feel
of the stone in the hand but the
placement of the buttons is rather
awkward I always end the pressing the
camera lens instead of a fingerprint
sensor just because of how low they are
and also do yourself a favor buy a case
this phone is very slippery and because
of the curves it'll fall off a table
faster than anything and here's the
thing I have always been in favor of
Chevy phones so long as they give me
good battery life but a 30 180 milliamp
hours this phone really tips the lower
scale of its category everything else
inside is great thanks to the new
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 Siksika bytes of
RAM 64 gigs of expandable storage our
unit has dual-sim capabilities qi
wireless charging and ip68 water and
dust resistance now when it comes to the
content consumption I am rather mixed
this 5.7 inch IPS LCD is great but it's
really small for its price range that
being said color reproduction is good
HDR capabilities are also great and I
love the animated ambient display
the screen is quite unapologetic about
bezels for 2018 but the front-facing
stereo speakers make up for the added
size yes there is a new dynamic
vibrating motor to vibrate the phone
whenever the bassist playing with your
audio
do yourself a favor as well switch it
off it'll bring your battery life and
it's just the worst gimmick of the year
other than that don't get me wrong
hardware is really good on this phone
but obviously it depends on your taste
the software experiences what I would
call good it's pretty much the Sony
experience that we've seen for years and
nothing really special about it probably
the things that I don't like or the fact
that it's still stuck on I enjoyed eight
dot oh and not a dot one for example but
this phone is on the list for the
Android P beta so those are points in
its favor really my favorite elements
are the fact that we have direct access
to the Google feed on the launcher which
is a current dying breed I love the
flexibility of the grid of icons and
little things like the arrangement of
the settings menu there are definitely
some interesting animations in the UI
that you'll probably like or disable if
you don't want what I don't like or the
steps you have to take to build a folder
in the home screen which I consider
dated now you won't complain over things
like the fluidness of the user interface
nor about how it performs when playing a
game the xe2 is quick and responsive as
pretty much every flagship should
essentials like phone calls whether
through the earpiece or the speaker are
also top-notch now even with the average
size of the battery pack I will say that
I'm very impressed with its performance
it blasts through the day and there have
been cases where I've been able to reach
a second day of battery life which I
will say speaks highly of the user
interface and the experience overall it
seems that this is something that Sony
doesn't get right now in the case of the
camera I won't blame you of your concern
were in 2018 and this is one of the few
smartphones left with a single camera
for the primary shooter but that being
said not everything is bad this is also
one of the few smartphones left if not
the only one with a dedicated camera
button
and sure I know the spec sheet isn't
really breaking any records on both a
primary or the selfie shooter that said
I have to say that I'm quite impressed
with the photos following on the
company's point and shoot camera
approach there's an intelligent Auto
that I feel is more like the adequate
term for AI today so the camera adapts
to the scenery it detects the 25
millimeter focal length means a wider
shot that I've actually come to use
quite often and I also find the selfie
camera to produce results that are
plenty wide and useful this is also one
if not the only smartphone that can
produce super slow-mo at 960 frames per
second at 1080p resolution the problem
is that well do you need a lot of light
to get that right and recording is
limited there is no 4k video at 60
frames per second but the neat trick
here is that there is HDR capabilities
for this 4k and it's also very stable
and you can also say the same about
stability in HDR and 1080p video
recordings this would also be the first
selfie video shooter that doesn't really
force you to a horrible crop while
providing some sort of civilization but
it's not perfect
to conclude let me just say that my
experience with the sony xperia x z2 has
been good the design feels better than
it looks the experience consuming
content is better than the spec sheet
reveals and the same goes for the camera
my problem really is the price tag at
$799 right now I'm sure there are
smartphones out there that will give you
a better user experience on this phone
for that price or a similar user
experience than this phone for less of a
price obviously if your Sony fan I can
totally recommend this phone but if
you're not then this is a tough sell
this is really a good phone but not the
best one at its price range in 2018
