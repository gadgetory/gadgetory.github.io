to expect for Samsung's upcoming 1ui as
soon as we'll be making some changes in
their near future focusing on gaming
phones and thus my suppliers saying
otherwise Apple sales are still
declining according to analysts I'm hi
melody that I yes it's the holidays and
for those of you asking for guides we've
got a very extensive one on the website
this is pocket out daily sponsored by
the huawei mate 20 pro official nurse
did I begin with deals it's all about B
and H as the company has a ton of Sony
phones on discount right now but
probably the most interesting one is the
XE to compact which is two hundred
dollars off leaving it at 450 that's
good
$100 off the gear is three frontier and
then we've got others that you can learn
more in the description now let's talk
about iPhone predictions when it comes
to sales I hate the fact that Apple is
not going to provide numbers and I hate
that they're not obligated to do so with
Michiko says that regardless of what
suppliers are saying that doesn't matter
he is predicting that Apple is down it's
down pretty much more than 10% and he's
not estimating good numbers for q1
particularly with the iPhone 10 are is
apparently it is disappointing
what are his sources I don't know but
he's always been right or most of the
time now let's talk about the whole
Qualcomm vs. Apple and Apple versus
Qualcomm debacle when it comes to legal
problems which I hate to talk about but
for those of you wondering about that
whole sales BAM that Qualcomm apparently
just got for Apple when it comes to
China the rumors are that Apple just
figured out a fix they only have to send
out a software update and ensure device
is running iOS 12 for there to be no
problems it seems that that's the way to
avoid the patent infringement so that
could mean that certain software updates
will disable things in general not
necessarily just in China because
obviously this is a global patent war
so we'll see now let's talk about a sues
the company that finally a million
months later just sent me the Isuzu ROG
for review that's gonna come at some
point think about it is yes it had ads n
phone line which
high-end premium mid tier and then it
was their high-end ROG phone which is
gaming seems that the company's a lead
of mobile is stepping down we've got a
new one and it seems that the CIN phone
line has no future
apparently the features gonna be focused
on ROG and yes I know there are a ton of
concerns because definitely ROG is only
for the high-end but it would be awesome
to see if the company would focus on
creating mid-range gaming phones I mean
I think that that would be a very
interesting market and finally the hot
news today have to do with Samsung uh I
wish I could give you dates as to when
your devices getting this one UI but the
company has just published the full
video teaser of the whole mentality that
follows one UI
what it is what it brings it how it
changes the way you approach the phone
where they're removing clutter they're
removing unnecessary gestures they're
also placing buttons where they're
supposed to be at the bottom where
people can actually reach them and yeah
I feel that this is definitely an
overhaul that was long overdue for Sammy
but let us know in the comments down
below I mean look at the video let us
know
do you like one UI do you think that
it's good enough to say yes sure I'll
prefer this over stock Android or do you
feel that we should just get a stock
Android version for Galaxy phones and
that that would probably help Samsung in
my case I always prefer Samsung's
approach to added value so I feel that
there is a lot of good ideas and what's
coming here but I would love the option
to just be like you know what Sammy just
give me the option to launch stock here
leave us a comment down below we would
love to know your opinion and folks
