expertise in mobile and you put it in a
laptop you get an always on always
connected PC that's sips power Lenovo
sent us their C 630 always-on Snapdragon
based PC and in this video we're going
to test it out and let you know if it's
any good let's get to it as I hinted the
c6 30 uses what is essentially a phone
processor but clocked a bit higher to
keep up with the demands of PC apps the
SOC is the Snapdragon 850 which is
similar in a lot of ways to the
Snapdragon 845 power and most of the
flagships from this year it's available
in your choice of 4 or 8 gigs of RAM and
128 or 256 gigs of ufs 2.1 storage the
unit I'm reviewing has 8 gigs of RAM and
128 gigs of storage it has the Qualcomm
X 20 modem which offers fantastic data
performance the touch screen is 13.3
inches and at a resolution of only fhd
it's another place to see 630 saves
power the display is an IPS LCD panel
which isn't the brightest or the most
colorful and I think the display is
probably the weakest part of the laptop
but for most people it'll be ok at the
end of the video I'll share with you
just what kind of battery life you can
expect one of the ways Lenovo can tap 25
hours of battery life with its 60 watt
hour battery is if you keep it in
Windows 10 S mode which only lets you
run apps from the Windows Store
naturally so that I could use any app
that I wanted I switched the laptop to
Windows 10 home which is free and only
takes a few minutes that way you can run
any app you want including Chrome and
although you will have a slight hit in
battery life because you're running full
windows apps it's not that big of a deal
the hardware on this laptop is really
fantastic it's lighter than a macbook
air and thinner too and the entire
laptop is covered in a smooth but creepy
soft touch plastic in a dark gray color
lenovo calls iron gray but the frame is
metal so it feels very sturdy and since
it's a yoga the screen can flip around
to go into tent mode or you can lay it
flat to use in tablet mode using it in
tablet mode means that your fingers rest
on the keyboard on the other side which
is not comfortable but in that situation
the keyboard is disabled so you don't
miss press I spent most of the time
using c6 30 in tablet mode if you get
the optional $25.00 Lenovo active pen
you can take advantage of stylus input
with
Inc there are two speakers flanking the
keyboard which can get pretty loud and
clear the trackpad isn't that big but
it's spacious enough to do three and
four finger gestures in Windows 10 to
the right of the trackpad there is a
fingerprint sensor which I found to be
very fast and accurate to unlock the
laptop with Windows hello or you can use
your face to unlock the backlit keyboard
has more travel than a MacBook Air and
like the rest of the laptop that's a
nice grippy texture that makes typing
very enjoyable my unit came with an
activated Verizon SIM but I also tried
using AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile and in all cases
I got very impressive data speeds in
some cases near 100 megabits per second
down plus outstanding reception no
matter where I was the C 630 even has an
e SIM which lets you buy cellular
service right from the laptop it's
shocking that every laptop doesn't have
a SIM slot and Isom capability like this
one does with an always active data
connection on this PC like your phone
certain apps and services will update in
the background and be ready for you
without refreshing when you open the
laptop again I'd mix results when
testing this for example my Google
Calendar and Chrome would automatically
update after making a change to my
calendar from another device but I
couldn't get this to happen with my
Gmail and Chrome or using windows
calendar I think this is because always
on PCs are new and while Windows
supports ARM processors in a hacky way
most apps haven't been updated to take
advantage of this new experience
it'll get better in time the real
benefit to a laptop that's always
connected is that you're never waiting
for a connection whereas a lot of other
cellular devices take a couple of
seconds to reach out to the phone towers
and to register your device when you
open the C 630 it's already connected
and ready to go
another benefit of using a Snapdragon
SOC on a laptop is how cool it stays
since heat is not a problem the C 630
has no fan and so the laptop is always
silent and cool of course one of the
main downsides to running what is
essentially a phone processor in a
laptop is that performance isn't that
great for basic tests like web browsing
and using Windows Store apps the C 630
Chuck's along just fine it can even run
full office apps Photoshop or whatever
you need but when you push it hard with
many tabs open in Chrome or by
installing big apps the C 630 can feel
slow but obviously this computer is more
for the road warrior who wants epic
battery life nice hardware and the
utility of an always-on computer not for
the person looking to do photo or video
editing
hinted at it several times so let's talk
about battery life on the c 6:30 it's
incredible to give you an idea I started
using the c6 31 week on a Friday I used
it almost every day over the subsequent
seven days using it for a mix of
watching videos making spreadsheets and
using a whole lot of Chrome all while on
both cellular and Wi-Fi and then it
wasn't until the following Friday that I
needed to charge that's right in my
usage in your situation will vary I was
able to get about a week of use on this
laptop with its amazing battery
performance in comparison on my new
MacBook Air which I use in a similar way
I have to charge two or three times a
week but the C 630 goes for an entire
week without needing a charge in my
usage that's amazing and when it's time
to charge the C 630 charges of her USBC
with the included 45 watt charger and
that will top off the laptop from 0 to
100 in about 4 hours
I wish the trackpad was better on this
laptop the first unit I got from Lenovo
had a problem with the touchpad which
was probably hardware related with the
touchpad would become inoperable the
replacement unit they sent has been fine
that said the palm rejection on the C
630 isn't great and while I wish the
trackpad was bigger
Windows 10 actually has a terrific
gesture support that worked great on
this laptop I loved being able to do
four finger swipe to move between
desktops or three fingers swipe to
toggle between open apps overall I have
to say that this trend of always on
always connected pcs is super
interesting the lenovo c 630 is a little
bit early and as such performance isn't
that great however if you want a thin
and light laptop with epic battery life
that's always connected it's a really
good option you can get it for about 700
bucks from Best Buy which is about a
hundred dollars less than the surface
laptop so it's a pretty good value give
