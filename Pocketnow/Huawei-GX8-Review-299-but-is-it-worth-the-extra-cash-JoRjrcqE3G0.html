becoming increasingly crowded with some
terrific options but what actually
elevates one company's offerings over
another when we can cover the basics
pretty well for cheap the huawei gxa
gives off a terrific first impression
but it also forces us to ask some tough
questions and recommending it I'm Juan
Carlos bag now for pocket nap and we're
going to determine who the gx8 is
actually for as reviews go it's usually
bad form to delve too far into
comparisons they should be separate
videos but the gx8 faces intense
competition not only from other
manufacturers but from other devices
made by qual way instantly on Twitter we
saw a lot of conversation surrounding
the war thickness of the gx8 versus
phones like the honor 5x and redmi note
3 rather than shy away from that chatter
we're going to answer a few of those
comments in this review now what
features warrant a higher price tag
obviously technology like processors
screen resolution Ram storage and
battery are all points that one might
examine to decide which phone to buy
against the honor 5x these two phones
share quite a bit of the same hardware
DNA so what makes the GX 8 worth an
extra hundred dollars first the build
quality is nicer in the hand than the
less expensive huawei the GX eight
corners and seams are wonderfully
finished compared to the slight defects
we found on the honor at arms-length
both phones look aesthetically pleasing
but up close the GX 8 continues to
impress with machining we'd normally
associate with a more expensive HTC
screen brightness on the 5.5 inch 1080p
display lands very close to the outdoor
view ability of LG LCDs it's not quite
able to compete against AMOLED screens
with high brightness and high contrast
modes but you will be able to see the
screen in sunlight in this market a
fingerprint scanner is still a pretty
novel piece of hardware to include on a
sub $400 phone
plain and simple Huawei makes a terrific
fingerprint scanner even on mid-range
phones this implementation turns on your
screen and unlocks your phone faster
than any home or power button mounted
solution found on other flagships
happily the GX 8 does seem to be ever so
slightly faster than the less expensive
honor 5x in our completely anecdotal
testing I'm moving over to software the
GX 8 is running android 5.1 with a
custom launcher emui is huawei skin and
the GX 8 comes with a theme that matches
the color of the phone Hardware it's a
sharp overall look for the pre-installed
apps but installing more software
obviously breaks that consistency we've
covered this user interface in greater
detail on our honor 5x and mate 8
reviews but as a brief overview emui
brings an iOS like style to the table
there is no app drawer and all apps are
installed onto your home screens sure
you can organize those apps into folders
but mixing app shortcuts and widgets
often looks cluttered and can increase
the number of swipes it takes to get to
the content or shortcut that you want to
interact with this aesthetic continues
to the notification shade and the
lockscreen Quick Menu there are some
very welcomed customizations like being
able to reorganize the software
navigation buttons a la LG and a doc
sliding gesture to shrink the screen to
a one handed mode motion gestures can
mute calls in the screen can be turned
on with a quick DoubleTap and I'm a
really big fan of using the
aforementioned fingerprint scanner to
pull and clear my notification shade
ultimately though for folks who like the
way Android organizes your stuff you'll
probably want to install a third-party
launcher to bring back your app drawer
now there are no surprises in terms of
performance the Qualcomm 6-1-6 is a
pretty well known chipset and the GX 8
won't play games any better than the
honor 5x
older simpler titles like Skyforce will
be fluid expect some framedrops in games
like Riptide gp2 but overall a pretty
fluid experience and more aggressive
games like marvel future fight will
become slideshows on medium graphics
settings this chipset on a phone at any
price point will be more than capable of
tackling the basics there shouldn't be
any reservations in using this device
for messaging phone calls social media
and email sliding through the UI it's a
snappy and responsive handset
surprisingly the GX 8 seems to handle
battery benchmarking better than its
lower-cost sibling even though both
phones pack 3000 milliamp hour batteries
the GX 8 handled our playback test
better streaming 30 minutes of HD video
over Wi-Fi and medium brightness
resulted in 5% battery draw 2 percent
better than the honor and one of the
better overall performers we run through
this test in general this power
advantage was reflected in daily uses
we'd end each day with a little extra
remaining juice than the honor
outside of maybe a more power efficient
screen we can't really account for this
large of a battery difference from one
manufacturer but it is a nice little
benefit
speaker playback on the gx8 is nice
enough for a single bottom firing
speaker don't let all those extra holes
in the bottom of the phone fool you
there's only one speaker on the
right-hand side
there's clear separation in the
mid-range for instruments in game audio
nicely designed around speakerphone
performance it's a subtle bump up from
the honor 5x which had a dull and buzzy
speaker but obviously falls far behind
the stereo speakers on an Alcatel Idol 3
the headphone playback was a bit more
difficult to pin down on our review
units the gx8 was on average around two
decibels quieter than the honor 5x but
more subjectively I liked to playback
better on the gx8 than I did on the
honor the honor had a slightly more
aggressive EQ curve with heavier bass
and brighter highs it sounds juicier at
first but over longer periods of time
listening the slightly more even
response on the GX eight was my
preference electronica and hip-hop had a
little less oomph but rock jazz and
classical were all better represented in
the mid-range the differences here
aren't radical though and depending on
what headphones you use many folks would
be hard-pressed to hear a significant
difference taking a second listen to the
earbuds which come with the GX eight
they're still disappointing mediocre
reproduction and they create little to
no seal around the ear canal to block
noise around you it's a shame they
contribute to the overall price of this
phone and to my ear there was very
little difference in phone call
performance from the front speaker and I
didn't get any complaints from people on
calls so that's good enough for me one
area where the GX 8 noticeably
outperforms the honor is camera output
no way around it folks though both
phones have 13 megapixel sensors with F
2.0 apertures the GX 8 with optical
image stabilization produces the better
images and smoother video the
differences in outdoor bright lighting
conditions will be difficult to
distinguish but moving to shade and then
tonight shots the GX 8 extends a
significant lead in producing clear
bright and sharp photos
similar to the rest of the phones UI the
app is also organized like the iPhone
utilizing a sliding action to move
between modes and it lacks the manual
controls of more expensive Huawei phones
it's not a bad app and we get fun
features like HDR and panorama support
but this camera is good enough that it
would benefit from more manual options
so where does that leave us with the
huawei GX 8 Huawei has made 2 phones
which look really similar on paper and
perform similar when covering the
smartphone basics it's when we expand to
more specific smartphone needs like
audio reproduction battery life and
camera performance that a number of GX 8
tweaks and improvements add up to a
nicer device is it $100 nicer though and
that depends on what features you care
about most I know for a fact there are
people out in our audience who would
appreciate the slightly nicer build
quality the better camera performance
and getting a little extra battery
runtime and it's up to those people to
decide for themselves how they're going
to spend their cash however this phone
doesn't exist in a vacuum and it faces
intense competition from Xiaomi a sous
Alcatel Motorola Oppo and others but it
also manages to give mid Ranger's from
Samsung LG and HTC are run for their
money
ultimately it's another point of
evidence that this market has gotten
more competitive and competition is a
good thing for all consumers what are
your thoughts on the Huawei GX 8 how do
you think it compares to other phones in
the lineup and what do you think we'll
see in 2016 to take the mid-range up a
notch drop us some comments below and
hopefully we'll get into some fun
debates as always thanks so much for

chat me up on Twitter and Instagram is
some gadget guy and I will catch you all
