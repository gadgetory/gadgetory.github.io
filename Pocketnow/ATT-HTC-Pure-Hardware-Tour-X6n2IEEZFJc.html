calm and here we are with the hardware
tour of the HTC pure on 18t first thing
is you know pretty much the same as the
diamond the unlock European one but with
a different body first thing if you can
see the back and the plastic is normally
it looks black but in the light there's
a subtle blue sparkle to it it's very
hard to see but anyway on the front we
have a different blends here there's a
phone button start menu back button and
call button there's your zoom slider at
the top you got your microphone headset
speaker and here's an ambient light
sensors very hard to see but it's in
there on the side your volume controls
up and down top you got your power
button on this side you have a speaker
so it's really good to have a speak
around the side because you're usually
holding it like this and with a speaker
on the back obviously sound gets my
holding okay or anything so the on the
side you're actually here stuff I'm back
is a 5 megapixel camera and the bottom
is kind of tapered there it's pretty
nice here's their stylist and that turns
on the device you also have a proxy IM
accelerometer so if it's raining you can
just turn it over like bad will meet the
ring also changes orientation and some
programs see the plastic very shiny and
very fingerprint magnet so i'm always
wiping left
open the battery cover like that and we
see it's the same battery as just about
every HTC device released this year has
and over here is the microSD card slot
does not come with a microSD but that's
a slot and they're very cheap so it's
very easy to get one of those back in so
there you have it let's say five and
twenty eight megahertz processor 512
megs of ROM in there 288 megs of ram and
it's a quad-band GSM and a dual band
hsdpa for eighteen t so there you have
it pretty nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
