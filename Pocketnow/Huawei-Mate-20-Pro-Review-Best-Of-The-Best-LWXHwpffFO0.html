company dubs as higher intelligence and
what I've even called the Kraken and my
initial impressions back in London see
the word beast gets tossed around a lot
when talking about flagship phones but
usually the differences between them are
quite negligible their respects nearly
match each other and the differences are
mostly about design and implementation
it's pretty rare for one product of the
five other products and even make the
average beast look bad in the process
thing is that was all in paper and now
that it's been nearly a month since I
started using one it's time to tell you
if it really lives up to its Clash of
the Titans title I'm home I believe a
tie with pocket now and this is our
review of the huawei mate 20 throw
I think it's only fair to tell you that
four years ago I could have cared less
about Huawei phones it wasn't until the
Google Nexus 6p that my initial
impressions changed that 6p continues to
be one of my favorite phones of all time
it marked Google's first attempt at
getting photography right and I was just
shocked to learn that it was made by
Huawei it may be try the Huawei p10 and
then the May 10 pro but it wasn't until
the b20 Pro that I realized that this
company wasn't interested in just
playing the me2 game anymore that was a
bold first attempt in disrupting the
market so I'd call them 820 Pro a more
mature second attempt but of course
there's no such thing as a perfect
product so let me begin this review by
telling you what Huawei gets right
visually this phone is like nothing else
out there at least in most things I'm so
glad that I picked this hyper optical
display pattern in blue it is elegant it
is gorgeous I even have a hard time
wanting to use it with a case because of
how much it turns heads and it doesn't
just look unique the curved glass and
the aluminum also feels unique it even
makes you want to scratch this pattern
at the back and best of all it handles
fingerprints better than most an typical
made standard all design elements are
now focused on the center and unique
touches like the red power button are
also here I've heard people point
similarities to the galaxy s 9 and
iPhone 10's from the front and that's
why I said most things not everything
yes it does look like a merger between
the two but with some very minor vessels
inch in the 6.3 nine inch curved OLED
display at 2k resolution and nineteen
point five by nine aspect ratio is
gorgeous viewing angles are great
brightness is more than enough for use
in direct sunlight and yes I know on
camera the screen does seem to flicker
trust me I've tried every single setting
and all of us reviewers are having the
same issue when on camera but in real
life you won't notice this at all
like seriously no complaints and those
of you that aren't fans of the notch
will find the option and software to not
just hide it but Huawei was also smart
enough to fit notification icons in the
hidden portion
no worries you're not losing any screen
real estate and yes even if not
modifiable the always-on display is also
here if you dig into settings and that
notch also serves a purpose that I'm
willing to pardon and the likes of
Apple's face ID huawei's facial
recognition is just this advanced this
means a full da projector flood
illuminator IR camera proximity sensor
and a 24 megapixel camera that also
serves for selfies the service is
blazing fast and I love that just like
in the case of iOS you can set
notifications to only show content when
your face is detected this is something
that I've waited for Android phones to
do for a while and currently only
available on this device now if I'm
locking the phone with your face is not
your thing there's also the on display
fingerprint scanner that's not just fast
but works even when the display is off
inside the may 20 Pro is literally the
most advanced Android phone you can buy
today we're talking about the keren 980
processor with the world's first seven
nanometer processor announced we have
six or eight gigs of RAM that depend on
your choice between 128 or 256 gigs of
storage respectively we have a massive
4200 milliamp power battery one of the
fastest chargers in the box rated for 40
watts she wireless charging that's also
reverse charging if you want to charge
somebody else's phone might be 68 water
and dust resistance dual-sim
capabilities and I'm gonna run outta
breath with all that's included here so
much so that this is one of the proud
few phones left with an IR blaster at
the top and since we're talking specs
let's talk about the cameras Huawei dubs
this it's thinking lens tuned by Leica
as a hint to AI but really what I care
about is just how it even manages to
beat the b20 pro in its own game we're
talking about a whopping 40 megapixel
primary camera def 1.8 aperture and a 27
millimeter equivalent the return of a
telephoto at 8 megapixels F 2.4 aperture
and an 80 millimeter equivalent and a
new addition a 20 megapixel ultra
wide-angle camera with its 16 millimeter
equivalent and F 2.2 aperture Huawei
claims that this new sensor combo
doesn't need monochrome assistance and
from my experience using it I have to
agree if we've called the pixel that
king of computational photography the
may 20 pro is the king of hardware that
also has computational photography like
I've been using Panasonic cameras for a
bit also tune by lekha so I'm already a
big fan of how like a favors warmer
colors and the use of grain to create
this sort of cinematic approach to
photography
I love the photos I love the dynamic
range and I love how the over sharpening
that I found on the b20 Pro is no longer
an issue here yes there is master AI to
point O to help the camera adapt to what
it sees and those results are great but
I found myself turning it off and just
drifting more to natural results from
the camera I'm also a huge fan of the
wide-angle camera they help you capture
more epic sceneries but seriously my
favorite trick is how I can get as close
as two and a half centimeters from my
subject and get some awesome macro shots
and for those of you that don't
understand the purpose of a telephoto
try this camera for street photography
that's really what they're great for in
this hybrid zoom that Huawei provides
makes up for some awesome detail even a
10x digital zoom
now night mode does not just make a
return but it works even with the
wide-angle camera
I love how Huawei will give you long
exposure shots if you can hold still
and if you can't it'll give you the
first shot which is still great probably
night mode is one of my favorite things
about this camera it is a champ and
low-light and honestly this is also my
favorite portrait mode on a phone I have
a few shots of my kids that remind me of
my old Canon DSLR
if you look closely about the only thing
that I wish was here is an option to
tune it down after the fact for those
cases were it's just too aggressive
which this happened and selfie photos
don't just pack a punch when it comes to
megapixels in the sensor but Huawei has
now brought HDR to the mix so dynamic
range on these is actually great and we
also have the benefit of DEF sensing
hardware that's needed for portrait
selfies but sadly at the mercy of
dynamic range as highlights get blown
out
behind you even with HDR unless you play
around with the metering now standing in
between what Huawei gets right and what
it gets wrong let's talk about software
I'm not the biggest fan of emui for its
user interface but this version 9 is
based on Android Pi which is great at a
time when there are a ton of flack ships
that still don't have it I love how this
is one of the few launchers left to
access the Google feed from the left a
must for every phone if you asked me but
then all it takes is the opening of a
folder for you to notice just how much
it resembles iOS and certain things that
I don't really praise now the reason why
I say that I'm mixed and almost at the
verge of praising Huawei is because in
the end what you care about is a good
experience using the phone and after a
month this phone is a champ regardless
of its proprietary UI it is really fast
that it's almost Spartan at its
animations and you can play games and
don't really complain about the
experience at all I mean seriously if
essentials like battery life are
important to you this is your phone in a
month of using this device I've only
seen the low battery icon once and that
was after a full day of heavy use every
other time I've been able to squeeze
nearly an extra day and then call
quality is great with callers claiming
that I sound very well over the earpiece
and data speeds are also great on this
device now on the verge of mix the great
is also video recording on this device
Huawei has seriously improved the
quality when compared to the b20 pro I
mean stabilization is now offered
everywhere and even in the wide angle
which is fantastic the company has even
fixed things like the user interface for
super slo-mo the problem is really that
with all this processing power this
phone still misses on 4k video at 60
frames per second and even if we're
talking about a lot of megapixels on the
selfie camera there is no higher
resolution video option other than 1080p
and with a very strong crop for
civilization and then when it comes to
video quality I mean it's good but it's
not really great it just tends to
overexpose in certain conditions that
said the added benefit of such a large
sensor creates a fantastic shallow depth
of field and video
which honestly I have a hard time seeing
on other phones watch my separate video
on the huawei mate 20 RS for you to see
more video samples now notice that
throughout all this review I haven't
mentioned content consumption so let me
tell you about what this phone gets
wrong the first thing the speakers I do
find the genius for huawei to fit the
primary speaker in the USBC port but boy
does it sound tinny yes I do know that
the earpiece serves for dual firing
speakers but it's also rather low and
going back to the software yes Huawei
does have full screen gesture control
but after a very frustrating day or two
I switched it off the back gesture
mimics Xiaomi with the back button on
the sides of the display and sure it
makes sense as an idea but it's really
hard to use in a curved display and if
you're using a case like forget it
and speaking of using a case I do
recommend you do Huawei doesn't provide
any ready for this Gorilla Glass so
avoid the necessary drama of glass being
exposed with all these curves and then
dropping your phone and you know what
the results are there to conclude let's
go back to that initial premise is this
phone really the Kraken is this really
the Beast that makes all competition
look bad in my book it is this phone is
miles ahead and so many things like the
camera the 3d sensing face to unlock for
Android the new architecture for the
processor on Android the fit and finish
and essentials like speed in the
software and also battery life it's just
so unfortunate that this phone won't
launch in the United States do I
recommend this phone I most definitely
do it may not be perfect but this is as
advanced as a phone gets in 2018 and
most of what it can do it does without
the need to recur to gimmicks I
seriously just have to admit the Huawei
May 20 pro is so far probably one of the
best phones of 2018 and definitely one
of my favorites
