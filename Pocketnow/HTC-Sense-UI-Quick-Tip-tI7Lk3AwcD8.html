pocket now calm and in this video we
have a really interesting tip for those
of you that have an HTC android device
with the newer version of sense UI let's
get to it are you are now in sense UI an
Android in many many different screens
you get the little slider along the
bottom the slider is very nice but often
times you'll have many different sliders
things that you never use for example
I've got a facebook thing over here I
never use I never used connected media
which is for DLNA I never use Flickr and
all I want to have is two things albums
and Picasa Web Albums now did you know
that you can actually take away these
sliders and rearrange them this is not a
very discoverable feature we actually
happen to stumble across it by accident
and quite simply this is what you do you
tap and hold on one of the items down
here and now you get a new screen and
you can you can tap and hold on these
different icons and put them up in the
tray if you don't want to use them you
can keep going until you have as many or
as few as you want and now there are
only two this works wonders and other
screens as well for example email is a
great example so here an email I've got
it down to just two little buttons
whereas previously out of the box there
are like 10 it's it's ridiculous and
most people probably don't use most of
those so if we tap and hold these are
all the other ones it comes with
favorites unread marked meeting
invitations and attachments and now if
you tap and hold you can remove all of
them and just have two left keeping it
simple clean and easy so a pretty cool
tip for sense UI if you have the newer
version this probably doesn't work with
last generation devices but if you have
a newer phone check it out it's a great
way to stay organized and keep things
fresh and light do you like this video
please give it a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
