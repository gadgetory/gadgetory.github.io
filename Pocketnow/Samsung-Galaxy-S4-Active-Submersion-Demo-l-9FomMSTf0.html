bucket now still here in London and this
is my personal samsung galaxy s4 I will
not drop this in the tank of water but
this is the galaxy s4 active and take a
look at this I'm taking it i'm not going
to make a huge flash but i'm going to
place it there right next to the other
one and while you cannot operate the
touch screen while it is submerged once
you take it out of the water it should
be working without a problem there we
have it just lets wipe off the water of
it
here it is it's working
as it should be there's still a little
bit problems with humidity and droplets
and probably from my hands but let's see
it should be back to normal now it is
working as advertised but here is we're
not talking about stuff or not they are
talking about the specs we're talking
about beats submerse ability of the
phone you can take pictures with this
phone while it is submerged of course
since the touch screen is not working
you can use the actual hardware buttons
to take the picture we're going to say
hi to our cameraman this is us here in
London we're going to switch cameras go
to the back camera submerge under water
you should be able to
I'm aggressing against the volume up and
volume down buttons but it doesn't seem
to work because it can get a decent
focus and trying to shoot against
something which is really really close
but you get the entire idea in the grab
a virgin so the main idea behind this
film is not it's super high-end specs
even though we talked about those in a
previous video this is all about ip67
rating and you can take this page you
can make this huge look at a fool you
can take this basically plus any worse
so this was a short look at the
submerged version of the galaxy s4
active thank you very much for watching
this is pocket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
