going to take a look at the software on
the 18 th TC HD 7 s first off i'm here
in the add an account setup dialog and
we have an extra one for eighteen t
address book so this is something that
they added where you can sync with their
ATT services on att.com / address book
so you can have all your contacts sync
with that if you you know don't want i'm
syncing with windows live or exchange or
gmail or whatever that's a cool little
thing that they added and here's the
default start screen and we see normal
stuff we've got eighteen t u-verse
that's an addition and then all the way
down here we have ATT navigator and 18 8
radio and the HTC hubs let's look at the
uverse mobile
initializing so this is nice I uverse
app that they added all shows only chose
to shows and I look at that and we can
download more all shows so this is a TV
shows that we can stream and download go
look at this one there's good little
intro video
ten dollars per month is that see
there's your intro commercial that tells
you about the service a little more and
let's go back and look at some other
okay you teen to navigators pretty nice
navigation Program
so pretty simple we can choose a recent
place
or we can choose a city and the school
voice recognition White Plains New York
and we have weak GPS signal so this
might not work yeah have some little
extras you got weather pretty cool
little addition find some movies
that's a nice addition let's have ATT
radio so you can stream different types
of radio stations and get us subscribe
to it
and we have some more ATT apps over here
so this family map my wireless is going
to be you know your account information
that kind of thing plus some support
tutorials and family map is when you
sign up with the family you can see
where they are on the map so we have
sign in for that or register as well
lastly we have the HTC hub which is
added by HTC and from here you can
download more HTC apps it's nice weather
animations
and you'll probably want to get some of
these special apps let's see mark place
we have some customizations here we have
the a teensy App Center and HTC apps so
two extra app stores and the ATT App
Store we have most of the same things
that is already bundled but we also have
an ATT code scanner so this is good for
reading QR codes we can install that no
problem and of course HTC apps only the
hub was actually bundled on this device
but there's some other good ones here
that you're going to one download tented
phone for example it's really nice so
there's a bunch more free apps you can
download now this device comes
pre-loaded with the node 0 updates so
everything should be a little faster
than the older phones although the most
of those are up upgraded too so I'm just
going to do a little test of launching
fabled Cohen golf so let's put the old
HD 7 right next to it and see if we can
do it at the same time
let's try that again ready
okay one was asked for the first time
when obsessive the second time so not
much difference
so that's pretty much it for what's new
what's added with the eighteen t HT 7 s
not a whole lot of bundled apps but and
the good thing about Windows Phone 7 is
if you don't like or you you're never
going to use this program you can really
easily unpin it now this is no problem
that's not really a big deal to to
remove these and even if you don't like
them over here it's very easy to tap and
hold uninstall hit that and it's gone
instantly so if you don't like these
programs it's very easy to remove them
but if you do they're pretty cool so
that's about it for the software tour of
the 18 th tcht 7s hope you enjoyed this
video give us a thumbs up if you did and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
