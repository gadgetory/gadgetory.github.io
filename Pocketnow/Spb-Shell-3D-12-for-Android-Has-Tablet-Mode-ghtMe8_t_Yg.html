pocketnow.com spb shell 3d for android
has been updated to version 1.2 and with
it we get a lot of cool new changes
including a tablet version that actually
looks pretty cool running on a
smartphone this video we're going to
talk about it let's get to it so shell
3d previously known as spb mobile shell
is one of the more expensive pieces of
Android software out there it's $15
before that $15 you really get a lot for
your money although we still would like
to see it at a lower price it's one of
the most comprehensive robust and
customizable android home screen
replacement so that is available right
now and as a recap let's go through some
of the panels then we'll talk about that
tablet mode so new to 1.2 is that in the
weather panel which has a beautiful
animation a forecast can actually toggle
between multiple cities pretty cool kind
of a basic upgrade their if we swipe to
the right to this other panel the
calendar widget has been updated to give
you a nicer view when you tap on the
calendar so it's more easily accessible
when you're when you're trying to access
a particular day swipe to the right we
can have a variety of panels
miscellaneous things we've got a
calendar widget we've got some program
shortcuts all of this is customizable by
the way when you go down into this menu
and that's not actually the right menu
that's the manage apps if we go to
manage panels we can click and drag a
variety of panels down we can move them
around slide them around on the screen
really versatile and how you can
customize shell 3d and if we go back
over here we've got this cool widget
which lets you you have to you have to
tap over here which lets you carousel
through your text messages again there's
a lot of 3d stuff going on here and if
you like eye candy if you like visual
pizazz you're really going to like shell
3d and over here we have some
miscellaneous things a world clock some
more app shortcuts some smart folders
and you get the point from here there's
also a an app tray which comes here you
can tap on any of these icons and it
will put the icon on your home screen
and then we've got customizable
shortcuts on the bottom now let's talk
about that tablet mode which is really
cool intended for tablets but it works
actually very well
for smart phones you can see why in a
sec so if we go to home settings by the
way new for 1.2 is updated settings to
make it easier to access things if we go
down to experimental you'll see
stereoscopic 3d mode which is kind of a
novelty something you can play around
with on your own you can actually have
it display in real 3d on your screen
let's go back but over here is what I
want to focus on tablet mode so we're
going to turn that on and we're going to
let it refresh by the way also new to
version 1.2 is landscape mode so you can
flip your device into a horizontal
orientation and spb shell 3d will follow
so let's let it load here okay so here
we are in tablet mode and as I flip
across you're going to see that
everything is much much smaller and you
might be thinking why would I want
everything to be smaller well with
smaller text you fit a lot more on the
screen at one time that means a lot less
scrolling a lot less panning and if
you've got a device like the infuse 4G
or the galaxy s2 or the HTC Desire HD a
lot of other folks out there with larger
displays it will work very well
especially if you have good eyesight so
here on the Xperia Arc 4.2 inch screen I
can read this text pretty clearly so the
tablet mode really isn't bothersome in
fact it's great because there's just so
much you can fit on one screen if we go
over to a screen with shortcuts look how
many shortcuts you could have you could
have dozens and dozens of shortcuts all
within one screen it even has a pretty
cool updated app tray got to be a little
bit more precise when you're tapping so
look how many icons you can have in
tablet mode really impressive everything
else is pretty much the same we can go
into that 3d view we can manage our
panels over here again everything is a
little bit smaller but if you've got a
device with a larger screen you're
really going to appreciate this new
tablet mode in shell 3d version 1.2 so
if you liked this video please give us a
thumbs up and let us know what you think
about the new features of sbd shell 3d
thanks for watching and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
