leave the company Google Drive see some
major improvements in mobile and believe
it or not Microsoft downgraded their
YouTube application to please google I'm
high memory meta and is it just me or is
this our video number 3000 one this is
pocket now daily let's start stay off
with the new products LG has just
announced their new Optimus G Jay and I
know this sounds like GI Joe or GI Jane
and still where'd his name in history
the problem of this product is that this
is actually an optimus G meaning it
keeps almost the same design it has
every single of the specs that we saw
last year on the optimus G and the
difference is that this is a ruggedized
version of the phone we still don't know
when it'll come to the United States or
pricing points but we will keep you
posted if it's even worth that I mean
it's kind of a seer specs now let's move
over to the Microsoft versus Google
battles Microsoft has decided to water
down there YouTube application you know
the one they had to actually build
because we'll never built it themselves
the reason why is because they got that
season this is litter we talked about
days ago because you could download
videos and you can get any ads and so
far they figured out how to get rid of
the downloading video apart sadly but
well the ads haven't been fixed yet so
stay tuned for that enjoy it for now and
speaking of Google they've made a major
overhaul to their Google Drive services
for mobile you now get enhanced editing
features for spreadsheets you get a new
UI that looks a lot like Google now and
you also get probably the best feature
or a scanner with the camera to be able
to take photos of documents and scan
them into Google Drive yes you have that
feature previously with genius scan and
other applications but it's always great
to have everything integrated you
download the application now and trust
me it is worth it now let's talk about
the Nokia EOS project yes we know the
reports it'll probably be announced or
launched by the end of this year but new
reports from a more reliable source
state that July 9th will be the day for
the announcement and I still don't know
what's special about the state doesn't
match any other event actually but point
being is apparently this device will
keep the same design as the Nokia Lumia
920 probably a little thinner and bring
the 41-megapixel camera I'm sure they're
going to figure
that one out it's interesting to see
what's happening and it's kind of weird
because windows phone 8.1 will probably
not be ready for when this device is
being announced which is kind of
interesting let's just see how things
point out probably again these are just
reports and finally for the most sad and
concerning news of the day things same
kind of grim over at HTC I mean their VP
of communications has just left their
senior chief product officer just left
and that's just part of the executive
team that is left in the last couple of
weeks I mean we do know that Peter Chou
has committed to stepping down from the
company if the HTC One is not successful
when we do consider that to be unfair i
mean HTC has driven most of the
innovation in the smartphone industry
for the past decade and if anything
changes in the company that innovation
could probably be gone but that leads
you to the question of the day that you
buy an HTC One and if you didn't buy an
HTC One let us know what why you didn't
choose it and also let us know what you
think is wrong with the company in my
particular case I'm buying an HTC One I
mean I do feel that the company has done
a great job in the past decade not just
now so I do believe that they deserve
another chance but leave us a comment
down below what did you do of course
it's always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet Oh make sure you
follow us on Pocket out without common
structure our YouTube channel as well
you can also follow me on Twitter and
hang on this quarter iveta please give
