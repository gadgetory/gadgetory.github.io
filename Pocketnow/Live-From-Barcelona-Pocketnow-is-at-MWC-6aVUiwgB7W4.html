now and this is anthony and we are here
in barcelona for mwc 2013 the Mobile
World Congress this year is starting in
just a couple days our press events
start tomorrow so we're here to bring
you just a few quick predictions things
we think we're going to see things we
hoping to see we're going to see insofar
as devices and announcements from the
major companies so let's have a look so
besides the expected flood of
unremarkable Android tablets our biggest
and probably most headline where the
prediction comes courtesy of rumors
surrounding Nokia which looks poised to
unveil the device codenamed EOS the
smartphone might be the first to marry
Windows Phone 8 with a real PureView
camera experience something to put it
mildly we'd most definitely like to see
if true it's tends to be the headlining
announcement of the show second liter
Samsung's note 8.0 the intermediate
sized tablet confirmed by a company
executive last month if that tablet
comes to the market with the rumored
specs will see a 7 inch 1280 x 800 super
who your LCD screen android 4.2 still
gigs of ram with 16 or 32 gives a
storage and a microSD slot and of course
the s pen it's also rumored to measure
in under eight millimeters thick and
carry 4600 milliamp hour battery the
side from screen size these specs aren't
anything new and the tablet continues
the design language of the galaxy s3 and
an l2 but it's a product we think it
might fill a specific niche bringing the
s-pen right between the 10 inches and
the five enters and back in the
smartphone world LG's optimus g pro has
already seen a South Korea launched but
we're expecting LG to announce its
global availability here at mwc
alongside the l3 to l5 2 and the l7 to
the version of the optimus g pro we saw
announced in south korea is powered by a
snapdragon 600 running at 1.7 gigahertz
and impacts a 5.5 inch display putting
it decidedly in phablet territory with
its 400 ppi screen and solid hardware
build it already looks like a more
promising contender than LG's previous
phablet attempts and we're excited to
see what LG's global plans are for this
device and wrapping up the big
predictions is the rumor
until powered the zoo's fonepad not to
be confused with bad phone despite
rumors and speculations that this might
be a windows power device or a combo
like the bat phone we believe that it
might have nothing to do with docket
instead we've heard it could very well
be a seven incher raising the phablet
screen size bar even higher packing the
Intel Lexington ship and running Android
4.1 whatever the case we'll see you soon
