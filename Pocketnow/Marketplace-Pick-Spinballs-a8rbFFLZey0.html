park now calm and today make sure a new
game called spin balls and this is a
pretty fun game actually we'll just
going to go into start right now and the
way that it works is you actually have
to tap on each one of these little
circles to rotate the balls so if I want
to tap on this one I can rotate it now
as you can see they highlight whenever
they are selected so we'll just click on
the five right here and it will load
those five and actually give me points
so the object of the game is to get the
most amount of balls and each sequence
that you can so for this one for
instance I would actually want to rotate
it this way I can have for that way so
on each move you actually get more
points and when you load up one of these
other four circles here you actually get
a bonus so it looks as though my time is
going to run out I'm gonna actually lose
so we'll see what it says says Rank 1
170 points level 1 I can either play
again or go to the main menu so I'm
going to play again time will start and
as you can see i have a rotated balls
here start that one and on those two as
you can see i got points for activating
these two little circles on these sides
so continue through the game okay so as
you can see it is pretty basic but a
very fun game so this is spin balls and
the program does cost around two dollars
and ninety-nine cents on windows mobile
marketplace but there also is a trial
version available so this is another
marketplace pick where you pick some fun
and interesting games and applications
on windows mobile marketplace thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
