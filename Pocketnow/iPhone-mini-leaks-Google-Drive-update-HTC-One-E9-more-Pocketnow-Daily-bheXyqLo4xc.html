6 mini and you won't like what you see
acc quietly unveils the HTC One a mine
plus and no we didn't get the name wrong
and if you're want to get Microsoft's
project Spartan browser try now is the
time I'm hi meri behna and sorry for the
late upload guys we ran into some
technical difficulties but this is
yesterday's pocket out daily brought to
you by Linda calm the official news
today after with HTC as the company has
quietly unveiled its 1e mine plus no not
the 19 and no not the one m9 plus that
we were waiting for but actually the
bigger variant of phones that don't
really exist we've got a 5.5 inch quad
HD display in addition to other goodies
hit the back like a 20 megapixel shooter
and yeah this is the plasticky variant
of a phone that we're waiting for to
launch soon and aluminum and we wonder
when and why this quiet launch but yeah
you can expected in Asia zoom and licks
lease return for full details on what
you're getting and just like we teased
last week google has updated its a
Google Drive application to now bring a
photo sub now you won't be forced to
back up your photos on Google+ since
many of you including me don't really
like it now you have the option to use
Google Drive which is great we're still
trying to iron out the details on what
limitations you get through the
photographs but the option is there
other official news have motorola if you
thought the company was putting down its
Moto X because it doesn't sell that well
the company is far from that it
continues bringing new color options to
the Moto X and if you didn't want that
exclusive a football style leather for
verizon of Union can now get red leather
as well on moto maker and it will cost
you the same 25 bucks in addition to
whatever option of a phone you want
which is really great the question is
what color do you like I currently have
the bamboo one and that's my favorite
one now let's talk about the Microsoft
Spartan browser we still do not know
what's the official name for this
product and no internet explorer is not
going to be the name according to some
sources as that name is currently dying
and if you want to give it a try it is
now available for download microsoft
says this is the future of browsing
oddly we feel that it's pretty much the
president browsing and the only benefit
you get here is court
on ax but Lexi the scripture give it a
try and let us know II think and finally
for the very disappointing news of the
day if you wanted a four-inch iphone by
the end of this year it seems you're not
going to be getting much we've got some
links of the chassis of the iphone 6c or
7c or whatever it's going to be dubbed
and the reason why we call it that way
is because it looks pretty much like the
iphone 5c all you have is a more speaker
grills and you have the two tone flash
option and you'll probably even get
touch ID because why the heck it's
probably going to be that case but yeah
you get the plasticky option that hasn't
really sold well it hasn't really sold
at all and it leads me to the question
of the day uh if you wanted that
four-inch iphone given the question that
i gave you last week would you want this
plasticky different color option or we
just paid out a dollar premium for
something better because in my case
that's what I would do I would rather
put up with bigger size but a more
premium phone leave us a comment down
below what do you think and folks if
you've ever wanted to become a pro at
web design build your own website or hey
