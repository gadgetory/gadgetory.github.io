huawei mate 20 yes not made 11 and it's
fast renders appeared to bring more
information on what we should expect for
a feature key - and there's an
alternative solution in the United
States if you want a huawei P 20 Pro I'm
Jaime Rivera and yes I'm travelling in
pre recording is happening but more
coverage comes very soon this is
PocketNow daily all right the official
news today begin with deals and write
this down you're gonna really want to
get into this one Google pixel to excel
it's currently $100 off yet again on
Best Buy but listen to this one once
again you can get a chromecast a Google
home many you can get youtube TV for two
months this is the craziest deal out
there where one of the best phones if
not the best phone of last year also
brings a ton of goodies you can learn
more in the description now let's talk
about the Huawei P 20 Pro for those of
you that want those 40 megapixels on
your camera and you're in the United
States you don't get a phone unless you
follow the description there is an ebay
seller that's trusted I would say for
882 bucks you could buy the phone and
again my phone is waiting until I land
on Studio One tomorrow and I'll let you
know what I think there's also another
option by the way you can get that phone
for 600 bucks I just I don't know the
seller seems sketchy that's just me
again more information in the
description now this was the spotlight
over to blackberry we cannot wait to see
when the company brings a successor to
the key one which we assume will be
called the key to and there are some
leaked renders that show as a device
that looks a lot like the current key
one not exactly sure what differences
are there other than the probable
specifications Neve dragon 660 it seems
six gigabytes of RAM and I always get
stuck when I try to say six gigabytes of
RAM but yeah that's apparently what's
coming let's see if that's real and if
you haven't noticed the very rocking an
iOS device iOS 11.3 has just launched
and I know I usually don't cover that on
the daily the interesting part is that a
lot of people that have been using
third-party displays on their iPhones
meaning you didn't go to an Apple store
to get it fixed apparently their
displays are not turning
on and that is definitely alarming I
know the aftermarket for displays is
insane and I've always known that these
aren't official so yeah let's let's see
how it happens or what I don't know the
third-party providers will do anything
about it which I doubt will be the case
in countries like ROM from and finally
the most interesting news today would
have not been the most interesting news
probably a couple of years ago but given
all the buzz of the huawei mate 10 Pro
and now the p20 Pro we've got
information about the huawei mate 20
probe because apparently it won't be the
mate 11 and I like the fact that the
numbers are finally catching up will
most likely get the triple cameras as we
saw with the mate I don't know the mate
10s or whatever I forgot the name but
you get the point
think about it is apparently the keren
980 processor which is going to be the
new deal is going to be up to 30% faster
and obviously bring some other bells and
whistles and we wonder exactly what
Huawei plans to bring you know to follow
up on the p20 Pro here and today's
question let us know I mean because of
the p20 Pro and the popularity
particularly of that hands-on video let
us know what you think I mean are you
looking forward to a mate 20 Pro in my
case of course I am but leave us a
