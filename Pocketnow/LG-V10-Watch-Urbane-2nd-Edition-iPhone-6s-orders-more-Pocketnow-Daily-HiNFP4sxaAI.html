Android where's first LTE watch stage
fright to point o takes a stage now to
worry Android users and iphone success
order seemed to drop even with so many
sales I'm hi Mary vera and I'm trying to
make the best out of this Thursday just
to get it over with you know why this is
parking out daily the official news
today start with malware for those of
you that were worried with stage fright
1 point 0 in your phone being able to be
controlled through an mms well now you
have to worry about mp3 and mp4 files
apparently that is the new way to do it
even though it does require more steps
requires you to go to a website and
stuff like that but anyways this was
alerted to Google back in August and it
seems that google has a patch for it
next week so make sure you update for
those of you to remember the rumors of a
budget-minded 1+2 because of yeah the
one plus two is it enough it seems that
the oneplus x is still in the works this
is a 5-inch 720p display device but it
does bring a fingerprint scanner at the
back and apparently you're getting a
Snapdragon 801 processor here the specs
aren't really that bad so long as one
plus is able to keep it in the two
hundred dollars somewhere price range
and apparently that is the target plus
at three hundred actually uh just stay
tuned let's see if we actually get this
product soon and yes today is October
first meaning that if you did not cancel
your Apple music subscription service
and yesterday you most probably got bill
today the three-month plan was over
yesterday but Eddy Cue was recently in
an interview being asked what happens
with those people that leave the service
and according to Q he is not worried
according to him Apple is working on
this arm alarm run meaning beats won the
radio station and the whole idea of
Apple music is something that Apple is
not going to cancel today and that
they're trying the waters let's see if
it works because I'm background spotify
when it comes to the iphone 6s and
iPhone 6s plus even though Apple had a
very successful weekend selling a crazy
amount of units it seems that the
Cupertino has begun to drop orders for
supplies for this particular product and
it could be due to many things probably
because the company prepared so much for
so many
sales that now that they're over there
planning to level things off it usually
happens when supply chains probably the
company has enough stock but we do know
that there are shortages right now on
particular units so let's just see if
it's that or it's the fact that Apple is
really predicting that they're not going
to so much because of the new Android
competition and finally for the very hot
news of the day yesterday we get the new
LG v10 and their new watch urbane second
edition what makes these products cool
is that this was LG's new super premium
phone we are still rocking a snapdragon
808 here but what we have here is a
secondary display at the top Michael
Fisher already had a chance to test it
out and in the case of this watch urbane
model well it's the first Android wear
smart watch out there without te
capabilities well these products were
extremely cool I could go crazy telling
you details but we have two hands on
videos already available in the links of
the description and just leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about LG's new products do you like them
more but do you feel that you're just
gonna skip because if my case I love my
LG g4 but yeah I'll be willing to try
that be 10 in that watch urbane it was a
