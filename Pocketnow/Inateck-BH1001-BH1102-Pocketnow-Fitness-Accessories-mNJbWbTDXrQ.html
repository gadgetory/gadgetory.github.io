you're working hard it all counts and
everything has to be accurate I'm high
maybe that I would pocket now and this
is pocketing outfit
one of the major requests we received in
the comments was for Bluetooth headsets
and every other accessory needed for
fitness so for this particular episode
of pocket out fitness we decided to
bring you some really cool new
accessories from Innotech we've gotta
hand it to enter tech for two very
distinctive things when it comes to
their accessories number one is that
there is a lot of thoughtfulness in
their packaging since their products
usually include good quality carrying
cases adapters and wires but second is
the fact that you're getting a lot of
bang for your buck here at a time when
your average fitness capable bluetooth
headset costs around a hundred dollars
these Innotech th-10 o ones are
currently costing just around thirty
dollars on Amazon and yeah I did not get
that price tag wrong so for this price
tag you're getting a premium chrome
design within earbuds there are inline
controls for music playback that work on
whatever platform you choose at the top
of the ear buds are actually even
magnetic meaning that you can keep them
in place whenever you no longer want to
listen to music and best of all you're
getting eight hours of battery life
which is extremely uncommon for fitness
accessories training with these bh 1001
s has been okay for the most part if
you're looking for a good audio in any
or fit then these might be good enough
but my biggest problem with them is the
way they fit they would have benefited
from inear hooks or a tie strap at the
back to help them stay and place in my
case but then again in the case of
shoddy 'she actually likes their fit so
hey your mileage may vary whether you're
running or hitting the gym hard the most
important thing about this headset is
that it doesn't really get in the way of
your posture most competing headsets
make it uncomfortable for you to lay
your head on the bench when your weight
training but this design has proven to
be rather good in that particular
scenario we all know that you can invest
a ton of money when it comes to fitness
gear so if you're starting out i'd say
that the Innotech bh 1001 bluetooth
headset is a good way to start again as
long as they fit well initech also sent
us a sample of its dual dynamic Lacerta
bh 1102 which provide hi-fi audio for
around thirty dollars as well these
Lacerta aren't really fitness oriented
but it was really hard to ignore them
because of number one their price tag
number two the audio quality that they
provide and number three the DS in
design and the volume switches that
adapt to both iOS and Android on just
one package making them a really good by
if you would prefer wires most people
don't sweat as much as I do so these
might be a good fit for you but just
take into consideration that this is
probably one of the longest wires I've
ever seen which might become
uncomfortable for training overall the
market is full of a ton of bluetooth
headsets to choose from but if you're
starting and you're on a budget I can
think of no better option right now than
these innotech offerings anyways that's
it for this episode of pocket now
