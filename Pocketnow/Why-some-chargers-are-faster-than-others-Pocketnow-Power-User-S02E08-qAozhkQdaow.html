windows phone there's one thing that
unites us all I'm Joe levian on this
episode of the pocket now power user
we're going to talk about chargers the
why summer faster than others this topic
comes from Natalie and Kristen turns out
Kristen bought a brand new phone charger
that charges her phone about twice as
fast as Natalie's in wall charger what
gives that's a great question but first
we got to talk a little bit about
electricity for the most part
electricity comes in two different forms
alternating current the stuff that comes
out of your wall virtually everywhere in
the world and direct current direct
current is the stuff that we use inside
batteries and inside of our mobile
devices somehow we've got to convert
that AC into DC so that we can charge up
our phones I'll use them this conversion
happens through what we usually just
call a charger but really it comes
through something called a rectifier
that some people erroneously call an
inverter what it does is it takes that
alternating current and through a series
of circuits and magic turns it into
direct current that we then can pipe out
into our phone now all of our phones
these days use USB or apples equivalent
to charge and apples equivalent is
essentially the same thing as USB when
it comes to power what's different
however is voltage and amperage and you
know that other stuff so what are those
and how do they affect how fast your
device charges in electronics there's
something called Ohm's lot has to do
with how volts amps and ohms that's as
much details we're going to go into how
they all inner react well we've got two
standard this USB power standard that we
all use in our devices that dictates how
many volts we can have coming into our
device and for the most part that's five
volts five volts is great that's what
comes out of our computers through the
USB port so we can charge up our devices
when we're transferring data we can
charge up our devices when we've got our
laptop there all kinds of fun stuff but
now we have these direct plugs that plug
into our wall
convert the power from AC into DC like
we've been talking about and then send
it across again at five volts so if
everything's five volts why do some
charge faster than others that's where
resistance and amperage come into play
now resistance really shouldn't be a big
deal unless you've got a really cheap
table or a cheap charger so it
resistance just like it sounds that's
the force pushing back against the flow
of electricity from the charger into the
device and if you've got a really really
bad cable or maybe that connector on the
end is loose so it's not making good
contact your resistance is going to be
higher even though i mentioned
resistance first the likelihood that
you're going to have resistance in the
USB cable that's noticeable or that's
problematic is really low what is most
likely is you've got low amperage coming
out of your charger going through that
cable into your device the lower the
amps the slower the charge generally
speaking the more amps that you push
into the device the faster it'll charge
there are a couple caveats there your
device is only capable of accepting a
certain amount of amps you remember that
booklet that you throw away you know the
Quick Start Guide and whatnot it
probably tells you in there what the
maximum amperage is that your device can
use don't see that or you're going to be
damaging things and ultimately
shortening the life of your charging
circuits and probably your battery to
another thing that you need to keep in
mind is that charger can only do so much
so let's take a look at the charger and
see and i'm going to read right off of
this there are two different sections on
this this one happens to be an LG travel
charger so if I look down at this it
says that it is a 100 to 240 volts 50 to
60 Hertz and what that means that's the
alternating current I can plug this in
anywhere from a socket that outputs a
hundred volts all the way up to 120
volts ac that covers an awful lot of
people and as long as your outlet has
prongs that look just like that you're
probably safe you know better than I do
in your country and there are a lot of
countries with a lot of standards so
don't take this as
we'll just keep that in mind the next
part is the frequency 50 to 60 Hertz
different places in the world use
different frequencies for alternating
current that's how fast the current
moves back and forth in the line 50 to
60 Hertz so that charger will handle
anything in that range which is good
because even in the United States where
we're 60 Hertz sometimes we get a bit
less than that after 30 power and
whatnot comes through so it's nice to
have a little bit of wiggle room the
next part and this might confuse people
it says right here that this is 0.2 amps
well crap that doesn't sound like a lot
0.2 that's hardly any amps I'd throw
that out right no and here's why that's
the AC side of things so it's drawing
0.2 amps alternating current and then
it's going to convert it into direct
current so let's see the next line down
what the direct current does reading
here it says output is 5 volts 5 volts
direct current that's good at 0.85 amps
0.85 so not quite 1 amp that's just fine
it's 0.85 that's a lot better than half
an amp that's a lot better than 0.2 amps
AC right but we're converting it over so
your device if it supports anything up
to 0.85 amps I can use this charger not
a problem just plug it in and go we're
good however it might not charge all
that fast if my device can accept up to
two amps I can get a charger that's
twice as amperage E as that and charge
my device twice as fast roughly so
that's where the concern and confusion
comes in some of the devices that you
get to charge up your devices will
charge it to amps summit one summit one
and a half so I'm at point eight five
like that one does and some even at half
an amp so keep that in mind and get the
highest amperage that you can get as
long as your device supports it that
last part is the important part that
will
people overlook and why do people
overlook it I'll get a rapid charger i
can plug in the wall and it'll charge up
my device twice as fast as something
else but it might be ruining that device
in the process so read those
instructions and read those those
notations just to make sure that you're
using the right amperage you're not
going above what it's supposed to be and
you'll be safe so that was a great
question Natalie and Kristen I
appreciate it very much and with that
that's going to end our second season of
the pocket now power user we hope you
enjoyed it if you did make sure you hit
the thumbs up button and of course
subscribe so you know when the next
series is coming out as always for
pocket now I'm Joe Levi thanks for
