tablet of all time the new surface pro 3
has quite a few upgrades compared to the
surface pro 2 but there are also a
couple down rays that you may not
realize this is a Delaine from pocket
now and you're watching our comparison
between the surface pro 3 and the
surface pro 2 first we'll start with the
new features that are just fantastic and
make the surface pro 2 look like old
news the screen I love the 12 inch
screen on the surface pro 3 this is the
size of the screen that have been used
to on my older Windows tablets the
running Windows XP Vista and Windows 7
the 3 by 2 aspect ratio may seem too
roomy and some of the Metro apps but in
desktop programs like Premiere Pro
InDesign and illustrator it's perfect
surface pro 2's ten point six inch wide
angled HD display can feel a bit cramped
vertically in programs like that another
plus in terms of Metro apps is that that
with the surface pro 3 you can snap up
to four side-by-side as opposed to only
two on the surface pro 2 next is the
thickness and weight the surface pro 3
puts the surface pro 2's thickness to
shame I was actually very happy with the
surface Pro's thickness and weight it
made my older Windows tablets feel
enormous the surface pro 3 now makes the
surface pro 2 feel enormous the surface
pro 2 is about thirteen point five
millimeters thick the surface pro 3
reduces that by four point four
millimeters that's close to a 30%
reduction in thickness the 2 is also 907
grams versus the pro threes 800 grams
now let's look at the new kickstand like
the surface to the surface pro 2 had two
angles that the kickstand could click
into with the surface pro 3 Microsoft
has extended the variable viewing angles
for the kickstand considerably the first
angle pops out very easily but then
adjustments become much stiffer as
you'll need a bit more force to find
your desired kickstand angle that's not
a bad thing at all since you've got much
larger amount of control for your
viewing angle in terms of performance
both my surface pro 2 and surface pro 3
have very similar configurations
they have fourth generation Core i5 4300
u 2.5 gigahertz Haswell processors eight
gigs of ram 256 gigs of storage and the
battery life can generally last all day
without having to plug in both have the
same Intel HD 4400 GPU as well but the
surface pro 3 is available in other
configurations that offer even more
horsepower if that's what you're looking
for the charger for the surface pro 3 is
much better than previous charger the no
one uses a completely new slot like
magnetic connector and it's much easier
to connect to the device
those still pretty difficult in the dark
both Chargers still have the awesome
extra USB port on the brick for charging
a phone in terms of other specifications
the surface pro 3 has five megapixel
cameras on the front and back while the
surface pro 2 has two 720p HD cameras
the surface pro 3 also gives you
front-facing speakers which give you
great stereo audio the surface pro 2
speakers while nice and loud were on the
sides because the surface pro 3 has a
larger screen area than the pro 2 and
previous surface tablets Microsoft had
to make it larger type covers to the new
type covers are still sold separately so
that you can choose the color you want
or just not get one and use some other
keyboard instead it still has the
backlit keys and a nice soft material on
the back but now there's a new trackpad
because the keyboard is bigger Microsoft
was able to make the trackpad 68% larger
and it's also nice smooth plastic
instead of cloth like material so if for
some reason you actually would rather
use a trackpad instead of the much more
efficient touchscreen or stylus you'll
like the improvements here that brings
us to the new stylus on the surface pro
3 the original surface pro and surface
pro 2 both used in an inexpensive
version of Wacom Cintiq digitizer
technology Wacom stylus tablet tech has
been the gold standard for graphic
artists since the 20th century
personally I swear by it with the
surface pro 3 Microsoft switched the
stylus digitizer technology to an
intrigue version the advantages include
a thinner screen less of a visual gap
between the size tip and pointer display
and supposedly better accuracy another
advantage is a new button at the end of
the stylus
that allows you to instantly launch into
OneNote when the tablet is in sleep mode
that feature can be extremely useful and
brings tablet very close to being able
to replace the ease of picking up a pad
of paper and writing on it on the other
hand this new pen has three batteries
inside or as welcomes technology does
not need any battery in the pen at all
the surface pro 3 is stylus only sports
256 levels pressure sensitivity whereas
the pro 2 had 1024 levels of pressure
why comes synthetic companion Windows 8
tablet supports double that as well as
tilt sensitivity after installing
intrigues wind tab drivers from the
intrigue website all of your
professional graphics programs will
support the new pens pressure
sensitivity seven hundred something
levels of pressure sensitivity seems
like a big difference but in reality the
pressure sensitive drawing in Photoshop
and illustrator seems to be working
quite well I'm having difficulty seeing
any noticeable difference between
drawing on the surface pro 3 and the
surface pro 2 I've got the latest Wacom
drivers on surface pro 2 as well and I
see only minor differences between the
pointer position accuracy on the two
tablets at the edges of the screen
however the surface pro 3 is definitely
a little more accurate in its pointer
placement the surface pro 2 stylus
pointer can be out of alignment just a
bit at the edges the only really
annoying change that I can find in the
surface pro 3 is that the capacitors
start button has moved from the center
of the bottom edge bezel to the right
edge I've accidentally pressed it quite
frequently while using the stylus in my
right hand and I really wish I could
just disable it completely overall
despite the minor issues of having to
someday replace the batteries in the pen
and having to deal with the capacitive
Start button in the right bezel the
surface pro 3 is a significant upgrade
over all previous surface tablets
including the excellent surface pro 2
that's it for now be sure to give this
video a thumbs up and thanks for
