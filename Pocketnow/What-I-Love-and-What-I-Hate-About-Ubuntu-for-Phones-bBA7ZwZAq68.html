Developer Preview since went live last
week I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is what I love and what I hate
about Ubuntu touch for phones I first
installed Ubuntu touch on my nexus 4
when the developer preview images went
live I've been using it off and on ever
since and I've noticed some things that
I absolutely love about the operating
system and I've also discovered some
things I absolutely hate so to start
with we'll go over the first four things
that I found that I just cannot stand
about Ubuntu touch a feature canonical
lists on its website for Ubuntu 4 phones
is being neat and organized however I
feel the interface is a little more
cluttered and disorderly than anything
the far left page is music but the far
right page is videos why would those not
be closer together the next page over is
people then you have home and apps but
there's no real organization to it
that's just kind of there and if you
don't like the way it's organized
there's no way to change it everything
is set where it is there's no way to
reorganize things remove things add
things everything is set in its place
there's no customization at this level
and there's no way to organize things
better to your liking which gets me to
my next point the interface and maybe
this is just how it is for the Developer
Preview but the interface is extremely
extremely redundant for instance your
people page has your most frequently
contacted people that exact same list of
people is shown one page over on the
home page there's also a page of
frequently used applications on the
application page but if you swipe over
one page to the left they're also there
on the home page your recently played
music is on the home page and also on
the music page there is just redundancy
all throughout this operating system and
it's very annoying the problem is you
can't change it there's no way to delete
one area of frequently used applications
from the home page or maybe the
applications page it's all there set in
stone for now at least another part of
the operating system that I can't stand
is search there is a search bar on the
top left part of the interface but it's
relative to whatever page your own if
you're on the music page it'll search
music if you're on the peoples page it
searches people and if you're on the
videos page it searches videos the cool
thing is that it searches online
databases so you can pull video and
music searches from Amazon straight to
your home screen that's really cool but
it's relative
- whatever paid your own if you're on
the homepage if you're on the apps page
it just doesn't search anything it
doesn't search at all there should be a
universal search that would show local
search results at least for the home
page the fourth and final thing that
absolutely drives me up the wall about
Ubuntu for phones is the gesture
navigation it's also one of my favorite
features about the operating system it's
one of the most distinguishing features
but it's so clunky an average usage that
it makes navigating kind of difficult in
some scenarios for instance if you're an
application and you want to go home you
swipe from the left side of the display
to access your favorite applications you
also swipe from the left side of the
display the difference is how fast or
how slow or how far you drag your finger
the problem with that is that it's hard
to get it just right every single time
so sometimes I want to go home and I
open one of my favorite apps or I want
to open a favorite app and I go home or
somewhere in between they're the
favorite apps drawer stays open but
nothing happens the rest of the gesture
navigation swipe in from the right side
of the display to switch back to the
previous application works great gesture
navigation can be great but canonical
really needs to focus on how to make it
better
it's very clunky right now and they're
trying to do too many gestures with only
four edges of a display I've also found
some things about the operating system
that I just absolutely love assuming the
redundancy issues will be fixed and that
some sort of customization will come in
the future I love the way it looks it
looks and feels sort of like web listed
in the very beginning there are obvious
differences in the way webOS and Ubuntu
for forms look but there's also a lot of
similarities in the interface and how
user-friendly it truly is once you get
past some of the quirks another feature
I love is the quick access to your
favorite applications a simple gesture
from the left side of the display will
unveil a short list of your favorite
apps scroll to the one you want and let
go the app you selected will launch and
you can do this over and over it's very
quick and simple actually loved it so
much that I found an alternative for
Android called Club box and it works
almost exactly the same another feature
that is hard not to love is how easy it
is to switch back to your previous
application simply swipe from the right
side of the displayed left and your
previous application will appear do this
over and over and the previous
applications will appear sequentially
starting from the most recently used to
the oldest last and most certainly not
least is the notification shade much
like on Android you pull it down from
the top of the display but that's where
the similarities really end with Ubuntu
you can sway
down over different status icons to open
different parts of the notification
shade it's sort of like a paginated
notification area swipe down over the
messages icon and you open your messages
swipe down over the battery icon and you
get your battery status and your
brightness toggle you can tap the time
and see all of them at once and quickly
jump to whatever page you need and if
you pull down over the wrong status icon
you can simply swipe from left to right
to jump to the page you need to there's
a lot to love about Ubuntu touch for
phones and there's also a lot to hate
canonical has their work cut out for
them but this is a great start if you
