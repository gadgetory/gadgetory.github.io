pocketnow.com if you were able to watch
our unboxing of the dell streak you got
a brief introduction to a very unique
android tablet device if you didn't
catch it feel free to click on this link
right here to watch it in this video
we're going to actually show you a
little bit of the device by giving you a
software overview and kind of show you
how some of the applications work as
well as go into depth on Dells custom
skin which makes the device much more
functional so let's get started welcome
back and we're actually get started
right away on kind of giving you a brief
look into the software that makes up the
dell streak it's very unique dell did
skin their version of android just like
many of the other manufacturers out
there such as HTC Samsung etc the only
downside here with the streak is that
it's currently running android 1.6 it
will be updated to throw you in the near
future however right now you're stuck
with 1.6 which really doesn't mean too
much personally except for the fact that
some of the applications may not be
compatible with your device as far as
the speed goes right now the streak is a
very snappy device which you will see in
a second now the lock screen you're
going to get is as you see right here
it's going to show your background as
well as the AT&amp;amp;T basically your carrier
is amusing an ATT sim card right now as
well as the press menu to unlock with
the date and time so instead of sliding
or pressing a button you actually just
go ahead and press that menu key these
are actually three capacitive buttons
here and now we're greeted to our home
screen now these screens are actually
called rooms a little strange different
name for them but at the same time it
definitely houses a lot of different
applications there makes it very
personal so the room name kind of makes
sets now by default you have the ability
to have up to four rooms which is for
home screens however as you see here we
have this toolbar at the very top now
the one that says AT&amp;amp;T is actually where
you would go to add more rooms by
pressing on that we have the ability to
add more room screens here up to six
total and we also have some of our more
recent our favorite type applications
the main thing to keep in mind here is
you can only add six rooms with that
being said though this is a 5-inch
screen so you can fit many more icons
and you typically could as you can see
here I have two widgets I have the
beautiful widget clock as well as the
one of the Twitter which is itself
right there with some shortcuts so as
far as fitting things go it's really not
going to be an issue at all now
scrolling to the left and the right
you're going to have your typical layout
with the home screens this is the actual
main screen that you will see right here
you can add the analog clock or once
again one of these clock widgets as you
can see and we have the Twitter widget
which displays beautifully on the size
of the screen that you have you can fit
much more than ever before it's going to
our left again it shows you a different
screen as well as a different background
you can actually change the background /
screen or per room on this device so we
have the mountain view here going back
over we have the doc look scrolling to
the right we have two more widgets we
have the dell RSS reader which is
showing two feeds right now the pocket
now calm and and gadget as well as the
typical power control which if you're an
Android user currently you are used to
seem and then we also have room here for
more applications shortcuts whatever it
may be and as you can see right off the
bat this device is great in terms of
housing multiple widgets / scream as
well as some application shortcuts so
you're really going to get a lot of
functionality out of this device you can
just scroll right through to actually
see all of your stories pressing on the
story itself will bring you to the
browser and go directly to that page
once again we have another page here
with a different background showing the
Facebook and again you could have the
six of those rooms or home screens
however you see fit now dell is really
integrated something that is very
different on the dell streak from what
we've seen on many devices before you're
going to have your typical notification
bar which is actually here and you
actually press to bring it down you
don't actually swipe so you can see we
have the AT&amp;amp;T logo there no no
notifications but to the right of that
we're going to have the Bluetooth icon
the Wi-Fi icon battery etc by pressing
on that it gives you another drop-down
menu which will allow you to set your
alarm very quickly check your batteries
you can see right now it gives us the
actual percentage which we're at
seventy-five percent and if you actually
select that it will give you all of your
tips so for example right now the
brightness is maximized it'll say hey
you know maybe you can bring down your
brightness a little bit that's what are
things so the typical user that's going
to go a long way many of us tech people
will already know how to maximize our
battery life but if you don't or if
you're new to the Android operating
system that's a great week
for you to find out it's also going to
give us the ability to turn on the Wi-Fi
turn off the Wi-Fi change a different
connection as far as airplane mode edge
that sort of things so this whole layout
with the very quick commands is very
convenient very easy to use and it
allows you to change your settings on
the go on the fly quite simply we can
scroll down here once again you'll see
the bluetooth so if we actually just tap
this button here Bluetooth is now off
like that very quickly very easy to use
last but not least we're also going to
have the drop-down menu here which is
just like every other device however
this arrow is pointing down it's going
to give you your entire list of
applications now this top bar here will
be basically your favorite applications
you can actually shrink this down so we
only have that but by pressing more we
now can see every application that we
have currently on this device and it's a
very smooth scrolling doesn't seem to
hiccup at all on the right side of the
Vice you're going to have your typical
home button the menu button as well as
the back there is no search dedicated
search button however you can put the
search widget on this device without an
issue in reality because the screen is
so big it will fit easily and not being
the way now the downside we're off the
bat that you can see here is in order to
use this device listed in the home
screen you have to have it in horizontal
or in landscape as you can see here I'm
holding it vertically and it's not
changing so you have to actually have
the device in this view just to navigate
your home screen when you go into an app
for example let's say we go into our
Gmail application it was last being held
in the vertical position so we see it
vertically once you turn it over to the
landscape mode a very quick reaction and
it turns back over for you so that is a
really big downside right there
especially for a device this big if you
were able to hold it in the palm of your
hand vertically just to get some quick
operations you know to maybe press the
phone button that sort of thing it would
make life a little easier one aspect
that I really want to touch on here is
going to be the on-screen keyboard by
having this 5-inch screen the keyboard
would typically be much bigger than a
lot of the phones that we see however as
you can see right here that is not
necessarily the case especially when in
landscape mode the keys are a little
bigger however there's more space around
them which honestly gives you a little
bit more forgiveness in terms of not
hitting keys by mistake but the main
thing is you're going
have this number pad here which I
honestly feel like it should have been
utilized with these keys here the top
row of the keys like a lot of the phones
are doing it would have allowed for a
much wider much bigger keyboard on this
device here if we bring it into the
vertical mode you'll see that right
there how it's actually been utilized in
the top row which is not bad but these
are about the same size as the evo keys
a little bit bigger coming up in our
next software overview video we're going
to take a look at applications such as
YouTube the email applications the
browser especially and kind of compare
how the 5-inch screen will give you an
advantage over a phone like the evo 4g
where it's as a 4.3 inch screen for
example and that is one of the aspects
that really hasn't been determined yet
in terms of is having a bigger screen on
a phone always going to be better there
is a point where it becomes cumbersome
and it's a little bit harder to use and
by showing you some of the applications
and if they give you any more
functionality ease of use whatever it
may be paired with the pocket ability
which will be showing next in our
Hardware overview video will give you a
better look at determining if this phone
is for you or not if you like this
device you can actually purchase it
right now in the US over at negril
ektron accom as you can see it's at the
bottom of the screen here so it is
available unlocked right now in the u.s.
you can actually go over to that website
to take a look at it as always thank you
very much for watching everyone please
give us a thumbs up and feel free to
leave any comments you may have about
this device it is something very very
unique to the Android world thanks
