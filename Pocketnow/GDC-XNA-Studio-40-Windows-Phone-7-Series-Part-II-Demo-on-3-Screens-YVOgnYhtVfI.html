set and platform for you to develop on
as you can see there are multiple panes
that a consumer hands through on the
device you have a spotlight section
which allows for news aggregation things
that the developer can check out or
sorry consumer can check out new games
that might be available on service your
identity on xbox live so your avatar
gamers for the last achievement thank
you God asynchronous gaming is very
important to us on xbox live for windows
phone 7 series we think that that's
going to be a great experience that
people will attach to so you'll see that
we have this concepts of a request and
that's basically how do you see if it's
your turn or a friend would like to
initiate a game with you and then we
have the collection of all your games
across the console ones that you
acquired through an xbox live ones that
you acquired through marketplace let's
talk a little about the windows phone 7
series hardware one of the things that
we weren't constantly from developers is
the need for consistency and being able
to target a consistent platform what
we've done
7-series is really defined a consistent
set of hardware capabilities decline for
this goal so we have one resolution
available at launch which is 800 x 480
with the second one available shortly
after which is 480 x 320 these all have
the same touch input a consistent
processor and GPU across these devices
same available ran one of the few things
that oh yes to customize is provide an
optional keyboard when talking about the
developer experience gives really to
user experience frameworks that are
available to develop on for windows
phone 7 series the first one is
Microsoft Silverlight which is really a
water event-driven framework that
leverages sample HTML and JavaScript and
has quite a bit of adoption today the
other one is exit a and XNA game studio
which allows for the creation of
high-performance 2d and 3d games and
really has a mature rich content
pipeline that we built into the product
I won't talk more about that as time
goes on but the key takeaway from this
is that you can use the XNA framework
for games or applications or you can use
silverlight for applications for games
it's really up to you choosing the best
it was for you the XNA framework part of
the ethnic makes video product is really
designed to provide a robust API set for
game development and those around that
we use C sharp dotnet and business trio
too late which allows you to take
advantage of all the other great kind of
framework properties that Microsoft has
to offer as I just discussed on the
slide before we have solutions for game
content processing and an art pipeline
but really XNA game studio isn't
designed to be an engine solution it's
really designed to be a framework that
you as a developer build on top of and
we'll talk a lot about how to put in the
plumbing in place for you so the game
that i'm going to show you the real
quick is a game called of the harvest it
was developed by lu ma RK start to come
up there this game was developed in the
course of three weeks so we gave some
developers early access to our tools and
really asked them to give us an
experience that they thought might be
compelling on the phone so I hit play on
this and the thing that you'll see about
this game is that it's a full 3d game
everything you're seeing here is
rendered in real geometry the animation
of the air
then you see there is completely
rendered in 3d done all the XNA game
studio four point oh you'll see that
it's touched so I can kind of move him
around but really we think that that's a
powerful platform it says something like
you can get this up and running in full
3d with animated characters and provide
a great core experience on the phone one
of the things that we provided on
Windows Phone 7 series is this idea
configurable effects so you basically
have different effects that you can
choose from which you see here so basic
effect which is kind of a three-point
lighting effect skin effect environment
map dual textures and alpha textures
outlet s so Sean's going to go with much
deeper into these but a key takeaways
custom effects aren't available
7-series one of the great advantages
that were riding on Windows Phone 7
series with graphics in particular is we
have system support for a scalar and
orientation so one of the great things
that we have on the xbox 360 is the
ability to render something at a lower
resolution and then through hardware
scale that up to the native resolution
that the user has their xbox 360 center
we are providing some similar
functionality on Windows Phone 7 series
so this allows you also to write your
game without worrying about the native
resolution of the device will do
automatic kind of translation between
the portrait and landscape and we
automatically translate the touch inputs
as well between portrait and landscape
the scalar also has the ability to
dramatically improve performance on the
platform the game that I showed you
earlier was actually rendering at the
full resolution of the device so it was
rendering at 480 x 800 when you as a
developer had the choice to trade
Christmas when that scales up for
improved performance or pushing the
platform
