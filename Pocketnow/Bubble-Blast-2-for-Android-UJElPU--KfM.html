pocketnow.com
so if you have an android device and you
enjoy playing the occasional puzzle game
then you've probably played a game
called bubble blast it's one of the
highest-rated free puzzle games in the
android market
well magma mobile the creators just
released the next game in the series
appropriately named bubble blast - let's
see how it looks ok let's go ahead and
press play and you can see we have two
game modes here we have puzzle mode
which has 200 levels currently the old
version had I believe 700 levels but
magma Mobile already stated that they
would release more levels in the next
update so that's something to look
forward to
Arcade Mode is more of a relaxed style
of gaming let's go ahead and go to
puzzle mode and we'll start with level
pack 1 because that's all that I have
unlocked currently I have been playing
for quite a bit I'll go ahead and start
at square one so if you're not familiar
with the bubble blast series it's a game
where you burst bubbles to trigger a
chain reaction in order to eliminate all
the bubbles on the screen you only have
a fixed amount of attempts in order to
get this done for each level so here we
have this is very easy but you can see
we have one touch left and we have this
red little guy so we can just tap in and
I finished it so if if it took me more
than one shot I don't know how you can
mess that one up but then you would get
a redo so now we have two own so we'll
go ahead and press C they explode and
hit each other all right so now we have
a little more still pretty easy kind of
like warm-up rounds ok this is where it
starts to change up a bit now we have
these red guys and they actually take
two hits to explode so when they get hit
once they turn red and then they get hit
again and then they get eliminated
so it's kind of fun you get sort of a
satisfaction out of watching them
explode it can also get very frustrating
when you get into the more difficult
levels let's go ahead and try this there
we go all right so it looks like we have
some new bubbles here not only do we
have red and green but we also have
yellow and blue just like the green ones
the yellow one and the blue one take
extra hits to destroy so we'll go ahead
and try doing this we have three hits
remaining so let's see where should I
start there we go let's go to the next
level all right it looks like I'm not
going to get this one and here we have a
game over so you got to see what it
looks like when you can't complete and
the amount of touches left and we're at
level 27 so let's see how much more
difficult it is we have six touches left
we have red yellow green and blue
bubbles so we'll go ahead and try to
beat this level and we have two touches
left I don't think I'll be able to do it
looks like I'm gonna come up just short
but I think you get the picture so we'll
go back out of here and we'll try the
arcade mode now our K mode is much more
relaxed you can see we have ten touches
left and they sort of regenerate as you
break bubbles so see as I eliminate
bubbles it'll refill
I guess this is much more casual
there we go so I did beat that one
alright so this was a look at the newly
released bubble blast to version 1.0 for
android it's a completely separate game
from the previous one so you'll have to
search the android market for the free
download magma mobile like I said before
is going to release more levels with the
next update so stay tuned for that don't
