become official and you better get your
wallets ready rumors of the storage on
the iPhone 8 makes some of the details
hard to believe and we hear more of the
possible specs to get on the LGB 30 I'm
Jaime Rivera and I know this video is
late
you can blame all our Galaxy Note 8
coverage and this is PocketNow daily
the official news today start with the
LGV 30 probably one of the phones that
I'm waiting for most we've got famous
tipster Evan blast letting us know two
things number one that there is a logo
for the LGB 30 plus so that pretty much
said set in stone that there is an extra
variant the second is that the quad DAC
is not going to be exclusive to any
region on the case of the V 30 like it
was with the g6 pretty much like it was
with the B 20 where it didn't matter
where that phone launched you would get
the cream of the crop in features with
the whole plus variant rumors we don't
know exactly what the differences will
be and speaking of devices with
differences the Huawei made 10 is
another one of those phones that we're
waiting for and we've got some sources
that are claiming two things one is that
there are two variants and we actually
discussed that a few days ago the fact
that there was also a plus variant but
for those of you wondering what the
differences are apparently the plus is
not just going to be a larger huawei
mate 10 apparently we're getting a two
by one aspect ratio on this larger bait
10 and then in the case of the regular
mate 10 it's gonna be the regular
sixteen by nine and it makes sense I
mean we saw that with the porsche design
mate nine so yeah I hope this is not the
case I hope both phones get the features
but we'll see very soon now let's talk
about the iPhone 8 because the Galaxy
Note 8 rumours are done this time we
hear that KGI is predicting that Apple's
a hole sensing for 3d facial scanning as
so we should call it innovative that
Qualcomm is at least two years away from
catching up so yeah we know that
Qualcomm has been working on this
technology as well for facial
recognition and sensing rarely apples is
so great that not even Qualcomm can
catch up until 2019
obviously that is one thing we will have
to wait to prove until we get to hear
more about the iPhone 8 and since we
already started talking about the iPhone
8 why don't we go through the most crazy
rumors that we've seen today there's
this recent leak on Weibo that we're
gonna take with a grain of salt that
claims that the iPhone it is gonna come
in three storage tiers 64 gigs 256 and
then 512 gigabytes of storage and this
is kind of crazy I don't actually
believe these rumors are true mainly
because we've got MacBooks that don't
have that much storage and they're
beginner tiers or mid tiers
so it could be that we're wrong or that
iPhone with 512 gigabytes of storage is
going to be like 1500 bucks whatever the
case may be time will tell and finally
the very hot news they have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 it is now
official we were at the unpacked event
our hands-on video is live our
comparison with the iPhone 7 plus it's
live we've also got more videos coming
tomorrow and on Friday as we don't want
to publish everything today don't want
to drive everybody crazy with that but
we have a lot of great things to say
about this phone the design is gorgeous
the features that are coming regardless
of their conservative are not
necessarily bad ones I actually started
believing in the whole concept of
telephoto lens with the whole approach
that Samsung is providing not
necessarily saying that it's the best
but it's there obviously the s-pen is
something that I do miss this is not the
vanguard phone that will bring you the
cream of the crop in specs it's just
Samsung being conservative so it
actually leads me to the question today
I mean we've seen prices being published
for this phone nine hundred and sixty
dollars on Verizon 930 in other carriers
this is the first time ever that I have
ever seen a smartphone being priced so
high in its beginner 64 gigabyte tier
that is a lot of money so my question
today is would you be willing to pay for
it because in my case
oh my god I don't know it's it's a lot
of money and with phones out there like
the oneplus 5 it's just difficult I'm
not saying that the notes that the note
8 is not worth it I just want to know
what you think do you think it's worth
it leave us a comment down below
bradon's you know the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
video was filmed all the ones I'm
talking about are comment subscribe to
our channel as well for more videos like
this one it also follow me on twitter hi
my underscore to be better on instagram
but hi Mary better please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw I am hi Mary but I think so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow and yeah
