now Tony behind the camera we're still
at the HCC booth and we still have the
desire 816 and we're going to compare it
against the Galaxy Note 3 now off the
bat there is a substantial difference
between these two devices Sampson
pretends for the Galaxy Note 3 to be a
high-end business phone and HTC pretends
for the desire rate succeed to be a mid
tier device but if you look at them
honestly the size difference is not that
much I mean in the case of the age 16
you would have to be able to turn on the
display for me to tell you or show you
the difference where the display starts
and ends but honestly it's because of
the boom sound speakers that bring the
advantage of this HD 16 when compared to
the Galaxy Note 3 we know the Galaxy
Note 3 has terrible speakers then we
have you see the thickness obviously the
816 on the note 3 both have just the
same thickness you'll notice that even
though you can't replace the battery on
the 816 you do have expandable storage
up to 128 gigabytes in the case of
Desire X 16 you will have that
functionality on the note 3 obviously
what's the biggest difference here this
is Android 4.3 this would be Android 4.4
you do have a smaller battery at 2600
milliamp hours then 3200 million powers
here but again this is 4.4 KitKat and it
was designed with that mentality so it
should be a more efficient phone will
have more comparisons coming up from MWC
2014 with Tony behind the camera hi
never out of a pocket now thank you very
much for watching we'll see you would
more
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
