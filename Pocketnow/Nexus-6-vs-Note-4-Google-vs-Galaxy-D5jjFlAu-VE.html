on their Channel seriously what are you
waiting for get in on the action and
while you're there make sure to
subscribe they used to sit about as far
apart as two smartphones could but
Google's Nexus line and Samsung's Note
family now share at least two things in
common an affinity for oversized screens
and a pretty serious price tag
i'm michael fisher with pocket now find
out which is the better fit for you in
Google Nexus 6 vs Samsung Galaxy Note 4
this is a complicated comparison so
we're going to break it down into two
simple sections reasons to pick the note
for and reasons to go for the Nexus 6 a
spoiler alert
the first section is a little longer if
you've been following our note for
coverage you already know that we think
it's the smartphone that best makes use
of its phablet sized screen the Notes
multi window feature lets you do two or
more things at once whereas the Nexus 4
now confined you to a single full screen
app at a time the S Pen Stylus that
gives the note its name functions as
both mini smartphone Mouse and artistic
implement backed up by a digitizer that
registers up to two thousand levels of
pressure sensitivity beneath that sits a
display that's slightly smaller than the
Nexus S but which delivers more accurate
colors in super dim settings and
brighter a more readable text in super
bright ones the note 4 also features
Gorilla Glass 4 cover glass stronger
than the nexuses Gorilla Glass 3
it's been around past the sides beveled
aluminum magnesium on the note and
straight aluminum on the Nexus and
you'll find the note 4's backside comes
right off granting access to the
removable battery and expandable storage
you won't find any of that on the sealed
up Nexus nor will you find the bevy of
other pock marks on the notes casing the
added microphones for noise cancellation
the IR port for TV control the
fingerprint scanner on the home key the
blood oxygen heartbeat and UV sensor
that powers the s health suite the
Samsung brand name is synonymous with
feature overload and the note 4 is
probably the best example of that
mentality and all those features are
crammed into a casing that's narrower
and therefore easier to grip than the
Nexus both phones offer an optically
stabilized camera with the note 4 edging
out the Nexus in resolution on both
front and rear shooters the note 4 shots
are also better and if you're a fan of
color and contrast like we are the note
also takes full resolution shots in
sixteen by nine format compared to the
nexuses four to three that's not
necessarily superior but it does fit
most screens better
video winner goes to the note as well
with again enhanced color and contrast
and much faster autofocus
you may have noticed somewhat better
acoustic performance from the note in
those video comparisons and phone calls
follow that trend while our voice tests
have been closed callers have said they
prefer the note 4 for clarity and
background noise suppression another
point for Samsung the Nexus 6 isn't
taken all this lying down
Nach there are some reasons you might
choose Google's outsized offering over
Samsung's beginning with price comparing
unlocked pricing on AT&amp;amp;T the Nexus is
almost a hundred and fifty dollars
cheaper than the note 4 contract price
difference is less notable at 50 bucks
and while you sacrifice a lot of utility
for the savings you get software that's
much prettier in return stock Android
lollipop is gorgeous in its sherbert
simplicity much classier than Samsung's
conflicted at times gaudy touch wit and
since it's a nexus you get much faster
updates to the latest version as well as
qi wireless charging right out of the
box in case you're tired of being
tethered to wires all the time
you don't need the batwing logo in the
center of the finger dimple to remind
you that the Nexus 6 is a Motorola made
handset it's metal rim to polycarbonate
casing feels reassuringly sturdy and the
components within are coated with a
water repellent nano coating to prevent
splash damage the dual front firing
speakers aren't much louder than the
note 4's but their positioning is
world's better for obvious reasons
and Motorola's other specialty radio
design comes through loud and clear too
with new LTE band support its 4G
compatibility is essentially the best
you can find in the Android world
finally if you're a developer looking
for the best possible stock Android
sandbox for your efforts obviously an
unlocked Nexus 6 is going to serve you
much better than any other device and
that is after all how the Nexus family
got its start but this is a comparison
for consumers consumers who in our
experience like to get the most for
their dollar and for them it's tough to
recommend the Nexus 6 over the note for
the note brings so much added utility
that it's really more miniature tablet
than blown up smartphone its software
shortcomings are largely cosmetic and
can mostly be plastered over even if you
never use its extra features they're
there for the one or two times a year
they might come in handy and even with
all those features crammed in its
densely packed design makes the note
seem smaller than it really is
by contrast the Nexus 6 seems not only
oversized but oversized for no real
reason as we said in our review it's a
fine smartphone but it doesn't realize
the potential of its large frame nearly
as well as the note for that fundamental
confusion combines with the shortcomings
in display camera and extensibility to
make it the less finished the less
impressive of these two contenders
unless you're specifically looking for a
nexus lined device or you only want a
big screen if it's made it to simple
software the Galaxy Note 4 is probably
your better bet there's plenty to like
and dislike about each of these phablets
