but supposedly cheaper and smarter
apple's mobileme services can finally
become with we've all dreamed starting
with a free price tag and all the good
the bad and the ugly with the App
Store's new subscription services all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi Madeline and welcome to
the pocket now I review the show we go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the world of Apple's
iOS devices let's start this week off
with the cool well even though the Wall
Street Journal confirmed that Apple is
working on a smaller iPhone call it nano
or many along comes in New York Times
and says no wait it's not smaller it's
just cheaper not really sure what they
mean by cheaper meaning not really sure
if Apple's going to hinder built quality
in order to bring a more you know
competitive price to compete with
Android and the new windows phone 7
Nokia strategy but again we don't really
see Apple working on a nanodevice or a
larger screen four inch device because
apples always about developers remember
that they went from the whole hvga
display to rent a display just because
it was double the pixels and it would be
easier for developers to be able to port
absolutely new iOS device same thing
happened to the iPad so not really sure
we'll see smaller devices not really
sure what to expect with cheaper devices
but we do expect for Apple to compete
with better strategical price points
against competition we'll see what
happens now one of the things where the
New York Times did agree with the wall
street journal is the fact that Apple is
working on improving their voice control
services on iOS devices call this the
fact that Apple is demonstrating that
they're finally working on the Siri deal
that they made a couple of months ago
now not really sure what Apple can do
here because first of all I'd rather
they figure out and prove the volume on
the voice control services because I
could barely hear the machine but aside
from that it's really cool to see that
Apple will bring new services now
whoever does use voice control nowadays
not really sure what to expect there now
continuing on with those rumors it does
seem that Apple is working on dropping
the price tag on their mobile me
services we currently pay ninety nine
dollars for a service you get for free
on gmail Dropbox and a couple of other
services so
if this make all the sense in the world
that Apple figures out how to add this
added value through mobileme now one
cool thing is that they're finally
working on streaming music services
through mobileme to iOS devices as a
strategy to figure out how to not add
more flash storage to devices and just
have all the music in the cloud kind of
smart if you ask me and while the dev
team has recently upgraded their pottage
tool to version 4.2 to support on
tethered jailbreaks the iOS 4.2 point 1
what does this mean well if you
currently have a baseband on iOS 4.0
point2 and you can only unlock your
device on that baseband you can use the
pottage tool to update your device to
iOS 4.2 point one without upgrading that
baseband meaning you can keep the
current carrier unlock now considering
the fact that the dev team is taking a
whole lot of deal to figure out how to
unlock the current baseband to iOS 4.1
and 4.2 point one not really sure what
to expect but aside from that another
cool thing is that if you had issues
with ibooks and jailbreaks well the
pottage tool does fix this too and even
greenpoison on a recent update so really
cool news on the jailbreak site even
though we are waiting for the unlocks
again
well that does it for the cool that's
continuing on with the not so cool
Apple's new subscription services in the
App Store have cost a lot of controversy
because developers are not liking the
fact that Apple is already making the
thirty percent cut over applications and
now they want a thirty percent cut over
in app purchases now from a consumer
standpoint it's not really bad that you
don't have to leave the application to
purchase new content and we just like
for apple and you know subscription
developers to figure out what they do in
between now if you think about it the
kindle app is not sold within the app
store nor is the sony reader app and a
lot of apps that cell content within
applications but don't sell the app so
if it's apple's app store i would
consider it fair that apple does make a
little money from whatever is sold
within if the developer is not going to
be selling their services really wish
they could figure this out because then
again you know if developers don't
really like it they're still calling
apple a monopoly for the services and
think about it i mean you're not
obligated to sell or to buy an iphone or
to buy apps within the iphone it's a
choice so it's not a monopoly guys if
you don't like it then just go develop
stuff for android or you know just bite
the dust and while continuing on with
App Store money issues AT&amp;amp;T is just let
the cat out of the bag with USA Today by
stating that it's not fair that only
Apple makes money through the app store
that AT&amp;amp;T should make money with the App
Store to right now one thing that was
smart coming from AT&amp;amp;T CEO is the fact
that it's not really fair that you
purchase an app through apple's app
store and then if you want to use that
same app with an android app store you
can't do that you have to either use it
on Apple or use it on Android but pay
twice the only thing is he did mention
that we should buy the app in their
store which is one thing we don't like
so you know again guys if you can find a
cool strategy or if you did accept the
strategy at the beginning why complain
about it later now we don't have a too
proud Apple boasting over the verizon
iphone sales it's because the verizon
iphone cells that not go that well
and think about it I mean the device was
too little too late to the game and too
little too late to the tech it's last
year's technology trying to compete with
4G and so many other world phones and
the verizon market already again not
really sure what to expect with apple
and june but our biggest bet is that
apple's will revamp the AT&amp;amp;T device and
not the verizon device so i think it's
time for you to consider if you're
either going to stay with your device or
you know just bite the best with the
current verizon iphone or just go for
droid yeah i did say that that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
