smartphones of 2013 but despite the fact
that they each run Android they don't
have much in common so let's put them
head-to-head I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow
and this is Samsung Galaxy s4 vs. HTC
One not only do these smartphones differ
is statically they're also coming from
completely different places
philosophically HTC shut for a total
reinvention with the one making a phone
that looks nothing like last year's 1x
while Samsung stuck with what it knew
iterating only marginally from the
galaxy s3 we have a more detailed
analysis of the galaxy s4 in our full
review and you should follow us on
social media and here on YouTube so you
don't miss our continuing coverage of
this new flagship for this comparison
we're sticking to five areas build specs
UI camera and some test notes in terms
of build the differences between these
phones leap right out even with a
cursory glance the HTC one features an
aluminum chassis nine millimeters thick
tapering to four millimeters on the
sides with injected polycarbonate on the
back and a side to side display cutout
on the front combining with a beveled
edge and machined speaker holes to
create a smartphone that's
unapologetically almost brutally modern
its aluminium is smooth often cool to
the touch and it's 143 grams give it the
barest hint of heft in the hand it feels
like a well crafted luxury instrument
which in some ways it is by contrast the
galaxy s4 looks and feels like a modest
iteration over its predecessor the s4 is
more rounded with a much more subtle
feeling overall than the HTC One it
looks thicker from some angles but
that's an illusion caused by the full
width silver ring running the perimeter
of the casing the s4 is a mere seven
point nine millimeters in thickness
almost all the way across in the hand
it's 130 gram weight makes it so light
as to almost seem like a retail dummy
and the hyper glaze coating on the
polycarbonate gives it an almost tacky
feeling you're not as likely to drop the
s4 as you might be the smooth metal one
but you'll want to avoid dropping either
the soft metal chamfer on the one
is very susceptible to pitting on impact
and the glossy coating on the s4 picks
up scratches extremely easily neither of
these is rated for ruggedness what the
s4 lacks in design punch it makes up for
in other areas and that brings us into
specs the s4 s5 inch samih LED display
is larger than the ones 4.7 inch SLC d3
and it delivers richer colors and deeper
blacks its viewing angles aren't quite
as good though and it's a bit cooler
than the ones overall the size
difference isn't too noticeable in hand
despite Samsung's larger panel it's just
as usable with one hand as HTC's screen
due to the s4 s tiny bezels they're both
excellent 1080p displays kicking out
absurdly high pixel density at 468 PPI
for the HTC and 441 PPI for the Samsung
which one users personally prefer will
vary greatly
they're both top-tier displays them
beneath those screens there are some
similarities here while Samsung's Exynos
5 octa powers some versions of the
galaxy s4 our sprint version here sports
at Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 running at
1.9 gigahertz is slightly faster than
the Snapdragon 600 running at 1.7
gigahertz inside our sprint HTC One
there's 2 gigs of RAM on each phone but
storage options vary with the s4
offering 16 32 and 64 gigabyte variants
and microSD expansion up to an
additional 64 gigs while the HTC One
comes in either 32 or 64 gigs with no
microSD slot and while we're talking
about what is and isn't removable we
should mention that the 2300 milliamp
hour battery in the HTC One is embedded
smaller than the swappable 2600 milliamp
hour battery in the galaxy s4 a more
battery life commentary can be found in
the full review of each phone these
devices are both beastly in terms of
wrong numbers but the Galaxy s4 with its
removable battery expandable memory and
larger display will probably be a better
fit for the spec obsessed diving into
the software only highlights how
disparate these devices are HTC's Sense
5 overlay running atop android jelly
bean is a flat minimalistic skin
emphasizing grays and blacks with
add-ons like blinkfeed bringing a boxy
tile
feel we haven't seen before in Android
the UI is responsive to a fault with lag
very difficult to induce the TouchWiz
skin running on the Galaxy s4 is once
again less a total rewrite more a minor
tweak Samsung's bright and colourful
software design persists in the new
TouchWiz and while it's normally just as
responsive as we've come to expect from
Samsung we did pick up a stutter here
and there it's nothing that makes the s4
particularly unpleasant to use but there
might be some optimisation that has yet
to happen here truthfully the more
annoying thing about TouchWiz is how
rapidly its aging its cartoonish style
really needs a revamp of course Samsung
is the king of added features and the s4
is no exception some features like
airView are actually quite handy and
make a lot of sense
others like air gesture are a little
less polished and fall more on the
gimmicky side of things at both the one
and the s4 offer remote control
applications to control home media
centers and TVs and so on but Samsung
really goes the extra mile with its
watch on integration and it's obviously
making a more serious content play than
HTC if an expanded suite of apps and
services is important to you the Galaxy
s4 will be the way to go if you value a
smartphone experience with very refined
very modern software design though the
one is a better choice in terms of
optics these devices take a different
approach to delivering quality photos
the HTC One S 4 megapixel camera is low
on resolution but it's ultra pixel
design with optical image stabilization
allows it to capture 300% more light for
nighttime shots
HTC has also rethought what a gallery
should look like and implemented new
sharing features with the one which we
covered in an earlier video samsung has
taken the more conventional approach as
chewing fancy buzzwords for a simple
bumpin resolution to 13 megapixels from
last year's standard 8 it's also
revamped its viewfinder software porting
some innovations from the Galaxy camera
like the shooting mode menu and adding
fun features like drama shot and
animated photo the results are good on
each side the Galaxy S 4 delivers photos
with higher saturation both indoors and
out and of course their resolution is
much
allowing for greater zoom ability though
the camera packs a 13 megapixel sensor
it's important to note that the default
shooting mode can find photos too 9.6
megapixels that's to preserve a 16 to 9
aspect ratio so that's the setting we
used for most of our testing period the
camera took a little longer to focus
than we're used to a problem exacerbated
by how light and easy to shake the phone
is and it didn't always launch as
quickly as the camera on the one also
low-light performance wasn't anywhere
near as good and the front-facing camera
can't compare it with the wide-angle
lens on the one but for photos you can
print without much worry or pictures you
want to zoom in real close on the galaxy
s4 will probably be the better choice
and either way you go video performance
is great check out our full review of
each of these devices as well as our
comparison features at pocket now for
more photo analysis in terms of everyday
use the ups and downs continue the one
is excellent at noise cancellation and
voice calls taken over the earpiece and
the boom sound speakers provide an
outstanding loudspeaker calling
experience as well those front firing
speakers definitely outclassed the
Galaxy s4's
single rear mounted unit the difference
isn't so much about loudness the Samsung
has boosted the output on the s4 speaker
and it's actually quite loud rather the
difference comes in sound quality the
forward placement and the stereo effect
of the widely placed speakers on the one
it's the best audio experience we've had
on a smartphone performance in other
sectors is roughly on par at launch
times are comparable and reception seems
about even between the two devices on
Sprint's Network though Sprint's 4G
network in Boston really needs some work
and speed and reliability over all the
ones software is more responsive but the
galaxy s4 counters by offering more of
the interface features we mentioned
before some are more useful than others
but they're there if you want them each
of these devices runs one of the newest
builds of Android it's the same OS under
there but you wouldn't know it based on
how thoroughly HTC and Samsung have
modified it in very different ways if
you want more features than you can
possibly use an expandable memory
capacity and swappable battery in the
lightest possible package with one of
the biggest
screens on the market and feature
compatibility with the rest of Samsung's
Galaxy family the Galaxy s4 is the phone
for you
if you're looking for a slightly
different feature set emphasizing a
slick UI very cool camera features
excellent voice performance and the best
audio we've heard from a handheld all
encased in a shell that's more art than
phone the HTC One is the way to go
either way you'll be getting one of the
best smartphones Android has to offer
that's gonna do it for now folks but we
have a whole lot more galaxy s4 content
at pocketnow.com and also here on
youtube so like I said earlier follow us
subscribe to us throw us a like if you
enjoyed the video drop us a comment if
you have something to say and thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
