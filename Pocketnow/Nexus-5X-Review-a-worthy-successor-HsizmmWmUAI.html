build the original Nexus 5 that was
bigger than the prior year's Nexus 4
which was also made by LG but wasn't
overly large in the hand it was a phone
for the masses and was relatively well
received in 2014 some say that Google
jumped the shark offering a phablet
instead of a smartphone a move that many
felt was abandoning the diehard
supporters of the Nexus phone this year
Google released two Nexus phones a
phablet to follow up the Nexus 6 from
last year and what many are calling a
return to its roots with the Nexus 5x
did LG build a phone worthy of the Nexus
5 name I'm Joe Levi with PocketNow and
this is our video review of the Nexus 5x
the first thing you'll notice when you
take the Nexus 5x out of its box is just
how light it is at 136 grams it's
slightly heavier than the original Nexus
5 but only slightly it feels like
because we've become accustomed to
bulkier and heavier phones specifically
184 gram behemoths of last year's Nexus
6 the Nexus 5 doesn't support the
aluminum and glass that many of this
year's flagship slot instead almost is a
throwback to two years ago the 5x uses
some matte polycarbonate and one of
three colors Carbon quartz and ice the
edges feature a subtle chamfer that
we've seen on other Nexus devices which
provides just the right amount of grip
without getting in the way of looks the
Nexus 5x isn't a particularly small
phone but it's not big either it's
easily pocketable and can be held
securely even in petite hands it's a
little taller than the previous model
but we don't think you'll mind other
than the color the Nexus 5 comes in two
configurations 16 gig and 32 gig with
the latter asking a $50 premium over the
$379 price of the base model we think
the 32 gig version is
well worth the cost to upgrade on the
front of the phone is a 5.2 inch screen
under slab of Gorilla Glass 3 with a
resolution of 1080 by 1920 the pixel
density is an impressive 423 PPI though
this is slightly lower than the original
Nexus 5 thanks to improvements in screen
technology color saturation deep blacks
and overall sharpness make the screen on
the 5x very crisp and clear bright when
it needs to be and able to accurately
replicate colors even in sunlight and in
the dark with the brightness turned down
low some reviewers disagree with this
sentiment when compared to the Nexus 6p
but while those conclusions may be
accurate they're also somewhat unfair
the average user won't be dissatisfied
with the screen on the Nexus 5x at all
on top of the phone is a single
microphone port to the right is the
power button above the volume rocker on
the left is the nano SIM slot at the
bottom is another microphone port the
headphone jack and the all-new USB
type-c port the front of the phone also
has an ambient light sensor handset
speaker front firing speakers third
microphone and a tricolor notification
LED that although it's disabled by
default can easily be turned on to the
settings unlike other Nexus devices
despite having two speaker grilles it's
only got one front firing speaker the
sound it produces is loud clear but
doesn't have the encompassing volume
that we've heard on other necks it's on
the back where things get really
exciting for the first time a Nexus
device has a fingerprint scanner which
Google refers to as Android imprint it's
situated near the top of the phone where
the dimple on last year's Nexus 6 and
some of Motorola's other phones can be
found also on the back is the reflective
Nexus logo with a fairly prominent LG
branding oh and the main camera too
as you'd expect with carrying a phone
with a nexus label the 5x runs pure
Android the way Google intends it the
bells and whistles are all stock but
sometimes it's the simplicity the lack
of superfluous features which only
serves to pad a spec sheet that makes
something truly elegant such is the case
with Android 6.0 marshmallow on the
Nexus 5 with marshmallow google
continues his foray into active display
pushing rich but black and white
notifications to the screen rather than
relying on a notification LED to get
your attention
unlike previous generations of Nexus
phones that may have had an LED here
access to your LED is tucked neatly
inside the sound of notification
settings Android pay also makes its
debut as a pre-loaded application on the
Nexus 5 replacing Google Wallet which
has been a staple of the Nexus brand
since it came out on the Nexus S in 2011
in the new - Nexus thread Google picked
the Nexus 5 as the first device to
officially support the aforementioned
Android imprint fingerprint scanning and
security subsystems other OEMs beat
Google to the punch offering many of the
same features of Android imprint though
in separate proprietary ways the
fingerprint scanner on the back of the
Nexus 5 is perfectly located and as easy
to find and use after just a few times
to get oriented with where it is and how
it works now does it work I think very
well very fast
I've only encoded two of my fingers so
far both my index fingers and
recognition is all but instantaneous
with a very high accuracy rate when your
finger is scanned at an odd angle or
even upside down the software is smart
enough to match your finger and still
manages to quickly unlock the phone
turning on the Nexus 5 is particularly
easy using the fingerprint scanner
simply rest your finger on the scanner
and your screen is turned on and your
phone is unlocked faster than you can
raise it to look at it in addition to
all that Android 6.0 marshmallow brings
now on tap a renewed permissions model
volume controls that finally work right
and an intelligent do-not-disturb
function that does
exactly what it's supposed to do we
covered all these in more detail in our
Nexus 6p review and since they're
functionally equivalent on the Nexus 5x
there's no need to repeat all that over
here for the last two generations of
Nexus phones quality of pictures taken
has been at the top of the priority list
though last year's Nexus 6 had a decent
camera it wasn't great that honor is
reserved for the Nexus 5 the main
shooter on the Nexus 5 is housed in the
slight bump on the back of the phone
which looks a lot bigger in pictures
than it actually is in real life it
features a twelve point three megapixel
sensor and an F 2.0 aperture and broad
spectrum CRI 90 dual flash hawai ass
wasn't included because google claims
that the larger pixel size and IR laser
assisted autofocus negate the need
moving around to the front at five
megapixels and an F 2.0 aperture the
front-facing selfie camera isn't
anything to scoff at either despite
being a technically capable camera the
camera on the Nexus 5 seems to be
unreachable at times it doesn't like to
rotate once the camera app is fired up
and is overall problematic and slow
there was an update for the Nexus 5x
that had begun rolling out which was
thought to address some of these issues
but our review unit hasn't gotten the
update as we went to press when it
behaves however the pictures in the
video the Nexus 5 produces are nothing
short of beautiful on the whole it
produces amazing pictures even in low or
dark light when it comes to video the
Nexus 5x can shoot 4k at 30 frames per
second and can capture slow-motion at
120 frames per second well walk and see
how this does Halloween time so we got
our decorations coming out this camera's
up sides far outweigh its negatives and
that's something we've never been able
to say about the camera on any other
Nexus of course the Nexus 6p
notwithstanding which happens to use the
same camera module as the Nexus 5x
we've used the Nexus 5x for about a week
in the Greater Salt Lake City Utah area
on the t-mobile network what's nice
about a phone marketed is compatible
with virtually any network though is
that switching carriers is literally as
easy as swapping Sims and the Nexus 5x
should work with virtually any of the
major carriers overall the phone is fast
than responsive in fact for the first
few days the Nexus 5x performed faster
and smoother than any other phone we've
reviewed in Utah offices however over
the last few days it's begun to pick up
and stutter upon investigation when
waking the phone seems to max out the
CPU cores for a short amount of time
slowing everything down whether this is
the natural consequence of doze mode
pulling in a handful of updates all at
once when you power on the phone or the
64-bit hexa core 1.8 gigahertz
Snapdragon 808 processor showing its
limitations well we're not certain most
of the time this has just been
frustrating but occasionally it has
required a reboot to get things back on
track next up is battery life which has
been pretty good on a full charge of the
2700 milliamp battery which takes under
two hours using the included charger and
USB type-c cable the Nexus 5x should
last you all day and most of the evening
before dropping the battery saving mode
at about 15% the Nexus 5x doesn't
include Qualcomm quick charge but it
does support USB type-c rapid charging
off the phone back on the charger for 10
minutes you'll get almost four more
hours of use to achieve this you'll need
to use the included charger or one of
you compatible replacements however if
you have access to a USB type-a 2 USB
type-c cable which isn't included you'll
still be able to use your old chargers
they just won't charge as quickly as the
one that comes in the box there are a
few t-mobile specific issues that
haven't been worked out just yet those
and the unexplained processor
utilization issue or minor
inconveniences but they're still
troubling on a new smartphone especially
one carrying the Nexus name brand we'll
keep an eye on them and report back when
the Nexus 5 gets hour after the buzz
treatment
we feel obliged to remind potential
buyers that the old adage about getting
what you pay for if you want a
top-of-the-line flagship the Nexus 6p is
a better Buy if you've got the money and
you don't mind the phablet form factor
the 5x is no show horse it's the phone
you toss around without worrying about
scratching it up the one you buy because
it's a good deal not because it's
delivering a premium experience that
having been said the Nexus 5x is very
much like its 2013 predecessor in that
it delivers a lot of capability for a
very competitive price point and it
manages to do so while still looking
fairly sharp at $379 us the Nexus 5x is
a tremendous value for the price it's
big enough to be functional small enough
to be pocketable and is everything
you've come to expect from the Nexus
brand for pocket now I'm Joe Levi catch
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
