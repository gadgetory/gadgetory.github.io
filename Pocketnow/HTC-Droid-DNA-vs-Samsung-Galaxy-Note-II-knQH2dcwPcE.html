their biggest beefiest droid yet the
Droid DNA from HTC almost immediately
folks out in the blogosphere started
drawing comparisons between it and
Samsung's largest handheld the Galaxy
Note 2 well we're still getting to know
the droid DNA and a full review is
forthcoming but right now even though
they're in completely different device
categories we're going to do a quick
face-off
to show you what's the same and what's
different between these two goliaths in
three categories feel screen and
performance I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is the HTC Droid DNA
versus the Samsung Galaxy Note 2
ok so first like they say in the song
let's get physical
one of HTC's big points at the unveiling
was that the Droid DNA is not a phablet
and while it may be tough to illustrate
on camera
that's certainly evident if you hold one
in your hand in brief the Galaxy Note 2
feels like a convergence device that is
to say it feels like a phablet it's very
tall at 151 millimeters and very wide at
80 millimeters it also tips the scales
at 182 grams the Droid DNA is smaller in
almost every dimension 141 millimeters
tall by 70 point 5 millimeters wide and
in those dimensions where it's not
smaller
it feels smaller the DNA is
three-quarters of a millimeter thicker
than the note 2 but it tapers on the
sides to just four millimeters thin that
coupled with the crescent shaped body
design and very manageable 138 gram
weight in the hand makes it feel
wonderfully petite in short the DNA
looks and feels much more like a
smartphone than the note 2 because
that's the unvarnished truth the note 2
with its s-pen added bulk and wider
display feels much more like the phablet
it is whether one of the other is better
in this respect is up to you
but one thing is indisputable the Droid
DNA is not a phablet moving on to the
screen the huge selling point of the
droid DNA HTC's product packs a 5-inch
1080p Super LCD 3 at 440 PPI while the
Galaxy Note 2 offers a 5.5 inch 720p
Super AMOLED at 265 PPI the note 2
screen of course also packs that Wacom
digitizer that enables the s-pen but
what most people are really concerned
with in this case is the resolution they
want to know does the added resolution
of the 1080p display actually add to the
experience on the DNA and the answer is
yes I personally didn't see the point of
1080p displays on smartphones for a long
time I argued screen sizes were too
small to be able to see the differences
but and this won't read on the camera
I'm using I'm sorry I was wrong
the icons and text on the Droid DNA are
substantially sharper and clearer than
on the galaxy note 2 in person I'll go
ahead and swipe to an almost empty
screen here you won't be able to see the
difference but there is substantially
more detail on the space shuttle on the
right that's the Droid DNA then there is
on the galaxy note 2 on the left even
though the screen size on the galaxy
note 2 is substantially larger you do
have to get close to see it but the
difference is there the Droid DNA's
panel is truly remarkable another thing
you can hopefully see is the color
difference here with the note twos Super
AMOLED screen really amping up that
saturation and this is even in standard
display mode while the DNA keeps things
much more even much more true to life on
its s LCD 3 that as I assume drew to
life I have not been to space yet the
Galaxy Note 2 is powered by an EXO nose
4412 quad-core cpu running at 1.6
gigahertz based on the cortex a9
architecture the Droid DNA includes a
crate based Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro
running at 1.5 gigahertz also quad-core
what does this mean for performance well
here's how the benchmarks turned out in
quadrant standard the Droid DNA got a 7
8:44 while the galaxy note2 got a 6186
in antutu benchmark the Droid DNA scored
14 at 5:14 where the Galaxy Note 2
scored 13 5 to 9 in Linpack single
thread the Droid DNA scored a 191 point
eight three eight galaxy note 2 64 point
four three eight Linpack multi thread
droid DNA for 64 point six four six
galaxy note 2 one fifty two point nine
sixteen in smart bench twenty twelve the
Droid DNA scored 46 77 the galaxy note 2
46 44 and finally in SunSpider where
lower is better the Droid DNA scored 11
forty eight point three galaxy note 2 10
forty one point eight so the Droid DNA
beats the note2 pretty handily on most
of these stats possibly because of the
crate versus cortex architecture but
listen before you go gloating or moping
in the comments in everyday benign usage
there's really not much difference in
fluidity between these two devices and
that's actually quite significant in
this case I mean of course swiping on a
launcher or pulling down a notification
shade isn't a challenging activity for a
processor as powerful as either of these
but listen here the Samsung's TouchWiz
has been fast for a long time but HTC
Sense has historically been a very heavy
Android skin while we've always liked
its aesthetics we don't usually like the
performance cost it demands in return
but so far on the Droid DNA that hasn't
been an issue at all and that's a great
thing
pardon our Nokia wireless charging dock
propping up the devices to fight the
glare a little bit here we're not going
to get into gaming in this quick faceoff
but just like we did in our DNA vs lg
optimus G video which you should watch
if you haven't yet we're going to do
just a couple app launches to see if we
can spot a difference in load time I
kind of doubt it first off is camera we
would like to make sure we can take that
special shot when the opportunity arises
one two three boom Wow basically an
ident
buuut time on on each of those right
around one second let's go ahead and
jump into email the stock email app on
each one two three
very nice there that is clear that
before we see anything interesting and
just to make things a little spice here
let's go to a third-party app like
Instagram one two three once again
substantially the same on each and
finally let's go ahead and do the web
browser one two three stock browser on
each there should be a fresh load we're
not testing loading speed one of these
is on LTE one of them is on Wi-Fi just
checking to see how well the browser
renders things boom well both pages
loaded very quickly on each of their
respective connections now if we have a
look on the note two we can kind of
double tap here to zoom in and we get
that really fast responsiveness it
clears up in a little less than a second
so you double tap to zoom and boom there
that is and see ya in less than a second
after zooming and we get the
pixelization is gone the text is clear
it's not going to be as clear as that
1080p text was we'll see in a second but
really really solid performance there
nothing nothing to scream about and our
site isn't the smallest I mean look at
all that we got a lot of graphics we got
a lot of columns here there's a lot
going on on some animated elements up
here etc the note 2 handles it with a
plumb hop on into the droid DNA same
thing same kind of one-to-one
responsiveness on the finger do a little
double tap there we get text reflow in
the stock HTC browser which is a little
bit different that's been removed from
the Samsung stock browser not really
sure why we go ahead and zoom in there
really really solid of recomposes the
browser page once again and a little
less than a second really really
excellent responsiveness really
beautiful text tough to see from your
point of view but in person really
really sharp performance there and
finally just to load a third-party app
that does require a little bit more
thinking on the processors part though
admittedly not much because it's a very
old game Duke Nukem 3d one two three
boom
there's startup animations on each we're
not gonna play the game this is just a
blue test look at that neck-and-neck
there we go the Droid DNA just a little
bit behind we'll go ahead and leave both
what do you know comparable performance
the game load times were within one
second of each other not going to call
that a solid victory or loss for either
of these devices there's a lot more to
these devices like the camera and the
battery life and so on and so forth but
we really won't know more about the
Droid DNA until we've done our full
review so watch for that now I know a
lot of you folks like spec comparisons
and peeing matches and seeing who's
better than whom so forth and these are
both really really high and really well
performing devices from two completely
different product categories and we have
yet to form a full opinion on the Droid
DNA but it's safe to say at this point
that people choosing between a note 2
and a DNA are going to be looking at
usability factors and how each meets
their own specific needs and whether
they need a phablet or a smartphone not
at which one is better
quote-unquote that's gonna do it for
this quick comparison of the Galaxy Note
2 to the HTC Droid DNA make sure and
stay tuned to pocket now so you don't
miss our full review of the Droid DNA
coming very soon follow us on Twitter so
you don't miss that pocket now tweets is
the official account if you want to
follow me I'm at captain 2 phones it's
captain the number two phones but make
sure you throw us a thumbs up here on
