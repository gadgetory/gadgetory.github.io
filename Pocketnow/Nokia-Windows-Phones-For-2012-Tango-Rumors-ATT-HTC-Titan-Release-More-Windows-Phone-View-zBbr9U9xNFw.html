the first half of 2012 Windows Phone
tango already gets leaked to the masses
and the AT&amp;amp;T HTC Titan is now available
for sale all this and more coming up
right now hello everyone I'm hi everyone
with Parker now calm and welcome to
Windows Phone view the show we wrap up
all this week's good and bad inside the
world of Microsoft's Windows Phone
platform let's start this week off
what's good as we do every week let's
begin today's coverage with the nokia
microsoft partnership so far rumors have
it the nokia is scheduled to bring new
windows phones on the first half of 2012
we've had a lot of really good leaks
coming from nokia this year and like we
mentioned last week for example the
Lumia 601 seems to be a really
compelling device so we'll have a lot to
talk about we're all not really sure of
Nokia's planning to release these phones
in the US at the same time interesting
is the fact that we already have leaks
of what we could expect for Windows
Phone tango we're just plan to be on
cheaper budget device so could this be
part of the nokia microsoft partnership
time will tell speaking of nokia lots of
people were skeptical the Lumia 800
would ever be a hit and the answer that
was quite simple the phone sold out in
every store in the UK on the first week
of sales that's just to give you an idea
of how things are things are going so
well for nokia they're even planning an
event in the UK when they're going to
turn the Milbank tower into a little
gigantic live tile phone so make sure
you catch all the coverage next Monday
of everything that happens on this event
because definitely the Lumia 800 is a
hit so far in Europe and hey speaking of
the Nokia Lumia 800 make sure you don't
miss our weeks coverage of our full
review of the device which is now live
we all know that Adams both an avid
Windows Phone fan and also at the same
time a tougher viewer so far the device
scored 4 stars out of 5 so if you want
to know why the device lost the full
star in the review from Adam make sure
you catch the link of the description
for details on the full review out of
the smartphone releases for the week
you'll be happy to know that the ATT
variant of the HTC Titan is already
available on sale hit the link of the
description for our flurry of the device
because the ratings were really good
obvious
that Titanic displays not for everyone
so read the full review and think about
it this device is for you the lge 906
Jil Sander windows phone also went on
sale on the UK for around 450 bucks
which is a lot less than what we'd
expected for a signature smartphone so
watch up on that and well the acer
Allegro device that were recently had a
time to play around with an atom's
recent video of the Windows Phone launch
event in New York City is now available
in certain countries in Europe so if
you're interested on that device it
looks quite compelling so make sure you
catch that up in Europe one of the
things we must commend Microsoft
manufacturers and carriers is all the
effort they're putting in getting
windows phones in the hands of everybody
so far this year on Black Friday we saw
it windows phones for free after a
two-year contract we also saw some xbox
live games for sale and also a lot of
zune music in the marketplace available
almost for free so it's really cool to
see that Microsoft has changed their
strategy for all of us that come from
the old days of Windows Mobile remember
windows mobile it was pretty much
abandoned by Microsoft and now we see
them doing all they can to put the
platform everywhere and that's really
good to see them becoming really
aggressive with their platform so far so
good it's great to see you guys putting
up a fight
that is it for what's good let's
continue on with what's bad well it
seems that recently some HTC windows
phones are having a hard time keeping
their Wi-Fi mac addresses in one place
you know that long code that's unique to
each Wi-Fi product on a network well
obviously it becomes a problem if you
have a block network for specific
devices and your device doesn't really
keep the same address becomes an issue
so it seems that HTC is working on it
though we don't know which devices are
specific to it or when we're going to
get a software update other recent news
have nokia already working in as many as
two software updates to fix a lot of the
battery issues on the lumia 800 so we
couldn't agree more with them let's just
hope that the release is up whenever
they can and also to end the bad news it
seems that Nokia already came on record
to tell everybody that they won't be
offering their nokia drive service to
other manufacturer devices which kind of
makes sense because first of all you
don't see the HTC hub on every other
smart phone from samsung it it makes
sense it's just sad news for everybody
because obviously we won't get the
benefit that's it for today's show thank
you very much for watching I'm hi many
better remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now
