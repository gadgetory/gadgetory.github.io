now and after two months since the
official release of HTC sense 3.6 with
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich t-mobile
finally shares that love with sensation
4g customers there are a lot of really
good changes in this update so let's
talk about them even if this is HTC's
flagship device from last year and also
the predecessor to the HTC One S the
sensation 4g is still a worthy contender
to a lot of current android devices
sadly people weren't fond of since three
point 0 because of the excessive
animations and the bottom dock selector
which you couldn't customize in any way
since three point six changes all this
and the upgrade is really something you
shouldn't ignore at the moment you most
likely won't get an automatic
notification of the upgrade so simply go
into settings navigate to about phone
then HTC software updates and hit check
now the update will take a couple of
minutes so make sure you have enough
coffee and yeah I'd wreck about three of
these once the upgrade is finished sense
3.6 may definitely not be since four
point oh but that may be a good thing
for many of you it retains a lot of the
great android 4.0 elements that many
wish since four-point-oh had kept so the
UI is fluid and much more efficient than
since four point oh even if it's running
on the HTC One X with all its horsepower
gone now was the dock with the permanent
personalized button that you rarely used
in the past and now you have a similar
dock to what stock Ice Cream Sandwich
provides where you can customize the
buttons however you want the
applications launcher still feels like
HTC in a lot of ways which is sort of
gingerbread leg with the vertical
scrolling but the tabs for favorites and
downloads are always very welcome
features that you don't find on stock
ICS like and since three point oh three
point six also includes the same ring to
unlock feature and the applications that
are unlocked features now mimic the same
dark applications that you've selected
in the home screen a rather unfortunate
problem is that even though stock ICS
allows you to disable applications that
you don't want or cannot install
t-mobile block this feature even though
HTC sense 3.6 on devices like the vivid
on a TNT duel
it may not bother many of you but Teemo
will include so much local or on this
device it would have been a really nice
feature to keep speaking of the vivid
the sense 3.6 upgrade included beats
audio software for that device which was
sadly omitted on the upgrade for the
sensation 4g I'll tell you something
though the SRS enhancement in the music
player is hands-down great even on the
low end headphones included so I don't
think you'll be missing out on much
another disappointment is in widgets I'm
a big fan of tons of HTC Sense widgets
but sadly you can't resize them on sense
3.6 and stock ICS widgets like mail
weren't included as an option for those
other widgets from HTC sense that you
can't resize speaking of mail you don't
get the stock ICS version of the service
nor the sense four-point-oh version that
we really liked this mail application is
good and has a lot of really neat
filters but sadly it's kind of dated in
my opinion an interesting note though is
that even though since four-point-oh
doesn't include the recently launched
applications in the drop menu since 3.6
does as a way to multitask still just
press and hold the home button and
you'll get the stock ICS app switcher
which is preferred by many people since
3.6 also retains the old keyboard from
previous versions of HTC Sense which is
also a really great advantage because it
doesn't include the navigation keys at
the bottom which take up a lot of real
estate and yes you still get swype
functionality here the camera UI hasn't
changed though which is rather
unfortunate since the camera could
pretty much resemble the hardware
included on the HTC One series and
there's really no reason to not fit the
software with the same functionality
overall sense 3.6 and android 4.0 on the
tmobile HTC Sensation 4G is a dramatic
improvement in performance and
functionality when compared to the
previous version surely this is no HTC
One S in strength design elements like
thinness for example but it does make
the experience worthy enough of keeping
a one year old device like the sensation
4g for another year while the next HTC
One successor comes out to the market
thats it for our video walkthrough of
HTC sense 3.6 running on the tmobile
sensation 4g you like the update or then
like it at all please leave us a comment
down
loen he was a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw this is kinda to be better
from parking now thank you very much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
