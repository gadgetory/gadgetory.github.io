ipad air 3 and what might not be
included other reports claim that one
plus is out to launch another device and
the SU shows us how optical zoom should
be done on a mobile camera I'm hi Mary
vera and dealing with hard times just do
what I do and drink it off this is
parking out daily the official news
begin with Netflix as the company
continues to figure out ways to make
those nine dollars worth you coming back
as the company has just announced a new
streaming method and encoding feature
that they were working on in order to
number one adapt each film for your
device and for the bandwidth that you
have and second for that all to match
and not give you a cumbersome experience
going forward this should mean better
Netflix watching in the future if only
we had unlimited data plans to actually
take advantage of that how about that
Netflix other official news come from
assumes as the company has just teased
all the mechanisms and the beauty behind
how the zenfone zoom works we're
actually expecting to see this phone at
CES 2016 were actually all going to be
there and for those of you that remember
that whole periscope lens for optical
zoom feature that Apple patented a while
ago well it seems that a sooz is going
to bring that technology with this
camera and we can't wait to tell you
more as soon as we see it and speaking
of Apple if you're in the market for a
new iPad we would wait if we were us
we've got trusted sources claiming that
the ipad air 3 is slated for the first
half of 2016 and if you trust the rumors
that the iphone 6c and Apple watch 2
will be announced in march then expect
that iPad to be announced there as well
now the only thing is that apparently
there won't be any 3d touch of this
tablet because apparently apple supplier
won't be able to make that happen so we
wonder what exactly will change here and
the cool thing about this being the end
of the year is that certifications are
up and we get to see what phones will
look like starting with the HTC One X 9
which we assume to be the m10 or well we
don't know exactly what we're getting
here but we get dual stereo speakers
we've got a very interesting design here
the only thing is that there doesn't
seem to be any USB type-c on this device
apparently they're going to continue
with micro USB and hey it's either going
to be CES for mwc as usual where we'll
learn more about their future flexion
and finally the very hot rumors today
come from one plus as we've got leaked
specification showing us a one plus two
mini and listen to this four point six
inch 1080p display in addition to four
gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage
apparently these specs could be wrong
but then again we wonder we've got the
1+2 we've got the oneplus X where would
this one plus two mini fit in the price
range is going to be a pricier phone or
not as some of the specs are actually
even better than the one plus two so it
does lead me to the question of the day
what would you think about this one plus
too many would you be willing to buy
this product particularly with its
specifications in my case I would but
then again I'm starting to like larger
phones leave us a comment down below
what would you do friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
nose earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on
bugging out comment subscribe to youtube
channel as well it follow me on twitter
highmount recording better on instagram
at high memory better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am I never even thank you very
much for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
