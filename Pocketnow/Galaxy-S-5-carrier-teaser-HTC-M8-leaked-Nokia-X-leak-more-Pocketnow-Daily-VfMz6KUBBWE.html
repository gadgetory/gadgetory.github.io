Senate pages ahead from even being
announced the HTC m8 is shown off in
photos and it's shinier than expected
and Huawei teases products that
according to them will revolutionize mwc
I'm huynh every that I and the
revolutionary that I need is a private
jet to save me 24 hours of flying to
Barcelona this is out daily
let's firstly off but not with any
official news as we're just a week away
from mwc so rumors are the big thing
right now and why is one of them they're
teasing two products one is a smartphone
with a revolutionary front facing camera
and then another one is a tablet with a
revolutionary front facing media
experience which will most probably be
front firing speakers and according to
them these will be better than samsung
and apple products so we would like to
see that let's see what we get at mwc up
next we have nokia as hey this is a new
microsoft company and we are expecting
to see a lot of mwc microsoft focus but
but we have our leaks from famous
tipster a bleak showing us the nokia
normandy which is now being officially
dubbed or should I say unofficially
because it's still a neat but nokia X
and it says there in the banner it's the
nokia X we just don't really know what
it runs we assume that it's running
Android and we see the phone painted in
green then we have no key opinion and
green all over in their facebook page so
we are expecting for this to be their
first android phone but it's such an
irony being that this time it is a
Microsoft company so hey we'll see what
we get here now let's go through some of
the hilarious news as no we haven't seen
the galaxy s5 you haven't seen it either
there are no leaks on this phone and all
we're waiting for mwc is an event to go
through touch with 5 which is what we
assume in that really a gs5 but hey 02
in germany is already opening a sign-up
page for all of you interested in the
phone and since we haven't really seen
it yet it's not announced yet how
exactly do you know if you really want
this phone now leave us a comment do you
want it already now one of the products
that we are looking forward to is the
successor to the experience have let Z
from Sony this was probably one of the
best tablets that we saw last year
waterproof great specifications great
performance and a very simplistic you I
we are already hearing that sony is
preparing for its successor which will
be dubbed apparently the z2 and what we
have here is pretty much just the bump
and specifications but a thinner tablet
if that's even possible so hopefully we
will see this at mwc we'll see and
finally for the hot news of the day we
get more leaked photographs of the HTC
m8 and this time it doesn't look like a
photoshop job it looks kind of real we
do see the dual cameras we do see the
dual flash and this is very interesting
it's got this new polish on the back
that looks kind of hot aside from the
fact that apparently this phone will be
made all out of metal and no plastic
bars anywhere which is really
interesting and there are some
conflicting rumors but apparently these
photos are of the HTC m8 mini which
would be even more interesting if they
kept the specifications but that they do
to the question of the day are you
bothered by the fact that HTC is keeping
the same design as last year because in
my particular case I'm not I actually
did want the HTC One and the only reason
why I didn't get it was because of the
camera so if they do improve all these
things I do want the m8 but he was a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is spelled mushy follow us on
pocketnow.com it's the scripture youtube
channel as well you'll also follow me on
twitter Jaime underscore Rivera please

what you saw I am he married Anna thank
