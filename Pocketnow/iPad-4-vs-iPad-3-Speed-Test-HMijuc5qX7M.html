pocketnow.com Apple claims that the iPad
4 is 2 times faster than the iPad 3 you
know we're gonna put the claim to the
test so let's do a comparison in this
video now when we reviewed the iPad 3
and it really wasn't too long ago right
we said that the iPad 3 was about the
same speed in terms of opening apps and
web browsing performance as the iPad 2
which was kind of a good thing but it
was a little bit laggy at times when
doing a lot of heavy web browsing and
launching intense apps and so forth that
was because the the iPad 3 has the same
chip as the iPad 2 just with more GPU
cores in the case of the iPad 4 Apple
put the a6x chip in there so it's a
similar chip to what is found in the
iPhone 5 but it has an additional GPU
core and so it's got a lot of
technologies to make it a lot faster so
in this video we're gonna test in four
different areas one startup time to
Wi-Fi performance 3 app load time and
for web browsing performance so let's
start with the first test let's see
which one of these turns on faster
they're both updated to iOS 6.0 point 1
so they're running the latest and let's
see which turns on faster all right and
they're off again the iPad 4 is in white
and the iPad threes in black should be
easy to remember we're waiting to get to
the lock screen first to determine a
winner and iPad 4 beat the iPad 3 by
about 2 second okay so let's get started
the first thing we want to do is make
sure all programs are cleared out of
memory we've got 2 here we'll just clear
them out and then we're gonna launch
apps let's start with Temple Run it's
kind of a 3d game it's not the most
intense game but it does have 3d
graphics let's see which loads at first
one two three go Kate the iPad form is
ahead about two seconds and we'll click
play just to play for a second it's
virtually impossible to play two games
of Temple Run at the same time I
encourage you to try it
at home see if you can do it see how
long I can go okay this is too easy
right now I really can't detect a
difference in this game and again it's
not the most intense game but definitely
did open faster on the iPad 4 let's try
Facebook one two three lunch ok so again
about a half a second to a second maybe
a little bit more quick than the iPad 3
and there's really no difference in
scrolling I guess you could say it's a
little bit smoother but it's really
impossible to but tell next thing we're
going to do is launch the app store one
two three lunch and they're pulling up
different screens let's plus feature it
at the same time okay a little bit
faster on the iPad 4 and you can see I
haven't been through the screen yet and
let's click on the same thing ok a
little bit faster on the iPad 4 it that
seems to be the summary here ok now
we're to launch The Wall Street Journal
app 1 2 3 launch and faster on the iPad
4 by about by about a second and a half
and let's go into the web browser do
some web browsing speed tests keep
getting some email notifications over
here we're going to different sites here
we're gonna close out the browsers and
go to pocket now at the exact same time
and we'll circle back into a Wi-Fi test
in a minute so see if we can get this at
the same time might have to come around
on the camera here but all right at the
same time actually faster on the iPad 4
it looks like it finished first looked
like for a second but the iPad 3 was
going to win and we're gonna hit the
desktop version 1 2 3 go
okay the iPad 3 finished first that's
interesting let's see which clears up
text more quickly so pull out and then
release let's do that again that was
exactly at the same time that is
inconclusive Wow
okay so let's click on a story let's go
to something with a video here and the
winner is the iPad 4 by a little bit
actually that is still loading so that's
a lot bit and maybe that kind of tripped
it up let's play this video see which
gets it up on the screen first go
slightly faster on the iPad 4 it's
really not that big of a difference
which is actually kind of disappointing
to be honest but I'm glad we're doing
this video right people let's do one
more thing let's zoom in over here and
then we'll go to another webpage then
we'll do a Wi-Fi test okay a little bit
faster here on the iPad for iPad 3 seems
to get bogged down at the last minute
let's release and see that was not
accurate let's try that again we'll go
to some text at the bottom here which I
get the same size 1 2 3 exactly the same
time okay so let's go to another site
let's go to the verge real quick go at
the same time amazing ok so it's loading
very image intense webpage here let's
see which gets there first the iPad 3
this is very very odd ok let's click in
on a story here exactly the same time
maybe the iPad 4 by like a quarter of a
second so with these unscientific tests
it looks like that in terms of web
browsing performance the iPad 4 might be
slightly better but it's not that big of
a difference which has been for all of
you that own an iPad 3 out there because
you don't have to feel like you're
missing out now let's do a speed test
previously it was not working let's see
if it'll work now so we're gonna open up
the app opened up a little bit faster on
the iPad 4 let's do it the exact same
time
never a good idea but we'll see what
happens we want a faster ping okay and
faster ping on the iPad 3 we want a
faster down speed looks like it's faster
on the iPad 3 that's really crazy and it
seems to have froze on the iPad 4 but
like I mentioned there's been a problem
with the speed test on that app today
the point is here in this comparison is
that the iPad 4 seems to be a little bit
faster than the iPad 3 but definitely
not enough for you to go out if you have
an iPad 3 and buy an iPad 4 if you're
coming from an iPad 2 the difference
will be huge iPad 4 is a great choice
unless you want to wait for the iPad 5
which probably will be out in the
springtime but what we can conclude now
is that there's not that big of a
difference between the iPad 3 and the
iPad 4 in terms of performance maybe
it's a matter of a software update maybe
we need to do this in different kinds of
tests and maybe the iPad 4 would kick
butt with really high FPS gaming but in
terms of boot up time weight browsing
performance app launching speed and
Wi-Fi performance it's almost a draw
anyway I hope that was helpful if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
