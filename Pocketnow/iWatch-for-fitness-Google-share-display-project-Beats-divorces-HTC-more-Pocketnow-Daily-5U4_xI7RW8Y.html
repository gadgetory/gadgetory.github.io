help them build wearable hardware Google
is hard at work at letting you share
your smartphone content with larger
displays and HTC it beats by dre file
their final divorce I'm Hina Rivera and
please companies come on no drama this
is Friday can't you see I'm busy this is
pocket out daily if you were waiting for
official news today come on spare me
this is Friday and I do not want to talk
about the 1 billion dollar losses the
blackberry just filed in their
conference call because of the
blackberry z10 and their whole
blackberry 10 project but fine i'm going
to leave the sad news at the beginning
because HTC as well as just confirm that
they have now divorced officially from
beats by dre or i should say the other
way around this beats by dre has
actually bought their shares that HTC
had on the company and this now rings
the question if we are still going to
get beats audio on the next versions of
the HTC smartphones of any or if this is
just not allowing beach to not be
exclusive to HTC on smartphone so stay
tuned let's see how that goes now let's
talk about some rumors as nokia has just
filed a new patent that brings hovering
touch controls to their future
smartphone lineup and yes this is
expected i mean that the company is now
owned by microsoft we do expect some
more innovation to come from them as
they figured out how to do the touch
controls with gloves and everything else
this pretty much works already on the
galaxy s4 and galaxy note 3 so obviously
this is a piece of cake let's see when
no gift figures is out because obviously
patents are patents they take time and
if you thought QR codes were dead well
think again as google is now using them
once again with their new open project
in order to allow you to share your
smartphone display with a bigger screen
and listen to this i mean i'm talking
about any screen absolutely any sweet as
long as it can run a browser meaning all
you have to do is scan the QR code with
your camera and it'll share your display
with the other display which is fine
that's cool but even cooler is the fact
that you can actually control the device
from the display meaning you can control
it with your mouse with your keyboard
and if it has such controls you can
actually control it with the touch
controls of the display and your
smartphone can be in your pocket so you
can share photos and pretty much do
anything you want
your smartphone without pulling it out
of your pocket except for the QR code
scanning now obviously this is an open
project still they'll take some time but
it works really good on the video let's
see when we get it now let's talk about
some good and bad news when it comes to
the iPad because well we've got some
leaked specifications of the ipad 5 and
as it turns out it'll be apparently
thinner and lighter that we were
expecting we were expecting a seven
point nine millimeter thick ipad asper
leaks in june and as it turns out it'll
be 7.5 millimeters thick and trust me
trust me when it comes to tablets the
thinner and the lighter the better but
now let's talk about the bad news is
we've got some leaked photos of the ipad
mini in gold and with touch ID and if
you're looking at me wrong as if what's
wrong with that well the problem with
this leak is that this iPad Mini does
not have a Retina Display so for those
of you that were planning on getting an
ipad any now because you were expecting
a retina display trust me whenever you
hear new colors or new features trust me
you're not getting the ones you want and
finally for the both funny and cool news
of the day Apple has just launched iOS 7
point no point to to the iphone to deal
with the security issues on the lock
screen and forget about them it's
already been proven that it can be
hacked as well but anyways on the cool
side Apple is just hired ben shafer from
Nike and the reason why this is cool is
because this is the guy that created the
Nike FuelBand so think about this the m7
coprocessor from the iphone 5s and think
of the whole concept of the iWatch could
it be that Apple is taking the whole
iwatch concept into a fitness thing as
people actually use the ipod nano years
ago as a watch and everything but
anyways that leaves you to the question
of the day do you feel that fitness is
the best direction that Apple should
orient the eyewash do you feel that
that's the problem they want to solve in
my particular case I feel that it would
be awesome it would be cool but then
again there are a lot of competitors
there they've got Garmin they've got
nike obviously so it's gonna be a tough
concept unless Apple makes this a
no-brainer somehow so leave us a comment
