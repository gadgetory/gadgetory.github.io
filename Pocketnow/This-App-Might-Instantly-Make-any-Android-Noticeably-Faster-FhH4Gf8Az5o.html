know in the computing world there are
two problems with randomness first of
all it's not really random it's only
pseudo-random and the process to make
pseudo-random more random well it takes
a lot of computing power to help keep
your tablet or smartphone whizzing along
there's a collection of randomness
already in place apps can pull from this
randomness and use it whenever they need
well something random until it runs out
once it's empty
it's got to be restocked and until then
all the processes that need a random bit
they're stuck and you're waiting and
it's slow but what if there were an app
that could make random just a little bit
less random and speed up your entire
device that's the claim of one app and
it might just work the app is called
cedar one point one entropy generator
and it's said to provide significant lag
reduction how does it do that
and does it work well if you want the
exact technical details head over to
pocketnow.com and read what the
developer has to say in short the
developer is utilizing a semi random
pool to write in to the random pool at
one-second intervals the result he says
is significant lag reduction with an
exclamation mark
he continues Chrome maps and other heavy
applications switch instantaneously and
map tiles populate as fast as I can
scroll wow that's pretty impressive in
fact he goes as far to say problem
solved but don't take my word for it
give it a shot so we did we installed
the app on both the nexus 4 and a nexus
7 and we went about a normal day
benchmarks didn't yield much change from
stock but day to day activity seems
snappier
maybe this app could really improve
all-around performance after all
unfortunately there's a lot of heated
debate around this quote-unquote fix our
humans from it makes you less secure -
it just doesn't work are being thrown
around left and right people are
passionate on both sides of the aisle
either it's the greatest thing since
sliced bread or it's nothing more than a
placebo then a CyanogenMod maintainer
chimed in in short he says the recent
entropy pool fad is bull the only
conceivable reason some devices may feel
faster is because by constantly poling
it keeps the device's IO in constant use
which in turn and depending on device
will make the CPU stick to a higher
clock frequency and keep up or ramp up
the eye of scheduler accordingly but
does it work
ironically the answer is yeah but
probably not for the reason that the
developer intended to solve in our test
chrome was snappier and Google Maps was
much quicker drawing tiles why probably
not because the entropy pool was any
quicker but because the CPU and i/o
processes were being kept hot by the app
constantly updating the system with new
and less random bits in short the CPU
wasn't returning to a slower speed as
frequently resulting in a faster
experience and shorter battery life all
in all it was an interesting experiment
and an interesting concept the app or
rather the device when running the app
does make your everyday activities seem
a little bit faster though probably not
for the reasons that the app is trying
to solve what would solve it faster
processors or keeping your processor
running faster longer unfortunately both
of those probably mean shorter battery
life and it's a fine line between
battery life and performance it's an
age-old problem but hopefully we've put
this magic voodoo to bed and you can try
it for yourself if you want just realize
it's not doing what you think it's doing
and it's going to eat up your battery
life faster if you do decide to run with
it on all the time but if you want that
little bit of extra speed and you don't
want to go with some kind of a custom
solution that just keeps your processor
running faster all the time this is
certainly something you can try what do
you think
let us know in the comments over at
pocketnow.com and if you liked this kind
of half-and-half debunking and
justifying approach to cedar
one-point-one give the video a big
thumbs up for PocketNow debunking stuff
that sounded pretty cool i'm joe levi
