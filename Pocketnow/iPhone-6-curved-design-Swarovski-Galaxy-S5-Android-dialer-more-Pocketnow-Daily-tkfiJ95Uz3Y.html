a curve display in a curve design one
run commits to future smartphone
sporting near to stock Android and
people seem to be training their current
phones for HTC One m8 devices
significantly I'm hi Mary meta and just
cross your fingers guys third world
problems we could probably lose power at
some point this is pocket out daily
let's start off with some official news
as those of you worried about what will
happen to Motorola with the whole an
oboe acquisition well things are not
necessarily bad little does a really
good job when it comes to design but
apparently Motorola will be something
unique something different and something
on its own and mainly that's because the
company has just stated that they are
committing to making everything close to
stock Android when it comes to software
so hopefully we will see more Moto X
devices we've heard about the Moto e the
moto g LT variant and everything that
are coming soon so hopefully things will
remain the same now repeat after me
swarovski I think I got it right as it
turns out Samsung is teasing that there
will be a variant of the galaxy s5 next
month that will sports more offski
crystals on the back and you get to
wonder why exactly a Samsung teasing
different variants of its phone when all
you have to do is actually switch the
battery cover but anyways there is a
teaser weights of the scripture for full
details on what to expect as a this
could be hot for the female market and
with the launch of the HTC One m8 and
the Samsung Galaxy s5 if you're
wondering which is the hottest phone
right now in the United States none of
these companies are providing any
numbers but one thing we do know is that
HTC is boasting that a lot of people are
actually trading in a lot of phones for
the HTC One m8 now a big percentage of
these are people that actually owned HTC
phones which is natural but then again
we have a ton of people doing the same
from Samsung Galaxy phones and iPhones
well it seems for prefer full details on
percentages we still don't know exactly
how much is that percentage amount in
numbers but hey let's see now let's talk
about Android and basically stock
Android more like Google applications
since we do know that the company is
working hard on revamping the design of
these but how dramatic is that revamp of
design and links the description shows
you the full new dialer with
has a lot of boxes no numbers and
apparently this will be the new google
UI for the dialer it's actually been
leaked before now Google is actually
making it public and apparently the
significant differences are again
significant like the description tell us
what you think in the comments down
below and finally for the very
interesting rumor of the day Japanese
sources claiming that apple will bring
us more curves on one of its next
generation iphones we know that there
are two and apparently the 5.5 inch
model at least will bring a lot of terms
to bring some nostalgia to the first
generation iphone but exactly that
apparently it will have a curve display
as well as Apple is betting on trying to
make this thing as I ergonomic as it can
but that leave this is the question of
the day do you want to curb display in a
curve design on the next generation
iphone in my particular case hey it
looks better and it actually feels
better I don't really care but leave us
a comment down below what do you want
and friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
