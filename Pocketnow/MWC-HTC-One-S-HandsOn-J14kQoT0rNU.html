pocketnow.com Luke Gavin here is going
to give us a quick demo of the HTC One S
from HTC tells about it hi this is a the
HTC one edge and it is aluminium unibody
design let's meet at all
it's a single pieces curve is very very
little extra parts on it and see this
make hotel tools here here it's because
those are machined right a machine and
when they when they beat piece of
aluminium and your boxing machine
you see that as a gradient on this model
that's our finish which we're gonna tame
okay so we just put it on fire expected
an acid bath today show the naked eye
that's not paint finish over the top
big part of HTC One X is the ability to
take a look
okay about Abby try it I was noticing
the dual the dual shutter so can you
show me filming a video and then and
then taking pictures at the same time
okay so lock screen there Hopkins into
the camera so see we bought one thing TT
we simply ball down
I will continually take photographs ok
we can go through
these definitely are connect the one
that we won
okay big fish shop here yet Oh it'll
automatically select the best one that's
initially the best one interesting and
we're taking video
all the time here
I'm still can be taking single shot
okay we'd have no shutter sounds no
stopping within the video the video
would be completely completely smooth
the octo key nightmare they all you okay
shutterstock indistinct fellowship
okay now this one s device that you have
here is this a quad core or a dual-core
processor device because it was
mentioned there's a quad core in the
keynote but then I'm noticing that the
within the device in the About section
it says dual-core do we have any
differences or different models a quote
the Hedgehog 2 &amp;amp; 1
okay which one is the one that's going
to bring the quad core processor quad
cores gonna make my name's the 1x okay
which is the polycarbonate design okay
aside from that we've got one gigabyte
of RAM any other specifications on the
device
one man
you mean the main differences days
materials only
the couch on the shame through the
the same makeup 8 megapixel camera is a
contextual on the 1's okay 1x okay and
when you get to the one c-spine negative
5 megapixel on the front facing camera I
was noticing that this one is vga the 1x
is 1.3 okay so even if this this is the
device that's made out of metal we could
consider the 1x to be like the flagship
device the one with the better
specifications and innovation is an idea
to Peter for the whole different tastes
okay to be honest with you at first saw
this device yeah I like 1s casually the
name of startling connects expand well
design wise the 1s seems to be more
refined but obviously the One X is the
one with the most with the better or
specification so it'll be up to the
customers in the end thank you very much
Gavin this is time every that again
reporting from parking now calm this is
the HTC One S</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
