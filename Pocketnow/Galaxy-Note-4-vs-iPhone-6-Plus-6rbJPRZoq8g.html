Note 3 came out and we didn't even
compare it to the iPhone 5s well that's
because they were fundamentally
different devices for about a billion
reasons not least of which was their
size well this year things aren't so
simple
Apple surprised us a few weeks ago by
releasing a monster 5.5 inch iPhone and
that simple change puts it in direct
competition with Samsung's newest note
I'm Michael Fisher with pocket now let's
see how they stack up in galaxy note 4
versus iPhone 6 plus brought to you by
Squarespace used to be that Apple was
the king of all things fit and finish
especially when it came to Samsung
comparisons but the folks in Seoul have
stepped up their game this year as we
explained in detail in our full note for
review the newest Samsung phablet bears
a chamfered chassis of aluminum
magnesium with a polycarbonate
leatherette back that recalls the
expensive notebooks it's named after
it's thicker and heavier than the iPhone
bigger in every dimension except height
and it's beveled edges are harsher in
the hand too it's a phone
that wants everyone to know it's not no
sissy it's a mammoth powerhouse and you
better recognize it the iPhone 6 plus
takes a more subtle approach with its
particular brand of big it's more
slippery yet much more comfortable to
hold and talk on thanks to the curves
that dominate its build with an all
aluminum fuselage and the attention to
detail that Apple is known for it feels
like the more futuristic of the pair but
it also seems more fragile and may be
more prone to accidental damage
aesthetically it's not our favorite
iPhone ever either with its bold antenna
inlays seeming out of place on this
rounded Hardware Samsung's approach with
the note family is to see if there's a
speck worth offering and if so to
include it Apple doesn't think that way
so the note 4 has a quad HD display
while the iPhone settles for 1080p the
note packs a larger removable battery
and microSD storage expansion not so
with the iPhone with the note you can
control your TV or media center via IR
you can
measure your heart rate and blood oxygen
level and you can draw on your screen or
scroll like a mouse with the included
s-pen the iPhone offers none of that if
you're looking for features above all
else well stop the video here and the
note is your device but hold on what
Apple brings to the table is just as
alluring to some people greater
simplicity and to focus on tiny details
that borders on the obsessive there's a
little switch on the side of the iPhone
and when you flip it your system
notifications are muted the fingerprint
scanner lets you just place your thumb
to unlock the phone instead of clumsily
swiping across it apples lightning
charging cable is proprietary but it's
also reversible so it's easier to plug
in in the dark these features elementary
even laughably so yes and they're also a
part of the reason Apple has sold so
many millions of iPhones over the past
seven years the software reflects these
basic values as well rather than being
endlessly customizable and often
needlessly complex iOS keeps things
simple with a straightforward and
familiar grid now if you've watched
enough of our videos you know that not
all of us are fans of that grid which
can feel a little like prison if you're
used to tweaking everything on your
phone and on the iPhone six-plus frankly
it seems even less justified the most
customization Apple permits is
relocating folders and apps on your
springboard and even then you can't even
choose where you want the empty spaces
to be worse every app takes up the full
five and a half inch display and not
many of them make terribly good use of
that space the note 4 on the flipside is
kind of the poster child for intelligent
use of screen real estate first of all
you can arrange the display however you
want mix and match widgets and icons
move folders and entire screens around
install a custom launcher knock yourself
out
also with the note you can divide your
apps into moveable windows collapse them
into minimized icons or drop two of them
side-by-side so you can use each one at
once using Samsung's S Pen Stylus makes
this even more convenient at points as
you can copy and paste text from one app
into a neighboring
or drag-and-drop media from one place to
another that's a lot of functionality
and the reason the note 4 doesn't win
this comparison by a landslide because
of it is because there's a big trade-off
the simplicity that Apple has perfected
so well is nowhere to be found here
multi-window is great but it's complex
and it can still be temperamental and
finicky even in this latest generation
the s-pen is very cool but learning it
takes time and effort and even then it's
not as intuitive as it could be in our
experience the iPhone takes much less
effort to learn to use which is why it
appeals to people who see their
smartphone more as a means to an end
once you remember to swipe up for
control Center and swipe down for
notifications you're pretty much golden
and hey if you can't stretch all the way
up to the notification shade well reach
ability can help with that the note 4 is
one handed mode is cool too and much
more functional to be honest but it's
not as easy or consistent to trigger you
seeing a pattern here at the end of the
day the software question comes down to
the old iOS versus Android debate an
ecosystem choice that's much bigger than
this comparison to break it down to sink
ly the iPhone sacrifices versatility for
simplicity capability for cosmetics
whereas the note 4 does the exact
opposite the power gap continues across
the optics where samsung's sensor offers
double the resolution of the iPhones and
many more special features in the
software samsung has toned its option
density down a little bit with the note
4 but surprise it's still nowhere near
as easy to use as the iPhones viewfinder
as for which phone's end results you
prefer well that will depend on your
preferences both cameras are quite good
and if you prefer more authentic tones
you might lean toward the iPhones less
saturated results but there's no denying
that samsung's bold vivid colors and
higher contrast or big eye catchers
Samsung's HDR mode is also much more
adroit at pulling light from the
darkness
apples doesn't seem to really do
anything
and since both units have optical image
stabilization they each do well in
low-light though we prefer how Samsung
deals with the artificial tones thrown
off by light sources like street lights
the note 4 also seems less susceptible
to lens flare a complaint we also
Leavitt against the iPhone 6
apples a8 processor in the iPhone and
Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 in the note are
completely different from an
architectural standpoint fortunately we
don't have to talk too much about that
because insofar as most consumers go
none of it matters both devices adroitly
handle processing loads from the benign
to the extreme now each one shows
occasional stumbles in everyday
interaction which is surprising given
the amount of power under the hood here
but no device is perfect testing on AT&amp;amp;T
and Greater Boston we found the iPhone
to be the more comfortable device to
talk on both physically because of its
soft rounded construction and because
its ear piece favors clarity over sheer
volume callers also said we sounded
louder but less clear on the note 4 with
noise cancellation effectiveness about
the same between the two as for the
speakerphone we said in our note 4
versus note 3 comparison that we didn't
like Samsung's decision to move it from
the bottom to the backside and the
iPhone six-plus demonstrates exactly why
its edge mounted speaker is just as loud
as the rear firing unit on the note and
it also delivers a fuller richer sound
despite having less space to work with
how long you'll be able to blast those
tunes will vary depending on your use
for stamina you really can't go wrong
with either of these they're huge phones
and they have commensurately large
batteries Samsung's battery is bigger
yes but it's also got bigger power draws
on the screen and probably the software
still the note does take the endurance
prize thanks to the battery being
removable and replaceable and also
Samsung has its special ultra power
saving mode available and once you do
exhaust the battery completely the quick
charger in the box can get you back up
to 50% in a half hour which is just
ludicrously fast
finally you can bring down the
brightness on the notes display to
almost nothing to save juice which is
also handy for reading in bed or texting
in a dim restaurant without blinding
your neighbours who says Samsung can't
sweat the small stuff outside the most
basic fundamentals these smartphones are
nothing alike so the right buyer for
each is easy to figure out if all you're
looking for is a bigger display and a
longer-lasting battery on a
straightforward but powerful smartphone
the iPhone 6 plus is the better fit it's
got the more polished ecosystem and
fewer hassles on the whole and its
software showcases the ease of use
that's made Apple a household name
if simple isn't your bag if instead
you're a hardcore power user looking for
the most raw performance you can fit in
your pocket or you're a Productivity
pundit in search of a phone more like a
desktop than a mobile device and you
don't mind the complexity that comes
with that the Galaxy Note 4 lives up to
its vaunted family name and it's the
better phablet for you either way
remember you're getting an outrageously
capable handheld the only thing that
makes one better than the other is how
you plan to use that capability and that
as always is up to you
