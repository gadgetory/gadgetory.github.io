include another variant microsoft's
quarter results reveal it there is still
a long road ahead and the blackberry
pribyl ends an official price and it
isn't as bad as we expected I'm high
Meadow iveta and how exactly do you
party on Fridays because we have sushi
night at my place and you are invited
this is parking out daily the official
news today start with Microsoft the
company is definitely cool again when it
comes to its products but not with its
revenue it's currently at twenty point
four billion in revenue compared to 22
last quarter and then when you measure
that year over a year it was 23 year
over year last quarter with worst
products that what it has right now but
you have to remember that these products
haven't really launched for the most
part so we do have to cut some slack to
the company and remember in addition to
that the company is mostly a software
company so stay tuned as we hopefully
see things flip themselves around over
time other official news have Google's
quarter results and even though the
company is not really specific asks
which departments for the most part we
do know that the company in general grew
thirteen percent were just great and it
seems that when it comes to its mobile
division there was a point two billion
growth in dollars which is ok not
necessarily Android though as we know
that it's broader than that well stay
tuned as a we should learn more over
time as well as will the spotlight over
to blackberry we were extremely
skeptical with the company's possible
750 dollar price tag with the privet
pre-orders have launched today you can
pick your device up as of november six
and it'll cost you six hundred bucks
which is still speed for a product that
should be proven i mean it's not that
it's not proven it's just that
BlackBerry's been on a hiatus so long
we're not really sure of this product
will sell but even if it doesn't it is
still an android phone so something
could play right through us how about
android 6th auto marshmallow even though
the big fanfare for the fingerprint
scanner had everything to do with
android pay for the new nexus devices it
seems that you can actually use it for
more than that as it seems you can
already use it in the google play store
but we kind of don't really understand
why google has dubbed that feature up up
to the point where you have to go into
parental controls and enable the
fingerprint option going to be able to
buy new applications again not
sure why this is probably disgusting
things around finally the hot news today
have everything to do with the Galaxy s7
we've been hearing rumors that the
product will be ready sometime mid
January for a launch sometime between
mwc which is in February which is all
great but we have trusted sources that
are claiming well one that the Galaxy s7
edge will launch with its s of an edge
plus variant meaning the smaller and the
larger sibling which is great and the
other thing that wasn't really mentioned
from this trusted source is the regular
galaxy s7 could it be that Samsung is
working on getting rid of the average
galaxy s7 and making everything a niche
product going forward and it does lead
me to the question of the day would you
be disappointed if Samsung got rid of
the regular Galaxy s7 I mean would you
put up with edge displays going forward
in my case yeah why not i love the edge
displace but i do know that a lot of
people don't especially because they
have to pay more for it so leave us a
comment down below what do you think
friends as always you know the drill if
you want to get it was earlier before
this video was filmed make sure you
follow what I'm talking about comment
subscribe to youtube channel as well it
followed me on twitter hind underscoring
that are on instagram at high Meadow
