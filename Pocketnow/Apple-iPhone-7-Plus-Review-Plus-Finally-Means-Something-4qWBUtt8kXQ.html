company's largest smartphone but also
the company's best one in years but at a
time when many companies have proven
that their best can be really good you'd
wonder how much plus you're getting for
that extra cash
I'm hi Natalie that up with pocket now
and let's find out in our iPhone 7 plus
review brought to you by deep brand
pocket house iPhone 7 coverage is
brought to you by deep brand to buy the
best fitting skin for your phone or
tablet visit deep brand comm I'd like to
call 2016 the year of choice today many
phones have great design fast
performance a great camera and the
concept of dual lenses and cameras isn't
really new Apple is actually late to
some of these competitions something
expected as Cupertino is famous for
airing on the side of refinement so
let's use refinement as the basis for
this review hardware wise the iPhone 7
plus is as refined as it is mixed this
continues to be one of the most solid
and pleasant phones to hold thanks to
the aluminum construction and 2.5 D
glass if you choose any of the new black
variants the finish is an interesting
blend of badass and elegant that looks
great up close and from a distance in
many ways this is Apple refining a
familiar design to a new level even if
on a conservative side other refinements
come at the hand of the ip67 water and
dust resistance to survive under a meter
of water for 30 minutes
something Apple took forever to catch up
on there's a new force touch home button
here that might take a little getting
used to if you come from an older iPhone
but that's far more convenient than the
standard capacitive keys that react to
heat and not to an actual press if
you're planning and keeping this iPhone
for the long run this is one less moving
part to worry about as well so I really
praise the new approach now thanks get
mix when you notice that essentials like
making the rest of the buttons reachable
is still a plus issue the camera hump
makes the
Wabble more than his predecessors on the
table and yes even with a plus style
thickness there is no headphone jack
here your color of choice also
determines other issues any color that
is in black is prone to antenna lines
and then the black variants are either
prone to fingerprints or easily
susceptible to scratches
I'm personally more inclined to this
matte black variant but each of you will
have to pick your poison still there are
a few new added tricks that make you
forget about the design flaws and that's
mainly because they're focused on
refining content consumption the wider
color gamut on the new red HD display
provides punchy err color and deeper
blacks than before and these are some of
the best stereo speakers that we've
tested so far but oh features matter to
all users so don't let that be the
reason for you to buy a product the
experience extends to the ample volume
for phone calls through the earpiece and
even through the speakers Apple's new
a10 fusion processor with three gigs of
RAM runs the show underneath with to
course providing powerful performance
when graphics get intense and too coarse
for day-to-day efficiency and given the
fact that I will considers itself more
of a software company that show that's
powered by iOS 10 is also what makes the
hardware disappear we have separate
videos to detail what iOS 10 can do link
in the description the ones I've enjoyed
the most room actually the little things
like 3d touch now including widgets to
save me the need to dig within
applications or subtle improvements like
race to wake to keep up with
notifications and then using 3d touch
again to respond to them without the
need of again digging into the
application the keyboard is now smarter
using series machine learning and since
it now supports predictions of two
languages without the need of switching
around my needs of a clunky third-party
keyboard are no longer a case
speaking of Siri I like how you can now
summon a lift with it or tell it to send
the whatsapp to someone though
third-party application support is still
rather limited and above all my favorite
feature is the integration with homekit
I recently received some fancy new IOT
products for my devices and now all I
have to do is say good morning and Siri
turns on the lights or say good night
and Siri turns them off
the new control center has also been
enhanced to include a home kit area in
addition to adding more room for the
rest of the controls and even though I
still avoid using Apple maps this update
makes it really useful for using it with
walking directions because it can
actually tell you to go right or left as
opposed to Google Maps which just
doesn't and then there are the changes
to iMessages Apple music and news which
I'm not really a fan of but that do
place these applications on par with
competing services I've been testing the
iPhone 7 plus in two different variants
for nearly two weeks in New York City my
experience with a 32 gigabyte version
truly crashed and burned I mean
seriously if you're gonna buy a phone
this big you want to consume a lot of
content and media or play a lot of games
with it and 32 gigabytes just does not
cut it as the 128 gigs of my black
variant and everything else data speeds
are great over t-mobile and the
experience of using the iPhone is as
expected with great fluidity in the user
interface and stutter free performance
when playing graphics intensive games
this is also the king of battery life
for content consumption going way over a
day of heavy use and about the only
thing that I don't like is how long it
takes to charge we've discussed that in
our 24 hours video about my only
complaints with using this phone on a
day to day basis or the fact that it's
large so it's really hard to handle with
one hand and two is the fact that well
there is enough space here for a
headphone jack Apple should have
seriously considered leaving this as a
plus feature the whole topic of fumbling
around with adapters leads to a very
cumbersome experience and sure there are
some Bluetooth options but inline
controls for the average Bluetooth
headset are really not at a friendly
spot for phone calls so it also leads to
another cumbersome experience now one of
the major changes that Apple made is
with the camera Apple finally took the
plunge to newer specific Asians like a
12 megapixel sensor with F 1.8 aperture
and optical image stabilization but if
one camera isn't enough for you there's
a separate twelfth megapixel telephoto
lenz at f 2.8 aperture for 2 X optical
zoom and 10x digital zoom when taking
photos I highly suggest you watch one
separate real camera review linked in
the description as well as we dig deep
into what these cameras can do as for an
average consumer I'm really happy to see
that once again I could trust an iPhone
with my photos and that's because we
have great color saturation contrast in
detail whether it's during the day or at
night this is truly a great smartphone
camera to rely on
I also love the smooth civilization on
video and how easily the camera
transitions from one lens to the zoom
lens oh and if you do see jitter while
filming or taking a photo while fully
zoomed in no worries somehow this just
doesn't make it to the final footage
really my only complaint with the camera
experiences the selfie camera which has
a very dated field of view at a time
when wide-angle selfie cameras are the
standard to conclude I guess the last
question left on the table is if it's
really worth it to get an iPhone 7 plus
I mean seriously this phone starts at
750 dollars and I had to make the jump
to nearly $900 plus taxes because the 32
gigabytes were just not enough that's a
lot of money in today's world for a
smart phone especially one that's not
significantly greater than everything
else that's out there sure you can't
deny that this still is the greatest
iPhone you can get and probably the most
pleasant experience I've had with an
iPhone in a while if you value great
experience for consuming content insane
battery life a robust ecosystem great
customer service and one of the best
cameras in the industry then I would
really recommend getting the iPhone 7
plus so long as you don't mind the price
tag and hey listen if you can't don't
worry this is 2016 the market is flooded
with similar alternatives that can fit
your needs depending on your ability to
compromise again the iPhone 7 plus is a
great phone that I highly recommend but
it's not the only great phone in the
market right now
