pre-order experience but Google's Nexus
10 is finally at our door at least I
think so the return address on this
unmarked box actually says ups SCS GA
building one dock door 54 so stay tuned
after the break and we'll do a little
unboxing here and find out if this is
the nexus 10 or something from the
dharma initiative by michael fisher this
is pocket now let's get to it
this unboxing brought to you by old
timer for all your unboxing needs that's
not true at all but this is an old timer
night the gifts from my grandfather if
you care which you probably don't but I
like see mystery box coming open here
air bladders some paperwork from the
google play store and look at that oh
cool let's get this mystery box out of
here wow that there is some distinctive
product packaging cool taking a tour
around here nexus 10 on the side samsung
logo down below some features on the
back here the best of google indeed
crisp is one word for the display that i
imagine we're about to be impressed by
and the 16 gig Wi-Fi version there see
if this is as difficult to to open as
the nexus 7 one's sleeve comes off and
we're left with just a black box product
label down here with all the codes on it
that you don't need to know aha more
tape mm-hmm chef unboxing music
shouldn't we gonna be fun this tape is
surprisingly hadi all right side man ah
very subtle little Nexus imprint there
let's go for it very easy not at all
like the Nexus 7
boom and a very reflective device is
staring us in the face let's go ahead
and Wow well it is light in the hand
here's the back let's put this aside and
just get the in the box stuff out of the
way here there's a little pull tab USB
cable product packaging i was giving
your product information here power
adapter wow power adapter in multiple
pieces that's very nice see what's else
is going on here going to try and leave
some of this a little intact for our
friend jolie by the android guy will be
receiving this device later nothing else
in the box i'm going back in very nice
so let's put this aside and come back to
the device Oh heaven knows we like doing
this here we go screen protector is
going to come off here wow that is one
thick screen protector remove that aside
let's go ahead and take it off the back
here as well very nice and let's just
have a look at the back here here's that
dimpled pattern running along the top oh
and the plastic is it is a tacky a tacky
plastic not at all like like a typical
soft touch feel this is quite different
not in a bad way either this this feels
great in the hand quite light not too
light i mean it's certainly not the
lightest tablet i've ever encountered
but here's some little little thickness
analysis there for you and just for
reference here is the droid DNA
alongside since many not many of you
probably have one of those
here is the Nokia Lumia 920 for a
comparison as well washed out in the in
the white light sorry about that anyway
why don't we give this thing a first
power on while we're taking a tour here
one two three little vibration buzz to
confirm how we're on there's our goog
branding there's my face at the least
flattering angle there is a little Nexus
animation letting us know it's getting
started let's have a look on the side
here while it is happening USB port and
headphone jack on the left Wow when
we're already here androids already
ready for setup not going to be doing
that as as I told you this is going to
Joe so I'm going to leave it be but just
to get a real quick detail on that port
on the right hand side believe that's
don't know what kind of port that is
actually and dock port connector down
here with the pogo pins we can't really
quite get focus on that which is a shame
but you're you're familiar with these by
now so that is the nexus 10 from google
and samsung i don't know about you but
i'm glad we solved the mystery of what's
inside the box we're gonna have a lot
more coverage on the Nexus 10 as well as
our full review in the weeks ahead so
