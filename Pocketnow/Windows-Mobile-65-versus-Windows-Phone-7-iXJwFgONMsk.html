pocketnow.com Windows Phone 7 is
technically the successor to Windows
Mobile but they are completely different
in this video we're going to compare
Windows Phone 7 with Windows Mobile
should be interesting let's get to it
okay before getting started we want to
mention that this is not final Windows
Phone 7 hardware or software and I am
running a custom ROM here on the HTC hd2
as many people are that are running
Windows Mobile devices and we're going
to talk about why that is in a minute so
let's briefly go over these lock screens
they're a little bit different both of
them show you new message notifications
on the bottom Windows Phone 7 will show
you if you have a new calendar
appointment so we're going to unlock
these devices and dump right into the
interface here so what a lot of
manufacturers have had to do over the
years for Windows Mobile is make their
own custom interface because the default
Windows Mobile interface that today's
screen as it used to be called is just
pretty much useless it's very basic you
can't do much with it you can add
plugins to it but it's really ugly it's
very one-dimensional so HTC most notably
for their HTC Sense came along and made
this beautiful gorgeous interface that
sits on top of Windows Mobile other
companies like SBB came out with mobile
shell there was a lot of proprietary
interfaces from Samsung with TouchWiz
and really all the developers came
forward to customize all of these
interfaces so you can customize the HTC
Sense interface really in any way you
want you can use a ROM that has cookies
home tab editor which allows you to have
dozens and dozens of quick links and to
really customize the interface you can
use the Max Sense UI I mean the list
goes on and on about how you can
customize Windows Mobile Windows Phone 7
not so much customizable in fact I think
people going from Windows Mobile to
Windows Phone 7 are going to feel a
little bit boxed in because not only can
you not change the interface you can't
change the web browser can't change the
keyboard can't change really the default
applications but that's not necessarily
a bad thing
that was one of the problems with
Windows Mobile there was just too much
that was left uncooked by Microsoft and
Microsoft is really focusing on making
sure that the core experience of Windows
Phone 7 is good out of the box so you
don't have to get the proprietary
interface ok enough about that let's
talk about these two different
interfaces and how they are different
the HTC Sense UI for Windows Mobile is
grouped into tabs and tabs organize
various actions so we have a tab
for people we have a tab just for photos
we have a tab just for music so you can
play music right from your home screen
it was a great idea and Android is kind
of like this the way that it is today
it's multiple screens with different
kinds of information that you can
customize and one of the best parts of
HTC Sense is the home tab where you have
these Quick Links Quick Links can be a
variety of shortcuts so you can have a
quick link to call your favorite person
quick link to a program quick link to a
website Windows Phone 7 takes this idea
of Quick Links and really puts it on
steroids they call them live tiles and
they can take on a wide variety of
functions they can be links to your
favorite map places links to multi media
links to your favorite people links to
web sites and then there are all the
live tiles that haven't been made yet
that hold a lot of promise so you could
have a live tile to show you sports
scores or a stock or weather in Windows
Mobile you really didn't have that with
the Quick Links in order to see the
weather you would have to go over to the
weather tab in order to see stocks you
would have to go to the stocks tab so in
Windows Phone 7 you've got this
glanceable information that is really
expandable so while the interface is not
customizable in Windows Phone 7 in terms
of making these blocks in a rectangular
or make them into ovals or make them
have a 3d effect you can't do that but
you can really change the way you
interact with the phone so let's say
you're done on the home screen and you
want to open up a program that's not
within easy reach maybe you want to open
up say the calculator calculator is not
here it's not there I didn't pin it to
the Quick Links so in Windows Phone 7
you swipe to the right you get your full
list of programs in Windows Mobile
of course you press the start button and
here is your scrollable list of programs
now in both of these operating systems
if you have a lot of programs they're
just going to list vertically and the
list is going to be SuperDuper long but
in Windows Mobile or at least the later
version it's like six point five point
three and six point five point five you
can move around the program so let's say
I use footprints a lot I can put it
right at the top with an easy reach
Windows Phone 7 doesn't have this
capability the programs are only listed
pathetically sure you could take any of
these and pin them to your Start screen
like so looks like it's already up no if
there goes but you really can't
reorganize the list of programs it would
be nice if they had the same alphabet
jump system that they have in Zune let
me show you what I mean if we go here
into Zune and we go to a listing of say
music if you press on a B you can
quickly jump to anywhere in the alphabet
Windows Phone 7 really should have this
for the Start screen so if you know you
what the calculator you tap on the
letter you go to C boom we're then so
let's talk about the Internet experience
in Windows Mobile you had a choice from
Skyfire Opera Mobile default pocket
Internet Explorer and several other
browsers in Windows Phone 7
you get one browser and one browser only
it's Internet Explorer as we talked
about in the previous video Internet
Explorer on Windows Phone 7 is darn good
it's smooth it works very well it allows
you to load multiple tabs at a time
the real weakness here is that it
doesn't support html5 or flash in
Windows Mobile you could get Skyfire
which can do flash in html5 just fine so
we're going to compare here Pocket
Internet Explorer just for the sake of a
throwback with Internet Explorer on
Windows Phone 7 a lot of people didn't
use Windows Phone a lot of people chose
not to use pocket Internet Explorer on
Windows Mobile cuz it's just not that
good compared to opera so let's go to
pocket now calm on Pocket Internet
Explorer here
I'll go to the home page what on on this
device and and here's a good example of
how Windows Phone 7 is going to
different from Windows Mobile I've been
trying to load pocketnow.com here for a
couple of minutes despite having a
perfectly good Wi-Fi connection the
browser is just not working this was a
curse of Windows Mobile where things
just wouldn't work the device would have
to be soft reset on a regular basis of
course with some good tuning in a very
good run that wouldn't be necessary but
this is just an example of where things
don't work and in Windows Phone 7
through through my usage of
everything just works it's the exact
opposite the interface is always fast
everything launches the way it should
and there's no problem so I'm going to
stop it from loading and we're going to
just go back to the the home screen here
now let's talk about the application
experience Windows Mobile has the
windows marketplace for mobile which
only to this day has 1200 apps despite
being around for about a year and a half
now that's really nothing it's not a
competitive marketplace a lot of the
apps are too expensive there's just not
a good selection Windows Phone 7 will
hopefully have a totally different
ecosystem of applications and Microsoft
knows that they have to have a much
better app offering so they're really
going after developers the interface for
Windows Phone 7 for the app experience
is much much better than than Windows
Mobile Windows Mobile looks like this
when this app was made in an overnight
here in in Windows Phone 7 we tap on
apps and we get the Metro interface it's
very fast
of course there aren't going to be any
apps here because this operating system
isn't launched yet but we can see what
it would be like to have some apps in
the market so you can see featured you
can see top new free and you can kind of
flick around you can tap on the stocks
app here and load that up and kind of
like the App Store for Android or for
iPhone you get a rating a description
screenshots that you can tap on and
flick through it's a very well done
interface for an app store unlike
Windows Mobile and so it's very likely
that the app offering for Windows Phone
7 is going to be infinitely better than
what we got on Windows Mobile of course
with Windows Mobile there were thousands
of apps but very fragmented you could go
to a variety of different websites you
could send the cab to your device it was
a mess but a Windows Phone 7 is going to
be a true application experience that
rivals that of the iPhone and Android
and finally I want to talk about fast
app switching the ability to multitask
between two applications or three
applications we recently did a video
about the iPhone versus Windows Phone 7
put a link up on the video after this
and in iphone there's a very easy way to
multitask you tap DoubleTap on the on
button you can go to the recently used
program jump between the two instantly
Windows Phone 7 does not have fast app
switching and it kind of is a bummer so
if we want to go into settings and we
want to jump back to marketplace which
we were in previously you can press the
back button we first go back to the
Start screen and then we go into
marketplace press back again we don't
jump forward to what we were doing
before
there's no way to jump forward in
Windows Mobile we do have fast app
switching but windows mobile 6.5 kind of
took it away but not really so in
windows mobile 6.5 in order to do true
fast app switching you have to install a
task manager that will allow you to drop
down a list of currently running
programs and that will allow you to jump
from program to program in windows
mobile 6.1 and below if you went into
the Start menu which had a button up
here you can instantly get to the
previous program through the recently
used programs menu so that was really
good app switching but Windows Mobile
out of the gate has always had true
multitasking so you can have a program
running while another one was running a
switch between the two in Windows Phone
7 it has the capability in the core
architecture but it's not available to
the consumer in terms of fast app
switching so in the end Windows Mobile
in Windows Phone 7 argue entirely
different operating systems totally
different experiences in fact they're
opposites in a lot of ways Windows
Mobile is extremely customizable Windows
Phone 7 really isn't customizable
Windows Mobile at times acts weird it
freezes things don't work Windows Phone
7 seems to always work things don't
freeze I haven't had to software set the
device once because of a failed program
or any kind of freeze so it depends on
the kind of user you are and hopefully
we will see the same sort of robust
development for Windows Phone 7 that we
have seen for Windows Mobile although it
remains to be seen if it's actually able
to be hacked and changed and modified so
curious to hear what you think about the
comparison between Windows Mobile and
Windows Phone 7 leave a comment and let
us know what you think please thumbs up
the video if you liked it and thanks for
watching that's in front</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
