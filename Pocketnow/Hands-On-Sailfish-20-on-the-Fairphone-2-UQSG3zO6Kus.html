difficult a recent history as Yolo but
in the words of co-founder anti Sarnia
Yola is here sailfish is here and we are
going to stay I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow here with a quick look at the
companies sailfish OS 2.0 running on the
Intex aqua fish and the new fairphone 2
sailfish has always had a very beautiful
interface and that's evolved nicely in
2.0 the awkward left and right swipe
interactions on the homescreen have been
replaced by simple taps while the focus
on one-handed usability remains you can
access certain menus just by dragging
down on the screen and the notification
area instead of being placed stupidly
out of reach on the top is just to swipe
away on the left side of the home screen
version 2.0 runs very smoothly and
consistently - I tried it on a
Snapdragon 801 and a Snapdragon 212 and
couldn't tell much of a difference in
performance the latter Hardware forms
the basis of the Intex aqua fish an
entry-level device targeted at the
Indian market and priced at a very
competitive 100 US dollars much more
interesting was seeing selfish 2.0
running on the fairphone 2 though the
responsibly sourced modular smartphone
introduced last year we saw one of the
companies representatives replace the
fairphone 2's display in less than 20
seconds here at MWC she then proceeded
to basically disassemble the entire
phone in less than a minute highlighting
just how easy it is for an end-user to
upgrade its individual components rather
than buy a whole new unit now despite
the upbeat messaging of today's event
it's hard to characterize the Yola
situation as hopeful the company wants
to push sailfish as a platform for
e-commerce and government use in BRICS
countries it's still poised to become
the official mobile platform of Russia
and on consumer devices it's offering
so-called super apps direct plugins that
make certain market specific
applications more obvious but which feel
suspiciously like bloat where it's
possible sailfish can survive and even
flourish in these niches but we're a
long way from the hopeful vibe of last
year's MWC where Yola had a new tab
but the big booth and a bombastic
attitude this year Yola is a company
still trying to recover from a
near-total implosion even for the
custodian of such a promising software
platform that's a tough row to hoe and
we'll be watching closely to see what
happens in 2016 there's still more to
see from MWC 2016 in barcelona so be
sure to subscribe here on youtube and
follow all the breaking news in the
pocketnow.com til next time this has
been michael fisher captain to phones on
twitter thanks for watching we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
