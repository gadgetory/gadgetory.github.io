Gingerbread and on the lg optimus 2x
it's Android 2.2 Froyo alright let's
continue on with our face off and put
our two combatants through some paces
here so you can see I've got a bowl shut
down what I want to do is fire them up
and see how much RAM is available at
boot up on both I'm sorry gonna both
fire it up there goes our galaxy s2 come
on lg optimus 2x there we go
well we've got a both booting up
alright galaxy s looks like it's ready
to roll let's go into settings under
applications under running services and
down here at the bottom we should get a
number of Gavin 594 at the moment bumps
up to 646 megabytes of free RAM 637 617
so it looks like it's gonna run
somewhere around 600 621 let's go into
settings on the optimus 2x under
applications and they're running
services we've got 143 plus 100 so
that's 243 we'll go around to 40 of
available ram on the optimus 2x after
boot 630 megabytes of free ram on the
galaxy s ii after boo alright first up
let's run the quadrant standard
benchmark test
I'll get that kicked off on both and
we've got a good clean start alright
let's check our results for the Quadra
Center benchmark test and the galaxy s2
came back at 32 42 and the optimus 2x at
2503 alright next up let's run our smart
bench test on both get that kicked off
alright let's take a look at the results
from our smart bench test and on the
prop productivity index the galaxy s2 is
the winner at 32 29 versus 30 98 and the
optimus 2x is the winner on the game
index at 26 17 versus 22 99 alright last
but not least let's run our Lim PAC
protest on both for Android and let's
run the benchmark and we've got the
winner is the galaxy s2 mega flops 47
point three one versus thirty seven
point one nine three and a time of one
point seven seven seconds versus 2.25
seconds on the optimus 2x I'll write it
up with a scientific test let's run
own unofficial speed test between these
to see what they're like in the real
world kind of Vance task killer on both
killed all the background apps let's
start opening some things up I'll try
and make these as obviously as close as
I can that was definitely the galaxy s2
on a calendar contacts galaxy s2 again
it's gonna maps galaxy s2 again it's a
way not by a whole heck of a lot but it
is winning gmail galaxy s2 again let's
try the market
I think the galaxy has to finished
everything loaded everything just a
little bit quicker let's try messaging
definitely the galaxy has to let's try
third party movies and again third party
that was the galaxy s2 as well so
there's a look at our unofficial speed
test alright I'm going to offer up a
little gaming on the galaxy s2 and
optimus 2x we're gonna fire up raging
thunder to give you a chance to see how
long it takes each of them will load the
game as well as what the graphic looks
like on each I'm gonna actually play a
little bit run a lap I can't promise any
entertainment value out of that but this
will give you a look at how they look as
far as load up galaxy s2 looks a hair
quicker not by a heck of a lot alright
and again I'm doing this to a camera on
so don't be too hard on me
alright let's try the Galaxy s2
oh they're very nice to that guy
gonna back
alright there's a look a little gaming
on our two combatants optimus 2x up on
top and galaxy s2 just below it alright
time to wrap up our pocket now face off
for dual-core smartphone world
domination between the Samsung Galaxy S
2 lg optimus 2x with our browser
comparison again I've gotten both
running up the same Wi-Fi network I have
the display set to automatic brightness
on both I've cleared the cache in
history on both and I have flash fully
enabled I figured hell a Duke or they're
supposed to be handled able to handle
heavy lifting so let's see if they can
handle some heavy lifting speaking of
heavy lifting let's head over to
Engadget and kick it off there and we're
off and it looks like pretty much a dead
heat to this point you know winners
gonna be Galaxy s2
followed right behind by the Optimus 2x
which you can see is again smooth but
not to the extent that the Galaxy S 2 is
and it is so sensitive I barely tap
something and it sent me to another
article we'll get it back load it again
and we're back to our home page it's
very very quick and you can definitely
feel the difference between the two when
you're working with the most double tap
to zoom in both handle that very well
pinch to zoom the both very responsive
no issues there one thing that is nice
on the optimus 2x is that you can't
pinch to zoom make the text larger
double tap on it to have a tree wrap and
fit the display the Galaxy S 2 does not
offer that double tap to zoom in by
pinch-to-zoom
double tap again it simply pulls back
away the Galaxy S 2 is definitely
smoother between the two alright let's
head over to pocket now on both of our
contestants and here we go and we're off
galaxy s2 is a winner of our first heat
and the winner here is going to be it
looks like galaxy s2 again looks like
they're choking on all the flash it
looks like the galaxy s2 is having them
handling it a little bit better I come
see optimus 2x galaxy s2 is done optimus
2x is still loading again incredibly
smooth no issues whatsoever double tap
to zoom in we're still waiting on the
optimus 2x to finish loading very good
ok got this all loaded up again it's not
as smooth a little sticky double tap to
zoom in pinch to zoom double tap there
we go
flash seems to be having its way here
with the optimus 2x a little bit alright
let's go in and read more on both of
these and see who gets there first while
big jump by the optimus 2x looks like
it's gonna take this one
and again we're waiting for the flash
and again it was the galaxy s2 alright
so there's a look at our browser
comparison between the galaxy s2 and
optimus 2x and based on our findings to
this point I would have to say when it
comes to dual-core world domination at
the moment the Samsung Galaxy s2 is the
winner hey I hope that's been helpful
this is Craig for Pocket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
