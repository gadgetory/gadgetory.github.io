pacu now calm and this is another
episode of the windows phone 7 app
roundup in which review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get started try is a simple drawing
application they cost 99 intends on the
windows marketplace so the cool thing
about this you can pick all these
different other tools to draw with so
let's say that I wanted to change it to
a stamp I have all these other stamps
that I can choose let's say I want to
add a present here I just put on there i
can go back and now let's say that i
wanted to change some sort of effect i
can go to magic and let's change it to
twist i can twist this here and twist
begin and keep on twisting until my
picture is totally distorted and to
start over all you can do is shake the
device your tuner is a paid for
application that costs one dollar
ninety-nine cents on the marketplace so
as you can see it's already trying to
tune my voice so let me pick a pitch and
see how well it does to knit
so apparently I am an a sharp so I can
change the pitch by going down here and
selecting the exact hurts that I'm
saying or making a note at I can go back
and I can also change my instrument to
select exactly which one I am playing
bubble jump is a pretty simple free game
in which you must jump your character
all the way up to the top to move on to
the next level so now I'm going to try
to catch some these bubbles by using
accelerometer built into my device and
some of the more colorful bubbles cause
you to fly further and then there's also
traps in which you have weights and
other obstacles and I just lost so now I
could try it again and will continue up
here and i'll catch more bubbles and the
game continues on just like this I by
smokey is an addictive and challenging
puzzle game in which you must blast the
emojis into these swirling vortex and
i'll show you how to do that all you
have to do is take one of your bombs and
arrange them in the exact position so
what's that I want to rank arrange him
right here I can either set the timer up
or set it down by scrolling clockwise or
counterclockwise hit the blast button
and now I sent my mokey a little too far
so I'll try that one again and hit the
blast button and hopefully he goes into
the semi into the vortex and now I beat
the level revenants is a really neat
game and it's pretty original I've never
seen anything like this dodge the game
is to move this swirling ball around the
obstacles or the enemies here before
they try to attempt attack you so let's
say we create a vortex and then when the
enemies go into their we score points
and the more points that we score the
further we get along into the game and
unfortunately if we hit one of them like
I just did then you lose a life and you
have to start over so this is that
