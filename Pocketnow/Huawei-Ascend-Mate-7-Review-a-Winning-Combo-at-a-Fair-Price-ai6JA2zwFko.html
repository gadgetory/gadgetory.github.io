smartphone your first thought probably
isn't huawei and with a bevy of great
options out there today who could blame
you
but if speedy performance a premium
design and a batterer you'll have to
work to kill sounds like a winning combo
to you then maybe it should be
I'm high at so huesemann bringing you
pocket now's better late than never
coverage of the huawei ascend mate 7
when we first saw the ascend May 7 at
FIFA last September we were taken aback
by its all-metal design from chamfered
edges to a seamless unibody enclosure
this is a great-looking handset and
every design aspect that we've praised
Apple and HTC for in the past is present
here the phone is relatively thin at 7.9
millimetres and an ever so slightly
rounded back makes it conform to the
palm of your hand it goes without saying
that top-notch build quality means
nothing if the phone isn't comfortable
to hold and that's a problem further
magnified with a larger screen like this
six inch er but it's clear that Huawei
plan ahead and took every measure
towards making it manageable the tight
bezels around the display and the
on-screen buttons both work together to
make the phone feel considerably smaller
than the Nexus 6 of the same display
size the only thing you won't find here
is a replaceable battery because with
the mates gargantuan 4100 milliamp hour
sealed unit you'll rarely ever need it
and in the likely event that the 16
gigabytes of internal storage here isn't
enough for you there's a microSD slot
for up to an additional 128 gigabytes of
space with that space you'll want to
download as much media as you can
because this 1080p IPS display is made
for viewing colors are pretty well
balanced with bright whites and blacks
just a touch great for our taste and
always included a temperature slider in
the settings
get exactly the look you're going for
the only real gripe we had with the
phone's hardware was the speaker which
is placed on the lower back right where
the phone rests in your hand and tends
to favor me it's pretty heavily in the
mix there's a DTS toggle in the settings
that's switched on by default but
turning it off just makes the output
sound more tinny so we just leave well
enough alone here but the real
showstopper on this device where Huawei
spared no expense is in the fingerprint
scanner where many have tried and failed
in the past with strange gestures and
awkward placement the ascent mate sevens
biometric identifier is intelligently
placed it's lightning fast and very
accurate and it can even be used when
the phone is on standby and in its multi
finger memory and the ability to snap a
photo by placing any finger on the
scanner while in the viewfinder and
you're looking at what's arguably the
smartest implementation of a smart phone
fingerprint reader out there the mate
seven runs a skinned version of Android
4.4.2 with the third iteration of
Huawei's in motion UI
front and center you'd be forgiven for
likening it to some other user
interfaces that sport rounded icons and
lack an app tray but comparisons out the
door emotion UI is a slick and
refreshing take on Android with plenty
of customization options take the themes
app which you guessed it lets you apply
different themes to spice up your home
and lock screens icons and font you can
even mix and match specific parts from
each theme and we especially liked the
magazine style for its shuffling
lockscreen wallpapers perusing through
the settings menu you'll find some of
huawei's twists to the Android
experience most interestingly a section
for tweaking the navigation bar you can
rearrange the traditional buttons and
even add two new buttons one to call
down the notification shade and one to
hide the buttons entirely we also
appreciated some included apps on the
phone like the built-in file manager and
shortcuts like pulling down in the
gallery to reveal the camera
there's also one-hand UI which shrinks
down the keyboard and other elements for
easier use with a single thumb assuming
you're using the default swipe for
huawei keyboard sadly but predictably
not every change to Android here
benefits the user and emotion UI is app
switcher is a prime example it's one of
the slowest experiences on the phone by
far and despite the typical 2 gigabytes
of RAM we found that too often upon
leaving an app the homescreen would have
to completely reload its contents one
more thing and this is a strange one if
you listen to music using a streaming
service like google play music or
Spotify you'll have to stay in the app
itself to play pause or skip tracks
because any time you try to do so from
the lock screen the phone instead starts
playing songs from the built-in music
player which in our case meant cycling
through a few cheesy pre-loaded songs
the 13 megapixel camera around the back
is situated next to an LED flash and was
a surprisingly good performer in most of
our testing the viewfinder app is simple
and clean and it packs most of the
features you'd expect to find like HDR
and panorama mode there's also a
mortifying Beauty level slider when
you're using a front-facing camera and
what Huawei is calling all focus on the
main camera this is similar to HTC duo
focus and that it lets you refocus a
shot after the fact but in a much more
authentic way the software actually
takes multiple shots in rapid succession
each with its own focal point and
intelligently lets you choose your
favorite focus afterwards beyond these
fun gimmicks the main sevens camera is
actually very capable the shots in
daylight look bright and vibrant I'll
get a tab over exposed in most cases and
even photos taken at night can look very
good in the right circumstances don't
expect as much from the front-facing
camera though which we found to be well
a front-facing camera
1080p video isn't half bad either though
without OIS cliffs tend to be a little
shaky and the audio starts breaking out
pretty quickly in loud environments in
general the mate7 performs very well
throughout day to day use as any device
with a whopping 8 cores at its disposal
should but as we mentioned before there
are some issues that permeate through an
otherwise smooth experience and even
typing this script in Evernote brought
up some pretty significant keyboard lag
it's important to note that by default
the mate sevens power saving mode is
enabled and turning it off makes for a
noticeably faster experience especially
in gaming we tested a few titles and
with power saving mode enabled even
threes was visibly choppy and just
looked off once you free the phone from
its own shackles games like asphalt 8
and Monument Valley start looking more
like what we're used to seeing now it's
no secret that demanding games take a
lot of power and that's where the mate7
truly impressed us we tried to kill this
thing in our week of testing we really
really tried but no matter how many HD
videos we watched on it or how many
crazy games we played it refused to give
in even after a 20-hour day with over 6
hours of screen on time call quality was
above average as well and our unit held
a solid signal over AT&amp;amp;T Mobile in the
Indianapolis Metropolitan Area you can
order your own ascend mate 7 stateside
from Amazon for about 520 US dollars
which puts it below the price point of
most other large flagship phones but is
it worth buying well if battery life and
build quality are most important to you
then yes we've tested very few phones
that can outpace or even match the mate
sevens longevity reports and though our
unit has a few scratches from day to day
use the aluminium frame might make you
reconsider getting a case
there are better options out there if
you most value media consumption and the
software experience has its quirks but
the ascend mate 7 is a solid choice for
all but the most demanding user and it
leaves us excited for what hallway has
