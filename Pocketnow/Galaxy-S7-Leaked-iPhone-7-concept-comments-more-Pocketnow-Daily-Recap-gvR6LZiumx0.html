hi man I do agree i just realized your
first name and frenches I like that
depends on how you pronounce it if
Christmas fell on Monday would you hate
that day you bet that's right it's that
time of the week I am hi I'm Eddie
Vetter this is pocket now and this is
the fog on out daily recap for last week
from las vegas on monday the topic was
pressure-sensitive displays analysts
predict that one in for smartphones are
gonna get it by next year and i asked
you if it's important to you out of that
we had 970 comments honestly for such is
just party gimmick personally some
people might use it but it's kind of
like wireless charging it's a luxury not
a necessity and i do agree that is the
main thing about or such i don't really
find the point to it particularly when
we've been able to press and hold for
the longest time just that's a little
functionality but then again it's not
like if you really need it pressure
sensitive display is on foreign to me
it's a cool feature but definitely
another choice breaker battery size and
life expandable storage oled and
Snapdragon 820 is my main demand on my
next phone and yeah our needs Barry
definitely and I do agree again it's a
cool thing to have but not necessarily
something great or there could just be a
feature that's not ready yet that could
take advantage of the feature in the
future you know focus the R&amp;amp;D and
manufacturing money on better camera
better associ√©s better displays better
designed waterproofing that our software
longer battery life please and Inter
preaching to the choir you could have
said it better on Tuesday the topic was
bluetooth headsets we saw some concepts
of the iphone 7 with the possible
bluetooth headset and i asked you if you
would mind that as well some people
particularly audiophiles don't like that
we had thirteen hundred and three
comments we start with bluetooth
headsets provide better sound quality
then count me in and I guess we're gonna
have to count you out I prefer the
effing 3.5 millimeter headphone jack my
hundred dollar headphones would be
worthless if they remove it and that is
the case for everyone but this wouldn't
be the first time that Apple did to
something and people just end up
accommodating to it removing the
headphone jack is effing stupid if
Samsung did it everybody s on them but
for
that case apple does it then people will
call a revolutionary in an innovative
and it doesn't necessarily happen that
way particularly because a samsung
builds a lot more products than Apple
and Samsung is actually more popular in
sales than Apple but then again i do get
you have a point you're talking about
fanboys and truth that is a case then on
wednesday we were talking about the
galaxy s6 we discussed the fact that
it's currently being tested for
marshmallow and we asked you what
features would you want such was to
include on this new update we had 656
comments and believe it or not we expect
it to start with ram management and yeah
true the only feature that I'm truly
excited for is doze I have no complaints
about my essex edge plus aside from the
mediocre battery life TouchWiz really
doesn't deserve all the hate that it
gets on this new degeneration of
galaxies and I have to agree with that
even though i don't like esthetics you
can just skin it out and then it's not
really bad when it comes to performance
again it just needs a better management
in certain things but a ram management
tent battery life and the yeah i do wish
for more efficiency and hopefully that
those feature can do that on thursday
the topic was the iphone mini as a we
saw that a Chinese carrier league that
and it seems that it could be a China
exclusive though again it just seems to
be I asked you that's important to your
what do you think about exclusive deals
we have 426 comments we start with being
exclusive to a market is never good and
I guess the iphone is the only example
of that whenever it does work malo came
with a larger iPhone why the hell would
I want 24 inch apple has gone crazy and
you would think that but you'd be amazed
at how many people still prefer the
smaller iPhone could not care less i
don't really like many concepts some
companies are doing with their flagships
honestly who wants a small phone a lot
of people do but i feel that as long as
they figure out the specifications and
not water down the phone then it could
be a compelling product then finally
friday the galaxy s7 was leaked by case
makers and that won't change in its
design i asked you if you would mind
that to be the case with this phone we
had 841 comments we start with the
design only needs expandable storage and
software needs cleaning that's about
and yeah could be I feel that there's
nothing wrong with keeping the design
another year far as the battery lasts
longer and they bring back expandable
storage and an IR blaster than I am
perfectly fine with it and yeah I do
miss the lack of an IR blaster on the
note lineup and the s6 edge+ I don't
know what happened there actually I'm
fine with the same design if Samsung can
make a phone faster and add a little
more battery life than the s7 will be a
winner in my book there'll be a winner
in my book to definitely battery life is
an extremely important issue that
Samsung needs to fix and yeah I would
love the expandable storage as well
that's it for the parking out daily
