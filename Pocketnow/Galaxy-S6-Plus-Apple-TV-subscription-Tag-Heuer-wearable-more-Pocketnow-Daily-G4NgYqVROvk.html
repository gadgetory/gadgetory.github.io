this is the way Samsung best things
apple TV streaming service might not see
the light of day at WWDC and tag heuer
gives a name to its future Android wear
SmartWatch I'm a meta vivetta and please
let us know in the comments is the sound
better I've been trying everything here
this is out daily there are some
significant official news today starting
with suz as the company has just
unveiled a ton of products at computex
starting with the azusa and watch to the
zenfone selfie and threes and tablets
now I'm not going to bore you with
specific ations look to the scripture of
full details on the products but the
coolest takeaway here is that zen watch
too does it only look beautiful but it
brings some boosted specs in addition to
a lot of Apple watch style watchbands
make sure you watch the video in the
description as well other official news
today in a way have tech warrior CEO
claiming the name for the future tax
lawyer of Android wear wearable or way
or a bowl whatever it's going to be
called and to make it even more
confusing it's going to be called the
Carrera wearable a 1 or Carrera I think
it's going to be I don't know it's just
crazy again this was just a statement
that he made he's not really naming it
officially but it seems that that's
going to be the name of this product now
they're apparently working a lot and
making this a unique thing in for a
thousand four hundred dollars it should
be we'll keep you posted as we learn
more I would seize the Samsung is not
done with project zero we've gots
trusted sources claiming that there is
another bigger plus product in the works
and we're not sure this is part of the
galaxy note lineup it's not specific as
for the rumors but we do know that this
is a flagship with the bigger chassis
and even though we don't have any
details as to when we can expect this
product again our biggest bet is that
this is the galaxy note 5 and it seems
that it will carry as much of the galaxy
s6 as possible or we call the galaxy s6
plus we'll see HTC is another company
with products up its sleeve as chair
Wang was recently on record to claim
that there is a new series of
smartphones coming later this year so
yeah it seems that the one line
but necessarily going to die but it's
going to have something else and the
biggest problem is we're not sure this
is going to be a mid-range or a lower
level or a higher level than the one
particularly because there's really no
higher than the one m9 plus for example
so it's really interesting to see what
share wearing will bring to the table as
HTC continues to shuffle things around
and finally for the very interesting and
probably disappointing news of the day
we've been hearing that Apple watch to
reinvent TV or the way we consume cable
and the way they plan to do that is with
the new subscription service and it
seems that the company is planning
something major locally Apple's a
biggest claim is that it's just so
difficult to be able to convince so many
TV companies on every region and
apparently that is exactly what they are
trying to do and it seems there is
hardware involved in these companies
have not signed the deal yet so seems
that apple will be pushing this until
later this year but it leads me to the
question of the day what would a TV
streaming service have to have for you
to want to pay for it and how much would
you be willing to pay because in my case
i wouldn't pay more than what i pay for
cable and i paid twenty dollars for it I
know Chief but leave us a comment down
below what is your case and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video with snow
machine focus on out comment
