built on a lot of scrap Apple decides to
address all the complaints of iOS 9.3
with an update and microsoft claims that
windows 10 mobile is sadly not its
priority I'm high Meadow Ravenna and
there came a point today where the UPS
guy just didn't want to see me anymore
there's a lot of work coming this is
parking out daily
official news today begin with Apple for
three different reasons number one
iPhone se s are already arriving at door
steps in addition to the ipad pro 9.7
inch that just arrived in my doorstep
but then again even more interesting is
the company's launch of iOS 93 one with
all the bug fixes for all the palms with
nine dot three you'll notice that I've
has were kind of forced to get the
update so if you haven't I highly
suggest you do and I'm moving the
spotlight over to Sampson this is rather
interesting the company recently
published an ad for a TV that show
kissed the guy that looked a lot like
soccer legend pele you know the
Brazilian and also doing a move that was
particular to Pele something that made
him famous when he used to play soccer
up to the point where Bella has now
decided to sue samsung for 30 million
dollars over deceiving marketing we
cannot wait to see how this is gonna
play out stay tuned and for those of you
that went crazy in the comments
yesterday / no news regarding build
there was a reason for that the
company's Terry Myerson just came on
record to state that even though the
company is invested in smartphones their
priorities for bringing developers into
Microsoft's ecosystem are not really
focused on mobile according to Myers and
they're focused on bringing this
elsewhere and it's something I really
don't understand I mean Microsoft is
such a large company I cannot understand
why the company can not figure out
mobile and hasn't been able to figure
out mobile for decades so I think this
is just the blunt excuse but then again
I would love to know what you think in
the comments down below when going back
to Apple we've got some very interesting
tear downs of the iphone SE already you
know that's a thing and one of the most
interesting and revealing parts of these
tear downs is just how much Apple
recycles from its previous units there
are a ton of parts that make up the
iphone SE that come from the iphone 5s
and yet there are others that come from
the iphone 6s but the fact that there
are so many parts from a device that's
three years old is rather striking it
means that either these parts were
really good or that apple is really
great at recycling or that the company's
really cheap and it makes sense i mean
the phone is adequately priced and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with well AT&amp;amp;T ZTE and cyanogen as
we've got some interesting reports
claiming that all three companies are
partnering to build a smartphone that
does not depend on google and this isn't
the first time that we've seen fork
versions of android we've seen it from
the Amazon on their Kindle lineup and
while cyanogen became famous over the
idea of getting rid of Google and we
also see it and pretty much every
smartphone in china so it just is very
interesting to see that AT&amp;amp;T wants to
bring this to the United States and to
the point where it leads me to the
question of the day would you want to
buy a smartphone that does not depend on
Google services or that does not allow
them or require them or just make some
optional which would be your pick
because in my case I am so dependent on
Google services I would totally not buy
one but we look to know in your opinion
what would you do in your case friends
