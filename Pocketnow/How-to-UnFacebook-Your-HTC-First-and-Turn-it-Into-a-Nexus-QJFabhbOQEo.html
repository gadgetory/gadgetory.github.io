of Facebook there is a redeeming feature
of the HTC first beneath the Facebook
home it runs stock Android on Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is how
to on Facebook your HTC first it's a
commonly known fact that the HTC first
is unlike most other HTC Android
smartphones not only because it's the
first smartphone to come prepackaged
with facebook home but because it does
not have any version of since UI running
beneath facebook's launcher instead it
runs a mostly stock version of jelly
bean android 4.1.2 and unlocking this
mostly stock interface and turning the
HTC first into a stock Android device a
rare yet highly soft feature is actually
very simple
there are even various degrees in which
you can disable Facebook home if you'd
like Facebook home and want to keep it
active but one a quick and simple way to
jump back to the stock Android launcher
there's an easy way to do that if
instead you want a small dose of
Facebook home but prefer the standard
launcher you can leave the lock screen
notification portion of Facebook home
active or if you really don't like
Facebook home and you only bought the
first two enjoy an HTC device with stock
Android out of the box you can quickly
disable all Facebook home functions and
forget it even exists the hardest part
is figuring out how you want to interact
with Facebook home if at all fortunately
there's no real way to mess up here so
if you decide any of this is not for you
going back to how things were in the
beginning is as simple as hitting a
single icon seriously to keep Facebook
home completely enabled and only jump to
the stock launcher periodically simply
press the home button swipe left to
access the application drawer scroll
down to the very bottom and select the
more icon this immediately takes you to
the stock launcher when you press the
home button again you'll jump right back
into facebook home it's that simple
best of all this more icon can be added
to your quick launcher the user-defined
pages of applications to the right of
the application drawer throw the stock
launcher icon in one of these and you're
no more than three taps away from the
stock launcher at any given time say
you're not a fan of Facebook home
appearing when you press the home button
but you don't mind it being the first
thing you see when you hit the power
button there's a quick fix for that to
pull down the notification shade and
press the Settings icon select apps and
in the alt tab find facebook home which
is listed as simply home select home
scroll down and press clear defaults
when you press the home button again you
will be prompted to select a default
launcher select launcher which is the
stock launcher and press always when you
press the power button on your device
you will now see your miss notifications
in facebook home you will also have
access to the previous application
Facebook Messenger and the Facebook home
application drawer but when you press
the home button you'll be taken back to
the stock Android launcher if neither of
those are what you're after there is one
final solution shy of routing the device
and it's most definitely the easiest of
them all
from anywhere in facebook home press the
menu button and select home settings the
very top option is turn off facebook
home confirm the action and reap the
benefits of a stock Android experience
if you later decide you want to turn
facebook home back on for any reason
simply tap the home icon in the
application drawer select home always
and you're back to normal
remember though if you select the stock
launcher as your default Facebook home
will once again appear whenever you
press the power button to turn the
device on to turn this off again you
will have to disable it in the facebook
home settings thanks for watching and I
hope you enjoyed the video if you did be
sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe and give us a follow in all
the usual places twitter google+ and
