recording mechanism it's already
recording oh we need a theme song yeah
how about we use the the old song which
we are using in the videos maybe maybe
or we can just sing together yeah too
bad that's got no lyrics uh-oh the theme
song yeah all right well we should
probably get started hey we should
actually include this part in the
recording just for fun okay I'm in all
right great well hey everyone welcome to
the eighth pocket now pocket cast we
skipped last week because there's a lot
going on with ctia Evan was out at ctia
so let me introduce everyone I'm Brandon
minimun editor-in-chief of pocket now
Evan blast our managing editor is here
with us say hi Evan hey guys hey Miranda
hey and Anton Dean Aggies here also
known as Tony a senior editor say hi
Tony hey Brandon hey Evan hey everybody
awesome so we've got so much to talk
about today and a lot of exciting things
a lot of forward momentum in the
smartphone industry which always makes
us sleep better at night somehow evan
has just gotten back just a few days ago
from ctia where lots of new phones were
announced Evan what would you say how
would you summarize the event if you had
to do so in a few sentences exhausting
from my point of view from fit for those
of you that don't know covering a trade
show is exhausting it's constant walking
and writing and calling and yeah I mean
for someone who you know whose job it is
to sit behind a monitor for for most of
the day not used to nearly this much
walking you know must have been a couple
miles each day we need to meet you we
need to all exercise so that you know
these trade shows be done but the little
easier yeah but um I'm more serious note
um I thought there was definitely some
good stuff there and a few surprises but
but in general and in talking to some of
my colleagues I think
I think most people found this to be a
rather uneventful event if you will I
mean and just like Mobile World Congress
just like CES it seems that Android ran
the show here yeah but but unlike those
events which which did have quite a bit
of announcements there there weren't
really that many new phones I mean we
had the you know the evo 3d the the g2x
at well some of these are rebrands so
you know how many new new phones were
there at besides that the evo 3d I can't
think about eight I'm getting back to my
old rent the HTC allow any of you
members of the media to have some
hands-on with Facebook devices because
they wouldn't allow us to touch them at
NBC I didn't ask I didn't see any of
those devices there oh so they weren't
even there hmm yeah that those should be
landing I guess when is it where this
event later in the spring or maybe the
summer the chacha and the salsa and the
tango and the merengue or the
cha-cha-cha as we've heard of chacha is
not a word to use in spring yeah that's
that's all very confusing so yeah this
uh this evo 3d was somewhat of a
surprise though not a couple of days
before the event pretty impressive
hardware here impressive enough to where
Evan is satisfied having written to HTC
many times expressing his dissenting
dissatisfy word this is satisfaction the
satisfaction yes oh that's happened
schooled by the Romanian on your grandma
I know but they but they really came to
the table with some good stuff I mean
two cores clocking at one point two
gigahertz hopefully batteries not too
bad 3d display with a dedicated camera
button so you can switch from 2d to 3d
they brought a new version of sense to
the table with a spinny carousel thingy
that kind of comes off the flyer haven't
actually got some hands-on time with the
evo 3d what did you think about it
I thought it was a great device I mean
you know you always have to preface
these things by saying that but you know
probably wasn't running final firmware
in this case Polly nowhere near close to
final form work because it's several
months out yet from from getting
released but the functionality i thought
was impressive there there really is a
3d effect to the screen when their
proper content is loaded up you know so
that's not just necessarily marketing
but the question is and this is the
question we've been asking over and over
is this something people really want at
least in the demos I saw me to it it was
a neat demo but I don't think that
they've come up with a lot of content
dumb where I should say a lot of
pre-recorded content that we're really
adds to the experience now one one area
I think that could probably change is
games I think they'll be able to do some
clever things with 3d that new we
haven't seen on you know 2d sex before
but as far as you know the blockbuster
bringing out you know movies in 3d it's
you know it's really just going to be
you know sort of gimmicky up until
they're they're they're adding some more
on some more value to the content I
should say yeah it sounds like games is
really going to be the the main focus of
showing off 3d technology once once
people start doing that both of you have
actually experienced a glasses-free 3d
3d display on a phone Tony I think you
said that it hurt your eyes when you
looked at the optimus 3d yes it might
have something to do with the either
screen resolution or refresh rate or
simply my eyes are bad and I was asking
Evan this question I think it was a
couple of days ago and the he told me
that he couldn't really see the screen
directly but he didn't notice any
flickering and I did notice light
flickering when not looking directly at
the LG optimus 3d screen and this brings
up a question to to you Evan did you see
any dedicated 3d software coming from
HTC pre-installed on the EVO 3d because
if i remember well on the optimus 3d at
MVC in barcelona we sell some dedicated
YouTube application in 3d I know
excuse me that's a good question I
didn't I didn't really look um I will
say that that anecdotally from from
other people who have seen both devices
and who have used both devices I guess I
could have taken a look at the optimus
3d at dca I probably should have done
that that the the evo 3d screen gives a
better 3d effect than the the optimus 3d
mm-hmm that's interesting and of course
the the e-book 3d has a 960 x 540
display whereas the optimus 3d has an
800 x 480 display not sure if that makes
much of a difference at CES I saw
50-inch glasses free TV and the two
problems with it were one it was very
low resolution which really doesn't
matter for a phone and to the viewing
angle was incredibly limited did you
guys find that if you move the phone
kind of wrong the 3d effect turn too
blurry junk yeah but i think that's
that's almost going to be inherent in
the technology you know you're the 3d
it's the way they're designing it is for
you know the effect could be for the
viewer looking head on and and I'm not
sure that and you know until we get some
of these um these TVs like they have in
and sit in some smaller on lcds where
it's a you know you can get a totally
different picture from each angle you
have someone sitting on the left and
someone sitting on the right and they
can be seeing something different until
they bring that to 3d this is going to
be a problem that I'm you know I don't
even want to call a problem it's just
going to be a part of the experience yes
if a drawback definitely it's the same
ya go i'm sorry i don't know i would i
was going to say that it's definitely
the same thing with the optimus 3d too
so with desert tolerance took
approximately 22 maximum 25 degrees in
angle in on the side so you have to stay
straight in the front of the screen to
see the 3d effect on the optimus 3d but
i played with the sharp links 3b also at
MVC and that device seem to have a
larger
doing angle in terms of the 3d of course
but but larger probably means that if
you've got five friends and you're
showing them a 3d video probably two of
them on the three of them yeah two or
three of them will see you will see
front in front of the device and the one
on the left and the one on the right but
the fourth and the fifth will not see
anything well if you guys use the the 3d
assets where you do need glasses yeah
yeah you have captain and are they
limited as well or is it is only these
glasses free that are where this is an
issue i think it's the glasses free and
i think this is why we're sort of in in
terms of the big screen televisions for
your home that's why we're stuck in this
glasses thing because the technology
isn't there yet to do glasses free at a
wide viewing angle it'll be here
eventually but right now it's just it's
too expensive to do it's funny that
we're saying that because just a year
ago we were saying glasses-free 3d was
too expensive to do so so it's probably
just going to get better with each
generation I don't know if the pathology
actually allows for a larger viewing
angle in 3d take only the classic LCD
TFT IPS or AMOLED screens they all lose
quality when you are viewing them from
the sides now some start losing at 45
degrees some third are thought the Sun
below but because of the glasses free
technology which combines the left and
right the images like on an interlaced
video but not really interlaced because
of this technology i'm not sure they
will be able to magnify that angle yeah
most probably they will improve it but
don't expect this is my personal opinion
don't expect to see a wide viewing angle
on a glasses 3d display yeah we're gonna
have to get in our time machine once
again we're working on building one
right now but we can't talk much about
it haha i have to say that excuse me in
general that seems the reception to 3d
hasn't been great all that so far you
know I sorta compared to when HD came on
seen in you know even though HD it was
sort of slow and getting adopted I think
everyone saw the value there yeah and
what was holding most people back from
getting a set which is they were they
were really expensive yeah but now that
you know they're there seems to be
almost a bit of a backlash against 3d as
as if some people think that that the
manufacturers are sort of pushing the
technology on us and we don't really
want it yeah I mean it's very clear that
the the manufacturers need to bridge the
gap to to start generating profits again
because everyone bought an HDTV and if
they didn't they're going to buy one
soon and so so TV sales are going to
plummet and the only way to get them
back up again is to have something new
and exciting and yeah I think there is
backlash I don't think people want to
sit in their living room with you know
funky glasses on and I don't think they
want to pay a big premium for something
that there's not much content for still
I mean there's just like two or three 3d
channels out there it's like HD all over
again right cool well let's move on a
sprint also announced the kind of knew
about this the nexus s 4g coming this
spring at one hundred and ninety nine
dollars that's going to be a cool phone
i mean the nexus s is a very lean
android phone with no UI junk and to add
wimax to that is a pretty good
proposition nothing terribly interesting
beyond that to either of you when I
comment on that or should we move on to
the next thing now it's just the Nexus S
you're right just the next yeah I here
with you I didn't for anyone who's on on
sprint it's going to be a really
compelling device indeed okay so another
phone announced was the LG Thrill that's
it the 18th he's really good with the
inspiring names pun intended they've got
the inspire and the thrill and what
other uplifting names use infuse yeah
you see 7's good but yeah that that
one's a little depressing yeah so I mean
the third not much to talk about here
either the LG throws coming to AT&amp;amp;T
it's going to be the optimus 3d in the
u.s. you know Tegra 3 or 3 that'd be
great patek or two glasses-free 3d um so
yeah yeah it's just a thing that that
18t sort of sort of one upping t-mobile
a little bit with the you know the
thrill is basically you know a 3g
enabled optimus 2x which tmobile is
getting is the g two acts and you know
within within a couple months you know a
little bit over a year it's really not
going to matter yeah it's it's kind of
funny because LG has the optimus 3d if
you take out the 3d part you get the
optimus 2x now HTC has the evo 3d and if
you take out the 3d you get the pyramid
perhaps hmm I see what you did there
yeah I've been I've been thinking about
that all week said it uh we don't know
that to be true do we Brandon I mean for
all we know the pyramid could have 3d
right as Tony's mentioned on several
occasions you know the pyramid is one of
the is one of the most iconic on
three-dimensional shapes oh that is a
very very interesting observation but
then on the other hand I mean how often
does HTC really you know associate or
you know make a connection between the
code names and what the phone does
functionally you know what a few of them
yes like Mondrian that was that was
definitely hearkening to to Windows
Phone 7 and where the the homepage you I
came from you know that guide Pierre
Mondrian here with the paintings so so
some of them they do but but I would say
that the vast majority they don't this
plus then there's the the other parts of
the story which is the marketing and
sales part we know that the main markets
for smartphones are the USA and Europe
and if you take out the 3d from from the
evo 3d and you get it to Europe with
other 3d then Europe will remain without
any 3d HTC devices and I think HTC does
not want to do that Sharona on the on
the other hand the evo 3d is is and is
going to be a very thick and heavy
device as thick as an EVO 4G and they
need to they need to bring these specs
for qhd screen 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor in a smaller petite sexy razor
thin form factor and they can't do that
with the 3d added remember what we just
saw yesterday Brandon is that it's very
very likely that that the evo 3d is
going to be released internationally
there was a whole specs page up with
mentions of gsm bands all over the place
and that HTC pulled that down today so
it's no longer there and and the phone
is even unbranded it it doesn't have
sprint branding on it the pictures that
they use so I mean I don't I don't think
it can be any more clear that there's a
gsm version of the that phone on the way
the question is whether the pyramid is
going to be that or if the pyramid will
mix the 3d display know that i'm saying
is that i mean we have we actually seen
pictures of the gsm evo 3d if you want
because if the only evo 3d out there is
on sprint then only pictures of it
should have sprint branding on it right
that makes sense yep have you ever seen
like you know a droid incredible without
Roger branding knew how so so the only
reason that they would have all that
stock photography of have the evo 3d
without without a mention a sprint on it
is because it's a it's also an
international gsm phone and speaking of
verizon when do you guys think verizon
will have its first 3d device and what
would it be because obviously a TNT has
its own sprint has its own silver aizen
has to keep it up it'll be from motorola
live at mmm it's good thought Samsung
needs a 3d phone too yes they don't have
one soon I do too I think
comes in the same boat as LG we've
discussed this before and that you know
these are our manufacturers who have
thrown several verticals but you know
being both home theater and mobile so so
no and they're one of their thoughts is
that you know to push people into these
multi-thousand dollar 3d tvs they first
need to have content that they're going
to want to see on them and what better
way then then to put these stereoscopic
stereoscopic cameras in their pockets as
part of their phones it's a really good
point I think a lot of people would be
more client inclined to buy a 3d TV if
they knew they could play their 3d
videos taking on their smartphone on on
the TV right exactly i mean right now
you know most people are only going to
have you know the phone itself to
playback this content on yep and that
brings up another point is that are
these are these these self captured 3d
videos and photos interoperable between
cameras like if i take a 3d picture on
my EVO 3d can i view it back in 3d on my
thrill 4g hmm i think it should be
because it's it should be an industry
standard you know I'll definitely should
be but but it should hmm vision we
should look into that that's actually an
extremely important thing to consider
hmm we're gonna have to reach out to a
distant Peaks get some good some man and
I asked friend that the same question
when I was at ctia and and I didn't have
a good answer for room hmm well
basically right at diving no I don't you
know it's not the type of thing that
that they're going to tell you in
training I don't want to get ticking now
but from what I know about 3d recording
and stereoscopic cameras is that you
basically have two cameras with two
lenses the left camera captures the
right image and the right camera
captures the left image and then it's
interlaces and puts it in one left one
right one left one right and generates
the 3d image and this should be the
industry standard all 3d devices should
use
so I think I think from my point of view
that they should be able to play back
each other's content and even if you
look at televisions I mean you get a 3d
blu-ray you could plug it into a variety
of 3d TVs and it'll work just fine so
perhaps there's some standardization
going on there alright well let us move
on we were also talking about t-mobile's
g2x the first time that the G brand
phone of the G brand doesn't have a
keyboard not really that big of a deal
just kind of an interesting observation
it's basically the optimus 2x another
Tegra 2 phone not much to speak of in
that respect so it's going to be a
popular handset though um obviously
because it's fast but also because like
the Nexus S it's going it goes naked
without you know any any UI on top of
Android its naked and I think isn't this
the first smartphone to do 42 megabits
per second hspa+ that I'm not sure I
mean it's definitely you know 4G or or
you know t mobile's 4g hspa+ but i'm not
sure if it's 40 20 or 21 um Joe wrote
about this I'm gonna try to pull it up
before the end of the call but that's
what I remember which is pretty
significant because in theory out of the
gate it should be able to do faster data
speeds than even the thunderbolt which
is on LTE that would be getting back to
your question just a little bit
t-mobile's G brand moving away from
keyboards I think it's normal with the
g2x to drop a keyboard because t-mobile
definitely does not want you to yank its
own sidekick 4g which is new and which
has a keyboard and which is a reborn
sidekick so having another G device with
a keyboard I think would be bad for
sales for the sidekick 4G so this was
something maybe they had in mind fair
point fair point yes so here's the
article
yeah so the g2x can do 42 down compared
to the g2 which can do 14.4 down real
world testing you get about half of that
around seven maybe ten megabits per
second down so we're talking like 20
megabits per second down in optimum
conditions on the on the g two x and the
Thunderbolt can do about half that so
that's uh that's some pretty compelling
stuff there it's going to be pretty
pretty popular as mm-hmm awesome all
right so let us move on we saw this past
the FCC ages ago but it was officially
announced that AT&amp;amp;T is getting the hd7
with an S on it s seems to be the the
hot letter to use yes yeah my prediction
desire HD s coming up you heard it here
first desire is that what you think the
successors gonna be called I don't know
like you said we had now we have the
incredible s the Wildfire s desire s and
the hd7 s that's for phones so you know
what why would they want to mess things
up with the desire HD I agree with you
Evan ninety-nine percent that's that one
percent which I don't agree with you is
that the incredible s is different from
the incredible and so are the other s
devices while the hd7 s is not much
different from the hd7 now give or take
the the new the new screen okay well
well three you know revised devices in
one you know slightly not but still you
know there's there's definitely a trend
here that we're seeing yeah that's
that's my 99 percent so I agree with you
here we are status statistician yes so
the big difference between the hd7 S&amp;amp;E
she said is what you can achieve are
just all around him I the most i was
playing with the Thunder ball and it
fell on the keyboard um the hd7 s has a
super LCD screen which is a really good
thing because if you ever have seen in
HD 7 you know that the screen is in
that that nice it's just a standard LCD
and the colors are a little bit the
washed-out contrast isn't great even
motion looks strange when you flick
through the program list so presumably
the hd7 s on AT&amp;amp;T will will fix that
problem I headphones fell off and i have
a mess over here Jack Ebert survived the
Thunderbolt yeah surprisingly i mean the
Thunderbolts like seven pounds is huge
here yeah so the hd7 s on AT&amp;amp;T is this
is this an important device for for
eighteen t do you guys think or is it
kind of just a marginal thing that that
a lot of people really don't care that
much about I think that they are
targeting the the segment of the market
which is in 24 inch plus screens now I
think AT&amp;amp;T has already two or three
devices it's I think this around the
focus and the LG quantum up the a
quantum Optimus 7q and they are all 3.74
pointing to and 3.85 we go well they
don't have anything beyond 4 inches and
yeah here comes the hd7 s with 4.3
inches yeah I think what it does I think
it says more maybe about 18 tease
intentions then than anything else in
that you know clearly there you know
AT&amp;amp;T seems to be in it to win it with
with Windows Phone 7 to have four
devices on you know in a lineup when
when everyone else has one or zero right
yeah what else to do it has to well I
guess you could say that that t-mobile
has to with the venue pro and HD 7 but
the venue pro isn't really available in
most people so yeah I mean 18t now seems
to be like the de facto carrier to go to
if you want a windows phone as Microsoft
and I was the premium carrier yeah and
there that's certainly showing 1 I
wonder if they have a sort of different
financial arrangement than then the
other carriers perhaps 18d gets gets to
keep more of the profits where they pay
a lower licensing fee although and they
it's the oems that are paying the
licensing fees to Microsoft yeah I
suspect that there that Microsoft
sweetened it up um but I would imagine
that after the first round after those
first three phones that you know if they
didn't do that well that the AT&amp;amp;T
wouldn't have taken the hd7 you know no
matter what the incentives were that's a
good point this might be a testament to
Windows Phone 7 sales right now or at
least enthusiasm yeah I don't think we
really hurt anywhere that that windows
phone 7 sales are are bad right now
maybe one report but the majority
reports say you know it's it's doing
okay you know some places it's they're
moving pretty briskly some places there
they're just moving a little bit but
they seem to be you know at least moving
everywhere indeed indeed and we're going
to talk more about Windows Phone 7 and
the updates in a few minutes we wanted
to switch gears a little bit and talk
about the 18t t-mobile merger that is
sort of really big news for the industry
but we're trying to figure out what this
means for for you the consumer when you
guys think that this is this a good
thing bad thing or good and bad thing
okay so here's what I think first of all
if big if if it gets approved the merger
because I've heard some rumors that it
might not or at least not in its current
form what I think of the merger is this
taking into consideration the rules of
free markets with free competition the
more players and a market the better for
the consumer the less players on the
market the more chances are for for a
company to take advantage of that and
get into a monopoly position of course
there's sprint and there's verizon but
instead of having four players there
will only be three players and we know
for sure that sprint and verizon will
not make a merger because neither of
them is interested I think that from the
point of view of those one
30 million or how many subscribers will
be on AT&amp;amp;T NT this would be good on a
short term but what if I'm just asking
what if in two or three years AT&amp;amp;T
subscribers will see some raised feet so
it's a question yeah I I I can't really
see all that many benefits for the
consumer you know how much did that
coming to the 18 teen singular merger
gonna pick the average cell phone user
no certainly you don't hear about a lot
of 18 key customers you know Sam it to
have the too much bandwidth that they
never drop any calls because that's not
true so yeah I I don't know III I kind
of agree with Tony here that I I don't
see all that many benefits to to only
having one gsm carrier in the u.s.
although as as verizon moves over more
and more towards LTE verizon can sort of
be considered a gsm carrier too but yeah
in general i don't think that that that
but that consumers are going to see the
benefits of you know economies of scale
or these all these synergies that
they're talking about I don't really
think that the average person on the
ground is going to get to see a lot of
those benefits unless you're an AT&amp;amp;T
shareholder of course uh I mean maybe
even not them if you know if if things
bomb like so some other mergers have
bombed and then everyone loses yeah what
I was wondering about and I was writing
about this in a little editorial this
this seems like it would be possible but
let's fast forward a year or two from
now and you've got AT&amp;amp;T towers you've
got t mobile towers AT&amp;amp;T operates on 850
1900 megahertz and t-mobile operates on
1720 100 megahertz so does this mean
we're going to have quad band UMTS
phones that can latch onto tmobile
towers and each
t towers no i don't think so i think
they said that that t-mobile's 1700
bandwidth which i believe is their only
3g bandwidth it's going to be
transitions over to LTE spectrum so so
that means that that if anything
t-mobile customers are going to have to
be transitioned over to 3g devices that
work on a 50 1900 so so Neil basically
we know 1700 3g within you know X number
of months after the murder should have
you approved so we thought won't that
impact people that whose phones rely on
that frequency no because they're going
to you know they're going to do it
slowly enough so they say that that
people won't be affected that you know
it'll be over a number of years it's not
going to happen you know within a couple
months or year or wherever so so what
they're telling us they seem pretty
confident that that the the person the
end user isn't going to see isn't going
to see any effect to this are they going
to peel the 20 100 megahertz band um I
didn't know that they were using that
now for uh for for anything any of it
you know they do 1700 for 3g and then
850 1904 for 2g I think it's kind of
like 18 key has it where you can be on
the 850 or the 1900 I think the 2100 is
probably list utilized but it's there
for certain situations where for some
reason the AWS 1700 band isn't available
yeah I will say that the devices that I
see going through the FCC for tmobile do
not have 2100 dot that's being tested
it's only 850 nineteen hundred and
seventeen hundred there we go very good
let us move on to the next bit here so
Amazon this week launched their app
store and I'm trying to load it now but
it doesn't seem to be working have you
guys had a chance
to play with the amazon appstore no not
really me neither so it's got buttons
and apps well actually now I mean it's
it's all right I still I'm not going to
use it over only the the App Store and
Android the regular have main does it
have an app yet for android yeah yeah
definitely and you use that yeah yeah we
actually posted a video about it so it's
what just happened something weird
popped up yeah it's a there's an actual
app that is the app store the only
really cool part about it is that it has
angry birds rio and I mean everything
else seems to be sort of redundant but
lesser quantity there's maybe five
thousand apps in the amazon appstore and
there's of course 150,000 plus in the
market sure but you know we know better
than anyone that that numbers really
don't mean anything I mean you know
those thousand fart apps and radiation
apps and you know there's there's so
many bad apps out there that that I
don't that I think at this point numbers
me nothing you know I mean the
difference between an app store with a
hundred thousand and 200,000 apps I
wouldn't say that that one's going to be
better by the other one by all means
right or do you think that that if you
have more apps overall that's indicative
of that you also more good apps I think
people want quality apps and I think
what Amazon is doing is providing a
level of filtration that the current
appstore for android just doesn't have
so i'm looking through these apps and i
don't see these like these crappy apps
that that just clog the search results
in the amazon app are not the amazon
appstore the android app store so i
think that's that's one of the major
benefits so the overall number long term
will be smaller in terms of available
apps but presumably though there will be
higher quality apps how do they do the
filtering I mean is there a team who is
reviewing any application submission and
they decide no fart app no good Angry
Birds good or are they based on reviews
from the google markets or plums this i
think that they probably have their own
team no just like any other and the
other product being sold amazon i would
imagine that that each software title
needs to get vetted you're right i have
a colleague who submitted an app and it
takes several days they think amazon
team tests it they make sure it's
appropriate whereas on the android app
store the android market you know right
now in 10 minutes I could have an appt
up in the market without any filtration
which is also good well which is good
and in a way it's good for the
developers Oh crazy ringing going on
here uh-huh bet you're great brington
that's hilarious my god oh man summer
training oh I would cut this part out I
don't know if I want everyone to know
that that's your ringtone brand which
ranked oh there were three phones
ringing in here whatever like that sort
of the pop was you know yeah you know
yeah i was hoping to listen to that ring
tone of yours with the interference of
gsm which is great by the way annoying
but great actually uh let me digress for
one woman I got it I got it we were
talking about this last week you guys
should listen to this the Nexus S has
these crazy ringtones that sound like
gsm interference listen okay so he's got
that and then this one awesome have any
bonus yet it best yeah so I was going to
say something before before we went off
in this digression it I think that the
the timing of the release of or the
debut of the amazon appstore is
interesting and I sure they didn't time
it this way but this it's coming just
you know week or two after there was
quite a bit of malware in the
market that you know Google had to
actually go and move off people's phones
right and so so I think you know now now
here's the Amazon with the you know I'm
presumably much more secure system where
where that wouldn't happen because those
types of apps would would never make it
through the the vetting process indeed
ah okay so here's a question for you we
know that there's the nvidia tegra zone
which is the filtering application which
filters applications from the google
market based on the requirements of
smartphones and tablets if you have a
Tegra 2 powered smartphone or tablets
use the TegraZone and there you have all
the applications which are for your
device filtered now say we have an
application on the google market which
is 499 and you have the same application
on the amazon market which is 399 or 299
where will the TegraZone point you to
buy the application will tigra zone have
let's say a deal with the amazon
appstore or not so this is just a
question or maybe something to think of
hmm it's possible that sort of like when
you let's see if you have two programs
on your android phone to do the same
thing like an adobe reader and also
quickoffice or something and you go to
read a PDF it says choose which program
you want to use so maybe it'll it'll
operate like that we got to get a Tegra
2 phone to test that with but it's
possible it would happen on the device
level where it would give you the choice
well that will be the smart thing to do
because it will bring up results from
both markets and you can see where it's
the better offer was where it is cheaper
and you can buy from the other market
totally and there's another good thing
to 2d amazon appstore and i think they
are giving away a free paid application
i mean they're giving away for free a
paid application every day a different
application which is good that is pretty
cool that is a cool and here's a yet a
third question is how long do you think
it's going to be important
has to change the name of the app store
haha well I think they already changed
it because it's app store in one word
and it's not app store as Apple trade
market I think they gave our App Store
are gonna fly yeah you're right about
that they put the words together it's so
funny for like two years if you go to
amazon.com you'd see the kindle as the
top feature thing but now they're really
pushing the amazon appstore for android
and they're showing it with a really
weird looking old HTC phone they should
probably put something nicer there well
maybe it's on purpose to see that do
more to make customers see that it's
compatible with the older phones Oh
could be it but maybe it's a I think
it's actually not a real phone Evan can
you take a look at that if you go to
amazon.com yes you're pretty good at
identifying phones I hear it's my
favorite game iphone it's it looks like
an HTC magic but it's got a front facing
camera and it's very oh you know what it
might be that that I Oh device let me go
and look on HTC there was uh or maybe
it's the first pyramid render oh ho
better not be the pyramid it already had
a google i/o device looks pretty claw I
think it's the this google i/o device
stare out i'll drop this in chat here oh
this that see well I can't see because
if i go to amazon.com I still have
kindle on the front page so it basically
offers me kindle because of my IP
address and the app store is us only is
you know ah yeah i think that's what it
looks a little bit different but
whatever it's a kind of funny to see
let's uh let's move on we've got a
couple of other things to talk about so
you guys might have seen the video with
a Joe Belfiore talking about the windows
phone 7 updates did you guys see that
yeah I love the guy
uh okay well so he was talking about the
updates and I was listening very closely
to understand what the delay is and he
made it sound like it's the carrier's
fault and to add insult to injury and
maybe there's no injury here maybe I'm
just mistaken Microsoft put up a little
phone grid that says where's my phone
update and it shows you a column for the
februari update for the March update and
there's a big difference between the
international grid and the US grid the
u.s. grid the februari update hasn't
been deployed at all and it's already
the end of March the March update
obviously hasn't been deployed at all
but if you go to the international
version of the of the grid there's the
februari update is pretty much out there
on every phone except for like France
and Spain and then the March update the
no no update one that brings copy and
paste is actually starting to roll out
which makes me think that he's telling
the truth that in the US it's more
difficult to get these updates out for
some reason than it is in Europe could
be because let's take any country from
Europe the biggest carrier and let's say
France Spain Italy UK or Germany big
countries I think has approximately a
quarter or a half of the biggest US
carrier they have less phones they have
less subscribers so it's easier for
carriers to test and take a device on a
run and real life situations than it is
in the US number one number two it's
easier to roll out to to update
processes on a European carrier than it
is in the US and since carriers can skip
one update but must deliver these
skipped updates with the occasion of the
second update we might see both updates
coming up at the same time on US
carriers and what are you getting with
these update together for that so the
pre noto actually the februari update
there's your device for the node 0
update we don't know something else in
that light basically I mean all this is
just for copy and paste more or less
right yep yep so it's just funny that
this is so much for for you know I
definitely needed functionality but you
know for basically one feature you know
this is this whole hullabaloo I don't
think it's about the feature I think
it's about the process itself it's about
delivering updates over the air or
testing and delivering the notifications
over the year which is something
completely new to Microsoft completely
new to carriers and we might see it as a
proof of concept rather than delivering
copy and paste yeah copy and paste will
be there because it should have been
there from the very beginning we won't
get into why it wasn't included but once
this whole update thing gets ironed out
we can hopefully see some smoother
updating processes for the mango and
maybe in between with smaller updates oh
gosh mango is going to change so much
about Windows Phone 7 and if copy and
paste is taking this long right it's
going to make people's head explode that
these people that test the phones I
don't even really know what they're now
they're making sure that the the apps
that they add still work and that the
phone snow makes calls and all these
things but oh by the way updates I think
we have a good chance of seeing the
first over the year delivered windows
phone 7 update sometime in the near
future windows 17 updates deliver in two
ways smaller updates deliver over the
air and bigger updates delivered by a
cable via your zune software on your PC
and there was a bit last week where
Microsoft acknowledged the security flaw
and it's internet explorer on PCs and
they say they were working on a fix to
bring that fix and patch to Windows
Phone 7 in order to cover cover it's
let's say one
ability so being a smaller update it
might be pushed over here which will be
the first ever windows phone 7 updates
to be pushed via air and not by a cable
that's that's what I think everybody was
right they don't want to have to wait
for carriers to update they just wanna
say everyone loves getting that pop-up
notification that says you know you you
have new software ready for your phone
and yeah yes but one thing is to patch
certain files inside the ROM and the
other thing is to build another rom from
scratch because it's microsoft that it's
building these roms as Joe Belfiore said
the difference between Windows 17 and
Android is that in case of Android its
manufacturers and OEMs that build the
Rams and distribute them with Windows
Phone 7 Microsoft is building the ROM
they are building the code they inject
the manufacturer drivers and
optimizations and they deliver of the
runs so it's a little bit more steps
involved interesting this is all very
interesting we shall we should probably
move on and hopefully those februari
updates happen close to the end of March
and hopefully the March update happen
soon uh all right it was it was a bit by
the way just want one more thing it was
a bit I think I'm a German carrier said
that the March update will be the river
delivered end of April which is so bad
for Microsoft and so bad for the career
if this thing turns out to be true yeah
I the first mistake was calling it the
March update you know at what the heck
it shouldn't just called it like up deep
obtained numero uno and then you know
without putting a timetable on it then
one would expect it yep I agree all
right come all their things we want to
talk about so there's not much news with
with iOS right now with with the iphone
you know there's a there's an event
coming up presumably in a couple of
months or a few months and the iphone 5
is going to be announced which you'll
have a 4-inch screen and maybe NFC or
maybe not NFC so there's there's not
that much to talk about in respect to
the iphone except that Apple has
unleashed
new ad campaign and people really like
Apple advertisements they're very clever
there sometimes emotional but this new
one is a little bit a little bit
arrogant it's the if you don't have an
iphone campaign previously their ads
showed you stuff that you could do with
your phone like read books like find the
nearest sushi joint but the problem is
that you can now do all of those cool
things on lots of other phones so they
needed a new angle and now they show you
a this thing where you know you don't
have the if you don't have the app store
if you don't have game center if you
don't have I books you know these very
specific brands then you don't have an
iphone um what do you guys think about
this campaign I think that's true if you
don't if you don't have an iphone you
don't have all sorts of great stuff well
I tend to agree here because Apple
obviously and the yes i have an iphone
and no I've not become an iphone fanatic
so this is for the readers and listeners
but I certainly appreciate the iphone
the iphones quality and Apple services
qualities and of course if you don't
have an iphone you don't have the retina
display we had an post this weekend and
there were so many comments saying that
I'm alleging Super AMOLED czar better
than than the retina display no guys
they are not the only screen which is
better than the retina display in terms
of the lighting and the brightness is
LG's know by display yeah or Super
AMOLED brings super contrast deep blacks
but it doesn't deliver natural colors it
tends to shade in blue purple or pink
with IPS you get true colors and with a
dots per inch that high as in with the
retina display I don't think it will be
matched in the next couple of months and
it's already been a year since that one
is out so I think if you don't have an
iphone yeah you don't have an iphone and
you're missing out on the App Store and
I books on retina display and so on I
have ADD
some some comments about that I'm
somewhat of a screen fanatic so I tend
to obsess about screens I agree with you
in a lot of ways that the retina display
is the best display in terms of I think
really two things pixel density ergo
screen clarity reading text on a Retina
display on the retina retina displays
unlike anything else I mean it's it's
like it's painted not actually pixels
and to color reproduction I think the
retina display provides the best
realistic colors that isn't to say
though that i personally prefer it over
over say super amoled plus which does an
insane job of contrast I think that if
you couple the contrast of a super
amoled plus with a higher pixel density
of like a qhd screen and you've got a
you've got a true winner might be might
be yeah so this this this Apple campaign
might be true it seems to me that
they're running out of creative juices
here and they're trying to bridge the
gap from the iphone 4 which is beaten in
a lot of ways by other devices in
certain respects to the iphone 5 which
will of course bring a new wave of
innovation hopefully with dual core
processor bigger screen but whatever it
will have um good well let's move on to
our final bit for today so AT&amp;amp;T has has
announced sort of casually that the
Atrix 4G and the the inspire 4G will get
updates in April to allow for 4G just
kidding that was a joke actually atrix 3
4g and inspire 4G owners will get hsupa
turned on which means simply that no
longer will your 4g phone feel like a 2g
phone haha it'll it'll actually be as
fast as a 3g phone now they still
haven't addressed the 4g issue i'm not
going to talk about it this time I got
it I got to take a you just gotta did
by your cone I know I know I did I know
but I mean that's so that's a step in
the right direction you know it's a AT&amp;amp;T
3g speeds can be very good at times and
it's just a shame that you can't even
get that on the inspire 4G matrix 4G but
soon next month you'll be able to simply
skip those speeds so I thought I was
going to get by without a rant on 18 th
s rebus but no chance no chance not not
this time a very good so uh fellas do we
have any phone releases this week this
would be the week of March the 28th
anything that you can think of your
blindsiding this year I didn't know that
we're gonna have to answer questions
like this this is a pop quiz I I think
the answer is no phones are coming out
this week yeah I've heard that the
optimus 2x is starting to ship in Europe
it has less week of March yes last week
of March so so then there are some news
and I've also heard that the is it the
desire s desire s is right around the
corner you know it's interesting a lot
of people are very very very interested
in the desire s which is basically are
interested yeah you know I'm getting a
lot of emails about it well sure the
desire was a very popular phone wasn't
here the original desire was a very
popular phone is a very good phone but
the desire s is just over the phones
announced at Mobile World Congress I
think it's the least impressive i mean
the incredible s has an interesting form
factor it's very thin the Wildfire s is
an updated budget phone but the desire s
is like you know in a little bit better
but but compared to the desire it's a
lot more attractive or anything I mean
just physically it will also depend on
the pricing it depends on the pricing
yeah I mean it's a nicer looking phone
the desire
headed asymmetrical design which is kind
of yeah kind of off-putting I think to
some people I don't want people you know
just to think that I'm all about looks
but in this case that's important Evan
looks beneath skin to to see beauty
that's that's good by it beneath the
plastic to see the silicon haha smooth
boom as food well done um very good well
this shall conclude the eighth pocket
now pocket casts thank you everybody for
listening those of you that tuned in we
really really appreciate it we do this
for you and leave us a comment or send
us an email if you have an idea or if
you want to perhaps call in next time we
haven't done that yet so uh thanks Evan
and Tony for for joining thanks thanks
for having a frame yeah see ya bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
