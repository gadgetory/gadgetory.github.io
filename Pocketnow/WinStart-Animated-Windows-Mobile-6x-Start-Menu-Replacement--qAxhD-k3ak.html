Pacquiao com so when you open the
default Start menu on windows mobile so
it just pops up there's no opening
animation it just doesn't have that
subtle way of easing you into the menu
well that's where xda-developers steps
in with a new start menu replacement
it's called win start and it adds
beautiful flying animations to the start
menu icons it's actually similar to the
effect you get with some launchers on
android and on iOS let's see how it
would look on Windows Mobile ok so I
applied the new menu let's go ahead and
press the start button and see what
happens alright so the icons come flying
in now let's jump into a folder and jump
out and check out another one just to
see how it's working overall so so far
so good it's actually working fairly
well here especially on this aging touch
pro2 I kind of expected it to be a
little bit less fluid but it is running
smoothly now keep in mind this is a beta
so there may be some bugs or glitches
but rest assured that it's being
actively developed so if there are any
issues they'll probably be fixed now if
we go into a folder there are some other
options we can access so tap on an icon
or not well tap and hold on an icon and
then you can hide this icon and move the
icon rename it and change the image so
we'll go ahead and hide it and you can
see it just disappeared so a sort of a
convenience feature to remove some of
the clutter in the start menu we can
move the icon okay so you just reorder
it and then it will apply it to the grid
let's go into the menu and go to options
alright so here we can actually change
the amount of icons per row in the start
menu so right now I have it set to four
I can change that to 35 or however many
i want there's probably a limit but i'm
not going to make it too big or too
small you can also change the
I concise if you wanted to customize a
bit so pretty nice let's jump out so
again this start menu replacement is
called win start i'll post a link in the
description with more information
remember it's currently in beta so there
may still be some bugs but it's
definitely one to keep an eye on if
you're still rolling with an older
Windows Phone and want to spice up your
Start menu a bit if you liked the video
please give it a thumbs up and as always
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
