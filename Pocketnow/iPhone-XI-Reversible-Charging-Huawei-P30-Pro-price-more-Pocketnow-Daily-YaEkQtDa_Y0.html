finally been announced and they are very
very hot and now we have a price tag we
have some renders of the one plus seven
and it looks pretty much like the rumors
we've seen it looks like the iPhone 11
will bring reverse wireless charging and
some groundbreaking fast charger out of
the box I'm highlighting that I and the
whole plan was to film this at the
Huawei event here in Paris and then I
forgot my tripod this is pocket out
daily the official loose today begin
with deals isn't it interesting how
Apple has begun dropping the price tags
on everything ever since their stock
market has a you know their plunge in
the market has been just I don't know
$200 off in the case of the MacBook Air
whether you're starting with the
entry-level variant now at 999 and up to
1199 for the 256 gigabyte model at Best
Buy you learn more in the description I
think those are good deals now let's
talk about smart phone hinges and the
reasons why foldables are so expensive
according to digit times it seems that
because there are so many moving parts
and they need to provide rigidity that's
one of the main reasons why they are so
pricey right now it'll pretty much take
up until 2024 least a drop in price
obviously right now they're over a
thousand sometimes two thousand dollars
so yeah it's probably not a good time to
buy now it's all about the iPhone 11
according to some trusted sources we
might be getting two new things here
finally like reverse wireless charging
for accessories like the Apple watch or
the air pods in addition to an 18 watt
charger finally a that's not going to be
us PC because this is Apple let's see
how what happens there now move the
spotlight over to the oneplus 7 as a
believe it or not well we've got more
specifications we've got more renders
and the rumors remain the same that
we're gonna get a tractable camera at
the top that we're gonna get a triple
camera at the back that this design is
going to follow a lot of what we seen
from vivo and pretty much oppa lately
I'm really liking the design but I'm so
curious as to what you think obviously
specifications are crazy to learn more
about those in the description as well
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with Huawei P 30 and P 30 Pro
which got announced today in Paris the
event was great
our review unit has already in expect
some coverage coming very soon
but yeah specifications are awesome
obviously the camera is specific
specifications is great obviously we
have to go test it out but definitely
for those of you wondering the price tag
it starts at $7.99 and goes all the way
up to 1200 depending on the variant that
you get that was the last portion that
was pending over at the hands-on but let
us know in the comments down below what
do you think do you like this phone or
not because in my case they gave me the
red one so I'm really happy leave us a
