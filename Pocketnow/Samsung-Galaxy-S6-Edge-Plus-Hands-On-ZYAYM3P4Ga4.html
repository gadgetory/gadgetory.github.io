bigger one
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is the galaxy s6 edge+ could we
really combine a large display and dual
edged well of course we can
that was samsung's reasoning and
designing the s6 edge+
aiming for an elegant understated and
finely crafted look at a larger scale
Samsung calls it an aggressively compact
size and that doesn't really read in the
hand this is a huge phone but you know
what it doesn't feel as big as it
probably should and this silver version
I am NOT embarrassed to tell you I
really like a lot the 5.7 inch quad HD
Super AMOLED display is what drives the
larger chassis and Samsung really talked
up the Edit sense of depth the curved
edges convey as well as the typical
color popping and the super-high
resolution and so forth the company also
unveiled a new push into social media
with the s6 edge+ and the note 5 it
called live broadcast it's kind of like
a YouTube powered periscope allowing you
to stream live video from within a
custom camera lens all this is augmented
by a new feature Samsung's calling apps
edge which is of course exactly like
people edge wherein you swipe in from
the curved display to access your
favorite contacts but with apps edge you
can also launch apps from a particular
category samsung tells us actually that
they are not curated apps you can launch
anything on the phone with apps edge
which is nice we will still have to
confirm that in our real-world testing
the s6 edge+ also includes most of the
same enhancements built into the note 5
samsung seems especially proud of the
included 4 gigs of lpddr4 ram
each one and it is technically
impressive we'll have to see if TouchWiz
and lollipops memory management can make
use of it also aboard ultra-high quality
wireless audio streaming LTE category 9
support for supported networks
Samsung pay coming to Europe on August
20th September 28th to the US China
Spain in the UK later and while the
camera is the familiar 16 megapixel
shooter with OIS Samsung has also added
new VD is stabilization for still
smoother recording finally we heard a
lot today about Samsung's battery
leadership but 3,000 million power pack
isn't as impressive when you consider
not just a huge quad HD display but also
Samsung's inconsistent track record when
it comes to endurance fortunately the
company has built in 30% faster wireless
charging which should allow for empty to
full charging in two hours flat the
galaxy s6 edge+ will be available in
black sapphire gold platinum and that
beautiful silver titanium finishes in
the US and Canada on August 21st with US
pre-orders open today
it's weird to say this I think I might
be more excited to review this than the
note 5 find out why check out our note 5
hands-on video up soon at pockets now
from New York City I'm Michael Fisher
with Adam Lane doing behind the camera
work stay tuned for more from the
Samsung event and from our review
coverage of the new samsung galaxy note
5 and galaxy s6 edge+
thanks for watching I'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
