video we're going to do an unboxing and
hardware tour of the sprint samsung
intercept which is an android 2.1 device
with a sliding qwerty keyboard in
landscape mode these samsung intercept
boots retails for ninety-nine dollars on
sprint after a mail-in rebate and on a
two-year service agreement which is
eighty dollars cheaper than the samsung
moment its predecessor when that device
was released last year inside the box
you will find the samsung intercept here
at the top it does have a capacitive
touchscreen along with a landscape
oriented toward e slider the keyboard
does light up and offer great tactile
feel we're going to go ahead and set
this device aside for just a moment and
see what else comes inside the box in
the box users will find some getting
started guides in both English and
Spanish and the guide is in color for
those who are curious there is also a
basics guide here which is a little bit
thicker and covers more of the device
and the Samsung Andrew the Google
Android interface on the samsung
intercept sprint also included in
envelope here for you to quickly return
your phone and mail in your device for
recycling to be a little bit more eco
conscious inside the box you'll also
find a micro USB to USB charge and sync
table so you can charge your intercept
to your computer to charge and think it
or plug it into the adapt or the
included wall adapter here to charge
your device there is also a microsd on
to SD card adapter so you can quickly
load music and videos and photos onto
your device or transform from your
device to your computer if your pc has
an SD card slot let's go ahead and take
a look at the device these samsung
intercept here has a 3.2 inch wqvga
which is 240 x 400 pixels
capacitive touchscreen display it is
lower resolution than the sprint samsung
moment which has a half vga AMOLED
touchscreen display this display is a
TFT LCD touchscreen which does have some
advantages over the AMOLED display in
that it is a little bit better for
outdoors on viewing however the AMOLED
display does give richer and more
vibrant colors on the bottom of the
touchscreen you have for capacitive
touch buttons that do light up they are
for the menu the home back and the
search button the search button is an
addition to the moment which lacked the
search button and offered only three
capacitive touch buttons like the moment
this device also has two physical hard
buttons here at the bottom for cost and
an end the end button also serves as a
screen toggle to turn on and off the
device you can unlock the swing by
swiping your finger up to reveal the
basic stock Android UI there is also an
optical trackpad here on the bottom that
allows you to navigate through your home
screens by swiping up down left or right
and it could be used in the browser as
well you can go ahead and select by
pressing in on the optical trackpad on
the device Britt also include a number
of applications to help you get using
your device easier for instance there's
a think free office which will allow you
to open and view microsoft office
attachments such as your word and excel
files sprint TV is also included which
gives you access to live television
content as well as on-demand content
here as well it does take a bit longer
to load on the moment be or on the
intercept versus the sprint HTC evo 4g
because the intercept uses a rev 0 or
rev 0 network support versus the evdo
rev a on the EVO 4G which is slightly
faster
for 3g connectivity web pages do render
a little bit slower on the revo network
and in part because of these lower
network support but you'll notice that
webpages load up so that you can
navigate and view a content on the page
even before it finishes loading so here
we're on the pocketnow.com homepage and
in a bit you'll see that the content
will load while everything else in the
background will finish loading so you
can have access to content as you need
it multi-touch support is included
pinch-to-zoom as well as double tap
zooming is available on this device as
well on the hardware side on the left
side you have volumes up and down button
towards the bottom a nice feature is
that you have a covered micro SD card
slot which you don't need to remove the
battery or battery cover to access and
sprint and Samsung included a two
gigabyte card here for you along the
bottom the device is relatively clean
except for a microphone hole and a
little slit here for you to pry off the
back battery cover on the right-hand
side you'll find an air vent here to
amplify the noise on the loudspeaker on
the back side along with a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack towards the bottom right side
you'll find the camera button which is a
dual press shutter button that will
allow you to press in once to focus on
your subject and press them against to
capture your image the camera also has a
number of settings including various
scene modes and an option to adjust the
white balance and color effects as well
as to change the picture size and
quality as well the camera is a 3.2
megapixel camera that will allow you to
record video as well
it does have a self portrait mirror here
on the backside let's go ahead and turn
the screen off for just a second and
we're going to go ahead and pry off the
back battery cover by just inserting
some fingernails and pulling off the
back the device comes with a fifteen
hundred million per hour battery which
is rated for over six hours of talk time
which is very good for a 3g enabled
smartphone the battery cover is
contoured so it does feel comfortable in
the hand and the device does feel a
little bit more slick and modern than
the samsung moment which it does replace
on the device you will also have gps
Wi-Fi and bluetooth radios and the back
side is matt with a slightly rubberized
finished although it's not like a soft
touch finish that many are accustomed to
on devices such as the HTC evo 4g which
has more of a rubberized field to the
back battery cover the samsung moment
has a nice spring assisted a keyboard
sliding mechanism and on the keyboard
another notable thing to mention is that
it has a quick shortcut key here that is
accessible via the secondary button that
pulls up emoticons so that you'll have
quick access to some of the more popular
emoticons if you're a heavy texture that
uses these emoticons the device is
responsive it does have an 800 megahertz
on CPU which sits between the HTC aria
on AT&amp;amp;T with a 600 megahertz processor
and the snapdragon on the HTC evo 4g
which has a 1 gigahertz processor this
device does feel responsive and fast in
daily use and also you can multitask
with the device by pressing and holding
on the home button which will pull up
recently accessed applications here on
the screen for quick
multi-tasking so I'm chawan and thank

samsung intercept which retails for
ninety nine dollars currently on

smartphone with support for sprint evdo
