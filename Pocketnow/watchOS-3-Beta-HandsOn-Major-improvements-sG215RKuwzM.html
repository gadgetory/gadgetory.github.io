iterations of watch OS apples third
launch expected this fall has proven to
be a jump into maturity I'm high never
weave a tie with pocket now here with a
quick look at watch OS three beta to be
honest before Apple announced watch OS
three beta my Apple watch was sitting in
a drawer the user interface was sluggish
launch of applications was hit or miss
and the ton of the features simply made
no sense like a button dedicated to
contacts only watch OS three is a lot
about bringing common sense to how a
SmartWatch should operate the operating
system has been optimized to help you
keep your favorite applications in
memory provide these with background
updates and as a result give users
instant app launches to achieve this
Apple has decided to remove a ton of
duplicates instead of having glances be
separate from applications we now have a
unified interface in the dock that's
launched by the bottom side button this
is sort of like a multitasking tray with
either your most recent applications or
actually choose to have gone is the
favorite contacts feature that no one
really used since hey you can simply
dock the phone application if that's
important to you if you launch
applications from the digital crown any
empanada Don to the dark will take a bit
to launch but this later gives you the
option to dock it later the watch user
interface has changed to a string degree
Notification Center is still a slide
from the top and instead of glances at
the bottom you now have control center
slide from the left or right and you can
quickly switch between watch phases for
such a display and you can edit these
instead messaging updates now include
new quick replies and in certain cases
the watch even detects the language of
the message before offering suggestions
if you need to write more than what's
suggested then there's a new scribble
function for writing your message on the
display that's rather accurate Apple now
includes new watch faces like Minnie
Mouse if that's your thing
a numerals watch face for added
simplicity but my new favorite ones are
the activity watch face
is that you can tailor to your
preference speaking of activity you now
get the option to compete with friends
on your activity results I don't like
that you have to set this up through the
phone but you can eventually glance on
it through the watch which is better
than what you can do on a fitbit another
changes that aside from being prompted
to stand now you get prompted to have
breathing exercises and the haptic
feedback guidance is very intuitive the
rest of the experience has received
minor enhancements that are still not
available in beta one there's an
emergency call feature that launches
when you press and hold the bottom
button but that's apparently not
available right now and then there are
other features like Apple pay for
third-party applications in addition to
audio support from these as well but
that requires developer support overall
watch OS 3 has brought tremendous new
life to the Apple watch and this is the
first beta that's not as clunky
obviously it's not perfect there are
some stutters here and there and there
is limited battery life but that's what
you pay for being able to test these new
versions of watch OS rather early folks
