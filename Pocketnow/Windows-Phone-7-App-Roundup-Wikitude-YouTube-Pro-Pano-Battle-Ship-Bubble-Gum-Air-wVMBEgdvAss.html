and this is another episode of Windows
Phone 7 app roundup in which review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get to it wikitude is a free application
available windows marketplace that would
give you information about businesses
and landmarks around you in your area so
let me just choose sites and here I can
view all these sites in my area it will
show me based upon my camera and dl
proximity of my GPS sensor so i can not
view all the areas let me just go here
so here are all the Wikipedia entries
that people have posted on this maps of
why I can click on one of these and it
will give me some information about this
particular landmark you can also go back
youtube pro is a light in paper
application available windows
marketplace that allows you to view and
download youtube videos directly to your
windows phone 7 device so here we can
view some of the top rated videos that
people have posted onto youtube and if i
can just go down to the bottom and i can
search for something so if i want i can
search for a light on all talking out
video so for I can view this video right
here and now I can either play it
directly from my windows phone 7 device
or I can download it so I can play it
later pano is a paid for application of
it on windows marketplace the legends
take panoramic photos on your Windows
Phone 7 device so i can take up to 16
photos and the application will merge
them all perfectly so if i want can go
and view one of my panels that have
created already
so here we can view one of the panoramic
photos that I took outside and it was a
little dark and of course it was snowing
outside so you can see a little bit of
that battleship is a free game fill in
the windows marketplace that is very
similar to the game battleship that used
to play as a kid so here we can view all
of these ships that we have and many of
them are different sizes we have two up
to five and we can also shuffle them
randomly if we like so we can start here
and now I can just place a spot on
Cheers or where I want to shoot so I was
able to hit their ships so let me just
go here and now we cannot move this one
and now it's their turn they can shoot
onto my playing field look so they were
able to get one of my ships and the game
continues on like bubblegum air is a
free endless progression game in which
you're trying to use your little bubble
here to inflate and deflate by tapping
on the screen or releasing on the screen
what we want to do is to get these birds
off the screen without hitting their
feet onto our bubble or else we lose
this side and if we're able to get some
of these birds out of here the game does
become more difficult as we move on
because they move faster and there's
other birds that attacked us and if they
hit one of our bubbles like that then we
lose the game you have to start over
again so this is been another episode
