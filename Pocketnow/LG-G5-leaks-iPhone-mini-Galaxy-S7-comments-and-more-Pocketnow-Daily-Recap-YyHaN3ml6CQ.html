know fun fact I used to hate my name
when I was in high school hilfiger polo
oh right where you guys should hire some
cute girls to review some products on
pocket now LOL and i'm not LOL a map I
couldn't agree with you more that's
right it's that time of the week I am
highlighting that up this is pocket now
and this is the last pocket now daily
recap from this studio let's talk about
your comments from last week so last
week we started one day with the iphone
many we had a lot of leaks of the phone
and I asked you particularly how much
would you be willing to pay because
obviously this is Apple and that's
probably gonna be the most conflicting
thing about the company doing something
that's budget-friendly if anything we
have 791 comments i would pay 250
dollars max for the iphone mini and you
know i think that two hundred fifty
dollars is probably a little too low but
it would be the sweet spot indeed during
fifty dollars you drunk high man who
knows maybe apple will shock us with a
charge of 399 who f knows and you know
apple already made that mistake with the
iphone 5c it could be that the company
might consider something different this
time says it's supposed to be a
budget-friendly phone i would pay
maximum three hundred dollars but
knowing apple it's probably gonna cost
around 549 and that was the case of the
5c again we don't think that apple will
do that the company wants to bet big on
india and they're gonna need to disrupt
with a really inexpensive phone if they
want to and speaking of the iphone mini
tuesday was about the iphone 5s which is
apparently going to be its name and
elliott specifications which weren't
gonna be that bad we were even getting
hey Siri hot word features here and I
asked you do you ever really use hot
works for your phone we had 906 comments
he activated my hey Cortana and I know I
did because I mentioned that in the
video and sorry buddy yes because my hot
words to interact with my phone is
hotline bling am I the only one that
doesn't really understand that comment
no matter if it's Syria or Google now or
Cortana I feel weird to talk to my phone
for doing stuff and you know I do agree
i feel that the only phone that i didn't
really feel weird with was the Moto X
but the
no why I just I can't find myself doing
it or I hate it whenever the phone does
not catch the hot word it just
completely defeats the purpose I hate
doing it and I don't do it again then on
Wednesday we had apples quarter results
the company barely broke records this
time and we asked you the company is no
longer selling that many iphones what do
you think they need to do to continue
growth for 2016 we had 1731 comments I
think that's a record thanks a lot they
should stop playing it safe and actually
innovate again I love this comment and I
placed it first because you're right
Apple disrupted with the iphone whoever
does not want to admit it was probably
not born in 2007 you probably don't know
what the smartphone market was like
before that or you just couldn't afford
a smartphone just admit it smartphones
before the iphone were horrible they
were just terrible and Apple came to
change that and we need that level of
innovation again the problem is you
can't really innovate so much in
something that's really bare bones
simple as Apple did it Apple is out of
options they need to do something
revolutionary with their software their
hardware is not going to be there
selling point anymore as many phones are
even better than them at this point I
agree with that and I agree with that
more because of the camera features I
feel that Apple is fallen behind in a
market they pretty much disrupted with
the iphone four of you remember ever
leads to focus less on thinner and
lighter and focus more on better battery
life and more features and this is my
other favorite comment a phone can not
get any more lighter Apple please give
me a thicker option of a phone if you
want you know I would have rather had an
iphone 6 that's thicker than an iphone
6s plus I would have rather a thicker
phone than a larger phone a phone that's
so large it's hard to use Thursday the
topic which was eventually cancelled was
the possibility of three or four options
for the galaxy s7 eventually our famous
tipster f leagues figured out that it
wasn't going to be that but day I asked
you which one would you pick out of all
of them we had 891 comments I've said it
once I'll say it again I'm waiting for
the note 6 so am i but hey I would still
pick one of the galaxies now yes seven
with the 5.5 inch would be great but
then again what's the point of a 5.5
inch unit if there's the note line up
already and you know I
can't wait for that event I'm actually
going to be at the event and I can't
wait to see what the argument for that
bone in particular will be so oh man I
want to report on that one indeed I
would go for the s7 edge plus know the
s7 5.5 inch what wait maybe the s7 curve
wait no that's the thing samsang stop
releasing so many damn phones yeah
samsung you know I don't mind I you know
this is a company that can do whatever
they want with their money and they
choose to throw it out an RD I don't
complain about that but yeah it's kind
of confusing and then finally Friday
with all the rumors of everything we're
getting at mwc we asked you if you had
to pick HTC when I'm 10 galaxy s7 or LG
g5 which one would you pick we had 999
comments particular number I want the g5
with the samsung Display HTC boomsound
and no skins on Android dream on gs-7
unless the LG g5 gets you I redesign and
so no go for me the nhcc is probably not
going anywhere I need the s7 edge Varian
and I just noticed that I pick your
comment twice buddy which is great
anyways you have a really good comment
and I chose it because of the g5 comment
i do want for them to change that you i
know you know no negotiates
non-negotiable they need to change it it
is urgent g5 just because the company
seems to actually hear what phone lovers
want you are so right you know we're
stuck in a bubble here we are power
users we love phones with no compromise
and that is what LG cells obviously
there are things like you know
performance the expandable storage is a
problem with performance and we can't
wait for storage to get cheaper but you
know I would prefer the option if you
don't want your if you want your phone
with extra storage you snap a card in
there if you don't want your phone to
get clunky you take the card out I love
that option to be available and i just
wish that other OEMs would give users
the option that's the whole idea of
paying so much reflection that's it for
the parking out daily recap thank you
