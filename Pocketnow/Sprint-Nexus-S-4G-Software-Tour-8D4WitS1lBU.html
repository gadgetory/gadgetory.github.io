pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a look at the software of nexus s
4g from sprint so sit back relax and
enjoy the show
now since the nexus s 4g from sprint is
a google phone and not really a sprint
random phone it's really lacking in a
lot of the blow air which is a good
thing and a possibly a bad thing if
you're trying to use any of the TeleNav
products looking here are the home
screen we've got the pretty much default
home screen as you can see and up at the
top you can see I've got the vibration
turned on Wi-Fi and the cell signal
battery clock this is not a default part
of the APIs is actually part of a tool
that I installed to make it so I get
easy access to the 4g settings swiping
over pages a default layout has the news
and weather app youtube google and the
android tutorial the market and the
power control widget going into the app
drawer we've got the 3d app drawer here
standard gingerbread nothing too
surprising here either car mode which
allows you to navigate using the car
when you well rather while you're in the
car
the camera itself camera software is
just the default Google camera software
so there's a lot of functionality
missing here that if you had a the
Samsung software you could get access to
you can see some of the apps i've
installed in here google music
navigation is the same as any other
navigation Netflix just was released but
it doesn't come default on this phone it
does work just fine on this phone
touchdown and the touchdown pro license
or both third-party apps that I've
installed to be able to use the phone so
as you can see that it's pretty
bare-bones considering the the
application if you've seen gingerbread
you've seen what this software can do
and if you're interested in more
gingerbread features you can look up on
our website one feature that i did find
interesting is going into the settings
here when you swipe up and swipe down at
the bottom and the top of the stack you
get a little orange glow now you can see
here the we are running to dot 34 on a
nexus s 4g batter use is also different
now it does have a little running gauge
up here and if you tap on an individual
item then it tells you the number of
minutes that was used and the percentage
of the battery used all that
even the dialer is generic looking very
vanilla you can see the call log the
contacts the favorites up here the
buttons don't have any skin to them
really at all they're very flat looking
which is not terribly bad but it's just
generic gingerbread so if you're looking
for a lot of customization you'll have
to add it yourself that bout wraps up
the software review there's not really
much to this because it's frankly just
gingerbread if you have any questions or
would like to see something in the final
review drop us a note and we'll try to
get back to you thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
