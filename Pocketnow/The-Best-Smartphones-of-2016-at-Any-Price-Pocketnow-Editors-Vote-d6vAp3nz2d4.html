technology some highs some lows and some
fun surprises summing up the smartphone
landscape in a single video is a tough
proposition but it's a challenge we're
ready to handle I reached out to the
whole editorial team at PocketNow and
brought back an old face to use as a
tiebreaker
so this isn't just my personal ramblings
on which phones I liked best
this is vetted by the entire staff
divided by price categories were
recognizing the top three phones in the
budget range the mid-range and devices
with a premium price tag with all that
info out of the way here are the best of
the best smartphones for 2016
starting with phones under $300 the
number 3 pick the honor 5x Huawei had a
really good year at the number 3 spot is
a phone which punches well above its
price tag the honor 5x brought some
killer features to the entry level price
tier and introduced the honor brand to
North America number 2 the Moto G 4 Plus
no shame in taking second with so many
terrific phones released this year
motorola helped invent the budget tier
as we understand it today and this
year's G family of phones provides
fantastic options at a range of
different price points and number one
the axon 7 Mini it's not really that
small but the more petite axon 7 scored
a lot of love for delivering great
performance and very good speakers
bringing great multimedia features to
this price tear is no small feat all
three of these phones help continue the
conversation that consumers deserve good
performance even at lower price points
more than just covering the basics we
should all expect a solid experience
even when we're trying to save some cash
moving to a higher price point this was
the most brutal area of competition for
2016 the barrier between mid Ranger and
flagship is eroding fast number 3 the
honor 8 my personal favorite surprise of
2016 the Huawei honor 8 took everything
we liked about the p9 added a few fun
features dressed it up in a shiny new
glass back and cut the price looking at
one company's lineup it's tough to find
a more winning combination against the
whole of the mid Ranger tier the honor
eight surprised with the terrific dual
sensor
camera and great performance but likely
lost a couple votes because of the
software on board
number two the axon 7 we're noticing a
bit of a trend Huawei and ZTE offering
up terrific options at accessible prices
the full-size axon 7 is a monster
all-rounder some of the best multimedia
performance we've tested at any price
point a ton of storage good battery life
and flagship grade performance the
recent price cut certainly doesn't hurt
either and the number one the one plus
3t the company which tried it out the
notion of killing flagships takes the
top spot for 2016 the 3t shook up our
vote as this was the first time we've
seen this company deliver a same year
refresh touching up a number of areas
from the oneplus 3 shipped earlier in
the year a best-in-class chipset very
good headphone performance and a
respectable camera it's a winning
combination for the sub $500 category
and here we go folks stepping up to the
big leagues the flagship market should
bring the best overall experience
available in a pocketable mini computer
and a price tag to match at number three
we've got a tie the iPhone 7 plus and
the galaxy s7 edge the only time we
couldn't properly break using our secret
ballots PocketNow editors awarded the
same number of points to both of the
larger Samsung and Apple phones this
year maybe it's a sign of how these two
companies have been racing to the middle
but consumers will be well served by
either water resistance camera
performance big bright screens battery
life these two set the standard for
friendly consumer all-rounder
smartphones number two the Google pixel
where the larger options one out for
Samsung and Apple the smaller pixel took
our overall second place position for
2016
likely weighing the price to performance
differences between the two the smaller
pixel one out google killed the Nexus
this year and shipped it to a more
consumer oriented device strategy it's
still early days for this new line of
phones but we're inclined to say this
move is a successful one delivering one
of the fastest performers of the year
showcasing some new virtual reality
capabilities and offering a very good
camera there's still a little room for
refinement but the pixel is off to a
great start
and now for the number-one flagship
phone of 2016 and maybe the most
surprising upset of the entire vote
pocket now editor's awarded the top spot
to the LG v20 it's not entirely
surprising as this team is a collection
of writers and producers that a big
productivity focused phone would win out
had it not been for some consumer safety
issues we can easily imagine which other
phone might have won this year but for
all the devices currently available to
buy there is no more complete option for
content creation fantastic camera
software best-in-class
audio for playback monitoring and
recording good battery life on one of
the few phones to offer a removable
battery and enhanced drop protection
it's not the prettiest or the
friendliest but where other phones on
this list might be cute roadsters or
flashy sports cars the v20 is a big old
diesel truck with a great stereo there
you have it folks the best phones of
2016 at any price and of course we want
to hear from you did your phone make the
list in a year with so many fantastic
devices will leave the honorable
mentions for you to debate in the
comments down below this video as always
