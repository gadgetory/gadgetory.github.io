what's going on everybody and here's a
look at the Lenovo smart clock and the
Lenovo smart tab let's start off with
the Lenovo smart clock now on the
surface it just looks like a small
little thing with the screen a little
bit like the Google Home Hub except it's
all integrated and yes this is still a
speaker and there's just a small 4-inch
screen on here that screen is 800 by 480
resolution and it is touch sensitive
allowing you to swipe among different
elements however this is not going to be
a full-on version of Android of course
it's actually a little bit stripped down
because it's trying to just be a simple
clock there are two microphones on this
device but you can mute them via a quick
toggle on the back if you want a little
bit more privacy and speaking of privacy
there is no camera on here either it's
all really simple and honestly it's all
about just going through the main
elements on the front screen you can
swipe down in order to control a few
extra things but ultimately it's meant
to tell you the time it is meant to tell
you things via the speaker portion and
it is capable of still doing your smart
home tasks via the Google integration
this is the kind of device that is
supposed to live on your nightstand it's
not going to replace your smart displays
or Google homes or Google home hubs that
might already be in other parts of your
home like in the kitchen or in the
living room
you're not meant to be watching full-on
YouTube videos or even looking at a
whole lot of media on here though you
can play music via the speaker portion
what you can do is set alarms charge a
device via the USB port on the back and
when you wake up in the morning it takes
a little bit of time to brighten up the
screen to simulate a sunrise when the
alarm does go off you can snooze it by
just smacking the top of the device or
you can smack it twice in order to turn
it off as this is a new product and
technically a new category there might
be some features that still need to be
fleshed out but as it stands right now
this minimalist design looks pretty nice
and it is a nice clock to have on the
side that allows you to do some extra
smart stuff but if you want to go above
and beyond Lenovo actually brought back
a tablet at CES one that can work not
only as a conventional tablet but also
as a smart speaker display this is the
Lenovo smart tab in a couple of
different varieties the m10 is the
cheaper of the bunch with up to 32
gigabytes of storage and up to three
gigabytes of RAM while the pita and has
more speakers has a larger battery and
supports up to 4 gigabytes of RAM with
64 gigabytes of on-board storage this is
an android tablet through and through
but this tablets main function is to be
an Amazon echo of sorts the 10-inch
displays which are also at Full HD
resolution can actually double as an
echo show display this smart dock has a
few contacts that allow it to
communicate with the tablet and then it
becomes an entire Amazon echo so you can
use the hot word in order to talk to
Emma's on the way that you would with
any other echo device the transition is
actually pretty seamless and the smart
dog sounds pretty nice the speaker
allows for some pretty rich sound and
you can use it in order to play music
watch some media online or get quick
recaps of current stories in the news
when playing music via Amazon music if
the lyrics are available at that
database it will actually scroll up kind
of like a karaoke machine so that's
actually pretty cool
the tabla itself is sleek it is
full-featured and it is a 10 inch
display meaning a plenty of room to have
fun with different games and whatnot on
the Google Play Store all of these
products are going to be made available
by the end of January with the smart
clock coming in at $79.99 depending on
what version of the tablet you want the
smart tab will come in at $199 or 299
