Samsung Smart Watch efforts the European
Union is asking for a correct way to
handle in-app purchases and is it just
as there is your Galaxy Tab s melting
down as well I'm Hyneman Ravana and I've
been waiting for this day for the past
week so shares everyone this is
out daily let's begin to date with
what's official as you remember that we
reported a couple of weeks ago that the
microsoft surface pro 3 was doing
decently in sales but it was also having
some Wi-Fi issues every time that you
would bring your computer back from
sleep and as it turns out microsoft has
just pushed the software update for the
tablet computer and aside from some
interesting improvements in Wi-Fi
connectivity you also get some
reliability improvements so Lixus return
for full details on how to get it and
also tell us in the comments what your
experiences now another interesting
official news the European Union has
been complaining for the last couple of
weeks over the fact that yet is the
seeding for you to get asphalt 8 and I
think that the application is free when
you download it and then eventually
learn that it's actually an in-app
purchase application that will only work
well if you buy those in-app purchases
and the European Union has been
commending google for doing a lot of
efforts and improving this and
apparently eventually the google play
store will actually tell you that an
application is not really free it's an
in-app purchase application which is
spray us so it should be but you know
the european union is also complaining
that apple is not doing enough for this
let's see how that turns out and for
those of you that are wondering whatever
happened to Samsung's Tizen phones you
remember that we talked about the
samsung Z that was announced almost a
month ago but was never launched the
phone was now available at an event in
Korea you can now see some photos of it
licks in the description though we still
don't have any official timing when this
phone will reach the market at least
somewhere around here let's see how that
goes is Tizen does need a phone and
speaking of Samson we have some very
interesting complaints from the 8.4
variant of the galaxy tab s customers
are already complaining about the fact
that the tablet heats up so much that
some of them had even ended up with a
deformed tablet at the back and even
though the battery has
exploded it clearly has caught up enough
heat to loose form in the back you can
see some photos and the links of the
description obviously let us know in the
comments as well if you've experienced
these issues as that is one of the
biggest problems of working with plastic
the fact that even though it doesn't
feel as hot as aluminum it does look
different after a lot of heat and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day it seems that the relationship
between samsung and google continues to
be stressed as you remember that google
complained about the fact that samsung
changed the whole uy for those tablets
that were announced at CES and going to
samsung ended up changing everything and
as it turns out google is not happy with
the fact that samsung is promoting its
Tizen smart watches more than it has the
gear live and that's very interesting as
Android where is the new thing it's
really cool but Samsung feels that they
want to promote the year too and other
smartwatches that they have based on
Tizen more than they want to promote the
Android one and that really leads me to
the question of the day if right now you
have to pick between the Samsung gear
Tizen smartwatches and the Samsung gear
live which would you pick because in my
particular case after such bad
experiences with Samsung and software
updates I would prefer to support the
gear live I would definitely prefer that
one but leave us a comment down below
which is your pic android l or samsung's
proprietary you I friends you know the
drill if he when I get the news earlier
