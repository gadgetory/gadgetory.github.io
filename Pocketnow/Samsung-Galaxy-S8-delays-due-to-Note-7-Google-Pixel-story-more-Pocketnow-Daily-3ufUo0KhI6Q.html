drama could affect an early galaxy s
eight other reports claimed that the
timing killed the water resistant pixel
plans and new developments point to what
to expect for Microsoft's next event I'm
hi Mary vera and you know what Google I
would have rather preferred a light
pixel but a water-resistant pixel this
is parking out daily so we are already
gearing up for Microsoft's event to
happen on Wednesday and even though
we're expecting more hardware that has
to do with PCs than anything some
trusted sources claim that we should
expect to things names the Microsoft
Surface studio which is hinted to
probably be a desktop PC but then the
question is what is the Microsoft
Surface dial it's one of the products
that is being rumored and we would love
to know what you think that should be in
the comments down below because nobody
dials phone numbers anymore so it's
probably not a fun and for those of you
to join me in scratching your heads over
why the Google pixels are not water
resistance apparently everything had to
do with timing long-term planning and
timing apparently the Nexus devices were
still going to continue then out of the
blue the company decided to just stitch
them early last year and there was just
not enough time to perfect the design
that would be anything more than I p53
water resistant that's kind of hard to
believe but according to the sources
that is the case I just feel it that's
probably the selling point for the next
pixel the problem is it's a rather
expensive pixel for non water resistance
or I p53 as will the spotlight over to
Apple's iOS 10.1 just got the least and
there are a couple of major changes here
number one improvement in bugs and
reliability there were a ton of issues
even with iOS 1003 experience a ton of
problems with connectivity with the
Apple watch apparently it restores
connectivity to Android wear watches to
the rest of them and the second thing is
apparently it comes with the portrait
mode and the reason why I say apparently
is because I already updated my phone
and it's still in beta yeah it's still
in beta but yeah it's there now hear
this for those of you that are still
holding on to your galaxy note 7 and I'm
one of them that has it off in the
drawer and I'm going to switch it soon
but here's the case apparently Samsung
wants to ensure that customers stick
with Samsung devices up
point where the company is apparently
because this is not official yet going
to offer a new plan where they drop
fifty percent of the price of the galaxy
s7 if you switch to that if you commit
to grabbing the galaxy s eight next year
and I'm like why wouldn't I want to
commit to the galaxy as eight regardless
of the fifty percent discount just the
fact that you are enabled that early
option for an upgrade is great so wait
for that probably but turn your phone
off or I don't know think of something
and finally the interesting news that
they have to do with how early that
galaxy s eight is going to launch
according to analysts the main reason
why the galaxy note 7 became such a
problem is called speed the fact that
Samsung wanted to race the launch the
note 7 and time before the iphone 7 plus
one number two apparently the fact that
Samsung rushed the inspections and
everything that had to do with the
replacement units of the galaxy note 7
instead of looking into the technology
of the battery what they did is just
change the supplier and so apparently
Samsung does not want to make that
mistake anymore and it makes all the
sense in the world if you think of it a
galaxy s 8 with these amount of problems
would just tarnish the brand completely
but it leads me to the question of the
day do you think the timing is in point
to the galaxy s 8 or do you think that
the best thing to do is for samsung to
do this right in my case I would rather
do it right because the galaxy s7 s7
edge or great bones not that I'm saying
that I want to wait until june next year
but i'm saying do this right samsung
