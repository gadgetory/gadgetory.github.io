device in the works with some odd shapes
the new Nexus launch our along with
Google assistant to reach everyone very
soon it seems the verizon pretty much
crippled the galaxy note 7 into less of
a note I'm hi Mary vera and this would
be the 3rd video that I do today so
that's the reason why I look like this
this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for the
Huawei watch I highly suggest you hit
B&amp;amp;H this is probably one of my favorite
android wear smartwatches if not my
favorite SmartWatch ever that's not my
favorite materials but I do love that
sapphire I do love that display and it's
definitely a good vibe you're getting
one hundred fifty dollars off certain
models sadly those one hundred fifty
dollars are not off the cheapest one but
anyways you can learn more on the link
in the description and speaking of
wearables one of the biggest mysteries
for Aoife this year is what's wicks are
from acer acer has been doing an amazing
job with gaming computers gaming laptops
but not necessarily in the mobile
department so we hear the company is
working on its own fitness tracker
that's great but apparently there's also
this gaming SmartWatch and what's the
point I cannot wait to learn more diva
we will be covering the event live as
will the spotlight over to the samsung
galaxy note 7 and Verizon if you notice
the device that we use for the review
was a verizon unit and yes there are
substantial differences in a couple of
things like for example the settings
menu its confirm that in retail units
that's really what you're getting pretty
much a settings menu that reminds us of
everything that we saw before in
addition to that remember that I
mentioned in the 24 hours video that
apparently Samsung cloud wasn't going to
make it yeah it's not gonna make it for
verizon devices you won't be getting
those 15 gigs for backups but you've got
verizon cloud at five gigs yeah i know
it's not even pointless to continue with
this now covering samsung's arch rival
Apple there are rumors of what to expect
for the 2017 iPhone we've heard oh that
displays 10 years of iphone dramatic
substantial change in design whatever
you want but apparently there's one very
interesting when you've heard about the
oled iphone that there are rumors that
apple will be investing in oullette for
these devices but apparently we're also
getting a curved phablet a double-edged
curved phablet pretty much like what
you've got with the galaxy s of an edge
we wonder what the purpose is going to
be and we cannot wait to see jony ive's
video over the reasons why Apple
innovated on something that it clearly
didn't and finally the very hot news
today have to do with Android 7 dot 1
nougat apparently there is a maintenance
release that is coming very soon
apparently in the next couple of weeks
and the most important things you're
getting here are two things number one
the new google nexus launcher which i
was expecting to see on my nexus 6p when
i got android 70 and it's almost pretty
much the same launcher too apparently we
are also getting google assistant
something that is highly anticipated
google made a big deal out of how
assistant will change your life at
Google i/o we cannot wait to give it a
test but it leads me to the question of
the day are you looking forward to
things like Google assistant are you
looking forward to upgrading to nougat
because of things like these because in
my case yes I am I cannot wait to either
not use it at all I could do it Siri or
it's actually highly depend on it leave

your opinion French another way it goes
