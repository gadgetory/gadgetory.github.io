pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a look at the hardware on the lg
optimus Evan it's a great device but
make sure you watch the whole video in
its entirety because you might find out
the second part of our puzzle question
for the contest so without further ado I
wish you good luck and let's see the
hardware on the lg optimus 70 so here we
are with the LG optimus m and first of
all some numbers the handset is 125 by
59.8 x 11.5 millimeters in dimensions
and weighs 150 7 grams now this might
not be the smallest and lightest hands
that you add about but for sure it's not
on the other side of the story I find it
to be quite pocketable it's quite good
it feels good in hand so don't worry
about these dimensions it's not too big
and for sure it's not you happy now on
to the things you cannot seem from the
outside it sports a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon qsd 8650 processor it has a
WVGA 480 x 800 TFT LCD screen which is
capacitive and it's three point eight
inches in diagonal it has gsm quadband
UMTS tri-band HSDPA and HSUPA support
for its radio it has 16 gigabytes of
internal memory from which for our land
and for our sdram a 5 megapixel camera
on the back with autofocus and LED flash
all the usual suspects is bluetooth 2.1
wireless BG and accelerometer proximity
and ambient light sensors as well as
digital compass and DLNA support let's
take a closer look at the device at the
top you will have the speaker grill now
what's good about this speaker is that
it doubles as a handset and as a device
speaker so you will hear some coming up
from here when you are talking to
someone as well as when you are
listening to music y on your zune player
you can also see the proximity and light
sensors and unfortunately there's no LED
indicator
for messaging or for coverage at the
bottom you will have three dedicated
hardware buttons and let me see if I can
get them to click yeah this is very good
because most of the manufacturers
nowadays use capacitive buttons and it's
good to have the good old-fashioned
clickable way in your hands now at this
side you will have nothing but a camera
button which is to stage 1214 focusing
and the second one for releasing the
shutter as well as the micro USB port
which is covered by this little plastic
here and the left side you will have the
volume wrappers for volume up and volume
down and nothing on the top you will
have the small power button as well as a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack well there
will be nothing on the button whatsoever
on the back you will have the camera
which is a HD capable camera for
recording HD videos it's 5 megapixels
then its dimensions for pictures taken
and of course the windows store logo now
if we pop up the back you can do this by
pushing the small button you will get
the metal cover out to discover the
battery which is a 50 million powers and
it's advertised to be the best in its
class with the biggest capacity among
all windows phone 7 handsets now on to
our next part of the puzzle question for
our contest today's part is your
favorite just for a short dimension
comparison you can find the LG optimus 7
at the middle with the HTC hd2 on the
left and the HTC Desire on the right you
can see it's approximately in the same
dimension range as the HTC
which is of course bigger in screen and
it's a little bit larger than the HTC
Desire now on fitness-wise it's
comparable to the HTC Desire but of
course if we add the HTC hd2 it's the
difference is barely visible so you most
probably will not even notice the hd2
looks a little bit thicker because it
has the part surrounding the camera
popping out but compared to the HTC
Desire you can see clearly that these
two devices are approximately in the
same thickness range so this was our
hardware review of the LG optimus 7
thank you very much for watching this
was ends on the unit and again I wish
you good luck in our contest for winning
one LG optimus 7 with bucket now and LG
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
