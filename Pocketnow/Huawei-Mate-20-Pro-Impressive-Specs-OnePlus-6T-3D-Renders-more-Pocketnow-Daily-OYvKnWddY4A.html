the may 20 Pro and let's just call it
the beast from now on
3d renders of the oneplus 60 have just
emerged showing us all that we want from
the design and a new certification from
the Oppo find X with a crazy 10
gigabytes of RAM has just emerged I'm
Jaime Rivera and this is definitely a
Diego joke happy birthday little Wayne
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with product
announcements I mean it was it's been
months or probably more than a year
since Facebook announced their whole
joint venture with oculus and the fact
that we were gonna get some unique
content that it had to do with Facebook
but as it turns out it doesn't actually
have to do with Facebook or anything
else other than the fact that they're
doing something that's unique in its own
it's called oculus quest it'll cost 399
it's not necessarily that inexpensive
but then again it's unique content for
oculus based on this whole concept and
everything we'll keep you posted as we
hopefully will get one for review and
tell you more now let's talk about LG
we're just a couple of days away from
the LG v 40 I am definitely excited to
see what this phone is like and it seems
that the company couldn't wait for the
event we've got teasers from the company
showing off the triple camera showing
off that apparently there are five
cameras we see lenses all over making a
V and everything the edge of the video
are very interesting I highly recommend
you watch in the description yeah I
don't think there's anything left to
learn here but hey now let's move the
spotlight over to the Opel find X I do
owe you that review this is definitely
one of the coolest phones that I've seen
this year even if it's not the best it
doesn't matter it is still one of the
coolest phones of this year now we've
got some tina certifications of the
phone with 10 gigabytes of ram and this
is not the lamborghini edition and I
know you're gonna butcher me in the
comments over the way I pronounced that
but fine think about it as 10 gigs of
RAM I know it's probably overkill but
the fact that a company is already
working on this is great I'll keep you
posted as soon as we get more details on
what its gonna launch now for those of
you that are curious on the oneplus 60
and exactly how the design is gonna be
we've been fumbling with case rumors
in addition to some leaked images from
the front I thought there was a
headphone jack but now we've got some 3d
renders from the same guys that pretty
much have shown us what smartphones are
gonna look like weeks and probably even
months in advanced there is no headphone
jack there is the teardrop design in
will we get from the front-facing camera
definitely on display a fingerprint
scanner makes sense because there's none
at the back so yeah I have let's just
see what oneplus tells us at the event
whenever they justify why the headphone
jack is dead that's gonna be fun
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the huawei mate 20 pro
let me know in the comments who else is
excited about this film because as of
now we're gonna officially dub it the
Beast we've got some leaked
specifications 4200 milliamp hour
battery apparently while we even managed
to fit wireless charging on this thing
and it's 15 watts meaning it's going to
be fast wireless charging take that
Apple in addition to other bells and
whistles that are gonna definitely make
this phone faster like for example
that's 7 nanometer chip and obviously
that larger battery plus the 7 nanometer
architecture apparently it's going to be
up to 15% more power-efficient but I
think it's gonna be more with just the
numbers that we're getting in today's
question let us know what do you think
are you looking forward to the may 20
Pro or what phone are your scouting out
for now that we've got so many coming up
just so quickly in my case oh my god
after using the b20 Pro I think the may
20 Pro will probably be my best for my
next phone but there's literally only
one way to find out leave us a comment

opinion friends again if you want to get
