the wheel we'll be answering your
questions about the Google manifesto
talking gender and politics and
technology the Moto Z to force one of
the more controversial phones we've
reviewed this year and we'll have some
fun discussions on software assistance
plus your questions and comments coming
in from email and Twitter there's a lot
to discuss so make sure you're charged
and ready for episode two six five of
the pocket now weekly recorded August
10th at 3:00 p.m. Eastern this weekly
podcast is where we dissect and discuss
those gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables is all
the stuff you wished existed when you
were a kid and you had a huge crush on
Ally Sheedy in wargames I'm Juan Carlos
back now senior editor pocketnow.com
blasting the signal from sunny Southern
California joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. Jules Wong out on
the east coast how's it going buddy boy
hello and welcome to all our viewers
live on the East Coast and the west
coast and around the world I I was sooo
mean that there has to be someone in
burma watching this right now i'm
wondering with a computer I would hope
so I really feel like Burma does not
come up enough in our tech conversations
and so if there's someone in Burma who
has a pressing need to answer some smart
phone questions this would be the week
to do it
yes let's let's get them on the show
right sweet and I just have to apologize
to all of the viewers and listeners
apparently when you have a toddler they
are just an incubator for all kinds of
ridiculously fun diseases so I'm working
on a little head cold and I kind of
overdid it a little on the the pre-show
we do a periscope right before we go
live just to kind of have a casual Q&amp;amp;A
every week and I was about halfway
through that going you know what this
was probably a bad idea why not coughing
snort and you know I do a whole bunch of
gross stuff right in front of my
microphone but I just apologies that I
probably won't be able to completely
contain all of the gross humanity coming
out lots of slurping noises yeah
okay edit that out I hope you don't cuz
that was hilarious I'm was hacked up on
the microphone doing a good idea to be
able to you know bring that up and bring
all your sicknesses to the podcast and
we want you to also chip in your
questions too because those can be sick
questions yeah so do that by going onto
Twitter going on to that PN weekly
hashtag hashtag P and weekly and
submitting your questions like that if
we're on the air live X this hour 3 p.m.
Eastern 10th of August and you know
we'll be able to answer them live that's
the kind of appeal of it and if you
can't do that why don't you do what
others have done in the past many others
have done it's a great thing great
process its crafting up an email and
sending it over podcast at pocketnow.com
I was going to think of another word I
was in crafting I was like crafting
nailed it but then there was the
anticipatory pond
it's gonna be really oh it's email he's
talking about you okay send that pop3
server I feel most people in our
audience are probably IMAP people that
was me not being a good improv actor not
going with your premise under the yes
and and just like no hard stop not pop
but IMAP all right well I'll see you and
so we got we already have the Apollo man
I'd get gone so quickly we already have
some some great questions coming in on
Twitter using that PN weekly hashtag a
comment from Hugh Richardson while we're
recording this great now I have to watch
wargames again it's a yearly viewing for
me I have to watch that film at least
once a year because it's such a fun
movie and I'm a big Matthew Broderick
fan but you know I definitely hit us up
on the emails definitely hit us up on
that Twitter using that hashtag but
Before we jump into more tech tomfoolery
we do need to thank this week's sponsor
and that's
hello fresh now hello fresh is a farm to
box couch to kitchen meal delivery
service which aims to make cooking more
fun so you can focus on the entire
experience of putting your food and meal
together not just that finished plate
that you're gonna take a photo of that
no one's going to look at on Facebook I
use Instagram I get a few more likes
that way each week hellofresh delivers
delicious new recipes with step by step
cooking instructions broken down into
six major segments this actually is
pretty helpful to the way that they
divide the the labor the prep and then
the actual the cooking the preparation
for each meal that they send so each
meal is designed to take around 30
minutes to prepare and so even for
kitchen novices or for experienced cooks
who might be short on time you can whip
up something really tasty really
efficiently they source the freshest
ingredients freshest ingredients
measured to the exact quantities needed
this reduces food waste and and I do
have to throw another shout out here
we've had them as a sponsor on the
podcast a number of times and thankfully
yeah this is a service that I've
continued to use past their little
introductory like they gave us a couple
free meals to play with and I really do
like the way that they package up each
meal so you don't just get a big gnarly
bag full of ingredients you get these
individual cardboard containers so you
know exactly what's going to go into
each meal and that does reduce the
amount of time it takes to cook each
meal less than $10 per serving you can
select between the classic plan
vegetarian options and a family box to
feed more people definitely check out
their menu they've got all kinds of
really tasty and really interesting
flavor and food combinations chicken
parm parmigiana salad Juicy Lucy burger
with molten cheese core zesty crusted
catfish I mean that was in the first
week of meals that I got from the
service and and all of them were winners
we were impressed with the the flavor
combinations on all of them hello fresh
employees to full-time dietitians to
ensure each meal is nutritionally
balanced and they're offering summer
fare now so definitely check them out
alongside new breakfast options get your
day started off right
excuse me I'm kind of hungry for lunch
already I'm like getting all Salvatori
right now delicious ingredients you'll
love to eat simple recipes you'll love
to cook hello fresh as a special offer
for listeners of the p-n weekly get $30
off your first week of deliveries when
you use the promo code pocket now 30
again $30 off your first week when you
sign up at hellofresh comm with the
promo code pocket now 30 and we thank
them for sponsoring the pocket now
weekly go and do you like liking what I
see here for this week so for August
19th like chicken share their fajitas
and talents your potted cheeseburgers
parmesan crusted fish we've got to stop
producing this podcast before before we
I think we should just stop just give up
on the whole food like that the prepared
food services because that is not really
doing anything for our like ability to
podcast it's it's it just it doesn't
work I'm not gonna be eating like while
we do the podcast but just be making the
stuff while we do the podcast all right
so on the Sharp Aquos I like hold on let
me just I gotta check on this boiling
water here because usually I I mean
again mixing food in tech I'm I'm on
board I think we should absolutely do
that if if anyone should really a fan of
our videos on YouTube I do have a hidden
recipe on one of our reviews for my
ultimate turkey melt recipe yeah you
just have to follow all the numbers at
the end that's always yeah that I
definitely give it a share on Twitter or
something you know and I'll echo chamber
that cuz I hit it in one of my reviews
and but you yourself cannot fine right
yeah and so it's it is it's the ultimate
turkey melt but we should probably stop
talking about food now and get into
actual news stuff it should for the week
of August 7th 2017 this is all the news
that is fit to find vodcast food cast
podcasts yeah that's a man beginning
that i potentially entering mass
production supply chain sources believe
that as component makers have seen major
annual sales gains iPhone eight
assemblers I may just assume start
getting more money from Apple well ahead
of previous bank expectations for
October and November production on the
iPhone 7s and 7s plus is also said to be
starting to the essential phone is also
starting full production the name is
coming the visa via a tweet from any
room in the company's founder the news
follows the Wall Street Journal's
one-on-one talk with company president
Nicola Damacy
where among other things he detailed a
unit sales goal in the low single-digit
millions best buy and Amazon will be
unlocked retail partners China sees its
first sharp phone in forever as the Fox
brand the Foxconn brand launched the
Aqua s2 this week the standard version
features a snapdragon 630 has a dual
camera system and a 2x1 display that
surrounds the selfie camera and receiver
if you think about the essential phone's
design much like that it's not even
clear when Japan Sharp's home country
will see this phone much less any other
country but said to range around the
upper 400 slower 500 cos the lenovo k 8
notes follows through on the
manufacturers must have moved to stock
android on its own brand phones it
debuted in india with a 10 core mediatek
processor dual cameras wmo sound and a
four thousand milliamp hour battery
amazon india will watch the phone on
August 18 the reveals continued though
this ones weren't quite that Galaxy s8
active has landed on ATT without any
preload take the Galaxy s8 apply a thick
polymer case and a four thousand
milliamp hour battery and you have an
active phone pre-orders are on mind
right now sales from August 11 t-mobile
has its own phone to talk about to TCL
was rumored to have made this the Revel
that is our e double V L some
entry-level specs will cost zero down
and five dollars a month it marks the
debut of the smart picks phone line up
each of the phones offered will be
automatically placed onto a new Jeff on
demand lease program where users can
upgrade once as often as every 30 days
Apple is playing with augmented reality
tech in prototypes of a new smart
glasses concept we see 3d cameras at
play but it seems that IO will mostly be
left to a continued iPhone no word on
ETA but we do have a better grip on an
Apple watch 3 with LTE capabilities
apparently the engineering team have
figured out a way where a modem wouldn't
suck up all the battery they've been
working on this since at least last year
a final product should be out this fall
according to Bloomberg finally new emoji
candidates have been proposed for the
standard set to take effect in June 2018
there are a few body pots to be had
objects like teddy bears magnets into
brick walls and well you know this is
gonna be good sad pile to a sad the
happy Fuji my life is now complete just
wanted to throw this out there just to
see if there I mean they're already on
the boards we have like coming up to
like 2,000 of them many of them I mean
you know we still have many to go so I'm
wondering what you're missing out on
well I mean really it's I feel like we
probably just need a few more fill in
emojis so that we can finally complete
the return to hieroglyphics for
communication all of these letters and
numbers they're just really inconvenient
and what I really feel we should be
doing is using sort of more like
pictograph style forms of communication
areas name I think written like re did
that once so but we could first probably
is that concept we can always start from
just you know educational games because
I think that's all totally and then
we'll need translators for like people
my age and older so I can write out a
message and it'll just convert it into
all emojis you know yeah
we're not all like artists designers and
you know standardized you know we can't
just continuously replicate
these things unless you know I mean if
you if you're have like Sanskrit or
Chinese where the characters are more
complicated I think you'd be able to
handle that better
other than that English you know with
the standard care but all that stuff
like that's it's just simple strokes
really yeah okay so emojis that's
definitely a thing know what I wanted to
circle back to though was Apple watch
that the series three is coming out I'd
be very surprised if the watch looks
fundamentally different than previous
incarnations of the Apple watch cellular
capabilities could be really interesting
cuz I think right now a lot of times we
bill like LTE connectivity is this like
mainline way that you can stay connected
when really I think it's only useful in
short bursts like I want to take a
workout and for the duration of the
workout I want this kind of activity and
then as soon as I'm done with the
workout and I'm back at home I shut it
back off again
but I wanted to put out there was the
the notion that this could have glucose
checking built-in that this could be
something that is also now double double
dipping or serving as a way to help
manage other health issues like type 1
and type 2 diabetes which I don't think
is actually I mean it's there it's been
suggested it's been hinted and you know
it'd be great if it were on there but
I'm not exactly sure if that would be
about the most reliable thing I mean
you're talking about a whole whole bunch
of a big huge population and relying on
this kind of kind of a untested metric
or an tested mechanism so for I don't
know three four hundred dollars is this
going to be a worthwhile investment
compared to a dedicated you know and so
on the Spencer breeder whatever it's
it's still it's gonna have to go through
the trials and all that well it will and
and so I I don't think anyone would look
at a piece of consumer electronics as a
way to fully encompass management of a
disease like diabetes but what's really
important is because like we have a lot
of technology there Dex comms there are
glucose blood testing devices where you
have to like prick your finger prick
skin to get blood out what could be
really interesting is a way to track
general trends so if we had an apple
watch which didn't have to break skin to
get general trends on something like
blood glucose level that could also be
beneficial to a number of other people
in society other things like you know
people that are on the ketogenic diets
for example would probably want to be
aware of that in the same way that right
now I like being generally aware of my
heart rate is this the most accurate
heart rate monitor no it's really not
and I would never depend on this if I
had some sort of cardiac issue that
needed like actual care so I kind of
look at this is the same thing like if
you have an Apple watch and you're a
diabetic you can get a really good
overview of general trends then you also
have all of the the fun lifestyle
benefits of having an Apple watch you
wouldn't rely on it as a way to really
manage your disease but it's extra
information that helps fill in the gaps
in between those times you have to test
your blood and then I think for a lot of
other people that could be really
interesting so for example let's say
you're pre-diabetic and you don't know
it and you start seeing blood sugar
spikes after meals that could be
valuable information for helping to
change up your workouts change up your
diet or have a conversation with your
doctor indeed and also well I had a
thought in there that just disappeared
but it was about on the general aspect
of increasing usage time yeah that's
right
because we've seen this with Fitbit
where usage time is collapsed the
sessions are just not up to where they
were and that's you know that's where
the company has led itself down to kind
of a crisis point where investors are
not really believing in that so I mean
if that's a metric that Apple wants to
increase I think this is a definitely a
great way to be able to do that at least
in terms of one population I'm not sure
exactly if you know if it's a go-to
because if you're pre-diabetic you don't
know and
you have to actually go to the app and
you know it has to be something that you
actively care about in the first place
before you bring it up and I mean I
don't know so but we do have a question
here PN weekly hash tag from at
riina-chan is there a way to measure
glucose from the skin sweat and
technically yes I just don't know that
any manufacturer has ever put out a
device specifically to do that because
of some of the concerns we're talking
about it would be marketed towards
diabetics and it's not nearly as
accurate as doing a blood test to
measure your glucose levels but there
are also other sort of other ways that
people have helped manage diseases like
diabetes like you can train dogs to
detect the quality of smell and sweat
that comes off of someone who's diabetic
because that extra sugar in their blood
in their bloodstream is going to impact
things like the smell and taste of grass
I'm sorry and I'm really over
generalizing here and anyone who's a
diabetic is probably like smashing their
face against their computer right now
listening does talk about this but there
are different ways you can do that this
would be a consumer facing way with
broad acceptance if Apple decides to
actually implement it or maybe make it a
part of like a watch band or a watch
strap so it's not in every Apple watch
but it there's a way to use it with sort
of proprietary hardware indeed indeed I
want to circle back to a central phone
because oh yeah got the whole you know
being eight weeks late or even longer
because they'd have just hits full
production I do want to talk a little
bit Demi's comments from just yesterday
where it's you know he's basically
mostly just parroting developments that
we've caught on to you like the Best Buy
and Amazon retail holding and also
others like the whole week's kind of
general ETA timeline and then you know
of course any room and it had to like
come in and say oh it's happening now so
there's the whole what do you think
about
and it's Alexa fund and ten cents you
know China China huge tech conglomerate
funding three hundred million dollars to
this venture now because now we're
starting to see different expectations
about how you know the you know
essential home is gonna be a key asset
to this where does you know it can do
all sorts of things with Google
assistant or all the other assistance
out there Alexa included and then just a
Chinese power coming into play in the US
you know that's actually what I'm a
little less well-versed on is looking at
$0.10 business model in seeing how a
strategic partnership with essential
phone could benefit or could could help
improve their catalogue of services and
products in the United States obviously
in North America the Amazon side of this
is probably the more compelling part of
the discussion whether or not this will
influence essential phone to play with
Alexa compatibility is going to be I
think a very interesting position for a
smart phone manufacturer to take right
now but I think there's something really
compelling about the idea of Amazon
having that direct partnership with a
company that they can then promote as
sort of a crown jewel flagship unlocked
phone we know that their first
essentials first partnership is with
Sprint so we will see essential phone
showing up on Sprint that's their
carrier deal but we've seen Amazon make
some significant inroads in selling
unlocked phones to North Americans and
so those are usually budget devices less
expensive devices entry-level devices so
having a manufacturer set specifically
on offering a flagship device and one
that's being billed is you know like new
cutting-edge technologies modular phone
wireless usb adaptations a very bold
design whether or not that front-facing
selfie camera turns people off I think
that could be that could be a really a
really good partnership for both Amazon
and essential both for promoting a
device not having to rely on Sprint ad
dollars for all of the device promotion
then
having another outlet where people not
on Sprint would have access to that
phone - yeah and in terms of like the
whole sprint deal because sock Bank is
the Japanese parent company of Sprint
and there was a little talk where sock
bank would have invested I think it was
you know 100 million or something like
that into the company into essential and
was they pulled out because Apple were
decided to join in on the fund that it
was going to you know use to do that
with and since in social was competing
with with Android and with against Apple
that would ya been productive but you
know it was one of these big you know
angel investors with money with that's
interest in tech is going to be flying
around whether it be it you know
Elon Musk for some reason or $0.10 as
you see right here so yeah and
especially with TPP coming it just I'm
going I'm getting beyond my death via
depth here but you know there is an
expanding realm of China's economic
muster so with that you know of America
first in them yeah well it but you know
Andy Rubens reputation I think is
deserving of a shot like this it's just
when we start talking about this kind of
money coming in from other players and
other investors like it puts a lot more
pressure on the brand so that we were
watching recode the first thing I
thought of when when we got the news
about Amazon and $0.10 was that little
quip he made about it's okay for us to
take longer to scale you know because we
want to make sure that we can actually
fulfill shipping and manufacturing and
then as the business gets larger we have
different concerns that changes a little
when you've got players like Amazon and
$0.10 dumping hundreds of millions of
dollars into your company now the the
risk/reward is is greater and the
expectations are higher from people
outside the company so I'll be curious
to see how this first generation plays
off I mean I don't think anyone's gonna
have super high expectations for this
thing selling art
outselling an established brand but can
they show some kind of consumer
relationship consumer attachment that
they can build off of and that's gonna
be like a three to four year process if
they're really serious about being in
the smartphone space but even from
generation one we've got to see some
kind of uptick some kind of conversation
some kind of enthusiasts that's gonna
that's going to be a fan of this brand
because these cannot be a geek and nerd
phone I mean they've made it pretty
clear uh Damacy made it pretty clear
that you know they want to build in a
moat but you actually use your her kind
of go to terms of emotive attachments
and all that so I mean is of the current
Android ecosystem right the prison
people who helped create the current
smartphone paradigm that we understand
today he's the one that's wanting to
shift it more aggressively so we'll
we'll see I'll uh this is all just the
we're all super curious to see how this
plays out but damn if they're not gonna
be facing crazy competition there's a
quintet of phones coming out the end of
this year which are all gonna be monster
performers all trying to occupy the
limelight and Andy Reubens name is the
major differentiator for essential phone
becoming a success or becoming a failure
that's a lot of pressure to put on an
individual backing up a brand a new
brand he has a name it's it's called
Annie ruin and he happened to be whether
on the credit list for Android so I mean
yeah he's brother you know this all
these little ventures and is funding new
ventures with it through his playground
initiative so I mean he bootstrap did
boots get this thing out of partially I
picked a playground so and also Google
fun I think red B or something that is
that Google alphabet I that one I don't
know I'm actually not for that I don't
know that that brand name but so II that
doesn't need to bootstrap a product but
it's still facing very similar concerns
is a Samsung I've finally taken the
wraps off officially announcing that
galaxy active so you guys know
quiet you got it there's no please so
but you guys know I'm super excited
about this the active has always been my
favorite phone of the year and you're
telling me I can have a smaller screen
si not the si plus but with a battery
bigger than the si plus and in a more
rugged shell because I'm not a huge fan
of glass back devices this is already
shaping up to be my favorite Samsung of
the year but it was quietly and it would
like the press release came out of
nowhere it was a day where we're selling
it now okay I so really like they were
way late you know it's like not only
keeping expectations low but keeping
expectations almost non-existent they're
perfect they're trying to I'm not sure
if this is a definitive like gap for you
know just letting the Galaxy Note 8
breathe but I mean it's sort of ashamed
to you know be able to just it's a fort
that they've got great battery going on
here
we've never movie not got we have not
got to touch the damn thing right I mean
we can't really assess the durability
and all that although we would hope that
it would be better from the s7 active
with all its water resistance yeah you a
few manufacturing issues I mean from I
think we started doing we've been doing
this like yearly get-together in
Southern California where we take active
phones to water parks a bunch of just
local bloggers a trisha hershberger rich
tomorrow from KTLA we've done this a
bunch of times and from the s4 active to
the s7 active the s7 active is the only
time we had a phone fail so we'd usually
have like five or six like going down
water slides or going underwater or
getting pelted by like jets and stuff
like that and out of five s7 actives we
did have one that that that died on the
lazy river but of all things right yeah
I mean but it was like we're pretty sure
like it taken abuse before then and then
just we were trying to shoot videos like
oh this one doesn't work
um but considering you know like how
aggressive we put those phones through
potential water damage situations that's
still not bad
um that's still not a bad ratio it's
just not as solid as what we thought the
s6 act that was so hopefully they've
sorted that out for the s8 active
there's like I said like these are
always my favorites I like grippy backs
I like rugged construction I like not
having to throw a case on it I'm even
like kind of okay with the charmingly
ugly lumpy cling on ridges and fake camo
and all of those crap adaptations that
make it seem like a tough phone so I'm
on board yeah yeah have you contacted
your I can't even speak now can you cut
have you contacted your PR in on either
side no I mean we haven't heard anything
anything official on when we'll be able
to get our hands on one and
unfortunately I think everyone would
have knows even the PR teams that I work
with everyone sort of knows like no
one's gonna be talking about this
outside of like a little feature piece
you know like it's not gonna get the
same kind of coverage and it kind of
doesn't need it you know a lot of this
stuff is just carried over from the
regular s8 but what conversation we
would have had at the beginning of the
summer if this thing have launched in
June just like every other active would
have been a lot more interesting to talk
about is it's a summer phone it's a
vacation phone it's a travel phone it
makes a lot of sense in that regard but
now it's going up against Aoife coverage
note 8 coverage V 30 coverage it's just
gonna get it's just gonna get hammered
so I think even here they're they're
scaling way back on trying to promote it
and I don't even think we're gonna do
our little waterpark Trek this year just
cuz summer's almost over so we'll see
we'll see how it goes
all right well hopefully that might mean
that you should go just for the sake of
going I think that's that's I mean if we
do it I'm there because like I said who
doesn't want to for work I mean I have
to do it for work go to a water park and
play with the phone and it's great
because even though we've have more
water resistant devices out there now
you know like an LG you see water
resistant regular Samsung's are now
water resistant HTC you still like your
planner
with phones in water and people still
act like this is a unique yeah when in
Japan
taking baths with their phones for from
longest time texting something with well
burned up from Hugh Richardson at solace
geek using the PN weekly hashtag I'd be
all over in eight active except , AT&amp;amp;T
it is an 18 T exclusive
I really wish Samsung would deliver a
least a European variant may be called
you know the galaxy s a tough or
something like that from at-at Peter at
hatin Peter Peter Hayden I guess this
year why not compare this with all of
the other waterproof phones in the water
park it's all scientific testing so I
will have to take six phones and dunk
them all under water and see which phone
survives I'm really excited about
getting an active into the mix against
like an LG g6 I mean yeah as long as
they're willing to like you know we
don't have to buy a unit that's that's
that's gonna be great because at this
point we I I spent you know I spent a
little money on the you know our no-date
coverage are running and it's like it's
gonna it's gonna be fun but man I'm not
gonna be able to eat so I'm gonna be
there so who knows what will help you
know I hear they've got like good good
food you know in New York
I hear that well you can see full
details on these stories and more hit
pocketnow.com and look for the podcast
section to get to this episodes and run
down you can also chat with us but what
you've been reading up on with hashtag p
and weekly also be sure to catch Jaime
Rivera and the PocketNow daily on our
You Tube channel and now I think it's
time for something that's long been
overdue again we're going to talk about
some listen to me o listeners ly the
point where I put the Denton Louis bong
we haven't done the bong bong yeah
they're like that webOS still is the
thing that existed
Oh entry a friend of the show also
technically our podcast and like he
brought up webOS like I'm like
immediately on our like when I came
around that's was that's still active in
2017 great terrific sort of those
servers don't work anymore but it's
still a thing right I guess it's still a
thing
well anyway is enough about webOS
because let's talk about something that
is and yeah it's it's current and we go
on to Aaron linson hello pocket no team
I was wondering as a person currently
running a g5 from LG would going for a
moto z2 force be good I was also
wondering would it work for a job on an
assembly line as far as the unbreakable
display do you think this phone would be
perfect for me thanks Aaron linson PS I
talked to Michael about accessibility on
both Android and iOS when he was noticed
I would love to talk about this again as
things have changed since I last talked
so um I mean what the motives e to force
is it has a shatterproof display but
it's not specifically if it's not really
what I would think of as a durable phone
would you agree yeah I mean again if
we're sort of parsing a couple different
phrases in there and if you're looking
for a more rugged phone experience I
don't know that I would put this up
there as a device that would fulfill
that kind of criteria it's I think it's
only rated for modest splash resistance
not for any kind of enhanced water
resistance and the shattered shield
display is definitely more flexible so
it's gonna help against like a really
bad corner drop and not like rippling
through and spiderweb cracking your
screen but I don't know that it has any
kind of specific milspec drop resistance
rating at least not that I've been able
to look up and someone's gonna correct
me on this made out of a stem
and series aluminium I'm not sure why
didn't you know how the Christian and
and those and those there are important
build quality things to describe but
that still doesn't give us a proper
rating you know an expectation of what
this thing should be able to survive and
plus I still feel like we're gonna be
doing our full review on Friday for the
Moto z2 and as a spoiler for that review
there is a significant trade off for
having that shatter shield display out
of the box like I have not gotten a
screen protector for it yet and I
haven't even numerous scratches very
very fine light scratches that I
wouldn't have on another on a glass that
conclusion has long been spoiled by a
lot of other people you know we're there
those things come with compromises and
so if you're worried about drop
resistance shatter shield is fantastic
tech but I really wish Motorola would
deliver a first-party glass screen
protector to augment the lifestyle
durability of the device the chucking it
into a purse it accidentally gets put
into a pocket with your keys you know
that's a dangerous scenario for the z2
force where it's just sort of a minor
bummer if it's any other phone out there
where it's probably not gonna scratch up
that display question because we've been
talking about the galaxy and active them
the s7 a who had a shatterproof
displayed in it yes but I don't believe
it was the same kind of plastic yeah
it's not the same kind of thing but did
you did you ever get around to like
really something that thing not not in
like trying to rake it because I have my
a seven active here actually within
arm's reach it's funny how out of all
others am some phones the actives are
almost always closer than the regular
dresses and so this is yeah I don't see
any significant scratches and this was a
phone that went down waterslides we did
drop testing on it and it's been used
pretty aggressively also is the kid
phone so we'll fire this up with a bunch
of Netflix and let my daughter sort of
chuck it around while we're like flying
or traveling so she can watch word party
and it's in the screen on this is in
better shape
then the screen on my moto z2 which I've
had for a little less than two weeks so
over a year of active lifestyle
potential situation I just used the
brand name of the phone in there the
modeling of the phone versus very light
use a camera test and the first week of
reviewing and this is already a little
bit more rough aware than the active is
and so that that is definitely I think
that's a concern that I I feel needs to
be reiterated as we go through talking
about these different devices because
there's an expectation that phone
screens can handle a certain amount of
abuse and I don't feel that the Moto Z 2
lives up to that expectation if you were
coming from another phone indeed indeed
so I mean what do you think in terms of
just that kind of blush do you feel like
you know if you had to really nail it
down because I'm not sure in terms of
Aaron's timeline in terms of upgrading
but what do you think moto z24 sorry
gasps the s7 active
well actually I mean if we're talking
about durability as being the killer app
then yeah I mean if you can go for an
active go for an active maybe I also
consider a g6 because you're already on
a g5 and the g6 is rated for enhanced
drop resistance as well though I don't
trust a glass backbone as much as I
trust the metal back on the V 20 but we
have ratings for what we should expect
from those phones uh if the killer app
though like let's say Aaron you were
really into the idea of having a modular
phone well then the only game in town is
motorola so I don't know if you were
using your g5 because you liked swapping
between the camera grip or the B&amp;amp;O DAC
or something like that then I think
you'd really enjoy the Moto mod
experience on a moto z2 but if the if
the main feature that you're looking for
is durability then it's either an active
or a g6 right now are the two phones at
the top of my list and then below that
if you want to save some cash I'm always
been a big fan of Kyocera I like what
they do with the hydro line I like what
they do with the duro force
line I think you know they're not always
the most exciting phones they usually
have pretty terrible cameras but some of
the sonic screen tech is really cool for
making your phone calls louder and my
Brigadier is still the tanky astone I've
ever owned
it is the workbench phone of oh yeah
it's the I accidentally dropped it on a
table saw phone is right up there and
then in a two-by-four you know and it
just it just it's fine Thank You Aaron
for I'm not sure whether to go which one
to go to because I you know well look at
the questions I want to get to a couple
of these tweets real careful use these
tweets as a transition from Harlow
Espina am IV 20 survives from nasty
Falls I hope the V 30 will be as robust
again I think maybe the most survivable
phone I've had four drops has been the
v10 again those stainless steel rails
were killer from Hugh Richardson I think
I think I'm sorry I've got I think Aaron
would be better off going g6 with a case
and screen protector over a z2 force
especially given the price differences
and that's actually a pretty pretty
solid consideration to if you like LG
software you're gonna have a much
smoother transition from the g5 to the
g6 you can get the g6 pretty cheap if
you shop it and all the here I'm showing
y'all with scotty vests at the water
park i like i should show up in in like
a speedo and a Scottevest so many
pockets full of leached water yeah
that's fun I love it so I wanna I want
to track to an earlier question we got
right before the podcast started I just
have to to scroll back and this is from
Andrew Wallace at phat produce and and
as we've mentioned on the podcast the
keeper of the Star Trek gifs and he has
a question about fitbit's new SmartWatch
design and he lends it off with we lost
pebble for this SmartWatch god dammit
god have you pulled up what this thing
looks like yet Jules
actually I'll screen share so that you
can see you can see off of off of me if
it will allow me to do it yeah because
like I'm between the emails and
everything else because this uh there's
one that you mentioned at the top of the
show that I didn't originally clue
include because it was a little it was a
little spicy kind of off topic and you
know that's pretty oh man
so yeah I mean this looks a lot like
their other Fitness Smart Watch solution
what was the other one it's not the the
Fitbit HR is their heart rate they have
too many names too many names just too
many notes just get rid of some of the
notes and it will be easier to listen to
yeah charge HR I think it's the charge
or something like that but I'm but I
mean it was either the charge of the
surge and it was almost again almost
identical to this kind of layout this
sort of square-ish I'm saying I I don't
think that Fitbit optioned Pebbles
technology and intellectual property to
try and deliver a pebble experience I
think they were just looking at a
catalog of features they probably wanted
a handful of patents or one or two
individual features in their library
they can yeah it just kind of it came
with having to buy the entire catalog of
pebble tech unfortunately I think the
dream of owning a pebble like SmartWatch
has probably gone now
there was about to say it's in their
library they can show it off when they
do interviews in that dignified you know
politician manner where they have the
fully stocked bookcase behind them and
you know never really touch anything
behind them so great so now if if this
render is true that we're looking at a
proprietary watch strap design these
little clasps that connect the watch
strap that's going to be kind of
frustrating I like having just regular
pins that are standard for different
bracelets and I'm not sure I love the
way that the same angles back into the
the heart rate sensor that depending on
how this sort of presses up against the
wrist it could stick out sort of
awkwardly and then the watch straps
gonna pull it into your wrist
sometimes that fit can be a little
irritating depending on how that's
that's all put together I don't know I
mean Fitbit wasn't really my go-to
solution for any kind of SmartWatch so
I'm not overly excited about any future
SmartWatch from them and this isn't
gonna replace what I loved about pebbles
so I don't know I don't know that this
is gonna solve fitbit's marketing market
share and dropping sales all right so
we're moving on to this next meal which
is gonna be tough for me too I don't
think I'll express any view of it Google
gender manifesto that yes again a very
sensitive topic and this person does not
want to be the you know identified
anonymous because they would be in the
minority opinion and kind of like the
less open-minded opinion here so I'll
just read up what they say here I do
feel that there is an era perspective
that needs to be addressed with regards
to the firing of the Google employee
that was fired due to his diversity
manifesto full disclosure I am a
conservative the employee was at most a
moderate I do want to see women in the
tech fields and we in the text fields
and leadership roles however I believe
it should be dependent on the skill of
the individual rather than on a person's
race gender or sexual orientation
men and women do think and act
differently however this analysis is not
inherently a bad thing differences in
opinions and ideas are diverse and
should be expressed from my observations
however many diversity initiatives want
to shut down ideals he is in speech
considered hateful and divisive
however the standards of hateful or
divisive speech seem to undermine those
who express conservative opinions this
firing comes in tandem with YouTube
monetizing content it deems
quote/unquote controversial this
vendetta against arbitrarily defined
controversial speech is dangerous and a
threat to society a free marketplace of
ideas is true intellectual diversity
preventing us from going to an Orwellian
dystopia ideological shaming should not
be practiced I know that you might not
agree with what I have to say but I feel
that it needs to be expressed all right
so with all that going on haha give us
give us what's what's right what's wrong
do it just everyone's gonna be pissed
off with us if we say anything so I want
to acknowledge like I said the email I
was like you know like this this is an
email that we got I'm not sure if you
want to cover this and you know surprise
whereas we are covering this so again I
really don't want to touch this with the
10-foot rhyme mostly because I really
well first of all I I decided I like
when I when I read the you know
headlines I was like I was I'm not gonna
touch this I'm not gonna look at this
because at some point I want to get away
from the reaction get away from the 24
kind of our new cycle of that and you
know take a deep look when I actually
have leisure and time to there's a lot
to unpack and I feel any conversation we
could dedicate an entire podcast to this
topic and bring on guests and have
debates and still ones for women like
for example well but I mean and still
barely scratch
the surface as to some of the larger
themes that play here when it comes to
diversity in any kind of business
business environment and so anything
that we comment on here I think your
your sort of whatever your disclaimer
should stand for this is a developing
story in the context of a much larger
and divisive topic that we're
experiencing on almost all fronts
politics media content entertainment
technology business this is indicative
of a perspective which is evolving
throughout our society and we are we're
woefully unequipped to do it complete
justice in the context of a segment on a
podcast yeah now talking about this
situation specifically Google is a
business and I kind of feel like in a
capitalist society Google should be
allowed to conduct business how they see
fit corporates never a brief speech
including their relationships with their
individual employees because having
worked in some in some larger industries
and having worked for some government
agencies as a contractor a Department of
Energy I know firsthand that anything
that's deemed somewhat controversial or
explodes into any kind of public
discussion becomes a humongous headache
for your Human Resources Department so
let's say Google did not fire this guy
but that this sort of public discussion
in these trading manifestos was creating
a toxic environment this would be
incredible evidence for someone to bring
about some kind of discrimination
lawsuit against Google like if if a
woman or a minority or a minority woman
felt that this was becoming a hostile
workplace what would be piece of
evidence number one it would be this
manifesto
so do I necessarily agree with the
firing from the basis of free speech
standpoint no I don't I believe you
be allowed to say whatever you want free
of government persecution but that this
was a public discussion being held on
Google resources and in flaming part of
Google's employee base I don't see where
Google is necessarily wrong to try and
nip this in the bud I think it makes him
a martyr I think it actually brings its
the stress
what is it the Streisand effect where
when you try and quiet a situation like
this it actually draws more attention to
it but I don't think that Google was out
of bounds and I think that they were
probably doing the best that they could
in managing a volatile situation and
trying to keep their business focused on
the best possible outcome from a
volatile situation and hoping that it
would go away it's obviously not going
to go away because of that action but I
don't think there was really any other
recourse at this point that they could
have taken to try and mitigate the
fallout from from a situation if we're
going to look at this from a public
square versus private square so you know
take a look at uber and its culture its
thrown manifestos regarding its private
behaviors within the company it was just
it's it was bound to break out and you
know it's only you're only as good as
your perception and we've seen that in
uber 'z actions and ubers declining
popularity where lyft has just eaten
them up so good having Google seen that
yeah it would have made sense for them
to like you know what this this doesn't
look good and it wouldn't look good in
public so I mean there's that there's
also the whole bunch of things that we
can go into about corporate First
Amendment's you know Hobby Lobby
recently with the whole contraceptive
the SCOTUS lawsuit so beyond that that's
difficult about one of these topics
though is that it starts it starts
opening the floodgates on every other
situation I mean again if we're dealing
just with this situation at this point
it's hard not to bring in the baggage
from any other time that an individual
has has encountered a perceived
like because of having or entertaining
political discourse or a political
speech in the context of a business
environment and that is what I mean
that's why we I think we get so hot
blooded about these kinds of topics is
because it's really difficult to
separate from previous situations that
have also felt complicated dirty not
right something like that I don't think
it's a corporations place to try and
enforce or engage or promote some kind
of free speech ideal if there's a
perceived danger of that speech
impacting sales and shareholder value a
corporation does not exist to promote
the First Amendment a corporation exists
to deliver shareholder value so again I
don't really feel that there's any
significant problem with Google's
Google's firing this guy from a business
perspective but again this is why that
we've got to unpack all of this and say
like did it have the achieved outcome
absolutely not it turned this guy into a
martyr into a major talking point on
sites like Reddit we're having a
conversation about it right now two
tracks from yeah it detracts from our
main goal which is to talk about mostly
about hardware and the associated
software services like there are totally
valid concerns about the consumer end of
this because I you know I always wonder
how many women were in the room when
people decided you know to make a smart
watchful woman and it's all you know
crusts encrusted with gems
well not addressed you know smartphone
is it for to be lavender-colored and to
have a jewel that hangs out of the
headphones like that's that's always it
like if you're if you're trying to you
know I feel like you know people are
putting in like beside the whole gender
diversity or diversity of thought it's
having you executed using that in the
right way in the first place so that we
can not have flops or you know such as
the twelve is that the HTC something
whatever like that the phone you're
referring to but you know it's it's
I call it the HTC ovaries a woman would
want in a phone and they're not only
wrong but like they're completely wrong
meet spot don't want to talk about just
just the part of the discussion here
whether or not you're for affirmative
action or against affirmative action
some of these other really dicey topics
to discuss I mean I think it's been
pretty clear over the course of
producing this podcast that I lean more
towards the bleeding heart than I do
towards the conservative end of the
political spectrum but this is also the
part of the conversation that we need to
have is accompanying really delivering
the products and services that you care
about are they reaching out to the
audience's that are going to benefit
from this type of focus or this type of
initiative and are they losing sight of
their customer base if you feel that
this is an area where Google is messing
up we live in a capitalist society and I
don't want to get all libertarian on
this issue but the market speaks and you
have the ability to influence market
decisions based on your purchasing or
your or your your own individual
monetary power and the ability to have
these discussions in public forums free
of government persecution and that's
what we need to continue to engage in I
am concerned about the current sort of
liberal initiative in shaming
individuals that have opinions different
from sort of a current generation
liberal mindset I tend to look at most
issues as being more economic driven
than racially driven I'm a pale skinned
Hispanic kid so I benefit from some
aspects of privilege but I haven't
benefited from all and I am a quarter
Native American you know so my
perspective to these things is singular
and I think that's also one of the other
things that we absolutely have to keep
sight of and where I've been most
disappointed in the liberal conversation
is conflating individual experiences
with demographic experiences and and how
we approach problems we need to have a
good balance of both and I don't think
anyone would necessarily disagree with
looking
the numbers of larger overall
institutional gathered data versus the
numbers and the personal experiences of
individuals who have gone through
different problems and different
challenges in their lives and I think
that's where we can come together to
have meaningful conversations but it's
not going to happen if we continue to
listen to the tiniest vocalists minority
of angry people in this space then we
don't reach any conclusions then we
don't solve any problems then we all
just get defensive put our shields up
and we don't listen to the other person
opposite us you know I don't really have
a communicator think that yeah the last
thing I wanted to say it's not a
business's responsibility to foster that
conversation
I don't want corporations being the the
stewards of free speech so if our
business has to make it smart that's the
marketing department um that's a PR
company um if if a business still has to
protect their assets and their interests
then that's up to the business I I don't
see anything wrong with that actually
from the libertarian perspective the
business should be able to operate how
they want to operate and if an
individual employee is causing this much
grief then that's that's the situation
but outside of that corporate
responsibility when we were looking at
individuals and we're looking at
discussion in the greater political
realm that's where I feel we need to
have more substantive conversations and
and a little less of the whinging on
both sides from the people who are most
emotionally active but not really
looking at how we can solve problems
really looking more to create
thoughtcrime or to to express negativity
outside of that and and this is
something that I feel is is is probably
well represented on both sides of this
debate is people with their own personal
agendas and trying to stir up some kind
of victimhood we're not going to solve
problems that way we're only going to
make the divides larger for a field of
you know this where internet the
Internet has opened up communications
people have been trying to more like
they've created different silos it's
always been just the silo of a field of
silos and
yeah III think this is the you know
bring that conversation into the open
and being able to not only express
yourself in a mature and well thought
out in unit manner I don't I think
between like the outrage machines that
we vote that it's especially it's it's
it's hard it's totally is it's like what
am I supposed to be angry about today
let me go to Facebook oh my god let's
get into a more controversial and
divisive topic ready go yeah all right
so from Peter Hayden basically it blows
down to these two questions and there's
a whole but accessibility talk but we
can get into afterwards but how are the
current impacts of voice assistant
fragmentations
affecting us right now especially with
the HTC u 11 having access to three so
we have the sense companion we have
Google assist and then we have the new
Alexa integration just like it's it's a
we're having fun I guess and then
there's also the central hub which is
supposed to play nicely with all of them
so it's like right yeah this is this is
useful to us this is this is supposedly
useful to last but it's it's too many at
once well you know again it's one of
those things like what do we really
expect people to dig into when they're
going to try and take advantage of like
a software assistant and I just feel
that there is a terrible lack of
conveyance in what these things can can
do and unfortunately consumers are only
apt to give them a try once or twice and
then the novelty wears off and I don't
think they're really gonna you know dive
down that rabbit hole to see what else
they can do or when the software gets
updated so I think when the reasons why
we've seen so many changes like Google
Google now Google Assistant Google AI
all these different sort of permutations
of voice search on Android why Google
keeps renaming it is that people will
come
and try the new app even though it's
really kind of the same evolution of
what they had before they just weren't
willing to like keep checking in to see
what those new features are those new
service as a new logo and everything and
tents yeah I guess so yeah the whole
primary you know fragmentation I really
like how Peter points this out for
example with Philips hue lighting Alexa
will set a scene but not a color and
Google will set a color but not yeah
it's complimentary but it's not like
like you'd have to call it up in the
first place so if you have both all
right Google set a night scene or it's
set a set an orange color and then Alexa
said that that's not that's not
efficient that's not right I mean
obviously the only correct answer is
Cortana no I mean again sorry I'm trying
not to hack up my lungs on this mic um
no this is this is why this field is
still so wide open these are the first
baby steps in trying to interact with
data in services in another in another
way not just I stare at glowing
rectangle I touch glowing rectangle it's
can we really incorporate meaningful and
emotionally contextually relevant
interactions experiences and use
something like audio can we use
something like augmented reality what
what else can we do to push the
boundaries on how we keep people plugged
in at the same time potentially solving
some of the etiquette and dangerous
problems with utilizing mobile
technology if you caught the the
periscope last week we got down this
really deep conversation just about you
know social etiquette and then also uh
tech mobile technology where you know
your smartphones are probably more
responsible for fatalities in this
country than terrorist attacks you know
if we look at the driving statistics on
distracted driving and we're not in as
much of an uproar as we are about
national security but we could be taking
big
her grandeur steps to try and solve this
problem or at least mitigate some of
this issue before we get to self-driving
cars um this is another one of those
baby steps smartwatches some kind of
heads-up display better audio
integration better wireless audio
solutions these are all the little baby
steps that we can take to try and help
correct some of these problems but
ultimately I don't think we get there
until we can get a more comprehensive
software package that can take more of
the heavy lifting off our plate so you
know I'm gonna mention I want an IBM
Watson phone and better automation
around us for certain sort of easily
distracted scenarios things like better
cruise control better radar assist
better self piloting capabilities and
ultimately full-on autonomous driving
vehicles at that point then I think
we've got a lot more room to experiment
with how do we use our phones because
right now in Southern California
especially every time you pull up to a
stoplight
it's scary every single time I'm behind
the wheel of a car there is almost
always some potential altercation most
of the time it would have been something
like you know almost getting rear-ended
or someone sort of drifting into my lane
or something else but it was you know it
was last week
trying to make a left-hand turn and
realizing that even though I'm on a
solid red because I had to wait in the
intersection for people to finish
coasting through that long after the red
someone wasn't going to stop and they
were looking down in their lap you're
like I'm about to get into a head-on
accident head-on collision with a car
going 45 miles an hour with my daughter
in the backseat and I had to pull like
an emergency turned back into the middle
of an intersection just to avoid it and
I don't know that he ever looked up so I
mean like this stuff happens every
single time I'm behind the wheel of a
car and a lot of it is influenced by how
we use mobile technology indeed indeed I
don't mean to shorten that conversation
but it's just that this next one and
last one is is a mouthful before you do
that I just wanted this one this one
tweet from Harlow Espina using the p-n
weekly hashtag Google assistant has been
ignoring me
I've been trying to use Bixby I think
she's mad at me
I think the best way that you can
actually prevent that is by supporting
the Kickstarter with the case for the
Galaxy s8 that actually what we all know
that Google did Grudge though I mean
look at how long we had to go off air
just for streaming because we talk so
much crap about hangouts great some
flowers maybe some chocolates I don't
know what she's into but you can win her
back I'm rooting for you
Harlow I think you can do it go go do it
go send those flowers to the Googleplex
I guess yeah please so last one and for
all of you who have tuned in for like
t-mobile revel and all that stuff I
think we can definitely there's a whole
bunch that we can get to here but um how
do we tackle us all right so Brian Davis
is a Sprint employee he has been for
many years and he just wrote a huge
email it's not huge little email is a
manifesto actually I mean Wireless and
when you think about beats you know Yui
comes to all the marketing and all the
the hype around it and you know for
sound that objectively is not yeah you
know is like if you it's not good I
guess or it's not it's not proper but
our basis it's you know it's doing very
very well for itself yes it is I so like
this is way too long to actually go
through but I have a few questions that
we can turn on one by one that I bought
them down to you so John Legere or John
Ledyard
turned from man in suit to rebel program
lean back when he was first inaugurated
as CEO in 2012 that t-mobile was fairer
and cheaper than dumb and Dumberer with
no contracts and all that stuff so why I
feel much hype and why the anger why
that why the the fist in the air to all
these carriers was it just
a good idea to break that BS or or what
but I think you know a major part of
t-mobile's relationship during the John
John ledger ledger I keep saying Legere
I know that's wrong that means you know
like with his reign as CEO we've found a
company that has found a way to again
emotionally resonate with consumers to
try and develop a relationship beyond
just you know I give them money and I
get cell service again they made
t-mobile he made helped make t-mobile
into a lifestyle commentary you know so
I I don't do business with Verizon or
AT&amp;amp;T because I'm younger and hipper and
I care about you know fair business
practices and all these things and and
whether or not any of the stuff is
completely true it's it's just those
talking points that branding that
marketing the uncarrier has done very
well for this company and I don't think
you can do that without delivering some
incendiary or controversial headlines
right if you don't have people talking
about your brand you don't exist and so
I think that's been the big strategic
victory here is they stood as a thumb in
the eye to the 1880s and Verizon's of
the wireless market and it's worked that
they've become a very solid third place
competitor when John started as CEO I
think they were a distant fourth place
competitor behind Sprint and no company
has really managed to find that
messaging that really resonates Verizon
used to have it with network reliability
and stability but that's become less of
a concern for consumer potential
customers out there you know I think
contracts were the dirty word about five
years ago people really wanted to
especially when they started breaking
their and neat little phones their
iPhones that they've started to
appreciate and you know they just wanted
to get out of their contract and
especially when they had all those like
up to $650 a line if you move to us
right now do it and they got like 10
million subscribers or something like
that in just the first year that they
executed on that when t-mobile went to
no contract in 13 2013 did it have to go
with these equipment installment plans
like was it really the best route to do
that because nowadays were switching
over to leasing ants you know where
people had more flexibility even though
there's a little bit of a payments
jockeying at the end of things but you
know it allows them to move up but I
don't think we had to start somewhere
because 0% financing on all these uh all
these phones you know this six hundred
seven hundred eight hundred dollar
purchases or just it's you know you had
to start somewhere in order to build
credit like this wasn't just you know
subsidized and pay it and pay for whole
this is um actually making sure that
there was revenue that was coming in and
became tea to the creditors in rice yeah
so no I
cuz I completely agree you know this
look at how long it's taken to deprogram
the American customer out of the normal
two-year contract cycle we used to go
through so you know what an equipment
installment plan was easy to explain and
easy to to add to a bill in a way that
customers could understand what was
happening and how they were getting
their phone and what it was going to
cost them and it set the stage for now
these new leasing options these new
leasing plans and the update to the jump
you know you can switch your phone on
t-mobile every thirty days now it's all
smart packaging so do we really expect
consumers out there to be flipping their
phone every thirty days no in fact I
doubt many consumers will flip their
phone more often than they used to be
allowed to where you could only switch
your phone over three times a year I'd
be shocked if a majority of their
customers flip their phone more often
than that but doesn't it feel good to
know that you could it's kind of like
buying like an expanded insurance
package you know like you know we also
have like valet service and you know
Triple A and
you know fix-a-flat and fuel recovery if
you're stranded on the highway and like
how many people use those but it feels
good to pay for them knowing that the
errand that's kind of where I see
t-mobile currently right now is a lot of
the stuff people aren't gonna use like
international rates and all that all
that jazz probably not but people want
to know that they have it even if they
never use it
although fair's fair it's all you know
you have to you know if you want trading
it has to be in good condition I think
insurance used to be included but not
the case anymore in terms of it you have
to make sure that you know if you want
to protect your device you have to
purchase an extra nine to twelve dollars
a month so that's in itself and then
there's also the deductible so I think
it's still that's still kind of a thing
that we need to solve and someone's
gonna solve it may be it's gonna be
Sprint I mean they I don't know in terms
of t-mobile one when we had that little
change with Verizon unlimited and the
map with apples to apples the features
are the same for the same price and
t-mobile's I'm not sure how to moles
trying to UM image themselves because oh
it's is it better their value because
their same price or didn't like the
standard team over one for 70 or 75
dollars a month and you get throttled
video streaming and all that
look no hot spot so I mean is it I mean
it's providing the options and it's
getting but but I would also ask what
what did we have as a plan prior to
Verizon returning to an unlimited plan
it was all bucketed most that we had I
think was like so this this to me really
stands as one of those opportunities
that businesses can still compete in
this sector because for a while there
really felt like every carrier had
exactly the same plan with a couple
different little tweaks to it or
different fee structures or you end up
eventually arriving at pretty much the
same thing across the board and before
ver eyes
returns to unlimited t-mobile was pretty
aggressive about promoting this kind of
service so this is an opportunity for
another company to come in and compete
with a better product or a different
product or a more expensive or more or a
less expensive product and so when
viewed in its current state right now
for a lot of people that Verizon plan
might be a better deal but when viewed
in a larger context of how these plans
evolved and how we got to this point we
wouldn't be dealing with a Verizon
unlimited plan or an AT&amp;amp;T unlimited plan
that wasn't tied directly to DirecTV
subscribership if it hadn't been for
Sprint and an t-mobile offering
different rate packages different
buy-ins different perks you know ending
you know paying for contracts stuff like
that if the smaller players hadn't been
putting pressure on the bigger players
then we'd also be in like two gigabytes
of data is only a hundred and fifty
bucks a month you know like we'd be in
the same in the same boat there would be
no incentive for 18t and Verizon to
directly compete against each other
without some kind of disrupter coming in
yeah and all right so this one I'm gonna
have to tread carefully on as well
t-mobile is said to spread its towers
thin where other carriers go for density
and better bandwidth and speed and in
city centers he's accusing them of
cheaply pumping up pops4 towers in a
city it's just one tower and then they
spread that around so I mean if yeah you
know at more say than us in terms of
knowing about that but I don't know I
cannot speak from any kind of actual
market knowledge like I don't know what
t-mobile's tower distribution looks like
directly compared to the competition we
do know what we do now yeah that's what
I'm saying is getting to what we do know
we are still talking about the third
place formerly fourth place carrier in
the United States who didn't benefit as
much from other acquisitions as
t and Verizon did you know one of the
reasons why these companies have this
kind of penetration that they did was
the sort of mad dash to buy up smaller
competitors remember how many other
players used to be in this market and
and you know one of the reasons why I
think Sprint got hammered so hard after
buying Nextel was how different those
technologies were and how long it took
them to reconcile those towers so when
we look at t-mobile I look at a company
that benefited significantly from the
failed buyout from AT&amp;amp;T subsidizing huge
chunks of their business on 18 T's dime
and one of the things that I think
they've been a bit more future focused
on have been things like spectrum buying
a better building penetrating spectrum
and I know at fat produce Andrew Wallace
is probably flipping that I'm going to
mention 600 megahertz but you can have
fewer towers if you're putting your
money on the ability to spread that
signal further per tower does that fully
make up the difference between having a
better network of towers I don't think
so but again we're talking about a
service that's trying to bill itself as
being more cost effective and I think
that's an opportunity for consumers to
know that there could be some
compromises in some areas of the country
because of that whether or not a
consumer is gonna do that kind of
homework I find dubious but I think
that's the reality of the market you
know you do pay more for certain aspects
of wireless and carrier coverage than
you will for others and I don't think
that t-mobile is necessarily being anti
consumer duplicitous in how their
services are advertised once we get over
that initial like you know like Sprint
saying oh all carriers are within 1%
you're like yeah sort of not really but
that's all branding that's all marketing
you know so again if a consumer cares
about that kind of clarity they're gonna
look it up if a consumer doesn't care
about that clarity and it's disappointed
in the service they'll switch to another
carrier I mean that's kind of how this
markets gonna have to exist
the short-term yeah especially with you
know it's kind of it's always been kind
of hard to actually do ground tests of
every single thing it's just like word
of mouth oh this
I have t-mobile and it's working well
but you know you don't have even the
infrastructures to test in the cities
that we live in but I can say that like
t-mobile especially around the valley is
more than competitive with AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon offerings and I think the only
carrier that's still struggling out here
again we're still talking about their
retrofit for their towers of Sprint
where it could be one block to the next
where I've got screaming fast LTE and
then like nothing as I'm driving around
you know like wow this this cuts in and
out really frequently t-mobile has been
pretty consistent for where I live and
is usually decent enough in denser
populations and it like downtown LA like
it's fine it's not really an or worse
than 18t yeah yeah and well I guess you
know when it comes to like doing all
that homework I mean aren't we there to
help them out aren't we there to I mean
as best we can but again it's it's I I
would very you know I would take my
anecdotal experiences with all four
major carrier networks with a humongous
Boulder of salt because it's impossible
to have a good sort of shotgun spread of
locations around the megapolis which is
the Greater Los Angeles area
and just how different population
density shifts around freeways can have
a huge impact from day to day as to how
you're testing wireless carrier signal
reliability signal strength etc so you
know it's one of those things like I
think I would have to dedicate a couple
months to devising standardized tests to
come up with general trends that you
still wouldn't necessarily rely on to
make a customers purchasing
recommendation but it would just give
you a better a better overview of what
carrier signal was like over the course
of that month
and even then it would be an incomplete
discussion you know like if we were
Consumer Reports we could dedicate more
manpower for every city to try and
accomplish that in a more efficient
fashion but you know I would have to
give up on every single phone review
article editorial podcast for a solid
month to come up with a really thin
surface examination of the market as it
stands today or you could just you know
not recommend surface products and never
do that because your cert because he
found out that reliability is actually a
little bit worse than the average
laptop so that's what they did
totally surface damn it that's a good
punch darn it was a good pun no it's
true I mean did you saw the their thing
today about retracting their
recommendations right for retracting
what recommendations up or the surface
pro so no not the surface pro but they
said yeah it's oh yeah but up oh that's
that we're kind of ending on a downer
and we're kind of just watch so let's
listen from Andrew Wallace at fat
produce give me all the 600 megahertz
and he's got a great Captain Kirk
screaming Geoff that that's always
exciting from Peter hatin hatin I guess
the success of t-mobile is to ask how
many people talk about their carrier out
of interest again I mean if you make
your company a part of someone's
lifestyle they will be more loyal it
works for Apple it works for clothing it
works for bags and purses
why shouldn't go ahead but I think
t-mobile has done the best job of being
sort of an active participant in their
customers lives then the other carriers
have from from Renato not long ago we
were talking about telecom wanting to
get rid of t-mobile us now they want to
implement its management back home in
Germany I think that's a smart play
again this this market is fiercely
competitive so any kind
of emotional or consumer edge is going
to work to your fashion and then we did
get a number of comments from people
about the the Google manifesto and I'm
gonna try and take some of those off off
podcaster offline just a lot of people
have very strong feelings about things
like you know free speech and corporate
pressure on different types of speech
and I I really want to sort of respect
those viewpoints some of them
conflicting with my own but again it's
it's difficult and I want to you know
anyone who's trying to have that
conversation with me to understand and
have a little patience that if this
starts broadening out or tangents start
propping up or people start changing
topics or changing directions or talking
about other situations or other problems
then like I have to bow out of that
conversation because I don't think it
serves anyone when we get stuck in a
sort of ever descending circular
conversation of oh yeah well someone
else did something terrible
oh yeah we'll remember when this
happened and that was bad I think it's
more important to stay focused on the
actual circumstances of this one
situation and to try and hash out how we
feel about that rather than trying to
apply it as something indicative of
every single time we talk about
diversity or gender or racial issues as
it pertains to business and technology
so again I really want people to
understand like I'm trying to respect
how sensitive this topic is and it's not
that I'm gonna be ignoring people but
they're just I have limited bandwidth to
get into too much of an online debate in
140 characters or less per per talking
yes indeed 2:30 a.m. this Nightline ABC
News townhall regarding gender diversity
and race is running way too long I think
we have like the stereo 11:30 and then
they ran until like 2:30 he was like
crazy I you know again I wish we had
better better avenues for a long-form
discussion in in sort of appropriate
places because a lot of the stuff I
think is being dragged into arenas that
aren't really
the best fit for this kind of
conversation you know like Twitter is
the worst place to try and talk about
this type of topic you know trying to
follow the threat of a conversation or
trying to have someone expand on a point
of view or an opinion is is ruthlessly
terrible when you have that kind of
character restriction on trying to
accomplish your your idea or your
talking point all right make sure that
you have your tip telepathy buckets on
and we'll see you again real soon
absolutely you know until we have like
an empathy sensor in our in our social
media it's just gonna it's just gonna be
really dicey but there you have it folks
another episode of the pocket net weekly
