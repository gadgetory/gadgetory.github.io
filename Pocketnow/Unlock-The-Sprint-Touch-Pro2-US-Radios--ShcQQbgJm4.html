calm and today I'm going to show you how
to unlock the radio on your sprint HTC
touch pro2 so the annoying thing about
this particular device opposed to the
verizon touch pro 2 cm a variation is
that you are unable to use a US sim card
after the device has been somewhat
marked so as you can see right here in
the corner says that it's on sprint's
network and that's all you can pretty
much do in the United States for some
reason the radios are locked out so I'm
going to show you how to unlock the
radios and actually use an 80 or tmobile
sim card in this device so let's get
started okay so the first thing we'll
want to do is actually get our imei
number and write that down and make sure
that it's correct and you can either get
it from the back underneath the battery
on this particular device or you can
scroll all the way over to the last tab
on the touchflo 3d under settings and
then just click on menu phone network
mode you have to make sure that you do
this part is when the imei through the
device and then switch to gsm only
and now push the top button and then
dial star pound 06 come and your imei
number will appear at the top and you
can write that down okay so let's move
on to the next steps so the next step
would be a launcher internet browser and
type in rhodium which is Rho D I umw for
worldwide edition phone HTC hyphen
unlocks com and as you can see it's
right up here here's the web address and
that's the actual web address and this
program actually costs about Oh 15
whatever amount you want to spend
because it's actually donation where so
it's pretty neat so the lowest amount
you can spend is about ten British
pounds or euros so whichever you choose
you can also do that so here you want to
actually input your imei number and then
if you want a payoneer as you can do
that you can either buy with paypal or
pay with a credit card and what you
checked out it'll allow you to download
the program okay so once we've
downloaded actually install the program
it'll ask us it'll give us a little
disclaimer and it'll say I know or any
other entity taking responsibility for
watching damage or whatever most likely
it's not going to occur so just accept
and click yes and here is where you will
actually flash your hard SPL you'll need
to change the SPL and if you're a little
worried about that then you should
probably not install this particular
program and unlock the radio so the
first thing you want to do is make sure
that you're connected to your device
using your USB cable to active sync and
now we're going to run the hard SPL and
for this particular one you actually
want to take know if you have not
already installed this so click no and
then okay now it will actually install a
program on your device that will allow
the program on the computer to actually
turn off your device into the boot load
mode so we'll go okay after we've
installed that and it's going to ask us
if you want to flash move it okay and it
will bring us the wrong update utility
so
click OK and click on this little
checkbox after you've done all these
steps click Next and now she's going to
verify the information on your device
and it will show your current image and
what you want to update this to it only
takes a couple of seconds so I'll click
update and as you can see is going to
change the SPL so click next and next
and after it's all installed it doesn't
take very long to actually change the
SPL it'll actually reboot the device and
then turn it back on and now to the next
step ok so after we've changed our hard
SPL on our sprint touch pro2 as you can
see up here we still have no service on
our GSN so we'll want to actually unlock
the radio so I'm going to click right
here to unlock the radio and it's going
to communicate with my device it should
only take a couple of seconds to
actually change this and it seems ok so
that'll launch the update utility as
well so click next click on these check
marks after you've connected all you
connected your device and make sure you
are fifty percent battery next again and
now we can update
and on your device will actually go to
the bootloader or setting with these
four colored bars red green blue and
white we'll just wait for it to load
shouldn't take too long as you can see
it already says security unlocked at the
top so it shouldn't take too long to
load as you can see it's a it's gone
quite a ways in just a little bit time
and it will stop at like ninety-seven
percent at least on my computer it does
for a second and then it goes to one
hundred percent so it's going to take
this out of you okay so it's that one
hundred percent it will actually reboot
the device again so just wait for that
to occur and it says the update is
complete and okay click finish and we'll
move on to the next step so on a device
we still have no service with our GSM
SIM card inside so we're actually going
to unlock the rest of the device so
we're going to click on this last step
which is step three run unlocker it's
going to communicate with the device and
now it's going to run the unlock
sequence so this is actually going to
sim unlock your device and also CID
unlock your device which allows you to
unlock security as well so you can click
on security unlock all three of these if
you want to and then you can just get
commit changes and they'll go through a
couple of steps and that will soft reset
your device okay so after our device is
rebooted we can go into the settings and
under the gsm only we can look for
networks but it's still not going to
find networks because the radio though
is actually installed on this device is
still unable to find us gsm networks so
now i'm going to run another i'm
actually going to flash the radio and
i'll post a link i'm talking either
commas to how to get a link to this
different radio for the u.s. gsm bands
and i've already downloaded it so i'm
just going to click on the understanding
the costume above that okay click Next
kind of like the same thing as before
make sure you have all these steps done
click Next again and this is actually
going to flash the radio honor sprint
touch pro2 so that we actually get
worldwide coverage so it's actually
pretty cool click Next on here click
Next to getting then again it will all
little um activate the bootloader mode
and so again says security unlocked so
we're
to be able to change the radio on this
device so again it goes very quickly it
might stop at ninety-seven percent again
it does that online i'm just going to
cut the video out because no one wants
to sit here and watch that okay so it
has reached a hundred percent it will
state that your rom is noah is now
complete and the device will actually
restart again so in just a second
initially the settings to activate your
gsm sim card on your sprint touch pro2
so after the device is done rebooting we
can actually go back all the way over to
the settings go to menu phone network
mode and we're actually going to select
our network so if you click down here on
manual it'll actually look for a network
and right now we have 80 available so
I'm just going to click OK and now we
are actually registered on the network
as you can see we have our edge service
with full service unfortunately the US
UMTS 3g bands don't work on this
particular device because it probably
didn't pass the FCC regulations or
something like that so i will post a
link on pocket on the comments how to
get all of the information on how to do
this again the unlock program does cost
around fifteen dollars us ten dollars
euros and then but then again it is also
job nation where so if you have a sprint
touch pro2 and you want to use gsm this
is a great way to actually activate your
radios thanks watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
