market so far but Samsung isn't pulling
any punches with its latest tablet I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the Galaxy Note 8.0 review
all of Samsung's Galaxy devices from the
smallest low-end smartphone to the
full-size Galaxy Note in share a
strikingly similar design and they're
all built using the same quality hyper
glazed plastics with faux metal trim
they feature the same capacitive back
and menu buttons with a physical home
button in the middle the Galaxy Note 8.0
is no exception in the hand it feels
like a larger Galaxy Note 2 and it looks
like a blown-up Galaxy s4
it's just the right size to hold one
hand it in portrait with a firm grip
although it would be easier to hold if
it were just a tad narrower there are
only two true sore points with the
design there is no excuse for the camera
to be so accentuated seeing as it's not
a primary feature and the camera sensor
itself is only 5 megapixels there are
larger camera sensors crammed in smaller
devices that don't require a home for
the camera and the speakers along the
bottom edge are rather easy to cover up
unlike the Samsung made Nexus 10 with
front-facing speakers the specifications
on the Note 8.0 are solid it has the
same 1.6 a gigahertz quad core Exynos
chipset as a galaxy note 2 2 gigabytes
of RAM 16 or 32 gigabytes of built-in
storage with a micro SD card slot and a
46 hundred million power battery but
there's one specification that is
undeniably poor the display it measures
8 inches diagonally yet it only hosts a
WXGA pixel resolution 1280 by 800 pixels
for rating of 189 pixels per inch after
staring at 1080p smartphones around 5
inches or smaller slightly larger as
well everything on the note 8.0 looks
fuzzy individual pixels are visible and
there is noticeable pixelation around
the corners of icons and text that said
and despite the fact that this is a TFT
panel not AMOLED the color saturation is
high blacks are fairly inky they're
still a little more gray than a true
black and contrast is relatively high
unless you're a pixel junkie spoiled by
smartphones with 300 to 400 and 70
pixels per inch
the display on the Galaxy Note 8.0 will
suit your needs
lastly the S Pen is easily the standout
feature of the Note 8.0 it's what makes
it a note over say just a Galaxy Tab
it's tucked away in the lower right
corner and haptic and audio feedback are
provided when the S Pen is removed like
all previous notes the S Pen is
inductive extremely accurate and comes
with a horde of S Pen specific software
features but more on that in a bit
the Note 8.0 may not feature the best or
most notable design and build quality
but it does pack a punch with some
impressive specifications and the
utility of the S Pen software is where
the Galaxy Note 8.0 truly shines it
ships with Android version 4.1 to
beneath the TouchWiz interface if you've
ever used a TouchWiz device in the past
the software on the Galaxy Note 8.0 will
make you feel right at home the
interface while upgraded for the larger
display is almost identical to TouchWiz
on the note 2 or even the galaxy s4 from
the notification shade down to the
lockscreen mostly everything is the same
same icons wallpapers widgets and
animations the downside is content
fortunately more and more tablet
applications of finding their way to the
Play Store but there is still a shortage
of beautiful tablet applications a
content gap if you will and many like
Facebook or Spotify still use the phone
UI instead of the tablet optimized
layout the best part of the software
however is multitasking it comes with
multi window onboard which allows two
applications to run side by side em with
the s-pen you can open s note atop laney
application open quick command which
allows you to open quick shortcuts or
quickly search the internet or annotate
screen captures these make great use of
the larger display thanks to the monster
specifications the Note 8.0 pers along
just fine cutting through graphic
intensive games and even everyday
activities such as browsing the web or
taking notes without a hitch no sign of
lag or stuttering was present at our
time with the Note 8.0 and it performed
decently well even in synthetic
benchmarks inside the Galaxy Note 8.0
has a 46 hundred million power battery
keeping the show running in our time
with the device the battery performed
quite well easily lasting a full day of
moderate to heavy usage remember there's
no wireless data to consume power only
Wi-Fi the standby time is great that
said if you crank up the brightness and
get those four cores running at full
speed for say graphic intensive games
the battery will drop rather quickly the
speakers on a media tablet are vital the
speakers on the Note 8.0 are plenty loud
and only slightly tinny the problem is
their placement there towards the bottom
and entirely too easy to cover up by
accident I found myself accidentally
covering them up playing video games
even just listening to music or watching
videos so their placement is pretty poor
lastly the camera it's a tablet with a
five megapixel sensor so you can expect
superb quality pictures it's mainly
going to be used for snapping pictures
and a pinch maybe of documents or
showing people on a video call your
point of view but if need be the camera
performance on the note 8.0 isn't bad
the color reproduction is great
low-light performances mediocre and
details are pretty lacking but for a
tablet something that's not primarily
used for taking pictures it's nothing to
scoff at at the end of the day the
Galaxy Note 8.0 isn't necessarily the
best designed tablet and it doesn't
exactly feature the best build quality
we've seen in a tablet chances are it
won't be the cheapest either it hasn't
launched here in the States yet but the
Wi-Fi model in the UK is selling for 340
pounds or roughly 520 US dollars however
it packs quite a wallop
if you can look past the low res display
it features some of the best
specifications we've seen in a midsize
tablet or any tablet for that matter its
performance isn't off the charts but it
handles even the most graphic intensive
games without breaking a sweat we give
the Galaxy Note 8.0 a seven point four
out of ten that's all we've got for now
so if you liked the video be sure to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the
