Galaxy s6 devices and smart watches and
tablets from every manufacturer you can
think of I'm Michael Fisher I'm hi Mary
vera and I meant ND not you're watching
pocket now from mwc Barcelona 2015 Sony
said it will release a smartphone a
flagship one every six months some
people like the idea some did not we are
anticipating the z4 to make an
appearance here in Barcelona 2015 and we
are hoping it will be more than an
incremental update another company we're
waiting for as well as alcatel one touch
the company is trying to make a big move
in the United States and they're going
to need a flagship for that and
hopefully we will get that at this event
as well microsoft also has a press event
scheduled for monday at which it will
deliver something to help us achieve
more we don't know what that means we
know the company has been testing Lumias
in the foreign 5-inch screen size range
so nothing the flagship class probably
but maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised
switching gears to tablets for a second
we are expecting to see two interesting
products that we don't know very much
about but we're very excited to see them
the Nokia N 1 tablet running the Nokia z
launcher on top of Android very
customized software experience and the
new yola tablet in the exciting sailfish
two point oh very much look before
checking those in it probably the only
hot tablet is the most bogus of leaks we
have a sony application telling us that
we have a sony xperia z4 tablet to come
we're not sure if this is going to be a
compact or a big one but so he does make
some really good tablets we have an
invitation from sony go to their booth
let's see what we get in there of course
we've seen leaks heard rumors have not
one not two but several Samsung tablets
which might or might not make an
appearance here in Barcelona but we sure
expect something decide from the samsung
flagship now this could be the event for
wearables or at least that's what we
want to see wearables haven't really
taken off yet but LG wants to do
something really big with its watch
urbane we've seen the teasers and they
want to show us something extremely
elegant with the watch urbane so yeah we
will be seeing that next few days but
we're even waiting for Michaels webos
SmartWatch please LG please please
make it happen just so I can stop I know
about it I know it's not the only news
on the Android wear Department the watch
urbane the wall way has not waited for
the show to start to begin advertising
its own watch limits just called the
watch we saw a poster for it's running
Android wear its round doesn't have a
flat tire and that's about all we can
tell you about it right now except that
we want to see it so we were and talking
about beautiful watches we don't know
exactly what to expect but Martian has
announced their lineup or hopefully they
will announce their lineup with guests
and I'm guessing pun intended that they
will be some fashion oriented watches
which even I will be proud to wear mmm
so LG's gonna bring a lot of mid-range
phones to Barcelona el phones f phones
we had no idea there's gonna be three or
four so we're gonna take a look at those
as well another category that's really
taking off is camera phones like I mean
real camera phones and Lenovo Motorola's
parent company is apparently bringing
something major for this event that we
will be looking out for as well I'm
speaking of dedicated camera type phones
we are going to get a look at a phone
that escaped us at CES hopefully from a
sous the zenfone zoom the kind of Lumia
1020 look alike not really what sort of
with a massive camera component I'm just
blabbering because I'm really excited to
see it whatever you see everything I
can't take just whatever saving it's
going to be quick and finally the reason
you've stayed tuned in this long there
are two major smartphones launching this
event possibly up to four depending on
what flagship class rumors you believe
of course the bigger rumor center around
Samsung and its galaxy s6 a Cosmo galaxy
s6 edge if you believe that the rumors
are two separate devices what we know
what we believe is that this is going to
be the most beautiful samsung flagship
ever produced since I'm putting a lot of
emphasis this year on materials on
industrial design obviously Cameron
thinks the curved display the gimmickry
but chiefly what we're hearing is that
it is aesthetically the most beautiful
galaxy s yet and you know what I'm not
expecting and I'm not expected to see
TouchWiz I would be amazing rumors are
fifty-fifty on that we will have to say
but I have not expected to see the one
online and the one in line
will apparently make its way to
Barcelona as a follow-up to the water
made an improvement in every aspect it's
going to be better hardware better
software which sent seven better camera
faster processor more RAM everything HTC
does best Square you just remember this
is our favorite show this is the one we
have the most amount of work for a lot
of mobile a lot of geek stuff and we
would love to know exactly what you
would like for us to cover most any
comparison in particular anything that
you would like to see please leave us a
comment down below and share your needs
