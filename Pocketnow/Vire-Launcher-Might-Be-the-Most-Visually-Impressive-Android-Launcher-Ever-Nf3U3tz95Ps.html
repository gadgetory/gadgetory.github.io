transitions reflections and a physics
engine built in I'm Joe Levi for pocket
now and this may be the most visually
impressive launcher that we've ever seen
this is my Nexus 4 and on it I'm running
a new launcher called the viral on Chur
it's in beta and it's available in the
Google Play Store right now for free
now on the surface this looks just like
any other launcher you've got icons
you've got widgets
you've got your dock down at the bottom
and of course you've got your buttons
you also have your menu key down here
which is where you go into your settings
and to add stuff and all kinds of stuff
we'll get into that in just a minute the
first thing that I want to show you is
if you notice up here on this clock
widget you'll notice a reflection now
that reflection isn't coming from a
light or a window in my office know that
reflection is based on what's built into
this launcher and as I tip the device it
knows its orientation and it knows where
to place that reflection and it's just
cool that's actually rendered on device
next let's take a look at transitions
see the Hat looks like a big sheet of
glass that just flips around and then of
course the glass disappears when you're
looking at it face on but very nice very
fast chamfered edges I don't know if
that's guerrilla glass or not but let's
hope they got a license to do so very
cool that's only one of several
transitions that I'm going to show you
but what I want to show you first is how
these widgets look and how they function
this is just a regular widget I've got
regular icons on my screen but if I pull
down on my clock you'll notice I have a
new tray this tray can hold both widgets
from via launcher Android widgets
shortcuts icons the whole thing and this
is actually a two state dock so I can
continue to pull it down and get even
more stuff and you notice when I did
that I had kind of a flare around my
finger indicating a screen press very
very cool if I want to add something new
to this I simply tap and hold
I can add an application a widget via
applet is what they call them or via
shortcuts let's look at via shortcuts so
let's go ahead and put in a web browser
right here and let's tap and hold again
and add another shortcut to my app
drawer speaking of app drawers let's go
ahead and jump into that kind of a
window inside this we can change what
we're looking at from all applications
to my personal user apps recent apps I
haven't run many recent apps since I
launched this particular launcher and
then my most used applications and then
a Clear button so we can clear those if
we need to if we want to I'll say no for
the time being and then of course back
to all of our applications it's very
fast very fluid you can see my screen
taps they're lit up by a glow so really
cool what we want to look into it this
is very fast by the way they say it's
going to run fast even on very slow
devices so if you've got an older device
go out download this test it and let us
know in the comments how it behaves what
I really want to show you some of these
other 3d transitions to get to those
we're going to come down here to menu go
into settings and we've got all these
cool things reflections were enabled by
default I did turn on HD shaders which
is allowing me to use real-time
reflections and transition effects and
full screen transitions was on by
default we can change the launcher theme
it came at outline I changed it over
here to basic because I like the icons
the way they look a little bit better
but transitions that's what we want to
see so let's start out we're in Crystal
right now let's look at tiles go back
home take a look at this see that all
the tiles just kind of Block in and
block out then it's fast if you want to
show it off or want to see it you can
swipe across slowly just not too slowly
because you'll do what I just hit but
pull it across and wow it's just pretty
let's go ahead and look at some other
transition effects this one is called
cube free it kind of zooms out and puts
your home screens your panels in this
cube that then you rotate between very
cool transit
in effect I like the way they handle the
wallpaper just very smooth very neat
here we've got the basic transition and
that's just a basic side-to-side slider
it doesn't show you the outline of the
page as you're sliding side to side
which I kind of miss but it's still very
nice very smooth and even when you're in
mid transition you've still got that
really nice reflection just you've got
to see this to really understand and to
really appreciate it
there are a whole bunch of other
transition styles in here that we've
seen before going back to cube we have a
cube in and cube out that are
essentially what we've seen in other
launchers fade in fade out
scroll in scroll out flip just all kinds
of stuff
overall the one I like best however is
crystal that I showed you up front that
looks like you're just sitting on a nice
sheet of glass just very nice smooth
fluid go ahead and download it from the
Play Store let us know what you think in
the comments over PocketNow comm I think
you are going to be very very impressed
if you are and you like what you saw
give the video a thumbs up and while
you're at it why not share this video
with your friends on Facebook Twitter
and Google+ for pocket now throwing off
even more cool launchers like a viral I
sure I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
