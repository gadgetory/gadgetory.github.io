pocketnow.com and see the unboxing video
for the celia red fly see a 10 now the
Seelie already fly has been around for a
long time and we're going to take a
different approach to this video series
the Red fly is essentially a companion
for your windows mobile device so you're
plugging your device to the red fly or
you use bluetooth and you get a very
large screen you get a full keyboard and
a mouse trackpad whether you're running
on a Windows when will not in touch
screen device or touch screen device and
when the red flow has first came out a
lot of people were kind of excited but a
little bit sketchy because the price was
about four hundred dollars which seemed
kind of crazy having to buy this
terminal in addition to buying a a
mobile device and the idea was that you
would buy the red fly instead of a
laptop but then netbooks came around and
see Leo lowered the price of the red fly
they are now between 200 and 300 dollars
but now you can get a netbook for
between 200 and 400 dollars and so the
question is has become why would you buy
a red fly we can just get a netbook run
the full version of Windows you know XP
or Windows 7 or or Linux and have an
even better experience so in this three
part video series we're going to do
first unboxing then we're going to talk
about the red fly experience using a few
different devices and finally we're
gonna have a bit of a conversation about
the utility of getting a red fly versus
getting a netbook and whether there is
even a benefit to getting red fly and
not getting a netbook so that's the
approach we're going to take let's get
through the unboxing alright and there
are two models as I mentioned there's
the CA n and then the c7 the CA n is the
higher end version which has a larger
screen a larger battery and we're going
to talk about why it has a battery so
basically with the red Phi you get this
full keyboard you get a screen and you
can actually upscale the resolution of
your phone to 1024 x I believe 768 or
some variation of that which if you
think about it is kind of kind of cool
right so you have a windows mobile
device like an HTC snap and you can
suddenly expand the resolution to this q
vga device to something that's much much
greater so let's take a look at the back
and see what we've got here now this
shows you kind of how both versions
compare we have a see a 10 on the right
here and the c7 on the left the CA 10
has an 8 inch screen the 7 has a 7
obviously there is a 4500 milliamp hour
battery in the CA 10 and there's a 2000
milliamp hour battery in the c7 now what
that allows you to do is actually charge
your device while it's hooked up to the
red flies so the battery is being used
to power the red fly and it's being used
to recharge your device which is
actually pretty cool and here are the
resolutions that we can export to on the
seven we can go to 800 x 480 which is
pretty standard a lot of windows mobile
phones does that we're 800 x 600 then on
the premium model you can get all the
way up to 1024 x 768 which is kind of
wild as you'll see we're going to go
through that and then we have video
import on the CA 10 and the color is
black obviously so let's take a look at
the at the red fly so put the device to
the side for a sec and we have some
accessories here this looks like a media
cable which will allow you to connect
the red fly to an external video source
such as projector or monitor or TV or
something like that which is kind of
cool and wondering if it it scales out
in the full resolution the 1024 x 768 or
only to the maximum resolution of the
device will have to check for that let's
see what we get over here on the side
probably going to be a power adapter yep
just to charge the battery and that
looks like that's it's in the box some
other documentation and a quick start
guide which shows you how to use the
thing all right
alright so let's look at the red fly the
red fly is not surprisingly about the
size of a netbook it's got a rubbery
coating on the outside and let's take a
look inside it looks just like an that
except the keyboards actually a little
bit smaller so let's compare this to the
HP mini netbook which it actually goes
for about three hundred dollars now
pretty much the same price as the the
red fly running out of room here on the
table so basically we have a 10 inch
screen here and an 8 inch screen here in
terms of size the the red fly is
actually smaller than the nuttin the
netbook in terms of surface area but if
we look at depth the other about the
same in terms of heaviness the actually
feel very similar we have to check back
with exactly which device is a lighter
but the keyboard is definitely smaller
this is ooh Matt a little bit but the
keyboard is definitely smaller and the
trackpad is about the same size in terms
of surface area a little bit wider here
a little bit taller here with buttons on
the left and the right and that sort of
thing so next coming up we are going to
actually talk about using the red fly
with a mobile device and as I said in
the last video we're going to talk about
the utility of getting a red fly versus
paying about the same price for the
netbook we're also going to talk a
little bit about what the company is
doing to bring down the price of the of
the red flash so you don't have to make
this decision decision should I get a
red fly or should I get a netbook we'll
be back soon with more on the Celia red
fly that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
