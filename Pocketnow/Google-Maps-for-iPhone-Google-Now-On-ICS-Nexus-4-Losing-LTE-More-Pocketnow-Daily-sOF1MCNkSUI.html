teach you how to install Google now on
Ice Cream Sandwich and Google will
apparently kill LT on the Nexus 4 i'm
home it'll be better and according to
the Mayans there's nothing to worry
about this is out daily that's
right according to recent reports google
has now removed the developer archive of
the nexus 4 temporarily because
apparently they're removing the source
code that allows for hackers like us to
enable LTE on the nexus for now we sadly
can't confirm this until the source code
returns to the developer archive so
we'll keep you posted Microsoft's new
claim is that application submissions
have grown dramatically ever since the
launch of windows phone 8 pally the
growth is as much as forty percent but
if you think of it it makes sense when
Windows Phone 7 was killed obviously no
developers were building anything for
that platform and now when those phone 8
is out so developers are now back to
work with Windows Phone 8 let's hope
that these applications are hot because
it does break your heart when you're
playing asphalt 7 on Android and then
you're playing asphalt for I think it is
on Windows Phone we all know that Google
now is the crown jewel of Android 4.1 or
4.2 jelly bean but as some of those Ice
Cream Sandwich customers like to say we
don't get part of the fun so there is a
new way to get this to work on Ice Cream
Sandwich obviously thanks to XDA
developers and Joe Levi was nice enough
to compile a way for us to do it even
though you're gonna need a rooted phone
obviously it's not going to be easy the
procedures kind of complicated but it's
better than waiting for whenever your
oleum wants to bring your upgrade so
have a look at the link in the
description and tell us if you tried it
and if it worked for you this just then
but taken with a grain of salt at the
time of the recording of this video it
was rumored that Google Maps would reach
iOS tonight now obviously we're still
not sure if this is true or not we're
going to end up knowing by the time you
watch this video most probably if it was
real or fake but the biggest question of
them all is if we're getting turned by
turn navigation on this google map
service so stay tuned and let's see what
happens and finally for the interesting
news of the day time magazine has just
crowned their top 10 gadgets of the year
and the iphone 5 ended up being the top
number one gadget for them now this is
not just a smartphone list this is a
full gadget list for 2012 and it just
makes you wonder i mean the iphone 5 is
a great device don't get this wrong but
I think the galaxy s3 actually sells one
in the iphone 5 and brought a lot more
innovations than just the design of the
iphone 5 so that leads me to the
question of the day what is your
top number one gadget of the year do you
agree with time in my case if we would
have to think of gadgets gadgets alone
then hey I would call that the Retina
Display MacBook Pro but if we think
smartphones I could probably say the
galaxy s3 or no the HTC butterfly but
leave us a comment down below which is
your top pick and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on pocketnow.com
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary that
I'm thanks for watching and stay tuned
tomorrow as we check if the whole google
maps thing was real</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
