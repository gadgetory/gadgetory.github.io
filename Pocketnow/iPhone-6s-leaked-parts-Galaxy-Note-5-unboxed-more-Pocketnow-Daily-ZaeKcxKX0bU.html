success display assembly this i lead
show us what to expect for the ipad mini
4 and we get to see the galaxy note5 in
its retail packaging I'm hiya metal
iveta wearing red and white because it's
Monday be Monday depending on the region
your and you'll understand that this is
part out daily official news that I
begin with Google as the company has
just pushed version four point oh if
it's google hangouts application and
we're hoping that it's the application
that will rule them all because Google's
got a crazy amount of messaging apps but
yeah it's got stability improvements
it's actually faster more power
efficient but even more interesting is
the fact that it brings a whole new
Android where user interface and yeah
it's got material design a lot of stuff
the noise in the description you should
get your update soon but iOS will have
to wait as will the spotlight over Apple
as we get some cat images of what the
ipad mini 4 will be in its design and
yeah it looks identical to the ipad air
2 which is what was expected but even
more interesting even though this
product is smaller than the ipad air 2
it'll be just this thin meaning it'll go
from 7.5 millimeters to 6.1 millimeters
which is crazy given the fact that again
it's got a smaller chassis we wonder how
exactly apple plans to do with that
battery will keep you posted on that one
and speaking of apple let's talk about
the iphone success we get more leaks
from the assembly plant because the
device is going to be announced on
September nine then that's going to be
the common thing going forward this time
we get a full video of the display
assembly yes or such technology will
happen it seems yes it does seem that
the company's being more efficient with
connectors but the bottom line is even
though this product will be
significantly identical to its current
design seems that internals will not be
let's see what we get the one device
that will be announced in theory over
the next few days is the galaxy note5
and we get some retail packaging leaks
and for those of you that are wondering
exactly what the specification is for
this product will be all the packaging
pretty much reveals at all the octave or
64-bit processor wireless charging 32
gigs of storage non-expandable it seems
and the addition to other things that
you will see in the links of the
description galaxy note 5 is pretty much
happening
and yeah by the leaks and everything it
is going to be a gorgeous phone that
wont be expandable oh yeah and finally
for the very interesting rumors and
leaks of the day famous tipster Evan
glass has just come on record to say
that Microsoft will be announcing its
new Lumias on September so hear me out
here first of all microsoft says that
they will be doing something biggity
fucked it could happen at Aoife or it
could happen a week later in vegas at
ctia we're not exactly sure when but we
are talking about both devices to talk
man in the city man we're not sure if
this is the Lumia 940 or 950 or the 940
Excel line 50 Excel it's really hard to
predict but it does lead me to the
question of the day after so many
changes that Microsoft is done lately do
you even care about new Lumia
smartphones because in my case I love
their cameras but I really don't know
what to expect here it was a comment
