pixel Google enters a highly competitive
market and this launch isn't without
some controversy we're seeing
improvements over last year's phone but
is that enough against other terrific
smartphone options well here's our pixel
to review brought to you by deep brand
jumping right in on design Google kept
things simple changes are minor but we
ultimately arrive at a cleaner looking
phone in the first pixel this phone
loses the slight wedge shape and the
thinner glass visor on the rear arrives
as a nicer two-tone aesthetic it's funny
that manufacturers have two cell phones
by promoting premium materials and here
we've got an aluminum frame covered in a
really thick plastic key coating the
hand feel is excellent and it's really
easy to hold but why not just make the
phone out of plastic which would make it
possible to include wireless charging
taking a peek under the hood the
internals are in solid very good
territory for a 2017 flagship the
requisite high-end chipset from Qualcomm
64 gigabytes of storage 4 gigabytes of
RAM these are all good even if they
won't necessarily wow users Google is
making a similar argument as Apple might
that software plus Hardware optimization
is more important than brute force
hardware's facts that's what you're
paying for not the sexiest spec sheet
case in point this phone has a fairly
normal 16 by 9 1080p display our pixel 2
has a nicely juicy AMOLED with great
contrast and very good outdoor view
ability last year this display would
have been applauded but this year many
manufacturers have moved on to taller
screens
it makes the pixel to feel a little less
high-tech a little less on the pulse I
like the look of the phone overall but
we are pretty close to Xperia territory
looking at this forehead and chin it's
interesting how some phones are
criticized more aggressively than others
for similar features it's the software
side where the pixel 2 shines if
Google's claim is for better
optimization over the competition it's
the one area we feel most confident in
there
advertising Android Oreo with Google's
customizations makes for a delightful
experience it's clean its uncluttered
it's quick living wallpapers are fun to
show off in the bottom search doc makes
a lot of sense for a you I focused on
bottom mounted controls Google assistant
is ever more integrated into the
experience though I can't say I've used
the squeezy gesture since setting the
phone out I'm either already
deliberately searching for something or
I'm using a voice action there are other
pieces of hardware I'd rather have than
pressure sensors and you know how we
gushed over the iPhones augmented
reality capabilities well the pixel 2
can do the AR thing too except that it
kind of can't I couldn't get any a our
apps to work just yet Apple's a Ark it
has a lot more developer support than
Google's AR core at the moment on a more
positive note while it's something we
can't directly comment on in these early
days we are happy to see Google commit
to three years of OS upgrades for this
phone hopefully a situation where more
manufacturers will follow Google's lead
yea this phone is simply wonderful to
navigate it's extremely rare that the
user will encounter unresponsive lags or
stutters even while I was running the
camera hard in 100-degree Heat there
were only ever momentary twitches this
phone specializes in a brevity of
interaction and it won't leave you
waiting it's a great argument for why
it's worth spending more on a phone even
for users who just want to cover the
basics and it's a terrific performer on
graphics intense games we have a full
in-depth camera review on this channel
but to sum up our experiences the pixel
reigns as the best auto mode performer
in Android land producing the best HDR
photos we've ever seen great low-light
performance and adding Hardware image
stabilization to the mix only improves
on a great imaging platform folks who
want more granular control or manual
modes will be disappointed and forget
about stereo audio on your videos but
people who interact only with the
shutter button will be well served here
software is Google's Forte and that's
put to use in eight
rific portrait mode the first which uses
machine learning to cut out your subject
instead of dual lenses for depth
information it's not going to replace an
interchangeable lens camera just yet but
it's a very pleasant effect for
isolating your subject
ditto audio again the full specs and
benchmarks are in our reel audio review
but we're happy with the overall
performance our pixel 2 was free of the
speaker gremlins some folks have been
discussing online and it's always nice
returning to a phone with front-facing
stereo speakers the headphone game is a
bit more nuanced performance from the
dongle is nicely improved over the
built-in jack on the first pixel but
dongles are still a pain happily this
dongle represents real progress for
Android and USB audio it's a real USB
audio device that works on every
computer I've tried it on including
laptops other Android phones even my
last Lumia now if a headphone
manufacturer wants to build some USBC
headphones universally compatible with
all gadgets there's a blueprint they can
follow the battery chat is mostly
positive to the snapdragon 835 paired
with Oreo improvements is nicely power
efficient but the smaller battery
capacity is kind of a bummer running our
media tests the pixel to performed
alongside the best battery bench markers
of the year again this phone excels it
short interactions and in quick bursts
use it'll easily last the day I just
didn't have much room after dinner and
it's not going to be a screen on
champion as a special shout out the
low-power state that Oreo uses is
phenomenal on Wi-Fi when you're letting
the phone sit this thing is barely
sipping any juice fast charging is
supported and combined with the smaller
battery topping off during the day
doesn't require a lot of time so let's
wrap this up where's that leave us with
Google's pixel - I personally wish this
foam felt just a little more futuristic
I wish this Hardware was a little more
progressive I'm having a difficult time
shaking the feeling that this is a more
expensive Nexus than a new fresh phone
line
but bleeding-edge hardware really isn't
the point judged on its own merits and
graded against Google's claims the pixel
- well accomplishes what it sets out to
do this is a software platform and
Google is pretty good at software while
the front of the phone has this colorful
screen are you wishing the pixel to came
in more color options maybe you want a
different feel for the backplate the D
brand has a wide collection of custom
fit skins in a gamut of colors and
textures to land exactly the look you
want while protecting this paint against
scratches head on over to D brand comm
