leaked and proves that Apple does things
differently we get the codename
information for up to three different
Huawei made 10 devices and Xiaomi
announces the successor to the mimics
I'm high metal II that are sending out
our prayers to everybody being affected
by hurricane air MA this is pocket out
daily the official news today began
number one with a monster cold that I'm
battling in number two the Galaxy Note 8
apparently breaking records again the
company has pretty much come clear with
the fact that the vise sold in two weeks
with the Galaxy Note seven sold in three
weeks of pre-orders 400,000 units sold
only on the first day in Korea and in
the United States apparently we have
similar numbers we will provide them as
soon as we get the details on the United
States now let's talk about the Xiaomi
me mix 2 that just got announced in
addition to the special edition which is
just more ceramic and more curves and
everything else we've got the same
beautiful design of the Vice actually
gets a little smaller but then the
bezels also get reduced by 12% we also
get the same specification I'm tracking
835 six gigabytes of RAM in addition to
an option for a gigabytes 64 gigs of
storage and and everything else well you
are losing the headphone jack but the
device is gorgeous
how about if we discuss the huawei mate
10 as we hear that there are up to three
different devices making the cut Marcel
is the codename for the typical Huawei
mate 10 that apparently there is
codename blank for the mate 10 Pro and
then there is a code named Alps which we
haven't figured out what it belongs to
Evan blast hasn't provided details but
we're assuming it could be for some sort
of a Porsche design once again and that
could be the case that would be great we
should learn more over the next few
weeks and for those of you wondering
exactly what is delaying the iPhone X
edition or whatever it's going to be
called according to trusted sources in
the supply chain one of the things
that's delaying Apple the most are the
stainless steel frames that are gonna
make up this device this is rather
interesting as the iPhone 4 and iPhone
4s were made with stainless steel frames
so makes you wonder exactly what is the
laying Apple here if the company already
has experience apparently there is a new
process and everything and it makes
sense it's a whole
design let's just see exactly how long
the delay will be because apparently
we're gonna have to wait for that phone
until November and finally the very hot
news that they have to do again with the
iPhone 8 iPhone edition whatever it's
going to be called we've got some very
interesting leaks over face ID no longer
pearl ID we get leaks on iOS 11 gold
master that shows the whole user
interface or how you unlock your phone
apparently when you authenticate for the
first time you actually have to rotate
your face looking in different
directions at clockwise at the beginning
and then apparently that's how it's
going to record your face and then after
that it's just going to require you to
look at the phone and it's going to
unlock apparently that's the way Apple
is going to make this 3d recognition
work looks rather interesting but it
leads me to the question today do you
trust facial recognition being made by
Apple do you think that the company
finally figured out in my case it
wouldn't be the first time that Apple
figures something out differently but it
wouldn't be the first time that Apple
also fails at something so leave us a
