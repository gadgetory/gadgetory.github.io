smartphone compete with the likes of
what many have considered the best
smartphone of 2014 so far I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
Oppo find 7 a versus the HTC One m8 the
core philosophies behind both the One m8
from HTC and Oppo find 7 a actually
aren't all that different if you don't
consider the fact that the 7-8 isn't
actually a Bose absolute less smart
phone the fine 7 is but in actuality the
find 7a is more in line with the One m8
anyway so this comparison actually makes
a lot of sense
both HTC and Oppo have set out to make
absolutely stellar smartphones from a
design perspective fully fledged feature
set specifications and in overall
performance we'd say they both did
really well even if the outcomes were
totally different let's take a moment to
recognize that in the form of an
in-depth comparison from the outside
these two smartphones really couldn't
look less alike the One m8 is a
precision machined work of art the
brushed aluminium makes it look more
like a kitchen appliance than a
run-of-the-mill smartphone but it really
works well for the phone it's rounded
smooth and just glides into the palm of
your hand we figured the rounded back is
about all the One m8 has in common with
a fine 7/8 at least visually even if the
curve of the 7/8 is more subtle its
edges are more harsh it's much more boxy
and stark and we really like that too
but the fine 7a is made mostly of
plastic whereas the One m8 is 90%
aluminum the find 7a has capacitive
navigation buttons while the One m8 has
on-screen buttons and the fine 7a has a
removable backplate and battery One m8
does not those are just a few of the
design differences but certainly some of
the most notable physical slides is also
different though less than you might
think
considering this fine 7 a's display is
half an inch larger diagonally the One
m8 is just six point two millimeters
shorter than the fine 7 a four point
four millimeters narrower and zero point
two millimeters thinner and the
difference in weight is just 10 grams
both have a certain heft that we're
quite fond of both feel incredibly well
built and one is not significantly
easier to use one-handed than the other
and the deeper you go as far as hardware
the more like these two phones become
both
the Snapdragon 801 SOC with a quad-core
Krait 400 CPU clocked at 2.3 gigahertz
and an Adreno 330 GPU both have 2
gigabytes of RAM but with coming 16
gigabyte models with microSD card
support for up to 128 additional
gigabytes though the m8 also comes in a
32 gigabyte model and both come with
five megapixel front facing cameras the
difference in ratings on batteries is
just 200 milliamp hours but the biggest
differences are the cameras when a mate
has a 4.1 megapixel camera Geoff's
opposed to a 2 megapixel sensor for just
measuring relative depth and the fine 7a
has a 13 megapixel shooter capable of
taking 50 megapixel images also the m8
has Wi-Fi AC support as well as an
infrared blaster well defined 7/8 does
not the displays aren't entirely
different though despite the differences
in size and type the fine 7a comes with
a 5.5 inch IPS LCD with a resolution of
1080p the One m8 has a 5-inch s LCD 3
display also at 1080p so the one image
display is obviously a higher density
panel 441 pixels per inch to 401 which
isn't exactly discernible both panels
are incredibly vibrant with wide viewing
angles and great contrast however the
blacks are noticeably more inky on the
one inmate's display and it certainly
appears brighter by the way both foams
are incredibly solid the One m8
admittedly feels nicer in the hand but
the fine 7/8 has some perks of its own
like the incredibly awesome notification
LED that speaks straight to our inner
nerd and the casing which may ultimately
prove to be more resilient over time in
terms of software these two are quite
different the One m8 comes with a much
needed lighter version of since version
6.0 atop Android 4.4.2 KitKat
comparatively it comes with little bloat
either from the respective carriers or
partners or even HTC and the phone
itself comes with a very near stock
Android field even if there are minor
tweaks to the UI here and there HTC is
stopped focusing on creating visually
different software for the sake of being
different and started focusing on what
truly matters user experience things
like blink feed moves out and Zoe and
value to the software without making it
overbearing or over encumbered we wish
we had such nice things to say about the
software on the Oppo find 7 a which
comes running and
4.3 jelly bean beneath what Apple calls
color OS if you ever used my UI you'll
likely feel right at home
as there are a ton of visual
similarities frankly it feels as if no
Avenue was left untouched every virtual
inch of the software has been customized
and can be even further customized by
the user from the gesture panel access
by pulling down from the top of the
display to the powerful theme engine it
comes with a bevy of pre installed
applications for better or worse and
adverts heavily from the core Android
experience some things we do like
however like how the notification shade
layout handles landscape orientation if
there's so much going on that gestures
and other inputs often conflict damaging
the user experience one win for both
phones though are all the gesture
controls DoubleTap on the One m8 display
and portrait orientation to turn the
display on double tap the home button on
the find 7/8 in any orientation to turn
on its display draw a circle on the fine
7-days display and standby to launch
yourself into the camera app or pick the
m8 up in landscape and hold the volume
button to do the same these are the sort
of hidden features we'd love to discover
and both of these phones come packed to
the brim with them that said the One m8
takes to software battle in a landslide
victory due to the overall better or
simple user experience running the
current version of Android and not
bloating the phone with dozens of
applications users may never use or need
performance is actually a strong suit
for both of these smartphones which
should come as no surprise thanks to the
Snapdragon 801 chips inside both come
with the same 2.3 gigahertz clock speeds
and any differences in the speed at
which they open and close and switch
apps are negligible one might be faster
one time and the other might be the next
its back and forth and both are more
than capable of running all the best
games on Android without a hitch both
have the tendency to heat up quickly
though we'd say the one a mate's heat
dispersion is definitely more noticeable
thanks to the all-metal build and we've
actually noticed some lag on the find 7a
whereas the one inmate has offered an
overall smoother experience we'd like to
talk battery life and network
performance but we've been having issues
with our fine 7/8 unit both with AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile Sims here in the States
we're currently working to resolve the
issue but we decided to compare these
phones anyway by the numbers however the
find 7a has roughly an eleven point
seven six one hour battery to the One m8
9.2 watt our battery
we can't speak to its drain since we
don't really know what's going on with
the network but the fine 7a comes with
rapid charge technology and a power
brick that delivers 4.5 amps
simply put this phone charges fast very
fast both phones come with very loud
speakers the fine 7-days dual rear
speakers are actually surprised us but
they're hardly a match for the one image
dual front-facing boomsound speakers
which offer better low-end better stereo
separation and provide more volume and
finally the cameras at 13 megapixels the
rear camera on the find 7a is clearly
capable of taking pictures with more
detail but we felt the colors and images
taken with the One m8 were more true to
life however you can only crop so much
with the one image camera at 4
megapixels and we've covered before how
the duo chemistry focus feature only
works as intended a fraction of the time
yesterday we covered the standoff
feature of the fine 7/8 camera taking 50
megapixel images with a 13 megapixel
camera it sounds crazy but it actually
works better than you'd think
still neither camera is particularly
mind-blowing they're both pretty awful
at low-light shots the 578 is prone to
blurry pictures and the One m8 just
doesn't have the resolution to support
the 4k age we're transitioning into both
do however have 5 megapixel front-facing
cameras for high-res selfies they don't
exactly take amazing pictures but
they're notably better than their 2
megapixel counterparts so where does all
this leave us well with two very
high-end smartphones from two companies
striving to make the very best
smartphones possible and if you're after
quality you likely won't go wrong with
either option though we feel the One m8
is definitely geared more towards the
multimedia user you can't beat those
boom sound speakers and it's build
quality and design are definitely more
noteworthy still the find 7a s camera
software the gorgeous LED notification
light rapid charging and the raw power
of the Snapdragon 801 still make it a
viable option the better overall
experience comes from the One m8 no
question as the software on the fine 7a
is questionable but truthfully both
handsets are absolutely killer
