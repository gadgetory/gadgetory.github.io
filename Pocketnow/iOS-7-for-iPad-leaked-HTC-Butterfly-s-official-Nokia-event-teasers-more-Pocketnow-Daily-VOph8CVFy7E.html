HDC makes the butterfly s now official
for Asia and Nokia hasn't stopped
teasing 41 megapixels for their July
eleventh event I'm hi Mary meta
wondering when OEMs are going to start
using lizard names for their products
this is pocket out daily let starts day
off as always with product releases HTC
has just made their butterfly as
official for the Asian market they've
been teasing about this phone for a
while and the reason why it's important
is because if you've forgotten the fact
that the droid DNA is based on the
original butterfly this is a much better
butterfly wonder where they got that
name but it's got dual speakers better
specifications led to the description
for details we do not know what verizon
is going to be carrying this phone in
the future or if it'll come to the
united states aside from the HTC One but
stay tuned the specs are kind of cool
even in spannabis storage now let's move
the spotlight over a Nokia the company
has been hard at work teasing us about
what to expect for their July eleventh
event and it's been so loud that I'm
starting to get tired yes no can we get
it we're getting a 41 megapixel camera
on that phone and yes we also get a
digital zoom is now going to be so much
better we're going to be covering the
event live both at the events and also
at a full live round table hang out with
everything that's going on so stay tuned
for the coverage let's hope they don't
disappoint now let's continue talking
about Apple since most of the news today
had to do with the company apparently
we've got some leaked videos of what to
expect for iOS 7 on the iPad you know
it's kind of weird that Apple did not
launch iOS 7 on the iPad being shown at
WWDC but now we get it you know first
hand on video and it seems like a
blown-up version of iOS 7 for the iPad
just like every other version was for
the previous generation iPad so stay
tuned on what we get we don't see any
particular differences that we should
report about as being hot but it's
coming now let's talk about the iphone
5s you know case makers don't always get
it right but most of the time they do
and they're now leaking the signs of the
iphone 5s and an expensive version of
the iphone that we've talked about made
of poly
carpeted and everything and well the
iphone 5s doesn't seem to change all
you're getting is different bands at the
top that you didn't get right now you
know for better reception probably and
then the inexpensive iPhone actually
looks very different it looks you know a
little thicker than the current
generation iphone but it could be
something to talk about in the future
it's kind of interesting if the home
button is also different but anyways
let's see what we get and finally for
the interesting news of the day we've
got a leak video now showing a hidden
menu in iOS 7 that's being used by the
company to test out different things
that they can do with the operating
system obviously for testing purposes
it's very interesting because it allows
you to do more advanced things that you
can do with ios7 that you currently can
do with pretty much what we get on beta
1 a simple example which is not really
what i would call advances the fact that
you can create folders within folders
aside from other aspects and we're sure
that this already exists for iOS 6 iOS 5
but it's the first time that it's really
been leaked that it makes you wonder why
Apple does it offer this sort of menu
for power users since we kind of get
bored but anyways that leads me to the
question that they I mean think about it
if Apple or any other you know company
gave you the option like for example you
can root Android install super user or
jailbreak your iphone and do other
aspects with your phone that are not
intended by the company I mean wouldn't
because the company itself gave you the
option to do these extra features
obviously you know what you're
compromising probably battery life
probably other things but it's something
that you choose because it's actually
your phone you're paying for it in my
particular case I would love it i don't
believe that one size fits all and
before the that's what she said yo jokes
i mean it's true one size doesn't fit
all there are other things that power
users want to do that simple users don't
want to do so leaves a comment down
below well you prefer of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and top of old miss you
