recently we've been talking a lot about
the Motorola Droid Razr one of the
thinnest smartphones around today let's
talk a little bit about some accessories
particularly the multimedia dock for the
razor let's go take a look
all right so here we have the Motorola
Droid Razr HD dock this dock is used for
connecting up to well charging for one
thing but also for connecting up to
monitors let's go ahead and unbox it and
see what comes in the package all right
let's get the manuals out of the way
we've got the HD station for Motorola
smartphones apparently they're calling
it something different on the manual
we've got the dock itself which we'll
come back to and then we've got a a
power adapter which is just a standard
micro USB open that up we've got some
more disclaimers FCC notices regular
wall wart with two prongs for the US and
then a micro USB adapter so nothing
terribly noteworthy about that but let's
get over to the dock which is kind of
interesting go ahead and open this up
set it down and we're gonna take off
some of these scratch proof films okay
so before we get right into it let's
just done take a walk around the the
actual dock itself so relatively large
you can see here you've got a relatively
big back on the back of the device
you've got a speaker out jack you also
have your USB micro USB in and then
you've got your HDMI out port so you can
take that and either plug that directly
into a HDMI enabled monitor or even TV
or you can do an HDMI converter to go
over to VGA DVI or even composite video
if you want to do that with the right
adapters so very interesting got more of
that protective film over here we'll get
rid of that for you even more over here
we'll get rid of that for you okay so on
the bottom we've got some anti slip pads
gets it up off the surface
give it some traction and
in the front we've got the the motorola
dock itself Motorola logo on a raised
platform right there a little support
for the phone now you'll notice there's
no plugs down here on the side no gold
box like we've seen on some Nexus
devices in the past that's because
you've got this over here on the side so
on the left side of the device which is
the top of the device you've got your
micro USB connector you also have your
HDMI connector so let's see how this
works
sitting it down you can see it grabs the
surface pretty securely let's grab the
phone there's the phone itself set it
down in the dock and as long as you've
got that phone set flat then you can
simply line it all up and should be able
to just plug it in it looks like it
doesn't go in all the way to the edge
just slides in a little bit to make
contact so there's a little bit of the
the connectors still showing don't try
and force it but once you've done that
now you can get not only charging
through your device but you can also
video out and you can do audio out as
well if you want to use it just as an
audio dock so overall very cool I'm
going to be taking this to work with me
and use this as my charging station for
the next few days not a lot of bells and
whistles but I do like the new universal
design of having the connectors at the
top of the device one other item of note
it did not have to plug into the
headphone jack that is because you get
audio through the HDMI port so very neat
showing off some cool accessories
something we like to do if you like
seeing this make sure you give the video
a thumbs up all right so the Motorola
Droid what is it called the HD doc is
really one of the nicest accessories for
the razor the other one would be the car
dock which we didn't have the
opportunity to review but the desktop
dock has some neat features not only
does it let you do charging it lets you
do video out and also lets you turn your
phone into kind of a quasi desktop
computer the only thing missing is a
cave
which is kind of unfortunate because
those cables are kind of expensive that
having been said it gives you what you
need to to get up and going and of
course you can pick up a cable that
works with your TV which is probably why
they didn't include it in the first
place overall pretty cool if you like
seeing this kind of video make sure you
give it a big thumbs up make sure you
tell your friends about it too and head
on over to the website pocketnow.com so
you can get even more details and other
cool information about not only the
Droid Razr but other smartphones as well
for pocket now I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
