Nexus phones later this month and if
there's anything Huawei has proven its
good at its hardware I'm high on so
Houston of the pocket now and after
spending a week with the mate s here's
what you can expect for the best of
hallway we actually got the maid s about
two weeks ago but with the flood of new
devices to cover this month we've only
just recently had the chance to spend
any quality time with it we briefly
touched on the phone's hardware at Aoife
2015 and it's still gorgeous and
terrifically well-made the chamfered
edges lining the aluminum chassis convey
a premium look and feel and ran out the
sides to make it feel super comfortable
to hold the 5.5 inch AMOLED display
isn't the sharpest thing we saw at Aoife
but at 1080p it's still more than good
enough for most people there's a 13
megapixel camera and LED flash around
back and sitting underneath is what's
possibly the best fingerprint scanner
I've ever used it's unbelievably fast
even more so than on the galaxy s6 or
the iPhone 6 and like the dimple of a
moto X it's perfectly positioned right
where your index finger naturally
gravitates the main s is running android
5.1.1 lollipop with always in motion you
eyes sitting over top it's largely
unchanged from what we've seen before on
the ascend mate 7 or the p8 but while I
did make a few improvements to clean up
the experience a bit though it was never
one of our favorite features knuckle
sense now just called knuckle 2.0 now
allows you to draw a letter on the
screen to quickly launch apps and you
can still take screenshots with a double
knock the top end model of the made s
even allows for pressure sensitivity
through force touch and you can way
things cool the twenty seven hundred
million power battery sealed inside
doesn't sound overly impressive on paper
but so far it's actually holding up
pretty well screen on time and overall
longevity is still pending but standby
time is terrific and after sitting idle
on a table for four days straight
it only dropped by about five percent
when connected to Wi-Fi it's certainly
been enough to last me through the whole
day without much trouble but the lack of
quick or wireless charging is definitely
a bummer the same feeling of good enough
is Evoque ting the camera which seems to
do pretty well in broad daylight
but this isn't anything to write home
about of course we'll have plenty of
samples in the full review so you can
decide for yourself we're gonna have a
lot more detail on the main s in our
full review coming soon and if you don't
