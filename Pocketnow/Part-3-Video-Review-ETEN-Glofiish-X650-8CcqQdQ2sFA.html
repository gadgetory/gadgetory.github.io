is part three of our video review of the
eaten Blowfish x650 continuing on
software and the different things that
are included in the device for example
if we go to buttons we don't have
anything different they're one of the
different things you'll get is for
example this is a VGA screen you'll
notice that the input panel the keyboard
is different but then you'll notice we
get transcriber for hatton rin
recognition and one of the weird things
we get here is this easy keyboard which
is not acuity is not philly is i have no
idea what it is it's different I have
not tested it I have I can't say it's
good or not it's just different just
weird it's big too it does take up a lot
of of the screen but it could be good
let's see what they pull up because the
the options that it includes don't give
you don't let you do much with it which
is said then in well many years remain
the same sounds a notifications you'll
notice there is this headset detector
what it does is that when you pull in
your headset into the 2.5 millimeter
audio jack it'll detect it and i'll give
me the choice of using the headset or
the PC speaker when you do put it and
beware because you have to hear a little
squeaky sound to make sure the headset
is activated and this command begins
which is something that won't begin in
the immediate portion of when you
connected enough the rest is pretty much
standard backlight level certificates
Clark and alarm let's see microphone we
have typically to DP the power manager
you'll notice it's a bit different than
what you'll use to it has a little art
in the back but then it's pretty much it
you choose here if you want the battery
icon or not and if you want Keilar corn
r which is a weird you get it
differently another devices pretty much
after this it's only system information
nothing else out of the ordinary pretty
much standard stuff one of the things
you'll notice and this is probably one
different thing you'll probably see
that is different in vga devices that is
not included in qvga is the fact that
you have this option here which is view
and then use high resolution for the
Internet Explorer so it'll actually
bring you smaller text but since the vga
quality is so good you practically can
read the text even if it's the small and
take advantage of this option if you
want to see a better resolution for
larger larger web pages which is really
nice one of the things I probably
haven't liked about this device as of
yet is that the task manager won't close
the applications as I'm opening and I
have to open the task manager and then
close the applications from here but
these are pretty much livable things
another thing that probably some users
are wanting to know is what version of
Windows Live is included since I know
many old users complain about the fact
that when those life Saints the contacts
and then these are duplicated in your
context but i'll be happy to notify this
is version this is a newer version so
you don't have this prong here it won't
sync the contacts and keep them you can
choose to not have them and still use
your messenger without any trouble this
is pretty much it for part 3 over video
review it's pretty much what was left in
applications then the rest is pretty
much standard nothing I really have to
mention this except for the fact that
I'm really enjoying this a VGA screen
it's really crisp really nice for
rendering different things in the device
it'll actually allow you to view things
in a much better perspective or
practically view things smaller and then
still keep attention to detail which is
a one of the good things about this
device and you notice it's snappy right
now because I actually started some of
the application speak before the video
but the device is a bit slow it's
another con I've noticed the 500
megahertz processor is not really doing
pretty much the best job I'd like with
the device but then again it's it's the
livable it's still acceptable
or the work needed pretty much it for
part 3 hope you enjoyed it and we'll
continue on in part 4 and different
specs of the device and performance
thank you very much for parking now calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
