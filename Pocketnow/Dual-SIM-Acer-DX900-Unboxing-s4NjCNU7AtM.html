pocketnow.com and today we're unboxing a
very rare breed of cell phones this
device the DX 900 from acer has two sim
card slots so what that means is that
you can actually have two phone lines on
your phone maybe one for a personal one
for business or two for business or
something like that we're really curious
to see how this was implemented how it
was implemented in the software so is it
easy to use one phone line over the
other can you conference between the two
how does the sim context work there's a
lot of unanswered questions that we're
going to answer in this review and this
phone obviously runs windows mobile so
let's take a look at the device we've
got some more bubble wrap here and by
the way this device comes from clove
technology at clove co uk so if this
device seems interesting to you you can
pick one up there dual sim design a very
similar look to the the glofish v 900 if
you remember we review that several
months ago say candy bar device with no
keyboard has hsdpa at 2.8 inch vga
screen gps Wi-Fi and we got some specs
on the back let's take a look inside the
box
alright so we'll take a look at the
device in a second and in the box we
have probably some accessories a lot of
stuff actually well so we have an extra
stylus which is collapsible
unfortunately we've got some software
warranty user manual screen protector
then we've got some headphones pretty
standard stuff here a USB cable it uses
mini USB so that's good it's not
proprietary we have a case let's see if
the case passes the leather smell test
definitely not leather vinyl or some
cheap imitation leather but it's not
common to find a leather case and then
here we have the wall charger with the
plug so let's get all this out of the
way and take a look at the device you
get this out here it says push up so the
device is pretty small in hand it's got
a small screen relative to newer devices
that are coming out like the touch
diamond2 or the even the touch HD it
feels just like an eat-in glofish device
I mean if you remember acer bought eaten
and they're glofish line now they're
just all called acer devices let's see
what what's behind the battery well
wouldn't you wouldn't you know it there
are two slots for the sim card here one
here and one here so quite simply you
put in your two sim cards and of course
we're gonna have to talk about what
happens in terms of software once you do
have two phone lines on your device so
let's get the back back on and take a
look at it in comparison to other
devices we have the fresh new diamond
too and of course this has a bigger
screen and it really shows in this in
this view and the DX 900 is
significantly bigger and then we have
the big ol touch HD which of course as a
massive screen so a lot more to come on
the acer d x 900 we're really going to
take a look at how this works with
two different phone lines follow us on
twitter for more on windows mobile
twitter.com slash pocket now tweets will
be back soon with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
