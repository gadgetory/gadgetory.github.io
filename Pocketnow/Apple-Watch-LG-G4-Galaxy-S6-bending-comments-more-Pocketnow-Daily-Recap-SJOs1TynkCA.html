frog and the answer is no hey Jaime I
dare you to say jumping Jacob jumped
over a gigantic gorge on the weekly
roundup and I want what do I get okay
you've got my attention now what that's
right it's that time of the week I am
high netting that after this is pocket
now and this is the parking out daily
recap for last week someone they ask you
what do you think about external been
tests as Samson was being the victim of
another been testa but it was from this
insurance company that was clearly in
the business of making money selling you
insurance so again not really something
we call legal we have 619 comments out
of which one of them says I wish every
controversy that comes out would stop
ending with gate and dude I have to
agree with you I don't think people even
remember what Watergate is or no the
soccer lover 1598 says seriously people
are still trying to make Ben gate
references this s as old as f and no one
cares anymore I've got a note for and
I'm not a whining apple fanboy but
seriously it's annoying and I have to
agree with you I don't trust these up
again Ben test because yeah you can bend
anything you want with enough force so
is that really the typical usage
scenario you're gonna spend your day
bending your phone a shiny falling star
says your phone isn't made to be a
weapon any phone would bend with enough
force except the original nokia and yes
bring back the old nokia but agree with
that as well that on tuesday asks you've
given the option for different leather
or other options for backs of the LG g4
which one would you want as LG had to
send out press invites and we have a
leather back in the invitation we have
one and 25 comments out of which david
thomas says i'd like to see human flesh
option for the back of the phone next
when the ashvin says personally anything
but leather and glossy plastic would be
fine I'd really like to see soft touch
backs like on a nexus 5 and yeah I do
like polycarbonate as well it is a good
option and it's great to have options
and not just have one you can have a
couple of bits of replaceable back
that's even cooler and alex says I would
want carbon fiber in
sexy and feels good and I do agree with
you I wonder why companies don't invest
more and carbon fiber options that would
look really cool that on Wednesday ask
you if given the choice and having the
money to buy an Apple watch which one
would you pick as the rumors back then
before the launch of the Apple watch was
that there were constrained supplies and
that there were certain devices that
weren't going to ship until weeks or
months later which ended up happening we
have 124 comments out of which lego
craft nation says moto 360 greater than
the Apple watch and I agree and chris h
says i would buy the cheapest Apple
watch because every Apple watch has the
same software in hardware the only
difference is the material and of course
the price because of the different
materials and no the hardware's not the
same but I do get your point when it
comes to internals and because this is a
first generation product and we don't
know what's going to happen with the app
watch too then that's the main reason
why i would buy the cheapest one if I
still want it to have an Apple watch and
I don't an Eric lang says I would buy
the stainless steel models with the link
band looks like the high-end timepiece
and that is exactly the one I wanted up
until I saw that it cost eleven hundred
dollars then on Thursday I asked you if
Android wear ever launched for iOS
meaning there is an application that's
in the works do you think it would
cripple the Apple watch as those were
the news it seems that there is this
application already submitted to the app
store but it hasn't been approved yet we
have one in 68 comments out of which
Lucas andrada says of course it would
Android wear watches like the huawei
watch or the Moto 360 are much prettier
and cheaper than the Apple watch and
prettier is subjective but cheaper is
definitely the case and even though I do
disagree when it comes to the usefulness
of Android wear because I do like how on
the Apple watch you can launch
applications from it even though these
are connected to the phone and vice
verse and stuff like that but yeah it's
better than just getting cards on
Android wear but my god for the price
difference you can buy two moto 360 s
for the price of one Apple watch so yeah
and Seth Nieto says I believe it could
hopefully be the first step into
bringing
Apple and Android ecosystems together
maybe still being their own OSS but able
to work with each other the fact that
there are so many Google Play services
already available on iOS gmail google
maps and cetera et cetera just shows you
that there is that already but I do get
your point it would be cool to see
hardware Android hardware working with
iOS and vice versa but in the case of
Apple that's not their business in the
case of google it is so it's gonna be a
one-sided story then Hayden says hi man
could Apple really deny the Android wear
application for iOS wouldn't that be
trying to monopolize the SmartWatch
market for their platform it would be
monopolizing the Smart Watch for their
platform yes and it's their platform so
they can do whatever they want with it
yes they can do it they've done it
before with Google Maps it took ages for
them to approve it mainly because they
wanted apple maps to take off and it
crashed and burned so this is a
different story Apple can do it we're
not sure if it will if it does it's
entitled to do so we wish it didn't
mainly because hey if they allow the
pebble and the Kizito and so many other
smartwatches to work with iOS then why
not Android wear and finally on Friday
after all the pre-orders of the Apple
watch had gone through I was wondering
if with all the pandemonium you would
still want one because that's really
what happens when people see that people
are going crazy to buy something that
that means they want to buy a 2 we have
723 comments out of which darshan says
no Apple watch is overpriced mainly it
over hyped up yes overpriced indeed yes
overhyped indeed that's the work of
marketing and the I would have to test
it before I would say it's overhyped I
think that again it could be a really
good product but until I test it and
Buddha says I bet the Apple watch only
sold out so quickly is because they made
so few of them only to say that they
sold out in minutes and apples done that
before we're not sure if they do it
intentionally deliberately have issues
manufacturing and therefore there are
supply constraints we're not sure if
that's the case but it does drive people
to want to buy something so I guess it
works for them
and then another commoner says even if I
had s loads of money I still wouldn't
have bought an Apple watch just because
of the way it looks moto 360 any day I
love the Moto 360 I didn't buy it
because it's a SmartWatch I bought it
because it's the first watch that I've
liked period every other watch that I
had was a gift to me I wasn't really a
fan but my god this phone this watch is
gorgeous sorry in the case of the Apple
watch it's practical I don't find it to
be displeasing I like it but if I had to
pick when it came to design yes Moto 360
if I had to pick one a cake the
functionality I'd say Apple watch so
that's a tough pick up until you see the
price tag and that's really what halls a
lot of people away or toward something
that's it for the pocket out daily we
