time in launcher wars Brandon showed you
launcher pro today I'm going to show you
atw launch your ax let's go take a look
alright so in the last video Brandon
showed you launcher pro and to be honest
that is one of my favorite replacement
launchers for Android in fact I've got a
license key to the premium version of
that just like Brandon does and its
really really nice however i also have a
license key to this this is a TW
launcher ii x now the e x is the new
version that has some of these kind of
hyper real page-turner animations you
see how it kind of folds in and folds
out just all kinds of really cool stuff
and this guy Anders Webb was really one
of the first people to do that and it's
just really kind of cool and lets you
show off your Android above everybody
else's but cool looks aside let's go
ahead and get looking at the the
head-to-head stuff that we talked about
in Brandon's last video first and
foremost this is a t-mobile g2 I am
running a cyanogenmod nightly so it's a
gingerbread version which really is kind
of nice for this series because Brandon
showed us his Nexus S which is also
running Gingerbread so the operating
system is pretty much the same also the
same is the nexus s and the g two are
both coming stock with what's called the
google experience of android there's no
samsung UI there's no xperia type
interface there's no HTC Sense it's a
stock vanilla very fast implementation
of of the core android OS so that having
been said you can then throw on to it
all kinds of stuff like these custom
launchers really kind of cool so Brandon
showed you kind of really fast stuff he
turned off all of his animations on
except for his background wallpaper is
live wallpaper and you can see here I've
got a live wallpaper running in the
background as well I've also loaded this
up I've actually got three widgets on my
main home screen but we'll come to that
and
just a minute I however have left my
animations on except when that we get to
the app drawer and Brandon likes a fast
opening app drawer so do i so let me go
ahead and show you mine open the app or
see if I can get a good tap on it and
bam it's open just like that BAM it's
closed you can set animations to that
and all kinds of neat stuff but while
we're there let's talk about the app
drawer in adw.launcher there are lots of
different things you can do Brandon
showed you and launcherpro you can
change the number of icons and pack them
in tighter I've done that to you can do
that in launcher pro and ADW launcher so
I've got five icons going across and one
two three four five icons is going down
so I've got 25 icons in addition to my
dock icons right there you'll also
notice I've got these little itty bitty
dots across the top to help me know
which page I'm on and I've got just a
whole bunch of icons on there now you
can do the infinite scroll where you
scroll it up you can do an infinite
scroll where you scroll side-to-side
fling that there's lots of stuff that
you can do in the settings I kind of
like this because I can look at just one
page of icons at a time and when you've
got this many apps on your device
finding them is kind of a little bit
difficult so I like being able to look
just at one screen rather than we know
was it that or was it that when you can
do the scrolling you can get between
screens and then you end up looking at
the same thing twice which that's not
what you want to do when you just want
to get in and quickly launch an app so
really kind of cool there you can change
and theme the background of your drawer
in this case i'm running a gingerbread
theme now themes may be free or they may
cost extra money in this case it was 99
cents and I really been quite impressed
he's pushed it out a lot of updates that
primarily include all of these themed
icons you can see here soundhound here
is my setcpu my rom manager google talk
and they're not the stock icons neither
of these down on the bottom there icons
that come with this theme so if you want
to make your android look like an iOS
device you can do that you want to make
it look Windows Phone you can do that if
you want to make it look windows 7 you
can do that at least with the icons and
can
you I hint alright so going back home
Brandon showed you the sense UI previews
and you have that over here as well it's
a little bit slow because I'm on this
really resource intensive live wallpaper
background and that's just beautiful
live wallpaper from levelup studio so
that I've showed you in the past their
new OpenGL version once you put a nice
picture from your gallery behind it and
kind of adds a little bit more
personality to your device so really I
like that that update it is available
free in the market if you want to go get
that again level up Studios live weather
wallpaper search for that you'll find in
the problem anyway you can see here I've
got a total of what three four five
seven home screens and I do that mainly
because I like having a whole bunch of
homescreens I have them organized and
I've got some full screen widgets on
here that they take up a lot of space
but just by pressing and holding or
excuse me just by pressing the home
button on the homepage you can get to
that or if you want to pinch you can get
into that as well and then you can
quickly jump to any one of those so
we'll jump over here to my my voice
screen which you've seen in my voice
videos in the past now Brandon showed
you that you can resize widgets in
launcher pro you can do the same thing
over here in well they grabbed on to it
a little bit better in ADW launcher and
I'll show you what you just saw there in
just a moment so we're going to tap and
hold on it so that it knows that we
don't want to interact with it we want
to actually change the widget itself and
I didn't tap long enough let's try a
different spot here Andy and there we go
so now we get these three little options
popping up in this action bubble we can
either remove it from this screen we can
edit the widget or if it were just an
icon we could it edit that as well or we
can uninstall the app I think remove an
uninstaller kind of worded poorly but
you know that's just me now normally if
you want to remove something you tap and
hold and you drag it to a trash can icon
on the screen I've turned that off in my
option
you can do the same if you want but from
here let's go ahead and edit this and
you can see I've got these little
gravities I can make this wider if I had
more room here I can make it taller
since I don't I kind of boxing it in
here but I can make this real skinny I
can make it real wide I like what
Brandon's done he's got three so we're
going to leave it at three and to get
out of this you hit the back button and
there you go I've resized this widget
which is normally a 4 x 14 tiles wide by
1 tile high into a three by one and then
I've got my voice search button right
off to the side of that to make things a
little bit quicker and easier so
resizable which is really kind of cool
next up we've got the dock now I'm with
Brandon on this the doc is the dock and
it should be the same regardless of what
screen you're on so if I'm over here on
my social networking and new screens I
have the same dock you can set up a
second doc which isn't as many as in
launcher pro but you can have a little
gesture where you flip up or flip down
and it will get into basically giving
you another set of icons across the
bottom I like having consistency across
everything so I have it set right there
you can also style this dock you can add
icons customize it anything you want
maybe you want your your launch or your
little app drawer button over here on
the side you can do that not a problem
the icons down here you can customize
those when you drop them in or you can
get a theme pack like I have that
automatically changes it for you so I've
got google voice on the side I've got my
dialer got my my browser and then over
on the side I don't know if you can see
that very well on camera I've got my
ways icon that's not really a ways icon
that's Google Maps Navigation but I like
it better than the the ways i found
which is just the blue one and i kind of
want to go with the green theme down on
the bottom so really kind of cool all
right so I've shown you the screen
transitions I've shown you what getting
into the app drawer all of those are
configurable and that's in the settings
so let's go ahead and take a look in
there first i want to show you this i'm
on my far left screen so if i go into
menu i have settings that's going to
take me to my phone settings but i also
have a more button that will let me the
lock
the desktop or go to atw settings I'm
not going to do that right now instead I
want to roll all the way over here to my
home screen my main home and if I do the
same thing you'll notice now actually I
guess he's fix it in this update there
used to be an ADW launcher settings
there as well which it was kind of
inconsistent but it looks like that's
been changing in a recent updates oh hey
woohoo all right presets you can go in
and I can't left tap for some reason and
set this up however you think somebody
else might want so if you want just the
default which is really fast really cool
there you go if you want it to be kind
of iphone e you can do that if you want
to be like a nexus you can do that or if
you just want fast so they're just some
kind of presets I'd recommend you choose
one get to like it and then go in and
customize from there rather than
starting from default and and
customizing everything at least until
you get the hang of of changing all
these look we've got an awful lot of
settings in here so Brandon didn't touch
on a backup and restore it is available
in launcher pro but I recommend that
once you get everything set the way that
you want it to you backup your settings
okay and then you backup your desktop
configuration okay as easy as that now
it's all backed up with one caveat you
cannot back up widgets you can back up
their location but you can't back up
their configuration or their settings or
anything like that so if you're going to
go and do a you know custom home screen
like I've got where I've got three
widgets on there the placeholders are
going to be there but you're going to
have to readd the widget so it's a lot
better than not having anything at all
especially if you're wiping your rom
frequently like I am with cyanogenmod
nightlies you can restore your system
back or restore your UI back the way you
like it very quickly and then just
replace in your widgets so to wrap this
up speaking of widgets launcher pro has
some very HTC Sense like widgets that
come you can unlock that's cool it's
awesome in fact to be spending an awful
lot of time working on those widgets ADW
launcher is not doing that and the
widgets aren't cross compatible
one launchers widgets don't work in
another launcher which is kind of
disappointing so what I've done is I've
gone out and I found what widgets I like
best so this is plume which is a Twitter
client this is my pure calendar widget
these guys are both from level up
studios and they're beautiful widgets
pack over here I've got facebook I've
got feeder and I've got this is just the
google news widget so i put the widgets
that i like on there then yes they're
not as HTC Sense like as what comes with
launcher pro but i don't need them you
know this is my phone so the way i like
it Brandon's got his phone he's got all
the way he likes it it's all about
customizability and what you can do so
here I've shown you ADW launcher ii x it
is available in the market it is
available i believe in euros so it's
going to convert to your currency i
believe i paid about three and a half US
dollars for it three maybe 384 is coming
to mind well worth every penny there is
a free version just called adw.launcher
that doesn't have all the cool page
animations like this does so try that
out if you don't want to spend the money
up front both very cool if you want to
see more of these launcher wars
definitely give this video a thumbs up
let us know in the comments what
launcher you use so we know what you'd
like to see next four pocket now I'm Joe
