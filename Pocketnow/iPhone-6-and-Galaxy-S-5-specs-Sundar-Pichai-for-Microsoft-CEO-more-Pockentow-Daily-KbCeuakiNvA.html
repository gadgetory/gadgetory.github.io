get spelled out by analyst a sony xperia
smartphone with no bezels gets leaked in
photos and for a moment imagine sundar
pichai as microsoft's possible CEO I'm
high Nevada and at the same time please
imagine me for a moment as a
multi-billion dollar philanthropist this
is parking out daily that's right today
off with some official news asked pebble
has just announced the availability of
their app store for the pebble
smartwatch and this is really cool you
now have anything from 1000 titles to
choose from to take advantage of your
SmartWatch in different ways and this is
great obviously this is just a work in
progress there is more to come but the
biggest problem is that obviously the
first generation pebble doesn't have
enough memory to load a lot of these
apps but the pebble steel could be a
solution for you still if you want this
on Android you will have to wait it's
only available for iOS and that was it
for the official news that let's talk
about all the rumors we have more leaks
at the HTC m8 you remember that we
talked about it a couple of days ago
where we learned apparently we were not
getting any hardware keys on this phone
we were getting soft keys which was
really interesting as a departure from
HTC's design language now we get the
first league photograph so what those
soft keys are going to look like
obviously this comes from tipster efflux
which gives it a lot of credibility so
stay tuned HTC is changing now an even
more interesting leak is the fact that
we get this photograph of a sony phone
that has very close to no bezels this
was very famous on the Sony Xperia ZL
the fact that the frame was very small
but then Sony kind of lost that edge and
then they linked to bigger bezels on the
rest of their lineup so we are expecting
to see something interesting hopefully
at em though you see that brings a
SmartWatch with very little bezels we
know that Sony is famous for their
design so let's see this phone was real
obviously all we have is a blurry photo
with the Sony you are in a blurry way
now even though Bloomberg claims that
the microsoft seal is going to be named
as internal and the best candidate is
satya nadella we also have the New York
Times and The Wall Street Journal that
are saying that Microsoft does not reach
the decision but
we get some other conflicting and
trusted source leaks that say that
sundar Pichai is one of the biggest
candidates though we know that he is the
big deal at Google right now chrome and
Android and we do see this making sense
i mean center has done a fantastic job
and consumer izing chrome and making it
extremely affordable unpopular aside
from Android as well as oh let's see how
that goes and finally for the very hot
and interesting news of the day we get
analysts already predicting and pretty
much laying down flat the specifications
that we can expect for the iphone 6 on
the galaxy s5 on one hand the iphone 6
is as we expected two phones one being a
5.5 inch phablet and the other one being
a 4.7 inch phone with interesting
specifications the usual links to the
description for full details there a lot
and then we have the galaxy s5 where
we're expecting a five-point 25 inch 2k
display on this smartphone as well this
is going to be an interesting battle
2014 is going to be one of the hottest
battles because obviously I phones are
gaining more popularity again so that
leads me to the question of the day what
are you looking forward to this 2014
iphone 6 or galaxy s5 if you had to pick
from either of these i know that there
are other options in the market but from
these two which one in my particular
case since i have to carry two phones i
probably just will but leave us a
comment down below and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the news

a script reiki channel as well you'd
