pocketnow.com
and this is a look at the sense user
interface on HTC HD Mini this experience
is supposed to be very similar to what
you'll find on the HD 2 we're going to
compare parts of the Sense interface in
this video but in the next video we're
going to go more in-depth comparing the
HD 2 with the HD mini so let's start off
by turning on the device and we have
this new unboxing which is not nearly as
usable as the one you get in standard
windows mobile 6.5 it shows you
indicators on the bottom and it should
come back here about how many text
messages you have how many emails you
have but you can't action on them like
you can in windows mobile 6.5 and 6.5 if
you have a new email you can slide on
the email it will take you directly into
the email application on the HD Mini
that is not the case so right off the
bat we have the nice weather animation
which comes from HTC's newer devices it
knows where you are using the the the
GPS and it will show you the weather and
the conditions in this particular area
and of course I can tap on the clock and
it shows me the world clock you can also
show me my alarm clock over here and
it's really interesting to see how these
soft keys look down here again this is
Windows Mobile 6 point 5 point 3 as a
comparison if we look at the hd2 running
6 point 5 point 3 we see that there's a
start button in the bottom left corner
and even if we tap over to another part
of sense the favorite people tab we
still get the Start menu down there on
the HD Mini you cannot get to the Start
menu unless you tap the Hardware button
down here which I guess is ok they're
trying to save on space a little bit
so we zoom in some more if we tap on the
conditions were taken to the weather tab
we've seen this before and we can flick
through different areas let's go back
over to the left now we don't get that
much information on the screen like we
get on the HD 2 on the HD 2 in this
particular screen you get to see your
three Quick Links your next appointment
and everything else that you get to see
on the HD Mini but because this is a low
resolution screen which by the way
really shows in some
programs text looks really bad you don't
forget to see that much on the screen
you have to flick up to see your Quick
Links which is a little bit annoying and
of course you can you can add and remove
them you can add programs contacts or
bookmarks which is quite convenient but
it's this is stuff that we've seen on
other versions of sense it's just not as
not as nice because of the lower
resolution screen so if we go over to
the people tab we have the quick Quick
Links here that allows you to quickly
dial someone that you contact on a
regular basis we have SMS over here
which you can flick through normal stuff
that we've gotten on the Sense interface
and of course we can go to menu and we
can action on these right from this
screen without having to dig into the
the text messaging application for
Windows Mobile we can go into email and
you can flick through and see the
different emails you can action on them
right from here so again you don't
actually have to go into your email
application this is a new feature for
sense you don't have to you can spend a
lot of your time on the home tabs
instead of going into the actual
applications we can go into the internet
tab and from here we can launch the
browser or we can set up these Quick
Links to quickly launch a website
because this is a capacitive multi-touch
screen there it is pinch to zoom in the
Opera browser and we're going to talk
more about that in another video over
here we have the HTC calendar which does
an awesome job at showing you your
appointments you can flick through to
month you go back to agenda view and
change things over there here we have
the listing of stocks we've seen this
before over here we've got some some
photos but if you go into landscape
nothing happens you don't really get the
graphical power that you get on the hd2
so I don't think HTC could do that
really fancy animation we're in the in
the Photos tab you get that nice
transition into the landscape view over
here we have the music tab we've seen
this a million times you can go into
your library and get this nice looking
sense interface to go through your
artists and your albums and these these
icons are actually kind of new for this
device I think they're very colorful
alright let's go back here we have
weather we have twitter integration of
course this is HTC's twitter client
peach
there's just a pretty good job can
automatically update you can see your
@replies you can see your messages and
your favorites right from your home
screen without digging in anywhere we
have HTC footprints and you can click
through I don't think anybody really
uses this but it's a nice feature if you
travel you can tap on one of these
things it flips over it will geotag a
picture and you can also set a voice
note to it or coordinates or things like
that again good if you travel if you
don't travel it really isn't something
you'll use too much and over here we
have some settings we're going to go
through the settings in a second but let
me open up the the notification area up
here so if you tap and hold you get this
notification area and new to this
version of sense is that you get a link
to the task manager within the
notification area so right now I can see
all the applications I've opened some of
these I forgot to close so they're
taking up memory like the camera
application is using up 4.1 eight
megabytes so I'd probably want to close
that but the device isn't really slowing
down right now it has plenty of RAM for
what it is through about three hundred
and eighty four megabytes of RAM and you
can probably tell by me just using it
right now it's not getting slow even
though I have several programs open okay
so let's go back to the settings here we
can personalize some of the things we
can personalize the home home screen
wallpaper by doing either the wet
weather or wallpaper or animated
wallpaper they've got some really bright
ones here so I'm going to choose this
one lockscreen wallpaper we can change
that too this is the standard kind of
new-age HTC Sense wallpaper we can
change the font size so oddly it doesn't
seem like cleartype is on at all let me
show you why I think that let's go back
home you see the new wallpaper if you
look at these icons up close they look
very blurry or anywhere that you see
text in the operating system it's just
it's not clear let me bring up a message
okay here I brought up a message and
text is just not very nice-looking and
let me bring this up on the hd2 we can
compare them side-by-side and you'll see
what I mean I think the H VGA screen is
just way too low resolution for a device
like this okay so here we are side by
side and I'm zoomed out all the way so I
did a
pinch to zoom out and look at the text
here and then look at the text here much
darker over here smoother easier on the
eyes but on the HD Mini not so much and
again these graphics down here also
don't look very clear I think that's an
issue with the low resolution screen
something that you'll have to get used
to another place where you really get to
see the low resolution screen is up here
in the notification area look at the
look at the Wi-Fi icon I'll try to focus
it can you see the Wi-Fi icon it looks
horrible it looks like a device from
three or four years ago but that's okay
maybe that doesn't matter that much to
you let's go through some other areas of
the Sense interface so I'm going to go
to call history and share we have the
sense interface nicely integrated with
the contact so we can slide our finger
to the right and go to groups call
history updates and events it will
integrate with Facebook we can see our
groups of people we can go to our
favorites and so on so very nice
integration of this sense interface with
the slider along the bottom you get a
lot of that throughout a lot of the
operating system whether you're in the
calendar or in certain other areas of
the operating system so that was a look
at the Sense interface on the HTC HD
Mini I really don't think HTC capture
the sense interface found on the hd2
because of this low resolution screen
and also because it doesn't have all of
the interesting animations that you'll
find on the HD to suggest the cool
slideshow view and other things like
that so it's basically an HD to half of
the way there but perhaps that's what
HTC was growing forth so that's it for
now please give a thumbs up on the video
if you liked it and we'll be back soon
with more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
