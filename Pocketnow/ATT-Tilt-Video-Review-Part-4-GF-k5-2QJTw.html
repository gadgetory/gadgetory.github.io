pocket now calm and this is part 4 of
the video review of the AT&amp;amp;T tilt I want
to take a look at programs now in the
program menu the first three items
listed are eighteen t programs so they
allow you to download ringtones and and
music and small video content for a fee
let's go over to games and apps here and
see what's inside of there the tilt
comes with a bunch of games most of
which are trials so they only last about
fifteen days or so and they're not that
great of quality so for example tiger
woods and midnight pool don't take up
the full screen and they also don't use
the touchscreen capability if you want
the classics though you always have
bubble breaker and solitaire down here
on the bottom is tell MF telenav is a
program that utilizes your GPS
connection with your internet connection
so it downloads maps as you go along it
also gives you real-time traffic updates
which is pretty convenient this costs
about ten dollars per month for
unlimited use and we're going to get
more into telenav later I think it's a
great application if if you want the
real time traffic updates and you don't
want to buy a fully fledged GPS map
program for your windows mobile device
moving along we have messaging the tilt
doesn't come with a standalone version
of windows live messenger though you can
get it through the 0 Z instant messaging
application you can also get AOL instant
messenger and yahoo messenger I know 18t
has included this on other ATT windows
mobile devices such as the blackjack and
the 8525 so if you have either of those
devices you've probably seen this before
moving along pictures and video let's go
into tools in tools we have a version of
adobe reader called le which allows you
to view PDF files moving down here we
have some other standard things quick
GPS will give you your current location
though I'm indoor so that won't be able
to work right now we have a full version
of sprite backup which is great because
sprite button sprite backup lets you
backup all of the files the registry and
everything from your from your device
and restore it later should you
experience a device crash for some
reason 18t included version 5.1 the
latest out is six point 0 but at least
they included
the full version voice speed dial is a
program that requires you to train the
voice tag so it's not like voice command
where you don't need to train it moving
along if we go into let's see i have
google maps installed so that integrates
very well with gps so if i want to find
a coffee shop near where i am it will
reach out to the gps connection find
where i am and find gp-air find coffee
shops within my vicinity it also works
with Windows Live to the GPS
functionality and finally I want to go
into office mobile here and I found that
the 18t tilt can read office 2007
documents so i tried to open a dot xlsx
file which is for Excel 2007 and it
worked fine so that's a really great
feature I'm glad they have that and that
is part 4 of the video review of 18 Tito</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
