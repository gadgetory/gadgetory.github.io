max mate pro excel I hate that Apple
caught on to that - well this outro
Jaime could make a diss on mmm easy
I know his beard is weird I'm is rocking
a new magnum p.i stache okay yeah that's
right it's that time of the week I am
Jaime to be that others is PocketNow and
it's time for the bogging out daily
recap your comments for last week so on
Monday the top comments had everything
to do with the Huawei made 20 pro the
leaks of the new camera design and I
asked you which one would be your
favorite
we had 653 comments Huawei are taking
over if my p20 pro is anything to do by
the mate 20 pro will be a beast I
seriously have to agree with this it's
very hard for me to explain just how
much better the p20 pro is when it comes
to photography battery life
just the whole usability of the phone so
oh my god that made 20 pro with even
better specs that's gonna be crazy while
we are doing what other manufacturers
are not try change yes and no Huawei is
following on certain design elements
from the iPhone with a display and
everything which is something that I
hate but I do love the boldness that
they're following with their design
approach to cameras photography where
they're not doing what everybody else is
doing and I love that and then the user
interface is this mix where I don't even
know how to describe it
yes glad they're still innovation not
just iteration huh again not necessarily
agree with that particularly with
display design but everything else
totally from our way that on Tuesday the
topic was the Google pixel 3 XL and it's
possible color options we saw a blue and
some pink and but it was all code names
we didn't really get to see photos ask
you what did you think we had 359
comments Godzilla called he wants his
notch back alright I need to change my
joke fine I could give the pixel
presentation at this 48
all right yeah like with absolutely all
of the leaks like it would be awesome if
Google would just hire any of us just
stand on stage and be like let's talk
about the phone that all of you know
about or like Steve Jobs did with the
iPhone 4 it's like stop me have you've
seen this Google's improvement on its
camera is still hanging on a pixel three
notch or no not true I don't know it's
the most horrible design I've ever seen
but so was the pixel one the largest
Chin's on a phone for no reason
whatsoever and yet we praised it so much
because of its cameras oh I don't know
man then on Wednesday the topic was the
oneplus 60 we had some renders I asked
you what did you think about all the
leaks so far we had 374 comments I'm
just waiting for the day when you have a
fridge washing machine a wardrobe and a
damn phone and people will say man true
that technology has become so ubiquitous
that I get I agree I know I know
hopefully one plus doesn't settle with
no headphone jack
at this point Kevin I honestly doubt it
I just can't wait to hear the excuse
though should the 60 likely be IP
certified after removing the headphone
jack
most of the rumors points event that
we're getting a larger battery and water
resistance and that's the reason why
they're getting rid of it I I don't know
man
they're there you know bullet wireless
headphones are good they're affordable
it's just not a practical way to connect
I feel that Bluetooth still needs work
Apple has done an amazing job with air
pods even though they're the worst
headphones ever I don't know we'll see
on Thursday the topic was huawei the
leaks of a possible underwater camera
mode and I asked you like how often do
you take photos underwater
we had 321 comments once I use the
galaxy s3 once and take pics underwater
I am sure that phone didn't work
afterwards I think yeah it was the
Galaxy s5 was the first one with a lot
of resistance
I think underwater mode is awesome I do
too I just find it really funny that
they're using waves in the video which
pretty much points to saltwater which
pretty much points to there is no water
resistance right now that works under
saltwater while there is on certain
products but I don't think it's going to
come on one of these phones the beast is
a beast Huawei made 20
true that let's just see if it proves
itself and then Friday the topic was the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 the fact that there
were three variants one of these
variants having up to five cameras which
is crazy but yeah we had 518 comments I
asked you I mean what do you think about
this Samsung needs to work on their UI
first and foremost in my opinion yes and
no I like the their design aesthetic I
feel that it's fine but then again it's
a matter of taste buddy Samsung doesn't
need more cameras but needs more updates
true definitely I think that fine they
want to push their show their whole user
interface that's fine so long as we get
the updates I need super slow-mo on the
LG v 40 right stick to the point
definitely at least you got your comment
here LG v 40 we'll see what we get
because apparently that phone comes with
five cameras as well that's it for the
pocket out daily recap thank you very
