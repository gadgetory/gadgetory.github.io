streaming service offering online radio
playlists and more I'm high on to
Houston of the pocket now and these are
our top three feature picks for Apple
music it's great to be able to listen to
your favorite bands at any time but one
of my favorite things about streaming
services is music discovery an apple
music nails it when you first set up an
apple music account it prompts you to
choose some of your preferred genres and
artists and you can even emphasize which
fans of your favorites from there the
free you section begins to populate with
those in similar artists and have
already found a few new bands this way
another great feature is the connect tab
it's sort of a miniature social network
built into Apple music and the artists
can post photos audio clips and
interviews and fans can comment on those
posts or show them to their own social
networks it's not exactly a
groundbreaking addition after all you
could just follow the bands on Twitter
or Instagram and get essentially the
same experience but it's nice to have a
small hub focus solely on the people
behind the music you listen to and for
the hardcore fan there's all sorts of
possibilities here lastly one of my
favorite features on Apple music is the
iCloud music library it's great that
Apple music has taylor swift and all but
when it comes to lesser-known artists
like a local band you usually have to
resort to on device storage meaning
those songs won't be synced to other
devices you've signed into that's
suddenly a different story with iCloud
music library which lets you merge your
personal library with that of Apple
music so that none of your songs get
left behind on the cloud if we miss any
great Apple music features let us know
in the comments below and subscribe to
the YouTube channel while you're at it
