we're here at Pebble taking a look at
pebble steel at CES if we take a look
here this is actually pebble versus
pebble steel so this is a look at the
two devices side-by-side you can see the
the bezels are actually much slimmer on
the new model and I can just hold this
one up here so it's a it's smaller
pin-to-pin and you can see the bezels
are much slimmer this one actually also
has an LED notification light and that
is actually RGB so you can get different
colors on that based on developer
preferences and it can be used for a
multitude of different things basically
specifications are going to be almost
the exact same they have the same
processor they're same screen the only
difference is the new pebble pebble
steel has double the RAM so you have a
little more memory there it's not
anything pertinent immediately it's
basically for future proofing so there's
actually going to be a little step up in
price from pebble to pebble steel this
one that's going to be - $49.99 but it's
also going to come with both of these
options so you can choose a flat or a
matte black finish or this brush steel
here and it will also come with a
leather band so you do get that and you
get a huge bump in the quality here this
is not the same plastic it's it's metal
the black model is actually PVD we don't
have one right here
but it's PVD like the the watch bands
that you've seen on Michael and my
pebbles earlier this year so this is
just a quick look at the original pebble
versus pebble steel I'm Taylor Martin
with PocketNow and I will see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
