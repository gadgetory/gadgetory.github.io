security of a password lock on your
phone but you hate having to type it in
every other minute we all do however
thanks to Motorola's latest security
accessory you might be able to forget
that pin I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and this is motorola skip mobile
security cannot be overstated we have
become more lenient towards what we're
willing to store on our phones and well
their personal devices you likely have
conversations you don't want people to
read or other private information
neither the world nor snooping eyes need
to see or know about that's why it's
always good practice to secure your
phone with a pin or password the trouble
is we check our phones up to a hundred
times if not more each day
according to Motorola typing in a pin or
password takes up to two point three
seconds each time while just under four
minutes per day might not sound like a
lot of time spent entering passwords the
time certainly adds up whether or not
that time matters is well up to you and
so is making use of Motorola's latest
push forward in the ease of mobile
security it's called Motorola skip and
it looks like some strange fashion
accessory or a pull-tab of some sort but
it's actually a magnetic clip with an
NFC chip embedded and the promisor is
simple instead of actually typing your
PIN or drawing a pattern on your lock
screen every time simply tap the phone
and skip together and your phone will
unlock the setup is extremely simple
download the Motorola skip setup
application from Google Play run the
application by tapping skip to the back
to your own and agree to the service you
were then asked whether you want to use
a pattern pin or password lock when skip
is not available select your security
type and pair your skip the next time
you go to unlock your phone simply tap
it to skip and it unlocks the skip
whether it came free with your online
order or you purchased it separately
comes with three skipped dots which work
the same way but in sticker form you
might clip your skip to the belt loop on
your pants or on the hem of your shirt
the stickers you would strategically
place in safe areas or trusted zones
such as your desk at work your
nightstand or in the kitchen you may be
asking why is skip so helpful how is it
any better than simply entering your PIN
or
there's a simple answer one of the
unique features of the Moto X is
touchless control the ability to use
Google now without ever touching your
phone if you have a password lock on
your phone it's not actually touchless
anymore
you have to enter your password each and
every time sit the Moto X on a skip dot
or attach the magnetic skip to the back
of your Moto X and touchless control
works flawlessly even with password
protection motorola skipped works great
though we have yet to find a comfortable
place to actually attach it we tried it
on our belt loop but it was difficult to
tap the right part of the Moto X to skip
each time since it was beneath our shirt
we ended up fiddling with it every time
to get it to work so we just carry it
around in our pocket and slap it to the
back of the phone when we need it not
the safest method but we're working on
it
and it's certainly better than tediously
entering our pin every single time we
use the phone as great as skip maybe
it's not the only security feature of
the Moto X buried in the security
submenu in settings is yet another
similar feature called trusted devices
it may sound like one of those generic
features you've always overlooked in the
security settings but it isn't this is
new and it's quite cool basically
Motorola figures that when you're
connected to certain Bluetooth devices
you will likely be using the phone more
frequently so constantly locking the
phone when the display powers off is
overkill and unneeded when you pair a
device you will be asked if that device
should be added to your trusted devices
list if so when you connect that device
the phone will remain unlocked until
they are disconnected if not the lock
protocols act just as they normally
would for example I frequently used this
Bluetooth speaker with my Moto X when
I've connected I'm constantly powering
the Moto X on to change songs or
playlists I enabled it as a trusted
device a car stereo is easily the most
useful trusted device yet my pebble on
the other hand is not a trusted device
else my phone would never be locked
unless I walked out of proximity which
is about 30 feet it's not a terrible
idea though and if I wanted to make it a
trusted device I simply check it off in
the trusted device settings these
security features from Motorola are
quite useful and show some true forward
thinking from the company however they
obviously pose risks if skip falls into
the hands of the wrong
person they will have total access to
all your private data so Keeping Up with
skip is likely in your best interest so
we leave you with one question is
Motorola skip the sort of device you see
yourself using in place of typing a pin
or password all the time we've been
using it since Monday and don't plan on
stopping anytime soon it's convenient
and a parrot 'iv if you want to use
touchless control and a lock screen pin
at the same time that's gonna do it for
