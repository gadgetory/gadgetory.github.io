over
I'm Anton Dean I am hi everyone you were
doing the same cable should be on
this is high never again talk what
should I say whatever I don't want me to
talk I have no idea what you want me to
say something said dump its gonna ramble
now this beautiful water here which is
blowing I need to be really have you yet
no way
hmm say something
but this is a test of the microphone and
if we like the way the sound goes and ZT
is not gonna play their music and
nobody's gonna trip over the wire and
the camera is not going to lose focus
no it just lost from bogans chocolate
come on you under expose the camera
mines rollin I'm good you know the noise
is rolling is welcome all right
a possible Samsung Galaxy s5 a possible
Galaxy Note 3 competitor from LG and a
Sony Xperia z2 that we've always wanted
it's not possible it's been at already
enough that's yeah is the mic on
the everyone we are still here at
Barcelona at MWC now here onwards turkey
and a possible and hopefully alright
a possible Samsung Galaxy s5 the LG G
pro 2 Samsung Galaxy Note freaking and
something that we've always wanted to
hopefully has hit that okay let's just
look at how this and it becomes a
Bluetooth headset so have you get a
phone call obviously all you have to do
is this thing one two three this is my
left eye and this is me talking into the
microphone to see if there's any RF
interference like we experienced like
couple of seconds ago so hopefully it'll
be alright and I just keep on rambling
because it's random so okay
well in the palm of your hand now
turning the screens on and turn the
screen on it will actually turn the
screen on and turn Epona
shame on you
this is my girlfriend's phone
I will need to change that wallpaper
quick look at this I don't know the
while still talking about the camera a
very Barcelona and you are looking at
what we expect to see here aside from
the background all right let's go wait
he's gonna put them there okay okay I'll
let him let him clear the frame I think
he's doing that noise thank you yeah
let's have a look at the Huawei media
pad m1 8.0 before I lose my breath and
we've got this front camera that I'm
trying to decipher you remember what it
was I think it's a fiber it doesn't say
here doesn't say here he was serious and
also the follow-up for the Sony Xperia
Tablet see those two are something to
look at or not this valley extract good
the Sony Xperia z1 was a great phone the
camera was the bit on the low note
but I have a lot of bloopers
I had no papers and CES no bloopers
Aviva but this is gonna be interesting
wait media pat em 18.0 and I just lost
my breath there and we are continuing
our comparisons here for their bones
already saw the new beef 5s at CTS and
now we're gonna see the new BIA 5s mini
here at MWC Tony behind the camera hi
never laid off the parka now let's have
a look it's
z5s don't forget about the king the
typical Retina display with their
proprietary resolution 960 by 640 now
that's 1261 stokes yeah that's the old
one let's try one more time no match no
match no match something's wrong
holy different galaxy s5 at this event
and we will let you be the judge of that
by what we are
the Xperia branding and turning it to
the front we'll take a closer look at
the software just possible to catch my
breath
I'm gonna fight with and
thickness you know you can cut out that
does however with the to current
flagship Samsung has one is the flagship
tablet and the other one is this alright
let's go
a possible Samsung Galaxy D come on
ready yeah okay a possible Samsung
Galaxy s5 a noisy background okay
alright he ever moments Anton from Sony
hi man behind the camera we are healed
with processor plucking in and 1.2
gigahertz I'm gonna pause there because
this thing just closes automatically
come over this way because it's just the
phone is so dark all I see is a black
slab okay they're a range other device
do it again do it again do it again do
it in that was the Sony Xperia tablet Z
that was a tablet see right okay we're
having a hard time finding the mayor you
see there at the front
thank you
it's okay appreciate it if this page
wouldn't always move this is a great
cheat sheet that has always it always
moves another one you know okay so off
the bat this is
just want to see one thing I've
mentioned the word Android and yes we
are running it on a new lineup of phones
this is the nokia X why are you focusing
there yeah this one is - come on

now this is not an antenna this is for
the TV in South Korea
yeah hold on how do you unlock this
thing
traffic so does the screen option and
the specifications I have no idea how to
unlock this D phone and that's the way
it should go
okay
how do you all off this
push record
testing the sound as usual to see if our
she mic works
okay
what should I say in the outro so
they're okay getting to more of our
territory these
the desire 816 and we're going to
compare it against the Galaxy Note 3 got
the right phone right

like five hands
