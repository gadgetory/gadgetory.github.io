shows that 9 out of 10 people admit to
using their smartphone while driving and
nearly 4 in 10 admit that distracted
driving is a habit yes these numbers are
alarming in I get it after reviewing
smart phones are 10 plus years I know
that we love our phones for what they
can do but one thing that I will tell
you bones were not designed to be used
while driving AT&amp;amp;T has had one of the
most persistent campaigns to remind us
that it can wait and we thank them for
taking this so seriously that they sent
a package and they even sponsored this
video I'm hey mater we've add-on with
pocket now and let's dive into the
experience and learn some more facts
you know Aztec influencers I love it
when we have a chance to take a break
from our review programming and talk
about more important things this
campaign alone has taught me a ton of
things that have made me really proud to
be part of it so remember those nine out
of ten people well nearly a quarter of
them don't see that phone use while
driving is a major problem a crazy 60%
admit to sending emails while behind the
wheel and the crazy 36% watching stream
videos thing is all it takes is a split
second for everything to go really wrong
and that's what this package was all
about the Box I received is rather large
and includes some interesting essentials
it has all the latest gear for me to
experience this in VR the whole idea was
to snap everything together and there's
an interesting video included within and
seriously the best way to experience it
was through VR the video shows a couple
of different simulated scenarios on how
just a tiny little distraction just the
quick moment cannot just put your life
in danger but also risk the lives of
others driving around you or pedestrians
the video shows some touching cases
where people share their experiences and
let us know how it's been either victims
of crashes or worse people that have
caused the accidents the experience is
extremely moving and for me even more
because I don't know if you knew this
but three years ago I nearly lost my
life I put my son's life in danger and I
put a lot of other people's lives in
danger because I fell asleep at the
wheel I was lucky and yes the word is
lucky that I was the only person injured
with second-degree burns in my left arm
all it took was a split second for me to
slightly doze at the wheel I hit another
car and even worse at that time there
were children coming out of school this
could have been terrible so let me ask
you this think about it I mean what's
the difference between what happened to
me falling asleep at the wheel and let's
say you're distracted while driving
because you're looking at your phone and
are keeping
on the road back to the matter is the
risk is the same this experience really
changed my life it changed my driving
habits and watching this video
watching it can wait really brought me a
positive reminder one thing that I've
learned is that these reminders actually
help you retain those habits over time
ATT's it can wait campaign is now eight
years strong the VR experience will be
touring more than 200 stops in 2018 to
allow people across the country that
truly grasp the reality of the dangers
of this behavior one of the reasons we
feel so proud to be part of this is
because research has proven that
constant awareness helps 57 percent of
people are more likely to stop driving
distracted of a friend or a passenger
tells them to so far 23 million pledges
have been made to not drive distracted
to help out a TMT even created a free
app called drive mode and so far it can
wait has inspired a crazy 20 million
downloads so how about if we shake
things up a bit for the question of the
day let us know in the comments if
you've experienced any case where you've
noticed somebody being distracted while
driving or if that's happened to you if
you've been distracted while driving and
also let us know if you're willing to
take the pledge for it can wait at
pocket now we have definitely taken this
pledge while you're at that make sure
you follow us on social media and
subscribe to our channel for more videos
like this one you'll also follow me on
Twitter heinie underscore Rivera on
instagram @ hi metadata please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I'm hearing that I thanks so much

one
