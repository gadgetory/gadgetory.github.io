wouldn't know it necessarily looking at
the mobile technology industry where
competitors often schedule major events
right on top of one another well that's
what happened this week in tech and
that's what we're talking about on a
special episode episode 04 four of the
pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss smartphones tablets and the
state of mobile technology in 2013 I'm
your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now and I'm joined
today by editor in chief Brandon minimun
good morning to you what up son and
managing editor and Tandy no do good
afternoon to you good morning good
afternoon good evening everybody yes
gentlemen we are on a tight schedule
today we have a short podcast schedule
that's good because we're we're sticking
to a finite series of topics and that's
good because it's not going to allow me
to ramble on about about the new Star
Trek film which I'm seeing tomorrow and
very excited about and in order to
prevent me from talking any further
about that I understand brand amendment
has a thought thread related to mobile
technology I have a thought thread
related to the things at hand good good
relevant relevant discussion we like
that oh yeah yeah keep it keep it
relevant so Taylor reviewed the galaxy
s4 for AT&amp;amp;T and then he sent it to me
senior editor Taylor Martin that's the
guy and so he sent it to me and I had
this idea that I would use the galaxy s4
for a period of time and then write an
article entitled chronicles of an HTC
One lover gone galaxy s4 now it's a now
it's important to point out the reason
that I'm an HTC One lover it's not
because HTC pays me or something it's
because the one is in my opinion the
best smartphone ever and I wanted to see
you know how the galaxy s4 compared
against it I played with in New York
City with at the launch event I've read
all the reviews I've heard Michael and
Taylor talk about it
at length so now it's my turn to live
with it and it's not going so well how
many days into it are you I am a mere 24
hours into it Wow so so it hasn't been
long enough and I'm going to give it a
good amount of time at least at least a
week or so maybe five or six days and
there are a few observations that I have
which which have been observed before
but in my case are really really
bothering me number one is lag and you
know Michael and Taylor pointed the
point of this out in there and the
reviews where you know you do catch some
light when you're going back to the home
screen when you're flipping through
various places the screen animations
there's something wrong with the screen
animations to the point where the frames
get so slow in some cases you can
actually like count the count the frames
and see the animation unfold and and
that's totally different than the HTC
One which magically seems to have no lag
and I really mean that there hasn't been
more than one time which was probably my
own fault when I've experienced it's
like uh so so that's number one which is
number an amazing reversal right i mean
we're used to saying like old versions
of sense are really really laggy and
TouchWiz was really responsive for a
long time and so it's kind of
interesting to see though that the
mirror effect of that yeah and it's also
interesting because they have the same
processor but the one on the galaxy s4
is clocked a little bit higher so it
should make up for some software issues
um anyhow so so so that was the first
thing I noticed and I'm really having
trouble with that the second thing I'm
having trouble with which hasn't really
been cited very much is screen
brightness the auto setting sets it a
little bit too low for my taste so I
turned off auto brightness which is a
pain in the because now I've got it at
like sixty percent most of the time and
then I go outside and it should be going
up to one hundred percent because I
don't have it on although it's not and
on the HTC One the the baseline screen
brightness on auto is just right that
that's true and actually you know what I
was starting to think about was two
things first of all you have that really
awesome and convenient brightness
adjustment in the notification shade
thanks to TouchWiz we have one of my
favorite parts of TouchWiz and second of
all I wondered if if Tony had seen any
of the
on his on his octa-core version which
was formerly the one that I was using
and if he'd if we could just jump in for
a quick thought there before you move to
your next point yeah I was making the
list so about the leg first of all
disclaimer I have not used the quad-core
Snapdragon version i've been using only
the dual quad-core the Exynos 5 version
and I've been sending e-mails back and
forth to Michael and the ones who have
used the octa-core version and I am not
experiencing lag and Michael pointed out
to me that the of course my daily usage
doesn't imply maximizing the number of
homescreens 27 i'm using currently three
home screens and that might have
something to do with it i have enabled
and disabled all the s features and i
haven't seen any lag so this might be
something which the Exynos 5 brings to
the table in addition to the quad core
but again lag is a subjective thing we
perceive it differently by no means i
have seen at any point slowing the phone
down to the point where i can count the
frames and as far as screen brightness
is concerned super Emma let's are are
washed out in direct sunlight so I agree
to that I'm not sure whether your Galaxy
s4 guys has this feature or not it
should have it the the brightness toggle
and the notification shade once you set
it to auto within the auto you can set
it from minus 52 plus 5 so say auto on 0
brings you thirty five percent of
brightness but within the auto setting
you have a from minus 52 plus 5 setting
where you can further tweak the auto
setting what do you talk how do you do
this so say drop down the notification
shade yeah there should be an auto
button yep checked out as the press
press it on yep and within that move the
slider the end you'll see that it
changes from minus 5 25 within the auto
settings so that means that if you go
outside and you put it to plus 5 the
auto setting will be plus 5 degrees or
plus five notches higher than without it
hold the phone when you see this
granular control yeah where do you see
this plus 5 and minus 5
well if you hold the phone and get the
notification shade down yeah you'll see
the toggles and then you'll see the
brightness controls I see a slider and
an auto check box that's it and and the
slider can you can she move the slider
yeah okay so if you move the slider
towards the right you'll see a plus 5 I
don't see a plus 5 then this is not the
core version and this is a yeah this is
an artist thing Thank an aura us carry
so what I'm saying is that within the
auto setting it allows you to play with
yeah you can set the baseline from minus
50 five and one increments and you know
ice for fine cumin oh I think I have
something like that there are next year
brightness slider the notification shade
is there like a little sunshine on the
left it isn't yes it is but one side tap
on it nothing happens but the slider is
capable of being moved either to the
left and to the right and the small
number just changes accordingly okay so
can you send me a screenshot just
curious sure i'm sending you right now a
screenshot with the it's set it to plus
5 and let's get rhian while i do sigep
yeah like a like a bloody nose at the
worst possible moment uh yeah every time
I podcast to get a bloody nose yeah so
anyway brandon i want to mention here
the rest of your thoughts in the s4
before we move on to the week's events
sure sure ok so so also you know when i
got the s4 i packaged with it was a
smart cover which is pretty awesome i
totally agree with you guys that's a
must have although it's too expensive
the S view cover right the SS view cover
yes and to be honest I don't remember a
time in device history where a case has
has had some intelligent in I don't
censor integration with the software ya
like like like uve of the iPad Smart
Cover right which which turns the screen
on and off and that's it but this thing
like goes goes a few steps further it
does turn on and off the screen which I
love I love just flipping it over boom
screen on but but you know answering
calls from it and seen your notification
seeing the time I think that's freaking
awesome I think that's a nice leg up on
the one so the other thing the third
thing that has really irked me beside
screen brightness and lag is the device
I don't know what the word is it gets
dirty it gets disgusting if you don't
use the S view cover because the S view
cover it wraps around to the back and
you get like this fabric e stuff on the
back so you're not getting your dirty
fingerprints on it but the HTC one with
the aluminum on the on the back and
maybe a less porous front glass panel
does a pretty good job of deterring
fingerprints and grime on the galaxy s4
this is the same as the galaxy s3 and I
guess I forgot about it because it's
been a while since I he's a galaxy s3 it
just accumulates this crap and and it's
so bad that if you use the phone for for
more than you know 10 minutes just
checking a message or something it
literally gets gross right and this is
the part where everyone's like well what
are you would you stop eating french
fries and using your cone and so then
it's like no you don't even need to try
you know you don't even need to you can
have washed your hands and it's just
natural like whether it's sweat or just
natural skin oil or whatever it just
accumulates on the phone so quickly when
they uses this this glossy coating so
yeah it's it's interesting to see that
you're you know experiencing that as
well before before we move on can I also
say something about the s4 vs the HTC
one because since this is already an
editorial category this is my opinion
and everybody knows what I said about
the galaxy s4 and everything I said
still stands i definitely agree with
brandon and everybody else that this
thing once you use it for like five
minutes it's a grease collection it's a
sweat collection it's okay let's not get
into that but i've been using the s4
octa-core version for almost two weeks
now and part of those two weeks were
like four days when I was abroad in
London for the NOC event and I've been
also using the HTC One in parallel one
was unrolling one was in on three UK and
a local number I can tell you this much
if the galaxy s4 wouldn't have been
built with this coating with this
technology Samsung does it and would
make the phone feel a little bit more
how should I say this premium was
substantial and premium at the same time
I would probably choose it over the HTC
one because the camera on the s4 just
kills the camera on the age
see one and I will prove this in a
series of camera comparison posts and
the optical version i'm using yeah the
active perversion i'm using in
particular is by no means affected by
the slag issue but disclaimer again I'm
talking octa-core and you guys are
talking quad core yeah you know a tony i
think that i haven't looked but i bet
that you can buy a replaceable backing
for the galaxy s4 I looked I looked and
no and I was in UK and I looked in every
major store which had accessories for
the s4 there's aside from the S view
cover you can't find anything for the s4
yet I think if there's one constant in
the world of smartphones is that the
accessory makers will if there's a
demand for it they will make it so I see
metal battery doors in our future I see
you know matt finish polycarbonate in
our future I see about exactly a soft
touch back on a gasket for be I'm
curious whether the official wireless
charging battery cover which will come
from Samsung will be changed from any
perspective that'll be hyper glaze to
the max they are sticking to their guns
with this and you know what it doesn't
seem to be heard in them too badly
they've already sold what 6 million of
these things is out that i read that
statistic right i have not read it but
that was in a cave in the past yeah they
said i think they've already now don't
quote me on this but i think they've
already sold six million and they're on
track to hit 10 million by the end of
May first you know would be amazing you
know with that if this SQ cover let you
see the time all the time oh yeah you
had mentioned that before so the S view
cover what it does is it lets a piece of
the display shines for the window and
that probably wouldn't eat up so much
battery life if just the time was
constantly displayed may be floating
yeah because it's you know it some mo
glad so each pixel is is lit
individually yeah so but I guess I guess
you know over the course of 18 hours
that's probably a good for twenty thirty
percent and and so while we're talking
about the what we're talking about the
galaxy s4 I want to talk about a variant
that was announced this week and this
can kind of segue us into the week's
news this is this it was a rumor that I
thought was complete BS it landed I
think the day before Google i/o which is
what we're going to start talking about
in a second
and it was a rumor of a Samsung made
well well a galaxy s4 running stock
Android and when this thing was
announced I don't know if you guys were
as surprised as I was I thought this
rumor was just bogus and then when it
landed when oh who had it on stage that
guy yeah Hugo how God him I'm sorry I'm
horrible with names right now I should
have known this before we went on the
air but anyway when that when that made
its debut and where was a samsung galaxy
s4 legit running stock Android I had an
array of mixed feelings just kind of
emanate from my soul I was excited and
then I didn't know why I was excited and
then it wasn't sure if I was excited you
felt that way when you learn that the
stork wasn't real I did I did when I
found out the truth about the Easter
Bunny I was crestfallen that so I want
to know how you guys felt about this and
particularly Tony because we talked
about this a little bit on our editorial
round table yesterday Toni was clicking
down by the event overall but I want to
know the one piece of hardware that
actually did come out of google i/o
smartphone hardware what do you think
about it and it's actually one of the
one of the two pieces of everything
would happen yesterday that I'm excited
about so first of all awesome things
Samsung is a power and Android and with
this google not only recognizes it but
they're giving them even more power but
i have a couple of questions nobody told
us the specs will this be the snapdragon
version will this be DX newest version
it's got a snapdragon if it is the
snapdragon version then all the rumors
regarding the no user no power user and
no heck ability friendly rumors will go
down the drain because one samsung
delivers a stock bootloader unlocked
galaxy s4 the community will just rip
off the rom maybe it will be even
published on google servers and
everybody could Nexus if I there s force
it's kind of it's so funny and that's
and that's already happening anyway I
mean people are unlocking the bootloader
Zaun their galaxy s4's and loading
custom roms but once this happens it's
going to be like a Samsung made stock
install of it with
with all the drivers in there and
everything in people is just everyone is
galaxy s4 they can you know get this
stuff done is gonna do it it is it was
Hugo Barra and it is the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 600 version so yeah um what
what what gets me going gets my flag
waving what is far wood wood wood was
your skirt up my skirt gets blown up
when I think about how the galaxy s4
with stock Android is gonna have and we
talked about the song imma hang oysters
gonna have better battery life and it's
going to be faster and so and that fixes
out that that fixes a lot of you know
the battery was already pretty good but
the lag issue it fixes that so it I
think for some people it's gonna get
them closer to two preferring to have it
you're the one i think it's going to be
a really tough sell for most regular
folks at six forty nine ninety nine it's
so expensive and if it is hugely
expanded and it's so funny to see google
kind of vacillate brazenly between these
things like we saw the nexus 4 launched
last year at this obscenely low price
point you know which was a result of
some compromise but still you it's a
very high quality smartphone for a very
low price and then you see this device
which is of course also a very high
quality smartphone but had astronomical
price do you guys think that google is
training us to accept a higher price for
the next Nexus I don't know if I you
know no I think they're so inconsistent
it's impossible to predict I think what
they're going to do with their hard work
I don't think it's it's the case I think
this move with the galaxy s4 is this
this particular version is a pseudo
Nexus it's a combination of a nexus and
the galaxy s4 developer edition
obviously samsung wouldn't and it's
logical they don't want to cut the price
because they want to gain some money out
of this and google also wants to push
the nexus brand forward so i guess that
this was such a decision that will
probably benefit both sides but still
whenever the nexus the next Nexus comes
we'll see the same price point the same
tooth to to sound the same love to 300
yeah no really no
another another interesting piece here
is that they're doing the unlocked LTE
thing I did I was just thinking that
that's nice yeah and it's and it's it's
you know team is it's got a lot of bands
in there a lot of bands because it's got
to do it's got to do 2g 3G and 4G /
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T been so this thing is
is jacked up very versatile hardware
yeah that that's one of the things that
makes it appealing to me I just think
it's going to be so interesting to get
our hands on this and to you know not
that you can't do it right now like
Brandon you said before yes you can run
a galaxy s4 right now with stock Android
and you know that's not an impossibility
but to do it in a sanctioned manner to
do it fully supported to have it come
out of the box powered on and see stock
Android load it is sweet right it's an
entirely different experience to because
as I said on the Hangout and that'll be
the last time I say that um we are have
been trained by Samsung over the
generations of galaxies products to see
to expect to see less and less Android
more and more touch with yeah and the
end and also open another benefit here
is that it's going to get key lime pie
when the nexus 4 is getting q I'm pie
when the Galaxy Nexus is getting key
lime pie so it's a little bit future
prepare in that respect right right
whereas the hardware to last in a while
it's got awesome hardware and and it's
unlike the galaxy s4 which probably will
get the next version of android sometime
in the next five years you know yeah
well it's uh it's it's definitely going
to be interesting to see I think we can
say without a doubt that we are going to
grab one right we're gonna we're going
to be given this one the review
treatment we're gonna grab the crap out
of one good good then let's talk about
the rest of i/o briefly we did cover
this a lot kind of already and I I do I
am a little more interested in moving on
to nokia but we do have to touch on I'm
kind of the rest of this what was the
most exciting thing I'll ask you first
Brandon for you from yesterday is in
terms of the in terms of the longest
keynote in history you know Google I I
think yesterday was very interesting for
like the futurist for the for the guy
that really likes this idea of
a changing society brought on by
technology you know they were talking
about you know self-driving cars in the
evolution of maps and you know they were
took they had this whole section on new
web compression technologies that
promote YouTube which presumably might
fix the buffering issue on YouTube
they're talking about new image
compression technologies which might
make every web page load faster might
make our data bills lower travelzoo ways
to make animated gifts uh yeah it's the
best part they were talking about
machine learning of um again we talked
about the sister on the Hangout about
identifying what it is that makes a
picture beautiful and letting a machine
do that for you and they know Google
Plus now has all of these quick enhanced
features that are above and beyond all
of the quick and hand stuff that we know
about today so I thought it was very
fascinating for me as far as the actual
unique things that were announced I've
been messing her out around with this
google music all access thing trying to
figure out if it can pull me away from
Spotify um and what's the verdict do you
have one else I don't have one yet hi
I'm so like I mean it's the same thing
with when the move from one platform to
another if you're if you're on a phone
operating system meet you got all your
stuff all your experience is on all your
playlist they're all on the old thing
and then you gotta figure out a way to
transfer them and decide how to live
with this new thing right but um well
there was also the enhancements to to
voice search google now and i was using
some of that in the airport today was
picking up some friends from out of town
and I was just like you know I haven't
really been able to talk to Google now
like a person like I could talk to Siri
let me just try this I'm like hey we're
you know ok Google where is flight and
2486 and it's like oh here's your flight
information oh my god all right thank
you I didn't just I didn't have to talk
at it like a robot like I was typing
into a Google search bar so how else can
you interact with Google now that's
different than I'll for the update then
I followed that up with a query about
because I wanted to go get breakfast I
was like hey how early is the friendly
toast open and it got a lot I was all
suppose I don't want to go to that right
well then when does the rosebud
diner open and that it and understood
all that sentence wise so it did it did
nicely but we have a flip side of the
coin so brandon i'm in your boat i am a
futurist obviously I'm so you know been
watching Star Trek since I was 7 i'm in
love with the future and that this
concept of of enhanced computing in our
lives going forward Michael so in love
with the future that he hates the
present it is true i'm also in love with
the past though but in relation to
anything but the present but tony has a
different perspective because tony was
really looking forward to hardware at
this event and I think his position is
not at all unsympathetic I definitely
wanted a nexus 7 follow-on but Tony what
was your biggest disappointment from the
show not necessarily hardware I was
hoping or waiting for a new update for
android wetter that was four two three
four dot 35.1 75 point 55 I don't care
that's what I wanted I was excited about
two things the AOSP galaxy s4 and google
music but google music alexis is at the
same time a disappointment for me
because i cannot use it in my region so
it's not available here now yesterday
you and jaime were talking about that
brother extensively nuts it's just a
show google hasn't gotten a hold on the
global released i cast her yesterday
when i said that i was disappointed by
the google i/o event I've been receiving
tons and truckloads a flagman I've been
wiping my face off ever since but I'm
just that kind of guy I'm not taking
back my words I'm still disappointed in
google and whatever i said yesterday
still stands because and here's the
argument i give arguments unlike those
who just contradict me without arguments
for me as a user it doesn't bring
anything new to the way I interact with
my android phone I am not using google
now because it is not available in its
entirety in my region I am not using
google play Alexis because it's not
available I don't care about swiping off
a facebook Messenger notification on my
galaxy s4 and it's wipes off on my HTC
One so it's just the minor things I
don't care about uploading pictures to
my Google+ and had them automatically
get my black spots or myself in my skin
these are just minor things and I think
people shouldn't settle for such minor
things see i think so i think they're
major things if you're if you're
invested if you're both your developer
it yes well no no i mean if you're a
customer who is invested in google's
ecosystem and also lives in an inner
region where all the stuff is
implemented one hundred percent I think
that's the difference and I think it's
important to get your your perspective
hi mates perspective other people who
are in markets where this stuff is not
going to launch for a long time or may
never see the light of day you know it's
important to remember that that the
world is very different depending on
where you live in terms of Technology
Center me a company's ability to roll it
out you conclude don't get me wrong and
not be the one who says no to everything
I'm excited but the level of expectation
and the level of google i/o versus the
level of excitement brought by the
announcement is is there's a huge
discrepancy as I mentioned yesterday if
all these would have been announced via
a press release nobody would have cared
maybe the galaxy s4 maybe the s4 an AOSP
version I would have wanted to do a
video on all the new features i would
have been woulda still been impressed
but then again i'm a futurist right so
this is why i think that there's I under
I understand exact were coming from and
I you know I think if I think that the
keynote was so different to me i was
watching the the twitter feed and
everyone everyone even the veterans have
been reporting on this stuff for ages
like you guys was commenting on the
length of this keynote and i think it
was very different this year i think the
pace of reveals was slower it was a
trickle of stuff but I kind of liked it
because they would jump from something
like the the bombastic galaxy s4 Google
addition to something to like do 45
minutes on coding stuff and you know
back in messaging services and I'm like
okay oh my god I'm phone asleep and then
they would come back and they'd be like
oh no but look we made you to look at
the voice improvements like how cool and
then they dive into something else I
didn't care about then they'd come back
so it was well paced for me was like a
like a well-paced evening out on the
town I enjoyed the following it so I
don't know I i think that there's going
to be a lot to report on
moving forward from from google and of
course that's always been the case but a
lot of this new stuff is going to
enhance the user experience for a great
many Android users and I think that's a
good thing and of course that the
elephant in the room is that there's no
new version of Android not even a small
version update for daddy which was
leaked in the logs right sort out
through which is leaking lock so we were
pretty sure that we'd see a 4 dots 3
which it sounds like 4.3 will be an
update to Nexus devices to enable
low-power Bluetooth among a couple of
other things so just like just like
point2 or yeah yeahs point2 at point
three is going to be a small update not
many devices are going to get it and
well you know this the five point 0 is
coming they're not going to do a 4.4 or
4.6 or something they're gonna go to 5.5
point 0 when they release the new Nexus
hardware in the in the future yeah until
we see a until we get a paparazzi shot
of a construction truck offloading a
giant fiberglass key lime pie on
Google's lon I'm not going to get
excited of them can we just purchased
for fun I killed can we each have a
prediction of what key lime pie will
bring yeah um as long in one condition
i'm not i'm not gonna go first okay
don't you I go first no I don't want to
go at all uh fine I will go first to get
yogurt and maybe last um I think I think
I think holo UI introduced in an ice
cream sandwich which once was a sort of
revolution in UI design it was flat it
was efficient it was pretty is getting
stale and I think that they I think it
was gonna go in the other direction a
little bit it's gonna get a little bit
more Flair a little bit more textured
colorful um a cut like a little bit
closer to where senses I think just just
not you know sense 5 is so like it works
for everyone because it's it's flat it's
gray it doesn't get in the way I think
they're gonna get a little closer to
that to a new UI paradigm
you know they fix the speed thing in
jelly bean and I think they're gonna
have some further performance
enhancements maybe finally you know
fantastic support for multi-core
processors maybe some some battery
technology that that happens at the
kernel level to really save on on power
somehow um why are you just like blowing
through every prediction possible this
would be the best version of Android
ever well since you guys aren't gonna go
I do at least three I wasn't gonna go
I'd see what do you think so it's
interesting I don't I don't um I don't
agree with that that hollow is getting
stale I think that you know if you've
been looking at it for a long time if
you've had a device running stock
Android for a long time and maybe you're
you know you could be tired of it I get
that but I think hollow is still quite
futuristic looking I think in some ways
it's more advanced looking than even the
modern UI on Windows Phone which at one
time was like beyond futuristic to MIT
to my eyes it is it I don't and I don't
see Matias Duarte deviating from that
you know he's still the head of Android
design he's still got a very
straightforward idea for what what the
visual language of Android is and what
it's going to be I think we might see
some brightening in fact because look at
the direction the rest of Google is
going be a Play Store and email bright
white white white white every with it
they're caught it's like I think it's
called car DUI it's gonna be awesome for
AMOLED screens I was just Tony I was
just thinking the same thing I'm like
man while you were just gonna blow
through battery life a ton more although
I don't know when the last time someone
was someone ran a test to see just how
much battery life is saved by by black
screens and you eyes and AMOLED screens
but i don't know i am I looking forward
to this possible possibility of a bright
white future for Android not really i
don't think it looks i'm not saying it
looks bad but when I happen to Google
now it is a little jarring it's like wow
this is really white you know if you're
in a dim room or you're in a restaurant
you're like hey Google now and it's like
yes and just affects your eyeballs I'm
like oh my god so I it would be
interesting if key lime pie introduced
some UI customization like you know how
on Windows Phone you can switch it from
white to black
and backward on the home screen yeah
that would be cool that would be cool &amp;amp;
E and the OEM could say okay we're
shipping an AMOLED display here we're
gonna do the black theme right oh yeah
but I think customers should always be
able to toggle it left or right any
west's customer should always have the
choice but we don't see that happening
too much that's true that's true
especially once the carrier's get
involved as we saw with that galaxy s4
setting thing before before we move on
to to Windows Phone do we have a closing
thoughts on on google i/o I will go
first and I will go last I I knew
somebody under Tony wasn't good i I
thought Tony might bite on that one I
know I'm sorry I was I was just uh I was
yeah can you please repeat the question
sure I was just one question was
actually this is how much wood could a
woodchuck chuck info which I could chuck
wood a lot yeah all right you're right i
think which is improvement were wilson
answer that yeah you think we should
move on I never move on good because I
want to hear this story because this is
something we haven't really talked about
we talked a lot about IO yesterday and
this big deal but before that happened
we had a big announcement from windows
phone maker nokia they had a big event
in london Tony you were there in the
flesh and we have seen the results of
that we've seen the Nokia Lumia 925 see
the light at no actually that was the
Lumia 920's oh man we saw that launch
and we saw a little bit more on the 928
so we saw some great videos from Tony
and but we haven't heard about the event
itself so time to tell us what it was
like what the atmosphere was like as
Stephen Elop did not do the presentation
so what was the energy like I mean to
just just take us through that story man
for me the most disappointing thing was
that Elop was not there and while I was
standing outside a Victoria house I met
this awesome guy his name is Beorn big
fraud League force he's the global
events director at nokia and we had a
nice chat and it just so happens that
this victoria house is just across the
cross the road from the hilton and I was
just fooling around and asking beer now
so he loves gonna cross the street and
get in the back door
and if it was like you know will he lops
not gonna be really here but he's gonna
be here in a way and I was thinking okay
the man's busy he's gonna be patched in
through skype or for something and have
a short message for everybody who was in
the audience and so I'm pursuing this
idea so yeah he's going to be like well
not really in a way so it turns out that
that particular way in which Elop was
there was at one point when they
demonstrated the camera features and
especially nakia steak on drama shot the
the entire background the entire screen
and projection was was a a crowd and
within that crowd there was a lapse
picture who was just cheering and that
was elapsed presence and there was a lot
of speculation why he lap was not there
some said that he's one foot out nakia
because of the recent developments with
the board of directors some others said
that the 925 is not that of an important
device so that Elop should be there I
don't know so for me the biggest
disappointment was that and yeah and the
second one it's always nice to see him
right i mean like no Elop is is a great
mentation given he's the first presenter
in mobile tech yeah he's really really
good he puts on a nice show without
being flashy he's honest he's
straightforward he's clear it's got a
good voice really nice and he does i
really like when a pony proceed yeah
yeah the second disappointment and i've
been i've been following nokia ever
since they announced their strategic
alliance with microsoft in 2011 at the
mwc and then they back to room with more
than a thousand people and then in 12
2012 they had a smaller room maybe up to
5 600 people and then in 2013 this year
michael you can testify to this i'm not
sure we were more than 400 people yeah
and at this event in particular I i
would say 200 300 people so the the
grandeur the the size of announcements
and events is just continuously
decreasing and I don't know why why
Nokia is going this route because the
all the keywords in the presentation was
that the most advanced smart phone of
the world got even better this is the
Lumia 925 so for that for that pompous
grandis words and tagline you need to
show some power and nakia is doing the
exact opposite here's the most advanced
smartphone of the world oh there's 200
people in the audience yeah I bit and
and so I think I think the reason behind
that or one of them is something that a
lot of commenters have mentioned you
know if you think of the 925 less as the
next evolution and you kind of dismiss a
lot of the Pampas this is stuff that
nokia has to put out there to make it
the announcement worthy it's basically a
924 you know it's basically a 920
refresh for other carriers right with a
couple improvements just to keep the
line fresh it's kind of like the HTC one
x+ was to the HTC One X right yeah
Sturgis just a mid-cycle refresh to get
people re-enter ested a little bit but
not too interested right not too much
yeah exactly because you get a whole
bunch of people to buy into this and
then when you launch the EOS whatever
that is in the fall I don't upset
there's a problem right why didn't you
tell me yeah so that aside I was I was
happy that Nokia brought a lot of
devices to play with they had actually
three or four sections each of them
dedicated to one specific feature of the
phone one section was featuring two
skateboarders who were just going up and
down at half pipe and you could use the
drama shot feature to test the Lumia 925
against your phone the HTC one with the
Zoe or the s4 with a drama shot then
there were some dark rooms for for
low-light imagery and photography then
there were different stands where you
could see different features of the
phone so yeah that that part was was
awesome yes so they've added this sixth
lens to the to the the sixth element to
the camera assembly right I didn't know
that there were five before yeah I had
forgotten that there were five i mean i
think it was Apple that made the biggest
amount of noise about a five-element
lens it with the iphone 4 yes yes yes
that's understand right but then okay I
think they were more when they launched
the 920 I think there were more focused
on talking up the optical image
stabilization but apparently the sixth
the sixth lens on this element I'm
getting on my terminology wrong but this
sixth edition
it brings some real improvements in
terms of according to the conversations
by Nokia blog some natural details it
improves low-light performance and
improves colour reproduction and it does
a little bit better as far as brightness
control and Tony were you able to take
any shots like what did you do any of
these comparisons I had made shots but I
couldn't compare them to the Lumia 920
and that was the main thing I wanted to
do because at that point in time we had
three Lumia 920's really the 920 which
is on AT&amp;amp;T the 928 which will come soon
to verizon and the 925 for t-mobile and
the rest of the world so I was normally
fishing for that comparison I don't care
about the 925 versus the HTC One or the
s4 because they're not directly
competing but the 925 as it is now it is
directly competing with the 920 so well
I couldn't manage after we go I mean
speaking to that point about about
comparisons I you know I think it does I
when we do comparison videos this has
been very annoying to me because I've
been one doing the comparisons because
I'm the only one on the team besides I
think adam lane with a Lumia 920 so
whenever I do comparisons I'm always
doing like HTC One okay HTC one vs
galaxy s4 HTC one vs for iphone 5 and
Brandon that was you HTC one vs Lumia
920 mmm the 920 is the oldest phone it's
always is consistently the oldest phone
in the comparison video lineup that
doesn't hold up against the iphone 5 but
it does against other Android devices in
particular so it's been really annoying
to have to like em like I you know take
into account the the fact that the 920
is in a lot of ways like a last
generation device so it's it's nice to
see the 925 a 928 kind of updated a
little bit so that when we get it in
here it's like okay this is the latest
from Nokia maybe it's not a blockbuster
but it is the latest from Nokia and now
we can compare the latest from Nokia
against the latest from Samsung's and
that is correct and apparently according
to nokia every iteration of the 92
family the 92 x family is a step up and
the question the answer which i was
fishing for and i finally managed to get
it
how is the 925 better in terms of camera
than the 928 and the 920 and of course
there's the sixth lens and some software
improvements and as i learned nokia is
tricky we got the Xenon flash on the 928
nozzle which is awesome and it should be
standard on all phones well why do you
think it's not if it uses off I got an
answer for that too but it's it's an
unofficial answer so I'm not gonna say
who told me that but the 920 is the 920
as we know it the 928 has the same
sensor the same lens construction and
the same software but it has a xenon
flash so overall it is a step up from
the 920 now with the 925 it has the same
sensor but the sixth lens camera system
but it has a dual LED flash so as
interns there's a flash it is a step
down but in terms of the entire imaging
system it's a step up so they're trying
to balance things so that when you draw
the line the difference is minor between
nine right right because I was it was a
simple question why doesn't the 925 have
a xenon flash and the answer was while
we're trying to balance it out you know
cuz the Xenon flash is on the 928 yeah
but that's got five lines to
construction yeah but you know on the
overall they're approximately at the
same level so I'm not sure what you're
doing there but to quote we love all of
our children the same way yeah yeah
that's that's like one of the best
corporate canned responses every that's
like um it's like here's this really
generic analogy will you go with us on
this no okay we're gonna say it anyway I
but so I didn't get to say this when we
talked about this briefly yesterday or
whenever it was I think that xenon flash
is a really cool thing I really also
though think on devices like this and
I'm not a pro photographer I don't think
they're necessary I think that I I
always turn the flash off the only time
you know the only time I turn the flash
on my smartphone is to demo the flash
for a video I'm shooting for pocket now
I never use it in ordinary circumstances
because the low-light performance is so
good on the 920 and the HTC One so if
there's not enough light to make a make
for a good low-light photo
there's not enough light to have a photo
in my shooting yeah but then shooting in
low light always always induces some
noise but if you have a xenon flash
which is a powerful flash and you have
that setting where where you not only
blank out the background but you have
kept your capturing the light from the
background to with your subject being
well lit with the Xenon flash that's the
perfect low light shot yeah I saw you
use it to great effect with your 808 and
yeah Barcelona so yeah I don't know I'd
then you know what let me know when I
can when I can really rent about 925
well I actually that's what I was going
to ask you about peace so we've talked
about the event itself what do we think
about the device itself we have this
kind of weird hybrid aluminum
polycarbonate Frankenstein I don't think
you understand then I'll help out put
the full stuff at all right I'll drop
mine mine and their first I I've said
this before but I don't think it looks
as good as the 920 I think the 920 has a
really nice cohesive design philosophy
driving it we have that elongated very
very nokia camera bezel that elongated
pill shaped thing and nothing else on
the back there's no the perforations for
the speaker which are required are on
the bottom edge of the 920 so they're
hidden you know it's a it's a very
intelligently designed device to me the
925 looks like it looks like a prototype
version of the 920 it looks like the
thing you show to the press and the
customers to say look what we're working
on and this is going to get even better
it doesn't look like a follow-on to the
920 it looks like a step back in my
opinion even though the aluminum is
pretty cool that's that's where i'm
sitting from a hardware perspective how
about you Brandon I think it's a nice
there was a funny sound I think it's a
nice middle ground between between
plastic and and metal so you get kind of
the best of both worlds because you know
sometimes metal isn't as grippy as as
like a good soft touch plastic true and
so you kind of get both here and I
really like that yeah I like that too i
wrote an article to that effect i wrote
that oh wait I did that wasn't it was
like wait a minute do we have a
duplicate what about you Tony so listen
to this guy's
this is the sound of metal Tony SR
appropriate to do press our breasts tags
our name tags were aluminum pieces so it
was a slab of aluminum on which it was
written your name and the company or the
output you're working for a nice touch
and at that point plus with all the
rumors of a aluminum phone everybody was
excited of course we're going to see the
aluminum Nokia and then the presenters
came on stage and they were having a how
should I say this they were praising
aluminum as a material that it is a
awesome conductor it is an awesome
antenna and if I recall well whenever
Apple came out with a full aluminum
construction everybody was like you
cannot be plastic and even nokia was
like polycarbonate is the best antenna
ever that's where week anyway damage
control yeah anyways so I was naturally
expecting a phone which is completely
made out of aluminum as an HTC One as an
iphone 5 yeah a lot of people were and
and it's the reality is that there is
probably visible to the eye like five
percent of the phone which is aluminum
because just the outer rim and the sides
of the phone are aluminum the back is
the slimiest feeling polycarbonate ever
I just saw I thought of a soft touch you
know it is it is like you know the
feeling when you touch a glass yeah it
is exactly like that ah so it's very
very non textured at all so I was ok
what's all the hype about the aluminum
film because this is not an aluminum
phone an aluminum phone is the HTC One
an aluminum phone is the iphone 5 so
just don't make such a huge fuss about
it just say okay we've introduced
aluminum but we're still keeping the
black cover number two nokia was saying
that all the colors in the lumia range
are awesome and that that's the
signature for lumia phones and we got
two or three flavors black silver and
white from the Lumia 925 point nobody
understood and okay I can agree to that
why don't we have a removable back cover
with the Lumia colors right why don't we
have a removable back cover which also
includes the Qi wireless charging
standard why do I have to purchase a
super ugly super thick and super
inconvenient cover for it to work it's
not even a cover it's like a sled it
Out's terrible yes or slapping thing
yeah I am and it's thick Brenda this
thing you sent over was this is a render
I any when you were I was out searching
for an image of the 925 listeners i just
sent Michael a picture and Tony of what
it what I think Michael wish would have
been the 925 which is kind of a slender
version of the 920 that kind of has the
same aesthetic but but is cooler yeah
you know in its funny Tony you were
mentioning like why not why not have a
removable battery when I first saw the
images of the real 925 with that
isolated polycarbonate back I thought
that was a removable cover I thought oh
okay well it's a little ugly but at
least we're getting a removable battery
and there's also a gap so you you'd be
tempted to think that you can remove
that at one point because since is not a
unibody construction there's a small gap
between the aluminum which comes from
the sides and the plastic polycarbonate
on the back right number three the shade
the color differs from the black
aluminum on the sides to the black
plastic on the back it differs from the
silver aluminum on the sides to the
silver aluminum on the back so you get
two different shades of color which
doesn't look that that good it's more
visible in the silver version and if you
guys seen the video you know what I'm
talking about yeah another white one is
is white poly carbon on the back and
alumina on the side and I think that's
the sharpest looking one of the bunch i
think that one looks pretty good but it
is it am i right in thinking that the
front side of the device is not white as
well and the white one like isn't it
aren't they all black on the face
because it's it's the glass itself yeah
well the enemies the display is always
back but there's a like the bezels black
to the bezel yeah the bezel is always a
little bit black too and it's just
there's a little bit of aluminum which
comes from the rounded sides going
bracing a little bit front from the
front but it's not visible from every
angle reminds me it reminds me the
iphone 3g and 3gs remember we all had
the black face plate but then the some
of them had the white back right and i'm
remembering that right right mmm yeah I
was too young then thanks um so yeah so
that's the 925 is good to get it wait in
an also final thing and I don't need to
go into the wireless charging i wrote a
whole article about how i was annoyed
that they omitted wireless charging i
think that's not the way to go it mainly
though i think i was mainly mad because
it's hurting the standard because nokia
was the big champion it was like we're
gonna do wireless charging on the 920
it's a flagship thing it's like yes
finally wireless charging is getting its
day in the sun and then you know for the
next iteration so like yeah maybe maybe
not well for the record they went or at
least i've been told that they went this
way because they wanted to keep the 925
as thin and as light as possible right
now because they got it is about how
heavy and tank like the 920 is so the
925 is extremely thin and extremely
light not to the point of inconsistency
but so unlike a 920 yeah well it'll be
interesting to get these in our hands
Tony as I recall we have some 925 not 28
units coming our way yeah that's good
ice oh yeah I miss windows phone 8 I
like I wanted to ask you and I guess I
asked 22 at the last time I used windows
phone was at the end of last year with
the 8x and I had a lot of trouble with
it because it didn't have apps that I
really needed like Spotify which I
understand is has been there for months
yeah and Mike are there any apps left
that you really wish we were in the
Windows Phone episode from Instagram I
was gonna say with the new Instagram
yeah uh you know most of my app needs I
think it's a matter of perspective
because i have been using the blackberry
z10 again for the past couple days and
wow another topic we'll get there yeah
and well I really actually I've been
enjoying that experience a lot more than
I anticipated even though I liked it on
the first pass I didn't expect to like
it as much on this return but I really
like it and the problem is there that
app ecosystem regardless of the big
numbers they're thrown around it just
doesn't have what I
it's not a good fit for me because it
doesn't have things i use constantly
you're talking about blackberry I'm
talking my blackberry now this gives me
the perspective to say when I hop on to
my 920 when i take a break from the
blackberry and i switched to my
nighttime phone my 920 i've got almost
all the apps i need if instagram was
there i would be almost one hundred
percent content and despite the figure
the the growth slowing that we're seeing
on Windows Phones app store I think it's
in a really good position let me ask
most people will be able to find what
they need good I'm ask you guys question
ask something that was mentioned at the
i/o keynote yesterday I forgot by whom
was that Google believes in the future
where developers make a one version of
their software and it runs on every
device and they don't need to do this
crap where they have different SDKs
different api's I'm not necessarily
api's but the SDKs do you guys think
that that's a feasible future and I'm
not talking about building html5 apps in
the browser cuz that's lame sauce with
do you think one day a developer can sit
down write one app and have it run on
everything one day yes I think so
because the more I think about it the
more I look at this stuff the more I'm
convinced that while there may not be
room for five or six platforms there's
definitely not Oh the future is not a
one platform future and I don't even
think it's a 2 platform future I think I
think people are diverse enough and have
different enough tastes to want
different user experiences and but they
also want the same apps across all those
all those platforms so yeah I think one
day that could be feasible what do you
think Tony I am hoping for it but I am
skeptical because it is against what
these companies are all about nobody and
I'm talking about Apple Google and
Microsoft they are the leaders now and
of course let's include blackberry too
they don't have an interest in having
you as a developer work only once for
all the ecosystems they are fighting to
have as many developers as necessary on
their side on their team there they're
competing in download numbers in revenue
numbers in numbers of developers
developers and if this would have if
this would happen that I could write a
code once and use it on all platforms
this will completely dilute and cancel
this competition between them it's
interesting yeah it's and i'm not
convinced i have enough insight into the
developer world to offer any more
insight i just think we need to keep an
eye on what's going on and since
interestingly it's very interesting to
me that windows phone's app numbers are
such are in flux or the app growth rate
and i think that the windows phone is
going to kind of be the one of the
Canaries in the coal mine as far as
developer attitudes toward less popular
platforms but I'm not worried about it
I'm just saying we should keep an eye on
stuff but ever since we talked about the
the Instagram application I've been
trying to find the the name of the
application but my sclerosis is kicking
in so nokia announced an application
which will come exclusively to Windows
Phone and it is only available on iOS
it's a camera application I'm sorry I
don't remember it and that with that
application it's Hamlin's no no no it's
an act like I don't know paper camera
hence the camera whatever I can't
remember it and with that application
you can share to Instagram yeah yeah
yeah if it for Windows Phone only right
it's yes yeah I know what you made it in
they use some kind of back-end way to do
it without using instagrams if you guys
are something like that like it's some
weird hack that is not chancing right
it's not against the terms of service we
can't answer Brendan's question just
quickly they announced it 145,000
applications in the Windows Phone store
and this is crazy to think that
blackberry just announced 120,000 and
they've been around for two years less
or two years fewer right blackberry 10
rather yeah yeah but at same time
windows phone has much more as a much
more compelling catalog but we'll talk
about that next week we said this was
going to be a short episode and we
covered what we want to cover and we've
got to go we've got to get to other
tasks writing articles for you listeners
making videos and so on so we're going
to take off and that's going to do it
