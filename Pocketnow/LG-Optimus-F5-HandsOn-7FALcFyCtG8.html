pocketnow.com michael behind a camera
still with LG lots of phones here and
now we're taking a look at the LG
optimus f5 so what we have here is
basically a mid-range phone towards
budget phone the entire f plan is aimed
towards that we have a 4 x 3 inch IPS
qhd display we have an earpiece on top
with the sensors the webcam and we have
the android home button back button and
menu button the display on the design
and the entire language is very much
like the LG optimus g pro its following
that trend let's take a look on the side
we have a power button right here with
nothing else on this right side of the
phone we have a 5 megapixel camera on
the back with no LED flash unfortunately
this is a speaker rule which is
currently covered by this LG seal which
charges the phone towards the microSD
slot there's a microphone on the back
and we have a power we have a volume
rocker for volume up and volume down 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and a
secondary microphone on top of it now in
terms of software we have android 4.1
without geez proprietary user interface
and there are still a couple of features
from the LG Optimus optimus g pro which
are present on this like be a few slight
applications which allow you to have
multiple applications being displayed at
the same time for instance we have
calculator you've seen this in our
previous video we can also have your
memo application which is right there
you can see multiple windows and you can
take a memo and if you want to annotate
something you just have to go to quick
memo and you'll be able to memorize
something using your finger as a stylist
if you want to have that on board you
just press the button and it will stick
right there so that much about the LG
optimus f5 it is a sweet phone we're not
sure if it's going to be a huge
blockbuster just wasn't on front pocket
not a thumb Michael Fisher behind a
camera still with LG lots of more phones
to go through thank you very much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
