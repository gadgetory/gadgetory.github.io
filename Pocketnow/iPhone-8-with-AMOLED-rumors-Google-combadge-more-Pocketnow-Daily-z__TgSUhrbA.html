display begin to emerge Google's Nexus
6p microphone issues seem to be a little
more complicated than expected and
Google seems to be building more and
more Star Trek like wearables I'm high
Meadow iveta and believe it or not but I
ran out of Tuesday jokes suggestions are
accepted in the comments this is parking
out daily the official list today begin
with the Samsung gear s2 yes this eres
tu as the company is pushing a major
upgrade to its software bringing some
functionality that'll actually put it on
par with what other smartwatches gonna
do by for example giving you a
persistent notifications indicator which
is currently not available in addition
to also letting you know whenever you're
far away from your phone and also adding
some added functionality to a rotating
bezel whenever you want to launch
applications a this update should reach
of smartwatches either today or tomorrow
and then we've got a bevy of Google News
and let's begin with the security
department for those of you that are
certain that your smartphone is secure
meaning that if somebody steals your
smartphone and your information is there
lock you won't have to worry about it it
kind of depends as we just learned from
a police department in new york city
that well if the police required google
to unlock your phone and well if this
phone is running anything below lollipop
and is not encrypted it seems that it's
very simple for google to do so this is
rather interesting news there's a full
link in the description and an article
with details on what exactly who can do
in other google news if you're noticing
a very odd issue in your nexus 6p
whenever you're on speakerphone and
people tell you that you sound weird you
just don't sound at all it seems that it
has to do with the noise cancellation
microphone on the phone again it seems
that google has just detected this
problem they are apparently working on
the issue they haven't confirmed they're
going to send a software update or
whatever but yeah it seems that you're
not alone in this department and
probably we should see if fix coming
soon and remember those rumors of the
iphone in the future rocking an AMOLED
panel because they're working with
Samsung start with the Apple watch and
then in the future with a probable
iphone yeah there were other rumors
claiming that Apple and Fox
working on an LCD facility which means
that yeah they're pretty much tied to
lcds for the next few years but we've
got other trusted sources claiming that
yes Apple and Samsung are working
together on a probable future AMOLED
display for an iphone apparently the
only ball is that it'll have to wait for
2018 and given the fact that 20 18 is
actually an S cycle meaning it's
actually not a brand new iphone we're
kind of skeptical if that's going to
happen but hey let's see and finally for
the very hot news today we return to
Google as we just learned today that the
company is working on its own kompas
wearable or combi chai well it's a badge
that you wear on your chest or anywhere
above your waist and the idea here is
that just like in Star Trek well you
could press it and it'll actually
trigger you to be able to talk to
somebody and well this is a really neat
wearable it's neat idea connects through
bluetooth to your phone or whatever it's
not really something that'll be a phone
on its own but it's pretty much a
different concept for a radio we should
say just like you saw in star trekkin so
many other movies but it doesn't mean to
the question of the day do you see any
future this product do you think that
you know people will actually care about
it because in my case I don't
particularly because this is pretty much
just another bluetooth headset only it's
a bluetooth speaker sure saying just you
hang it on your chest but hey leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
what you think because the two headsets
aren't being very popularly so right now
at least not the ones that are not
stereo friends yes you know the drill if
you want to get the dozer earlier before
this video was filming sure you follow
us on pacquiao comment subscribe trying
to channel as well it followed me on
twitter hi mauja skory better aren't
