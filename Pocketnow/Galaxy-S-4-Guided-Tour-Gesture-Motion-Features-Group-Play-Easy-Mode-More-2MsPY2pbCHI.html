galaxy s4 and a bunch of comparison
videos so you know how we feel about the
device but we haven't gotten to show you
all of the features Samsung is packed
into its new flagship so let's remedy
that I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow
and this is your guided tour of the
special features of the Samsung Galaxy
s4
now we've already covered some of the
more visible features like s-health in
our full review at pocketnow.com and you
should follow us on social media if you
don't want to miss future galaxy s4
features and videos if you don't see a
feature you were expecting to see in
this video
odds are it's in our full review or in
one of our comparison videos so check
those out also we're not covering all
the features that were introduced in
last year's Galaxy s3
again check out our earlier articles and
videos for that first up a correction I
erroneously claimed that air view was
buggy on the galaxy s4 but it turns out
I was just using it incorrectly hovering
your finger over text in the messaging
app will provide a preview only of text
that extends beyond the window so short
messages will not produce a bubble
that's a little inconsistent I don't
really like it
but it makes sense the bottom line is I
got that wrong and I apologize it works
as it should there are many more exotic
features than just air view in the
Galaxy s4
we talked a little about how its
companion feature air gesture is too
buggy for its own good
in our review but we didn't elaborate on
how many features it actually contains
under the air gestures submenu are a
series of toggles that allow you to
control what the feature does and
doesn't do the first is quick glance a
very smart addition which lets you wave
at the device to display the date/time
and missed notifications the next air
jump lets you scroll webpages in the
browser with the wave over the gesture
sensor air browse is familiar from our
testing in the gallery but it also
allows you to change the currently
playing music track with a wave which is
cool air move is definitely the most
convoluted way we've ever seen to move
an icon from one homescreen to another
but it works if you've kept your kung-fu
training up to date finally there's air
call except which
to pick up the phone by you guessed it
waving over the sensor you also have the
option to start the call right in
speakerphone mode which is logical for
those wondering where the gesture sensor
is that enables all this action Samsung
has provided a little information on
that as well say what you will about the
company it sure does a good job of
educating you on how to use its features
as a little nugget of hardware info here
we should also mention that you can use
the Galaxy S force display through thin
gloves or as in our example through
light fabric that might matter a lot to
you folks in colder climes but keep in
mind that thicker gloves still won't
work the motion menu has definitely been
cleaned up a bit compared to its earlier
incarnation on the note 2 and we have an
interesting mix of familiar and new
features here direct call is still here
one of our favorite features that allows
you to switch from a text exchange to a
phone call just by putting the phone to
your ear smart alert has also made the
cut
detecting when you pick up the phone and
buzzing you with a little vibration to
let you know you have notifications
waiting
there's also zoom which lets you press 2
thumbs to an image and say the gallery
and tilt the device to push in or expand
a feature whose forebears we remember
from the old Samsung instinct way back
in 2008 there's also the pan feature
which uses the accelerometer to let you
look around inside a photo as if you
were standing at the center of it I'm
not sure why you'd want to do that but
it's a fun toy to use once finally the
old turnover to mute functionality has
made its return a very handy feature
that lets you silence a ringer or audio
track quickly and which probably works
better if you're not using the flip
cover a quick note while we're talking
phone calls Samsung has retained its
reject list functionality which is a
lifesaver if you're constantly getting
her ranked by spam calls like this one
this is a spam number it and others like
it make your life harder add them to
your reject list excellent I've really
really been needing to reduce my pay
alone oh thank
so much for calling the last of the
special Samsung gesture inputs that
we'll mention in this section is palm
gestures which let you initiate a screen
capture with a xerox like sweep of the
hand and it also lets you mute or pause
audio by pressing your hand on the
screen during playback hopping over into
the smart screen category we see some
old favorites like smart stay and smart
rotation and Samsung continues its full
disclosure approach by letting you know
about every possible condition that
could make these features not work it's
great that Samsung does this but with so
many issues you start to wonder why the
features were included in the first
place but we already mentioned that in
our review so let's move on smart pause
is one of the newer features the company
played up in the galaxy s4 announcement
it's supposed to pause a video you're
playing in the stock player when you
look away from the screen and then
resume when you look back and it does in
great lighting in dim or dark or really
anything but perfect lighting situations
you know the conditions best suited to
watching video on your phone it doesn't
work at all and that's pretty weak
speaking of weak smart scroll is quite
possibly the biggest waste of space in
the entire galaxy s4 suite it lets you
scroll a page in the browser by moving
your head or the device it's fun in a
whiz-bang kind of way but it's subject
to the same limitations as smart pause
as far as lighting goes and if you still
have your fingers it's way easier just
to scroll with them that's not a joke by
the way this could really be a cool
feature for the handicapped but in that
case it's an accessibility option not a
feature you pitch hard to your entire
customer base
speaking of esoteric features let's talk
about group play for a second this is a
feature that for most won't come in
handy all that often but it's still fun
and cool group play sets up a wireless
link between galaxy s4 devices to allow
for sharing of documents and photos and
media but it's most visible feature is
turning two or more devices into
multiple speakers playing the same audio
track so you can get a stereo effect
with more than one device again it won't
appeal to everyone but it's a pretty fun
feature to show off at parties it's a
lot more fun
when you have friends around though
we've examined prepackaged titles like
the Samsung hub and s-health
in other videos so let's wrap up by
taking a look at two other pieces of
included software s translator and the
easy mode feature s translator is a
pretty straightforward translation app
and there are at least a few more
capable titles available for download in
the Google Play Store but bundled aboard
the device like it is it eliminates one
additional step for the user and it does
a pretty good job of translating our
spoken words on the fly for some
travelers this included out of the box
functionality will prove quite handy
especially for new smartphone users it's
that last group that Samsung really
wants to court with the Galaxy s4 the
company couldn't stop talking about how
easy to use it wants to make the device
easy mode does just what it sounds like
it condenses the Android experience down
to a very usable very simple interface
it's not just skin deep either easy mode
reaches down into stock apps to simplify
their layouts as well making a pretty
comfy and safe environment for folks new
to a smartphone it does make the device
feel a little childlike which maybe is
unavoidable and we're left asking the
question why the target customer
wouldn't just save the money and buy an
actual stripped-down budget smartphone
instead but for someone eventually
looking to graduate to a smartphone
who's going to use easy mode as an
intermediate step it makes sense in a
nice touch when you're ready to return
to the full home screens of TouchWiz the
phone remembers your settings and
preferences maybe you'll end up turning
all these features on and using them to
their full extent more likely you'll be
like us and shut most of them off to
conserve power and system resources
either way we've barely scratched the
surface of the total feature offering
Samsung is packed into the galaxy s4 but
hopefully we've touched on the major
facets you were hoping to learn more
about in the company's newest flagship
I've said it throughout the whole video
folks we have a ton more on the galaxy
s4 at pocketnow.com
and here on YouTube make sure you check
those out drop us a like on this video
if you enjoyed
one leave a comment let us know what
else we forgot and we'll try and get to
it in a future video or editorial in the
meantime thank you very much for
watching and we'll see you next time
