calm and today we're going to unbox the
Pantech Burst for AT&amp;amp;T one of the very
first 4G LTE smartphones for 80 so let's
get to the unboxing so after cutting
open the package we can see that the
Pantech Burst has a pretty good design
opposed to many other other devices in
the past and we just go along the box
and this is an android 2.3 device which
like I said before is one of a tease
first LTE devices so here we can see on
the back of the box we have 4G LTE a
Super AMOLED touchscreen display android
Wi-Fi web browsing of course it's all
pretty much standard and it looks as
though we've gotten a previously
reviewed item or something the amt open
do put the same card in the box or
something like that so just open it up
and we have a quick start guide so let's
set that to the side and safety and
warranty died here so it also has our
device so we'll just set that to the
side for one second while we open up the
rest of the box and v what else we have
inside the package we have a wall USB
charger and what else do we have in here
we have a micro USB charging sync cable
and a we also have our battery cover and
the battery itself and let's see what
size battery is this so it looks as
though the battery is a 1650 mill and
power battery so we can just put this
into the device and the cool thing about
the Pantech Burst just telling two
colors you can get gray or you can get
this maroon metallic red looking color
so well I pop this in will turn on and
then we'll play around with the device
little bit okay so we'll just pull off
this plastic texting and driving it can
wait so we'll just turn it on and the
screen looks pretty clear opposed to
many other screens that pantech they've
come out in the past so we'll just click
through this and let's just go through a
little bit of the hardware so this
particular device didn't come with a
micro SD card but it does have enough
internal memory for most people it also
has a micro sim card slot which is a
pretty rare in the mobile industry these
days so if we compare the pantech
first to a couple of other devices we
had the iphone 4 iphone 4s here and it
looks as though it's a little bit
thicker than the iphone our iphone 4s
and the screen is a little bit larger
than the iphone 4 iphone 4s we can
compare to these samsung focus and it's
almost exactly the same size as the
samsung focus same thickness and same
dimensions and we can compare it to the
samsung galaxy no of course it's much
smaller than the samsung galaxy note and
they're almost about the same thickness
it looks as though the galaxy no is a
little bit thinner so this has been the
unboxing video of the Pantech Burst
available AT&amp;amp;T right now for a full out
by price of three hundred ninety-nine
dollars or even get a subsidized price
with a two-year contract for 49 or so if
you like our videos make sure you get a
thumbs up and also leave some comments
down below stay tuned for the heart
review and the software review coming up
next and also the final review on pocket
