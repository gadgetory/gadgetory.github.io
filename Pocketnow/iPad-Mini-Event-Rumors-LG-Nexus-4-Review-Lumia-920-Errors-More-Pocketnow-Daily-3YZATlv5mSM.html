nexus 4 gets reviewed and forget about
the Lumia 920 coming to t-mobile I'm
high metal iveta tired of all these
Lumia news without a phone and this is
 out daily if you were wondering
which smartphone is selling the most be
at the iPhone 5 or the galaxy s3
marketing companies are already
confirming that the iPhone 5 has
surpassed the galaxy s3 in web traffic
now this is in no way a confirm
statistic just remember the fact that
the galaxy s3 has been in the market for
so many more months than the iphone 5
and still the five was able to sell 5
million units in three days compared to
the galaxy s3 which sold 20 million
units in a hundred days there's a big
difference there or it could just be
that the iPhone 5 is using more web
traffic because their Maps suck speaking
of the galaxy s3 verizon has just
confirmed that they'll be picking up new
colors as of october twenty seconds so
now you have the choice of pebble blue
marble white and now they'll have it in
brown and black don't ask me for the
denominators but anyways if you're
interested in a cheap galaxy s3 best buy
us just confirm that they'll have it on
sale this Sunday and this Sunday only
for 100 bucks after a two-year contract
so it's either colors or cheap I like
the pebble blue model and what would the
news be without some LG Nexus rumors
it's now being dubbed the Nexus 4 by LG
and it's just been reviewed by a
Belarusians website and I think I said
that right but anyways there's no going
back here this device looks exactly like
the current generation Galaxy Nexus
except for the back and except for three
things you're going to hate first of all
the battery is non-removable it doesn't
have expandable storage and let me shoot
Google than the foot right here it's got
8 gigabytes of storage I'm not kidding
you 8 gigabytes I don't know what these
guys are trying to do but i think i'll
stick to my current generation galaxy
nexus and yes all things d is pretty
much confirming that we will be getting
an ipad mini events on october twenty
third will invites coming up next week
finally Apple did have some production
delays and that's the reason why
everything didn't happen this week for
an event next week but whatever happens
just stay tuned for the news most likely
the invites
come in mid next week sometime and
finally for the disappointing news of
the day remember no gift confirming that
their Lumia 920 hat pensive and 3G well
apparently they made a mistake they've
just confirmed it and they'll fix the
website because even though it says it
there it doesn't have anti-ban 3g now
guess which band is missing on the
device seventeen hundred megahertz 3g
which would be t-mobile customers so
sorry for you guys that we're planning
on getting an international version
unlock to work on tmobile or unlocking
an AT&amp;amp;T model that leads me to the
question of the day with an iphone 5 a
galaxy note 2 0 1 x plus way galaxy s3
