its Galaxy Note 4 and we calling it the
Prime Apple changes its refund policies
at least for certain customers in the
world and we're mixed about all the
rumors regarding HTC in CES 2015 I'm hi
meri behna and I know mondays are tough
but even tougher are the ones between
the two holidays this is out
daily let's begin today with what's
official SES Samsung has launched yet
another galaxy note 4 variant but
interesting the company's not really
telling us much about things like the
processor for example but we do know is
that it is an LTE a smartphone meaning
this is pretty much what we would call
the Galaxy Note 4 prime even though the
display is pretty much the same and
everything else is the same let's insert
a full details let's see if we ever have
a chance to review it even though we
don't know if there's really a
difference to even mention this is just
the carrier variant for specific regions
and speaking of Samsung let's talk about
a new and very interesting move as being
rumored for the company the Galaxy alpha
hasn't really taken the world by storm
you know it's smaller less spectat smade
of aluminium rumors are that the company
is planning to retire the Galaxy alpha
but not the lineup per se the company is
apparently going to replace the Galaxy
alpha with the Galaxy a5 which is not
necessarily a hot smartphone apparently
this will happen sometime in January
let's see why I've got some very mixed
rumors regarding HTC the company is a
rumored to be launching its HTC hema
flagship for CES which is odd since we
were expecting for that to happen
sometime within April or probably in WC
but the so reports claim that it might
happen at CES and then we've got other
conflicting rumors that say the company
is planning to launch a mid-range or an
entry-level smartphone at CES that's the
way they plan to start the year again
we'll be at sea as covering everything
live and we hopefully will bring
something to report on now let's move
the spotlight over to Apple one of the
things that people hate the most about
the Cupertino kids or the fact that if
you purchase anything digitally
according to the iTunes in terms of
purchase well that's really it you have
no option for refund
they say that every purchase is final
but teach at the European Union has been
making things a little difficult for
Apple up to the point where the company
is apparently opening this new 14-day
period for you to ask for refund but the
reason why I say apparently is because
it seems that it will only work if you
have not downloaded the product meaning
if it's an application then it really
doesn't mean that it'll work but the
mixing description and we will be giving
this a try eventually to tell you if it
really works or not and finally for the
very interesting news of the day again
CES and everything up to the next couple
of days will be CES it seems that
Qualcomm is teasing a partnership with
LG for a new Snapdragon 800 type
processor to be announced at CES now in
mind LG has been used in the past for a
lot of Qualcomm Snapdragon launches so
what could be the Snapdragon 810 it
could be another Snapdragon that we
don't know about but we know that it's
an 800 variant this is really
interesting as we weren't really
expecting any black ships to be launched
by LG at this event and now it seems
that we will be getting something but it
leads me to the question of the day
whatever you buy a smartphone how
important is the processor information
meaning are you the type of guy or girl
that would only buy a smartphone if it's
a Snapdragon 800 something or stuff like
that because in my particular case I
remember when the Snapdragon 800 came
out it was really important for me to
buy one because of its battery life
capabilities and yet became important
for me but leave us a comment down below
it tells your experience frenzy dodrill
I think when I get in those earlier
before this video was phone issue follow
us on talking about comedy script change
the channel as well it also follow me on
Twitter hi managers quarterly betta
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hind everything
I'm thank you very much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
