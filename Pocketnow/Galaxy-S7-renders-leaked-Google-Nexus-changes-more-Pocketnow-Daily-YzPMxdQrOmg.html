next galaxy to launch at mwc iPad are
schematic show us that there are some
design variances of the current model
and Google's quarter results show a
company that continues to make money I'm
hi Mary vera and I know that some of you
hate that I don't like mondays but don't
worry you will get over it this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with new university policies
or at least one Oral Roberts University
has just launched this new mandatory
Fitbit campaign for freshman's and
there's a purpose behind this it's not
just the fact that you're getting a
Fitbit for you to be able to track your
stats but the university wants to be
able to determine if your fitness
activity has anything to do with your
academic results so I wonder exactly how
that is going to match up at Spring
Break let's see other official news come
from google and its parent company
alphabet if you're wondering exactly how
things are economically we've got what a
results its parent company alphabet it's
just one of those things I mean they're
not really making revenue from some of
their projects and still there
1,000,000,000 up in revenue and profits
as well which is good and in the case of
Google they are 9 billion up in revenue
almost 4 to 5 billion up in profits
which is great if you want specific
numbers linked to the description it
seems that things are going very
positive a lot more positive than they
are for Apple which is this a lot and
speaking of Google you remember all
those rumors about HTC building the
nexus smartphones in the future well it
seems that those rumors are true one and
two it seems that google is trying to
change its way of handling the Nexus
program apparently google wants to have
more control over the whole process up
to the point where we have trusted
sources claiming with an HTC that Google
is becoming too exhaustive about it up
to the point of pulling an apple in the
amount of detail and attention to detail
that they want with this future
smartphone or smartphones which is
actually a great thing that's the way
Google should have always been about the
Nexus lineup it's great to see this
let's just hope they don't race the
price tag in the process and speaking of
ample for those of you that are
wondering of the ipad air 3 will change
in design
it actually will we've got more leak
schematics it seems that we are getting
the speakers that we talked about from
the ipad pro which is great but
apparently that will require some
changes when compared to the current
iPad air 2 apparently it'll be less wide
than the ipad air 2 slightly thicker as
well it makes all the sense in the world
that we are getting these speakers but
then again this would be the second time
that iPads get thicker which is rather
weird stay tuned for that one and
finally the hot new stood they have
everything to do with the galaxy s7 yet
again we have presentations for an event
to happen on februari 21st in barcelona
we will be covering it live and that is
going to be great but even cooler evan
blast is added again we've got more
leaks of the galaxy s7 and it seems that
the curve back is not just coming to the
Galaxy s7 but also to the edge variant
which is rather weird we wonder exactly
how are they going to curve both sides
and make it economically king of
ergonomics it does lead me to the
question of the day would you want a
design like the only see in the lease
with these a curve backs is it's
something that you look for because in
my case I'll tell you this much I do
love that in the galaxy note5
particularly because of how thick that
phone is but in this case it's not
necessarily that same scenario but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
nose earlier before this video was
