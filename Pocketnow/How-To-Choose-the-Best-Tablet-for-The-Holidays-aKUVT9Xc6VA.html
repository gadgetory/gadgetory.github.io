another major question we get on Twitter
is which tablet is better than the other
and the tablet space is getting rather
complicated as well not for the same
reason as smartphones actually tablets
have declined in sales and they've also
started converging with computers in
certain cases up to the point where
people don't really need a computer
because it's haplit isn't enough so if
you're in the market right now trying to
figure out which is better for you we're
gonna try to help you out I'm I'm going
to be that I would pocket now and here's
a quick how to choose the best tablet
for you this holiday season
to start the most important question you
have to answer is which platform you
want to be on just like in the case of
smartphones applications that come from
one platform like Android don't port to
iOS but in the case of tablets there are
some benefits depending on whichever
smartphone platform you own particularly
if you own an iPhone most likely most of
your applications will work on an iPad
so that could be the best bet but then
again iPads are not necessarily the best
tablets if you want to use them for work
for example this would be Windows so
this is the first question you need to
answer and obviously the following
segments will focus on which is the best
tablet out of which now notice the irony
even though Android is the largest
platform when it comes to smartphones it
is not the case with tablets and we
really would not recommend you buy an
Android tablet unless you have to or
unless you're really invested in Android
and in the case of the higher-end
tablets I guess the only two good
options out there right now are any
Samsung Galaxy tablet of the higher end
like for example Galaxy Tab esta 2 we
saw it at CTIA and it was really good in
addition to other Nvidia Gaming tablets
out there which are rather compelling as
well if you don't want to invest that
much money in a tablet you can also go
to the mid-range but then again we've
got this category of Nexus tablets
that's become extremely affordable this
year for example if you want the Nexus 9
you get it for a crazy price tag right
now online in the case of the Nexus 7 it
is still a very good tablet that is well
sold and that is still available in
certain areas and you could pay very
little money for it and it still is a
great tablet now if you want to go even
lower than that we would not recommend
it the biggest problem with Android
tablets is yes it's full of $50 $100 $30
tablets but then you've got terrible
displays and in the case of Android and
in the case of tablets but display is
everything or you've got very little
storage and you're then gonna be
struggling with storage issues because
in the Android storage is everything or
then we have issues with software
updates slower end tablets for Android
are really really bad the lowest we
would recommend you go is for the Amazon
Kindle Fire tablets that are costing
like $50 right now but then again you'd
have to be
invested in the Amazon ecosystem now
Windows is the most complicated platform
when it comes to tablets but that's not
necessarily a bad thing the good thing
about Windows tablets says these are
true work computers these are not
consumption tablets like in the case of
Android or iOS you can actually get
stuff done and replace your computer
with a tablet and obviously the best
tablets out there right now are the
surface book and the surface pro 4 you
are getting every bang for your buck
here but then again the problem is these
tablets are not cheap and they ought to
be expensive for what you're getting
these tablets actually compete with a
MacBook Pro just to give you an idea you
can definitely go for the mid-range but
then again there are last year's options
that are still good like for example the
Microsoft Surface pro 3 which is
currently available for like $6.99 which
is the base price tag for a 16 gigabyte
iPad that is an amazing price tag and
you're getting a full fledged computer
here and then obviously you've got other
mid-range tablets from a shoes like the
transformer book lineup they can think
about this lineup in particular is that
for example you paid $300 you get a full
computer in that tablet and you also get
the keyboard and we've also got other
Dell tablets and HP tablets that run
full Intel Atom processors and pretty
much behave like a full computer it runs
full Windows 10
these are great tablets the problem is
when you start going lower in the case
of Windows
I particularly test the be a SUSE
transformer book and it's not really a
powerful tablet it's for the basic
things that you need but then if you go
any lower than that you'll struggle
either with RAM issues or clunkiness and
the tablet or you'll deal with Windows
10 but the mobile version not really the
full-fledged version and this is a
terrible experience particularly when it
comes to applications so again in the
case of the windows face if you can pay
money hey go for the surface pros but
you still got the surface pro 3 which is
still a great tablet it's still being
sold in the Microsoft stores so I would
highly suggest you consider that tablet
in particular instead of any other
tablet out there and finally obviously
the king of tablets is Apple with its
iPad lineup and yes these are the best
design tablets they are gorgeous in
every way but you have to
you're really buying consumption tablets
here not like in the case of Windows
these tablets will really only help you
watch a movie or play a game or respond
to email or browse the web but not
really hard core tasks and even though
in the higher end we do have the iPad
pro with some added benefits like the
Apple pencil it's not really a work
tablet surely there are apps that will
help you work but it won't be a perfect
experience after that you have the iPad
air 2 which is also a great tablet but
then again do not go for any 16 gigabyte
model from the iPad air 2 or below
because iPad applications are extremely
large you will not have enough storage
to consume content which is the major
purpose for an iPad you can also go
lower than that with the iPad air which
is still being sold but we would not
recommend you consider these mid-range
tablets as an option particularly
because certain features from iOS 9 will
not port to these lower end or older
tablets in the case of the iPad Mini you
can get the iPad Mini 4 which will give
you all the benefits but any tablet
below the iPad Mini will not bring you
all of iOS 9 features and in the case of
the iPad Mini if you'd like to consume
ebooks then surely this tablet will be
good for you but then for everything
else it's not really the most practical
tablet out there again iPads are
gorgeous products they're extremely
light these are great products to give
to your son if you want to carry on a
plane for a long flight and watch some
movies if you just again want to lay in
bed and consume content but just bear in
mind you're buying consumption products
here not anything else bottom line I
guess the biggest question you have to
ask yourself is do you really need a
tablet again tablets are great products
to have but these are products you don't
really need surely if you want to use
this as your sole computer this is a
Windows 10 tablet than fine but then
again if you only have a computer and a
smartphone you don't really need a
tablet these are good products to have
if you want to fly for hours on a plane
and watch a few movies or if you just
want to lay in bed and consume currents
and then yes fine by a tablet but then
in some cases tablets you know larger
smartphones would be enough
or you know smaller computers would be
enough it'll all depend on your needs
whenever you want to buy your next
tablet anyways that's it for this video
