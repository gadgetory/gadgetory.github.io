here at IFA in Berlin at the Huawei
booth we're checking out the huawei
mediapad 10 fhd this is the largest
tablet and the newest tablet on display
from huawei here at IFA starting on the
back as you can see this is a 10 inch
tablet reminiscent of the galaxy tab
10.1 starting on the back here this is a
aluminum unibody casing plastic up top
for the antennas and an eight megapixel
full HD camera there with LED flash some
stereo speakers on the back as well in
addition to the Huawei branding a little
bit of volume controls on the sides
power button good responsiveness there
up front here we have a 3.2 megapixel
front facing camera and obviously the 10
inch display this unit is not powered on
they've had some charging problems this
morning so we're just taking a look at
the hardware feels really good in the
hand it's actually very very light I
mean I can gesture with this it feels
like a unit that doesn't really have a
battery in it but of course the battery
is integrated we're going to have some
more on this if we manage to get a
working unit but for now the huawei
mediapad 10 fhd it's very very light
very new tablet from huawei and take a
look at the rest of the hardware here
here we've got the huawei ascend g600
this is being a part of the g or gold
series this is part of Huawei's
mid-range line on the back here this
Hardware pretty typical hardware we're
looking at an 8 megapixel camera back
side illuminated sensor underneath here
it's powered by a dual-core 1.2
gigahertz processor this is running
Android 404 without Huawei's new skin
that they announced or that they
released here at Aoife this is just for
dorota for with a little bit of light
while way software customization there
this is a qHD display
it is 4.5 inches across and is brighter
than some of the other budget ones here
as far as heaven and end stuff goes this
is in line with most of always other
offerings as a very very lightweight
device feels fairly solid with good
response on the buttons here even better
than the ascend p1 that we tested
capacitive keys up front here all in all
a very solid mid-range device from
huawei let's take another look around
the table down here we're looking at the
huawei ascend g330 this is an iterative
upgrade to the g 300 which brings a 1
gigahertz dual-core processor with an
adreno 200 GPU as well as a front facing
camera and a 1500 milliamp hour battery
like we say just just improving on the
300 here's the 5 megapixel camera back
here as you can see it's a pretty thick
device pretty small in the hand with a
fairly dim display pretty deeply set in
the casing how much to get excited about
but it does bring the two 300 series a
little bit further along as an iterative
improvement let's keep moving along
finally here at huawei we've got
something interesting a 7 inch tablet
tub dubbed the mediapad 7 light there is
no accompanying mediapad 7 or any other
version this is the only other tablet
here besides the 10 incher this is
obviously a smaller tablet same unibody
aluminum on the back here but it's been
interrupted by two plastic flourishes
here this camera is sams flash it's got
the speaker phone right next was run by
a 1.2 gig urge processor you can see
microSD and sim card slots on the side
under the volume rocker and power button
these don't feel quite as premium is on
some of the devices we've been handling
here or on the mediapad 10 there's a bit
of lag on this device we're not sure if
that's because it's just been used a lot
already today at this early point in the
morning or not we've tried to close out
as many apps as possible this is running
Android 404 4023 rather as you can see
very similar in stature to Google's
Nexus 7 in fact the devices are so
similar that even at first glance you
might not be able to tell them apart
once you look at the back obviously
there's some significant differences
there as we say obviously this is not
running jellybean or even the latest ice
cream sandwich so there's a bit more lag
on this device not really sure exactly
what what ways is going for with this
one but it is a young product since yet
to see as you can see customize lock
screen as we saw on the ascend p1 and
then all the huawei devices here will
have a little bit more on this if we can
get some more face time with it but for
now just the mediapad 7 light the final
of the new products here at the huawei
booth at Aoife in Berlin I'm Michael
with pocket now we'll keep looking at
this stuff keep watching thanks for
watching in the meantime we'll see you
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
