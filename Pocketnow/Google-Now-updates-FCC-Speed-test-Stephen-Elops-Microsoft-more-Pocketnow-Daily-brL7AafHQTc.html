your smartphones in the next coming
weeks the FCC has taken matters into
their own hands to verify carrier data
speeds now if Stephen Elop were sealed
Microsoft iOS and Android would get MS
office I'm high memory data and trust me
the only thing worse about starting a
weekend with a cold is not being able to
drink while you're at it but this is
 out daily let's reach day off
with some official news as please raise
your hand how many of you are happy with
your current data speeds because the FCC
apparently wants to verify just how
happy you are with a new application
they launched for Android the idea what
the application is that you speed test
your current network you pretty much
tell the FCC if you're happy with your
current data speeds or not and that
these are as advertised or not which is
really interesting since I always
noticed that the speedtest.net
application performs beautifully when
you use it but then when you try to
upload a YouTube video gets startled so
anyways and skoo you have official let's
talk about nokia and their Lumia 1520
one more time as yet it was pulled out
of the blue from the microsoft an AT&amp;amp;T
store for reasons we don't understand
but now it's available one more time you
can get it by November 22nd for two
hundred dollars after two year contract
if you're interested in the phablet
Windows Phone 8 this is pretty much your
device even though we still don't know
who want to screen that big but anyways
the only problem is that apparently they
will have shortages on the yellow units
so move quick if you're looking for big
yellow device and speaking of Nokia
let's go through an interesting twist
talking about Stephen Elop as apparently
he's already been talking about his
plans as future Microsoft CEO if he
would ever get the job before me but it
was apparently according to his plans he
plans to ditch the Xbox platform and
sell it which we're not even going to
talk about here but aside from that
apparently he considers that that
Microsoft Office platform should not be
something that should pull people to win
those products meaning that we should
get it on iOS and Android with no
restrictions like we currently get with
office 365 apparently he wants to give
us the full version of office and
hopefully they will without that crazy
price tag that they have so let's see
how that goes and speaking of products
you'll probably not
by the samsung galaxy note 12.2 yet 12.2
the Wi-Fi only variant has just stepped
over at the FCC it's currently getting
verified and most probably we will be
getting it in retailers in the United
States very soon it's just again
interesting 12.2 inches for galaxy note
and the 10.1 hasn't taken off with all
its bevy of features and everything we
really don't know what the purpose is
for this 12.2 but let's see how that
goes and finally for the interesting
news of the day it seems that google now
is about to get better for your devices
in the next coming week or probably too
it turns out you'll now be able to talk
to google now and it'll talk back to you
asking more questions so it's a lot more
interactive than it currently is just
answering a question to you and aside
from that you can also launch
applications from google now aside from
other services that are probably coming
now these are still rumors nothing
really confirmed but that lazy the
question of the day how would you
improve google now what would you ask
that will now be able to do because in
our particular case i love google now i
love it so much that i use it all the
time but still i would love to get more
options on those cards so it was a
comment down below and fronts you know
the drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is still make
sure you follow us on parking our
comment subscribe my youtube channel as
