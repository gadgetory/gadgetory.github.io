now and when we recorded the show this
week we didn't expect the software to
completely tear apart the new summary
section which is why we won't be seeing
it on this week's YouTube version but it
is available on the full audio version
at pocketnow.com there will be a link in
the description but we did want to share
some video with you at least so
fortunately we have our conversation
with Evan Rogers she is social media
manager for Engadget and he wrote up and
dished out that little critique of
galaxy s 8 reviews that we've been
talking about so that should be an
interesting conversation but before we
get to that I think we need to take a
moment to thank our sponsor I think that
would only be appropriate for the
continued production of this podcast and
that sponsor is of course blue apron now
just because you're busy that doesn't
mean you don't have time to put together
interesting meals using high-quality
ingredients blue apron takes the
guesswork out of cooking delivering the
exact amounts of food you need for each
recipe we've been using it and when they
say you need one potato you get one
potato for that recipe all of those
ingredients meat and vegetables are
sourced ethically using sustainable
sources and they're often very close to
you supporting local farmers in your
area meals are delivered to 99% of the
continental United States and the costs
are under $10 per serving now some of
the meals available this month lemon
grass burgers and cabbage slaw seared
chicken and creamy couscous and a spicy
pepper and ricotta calzone that one I'm
really excited to try now those all
sound super fancy but each menu each
item comes with a menu card to walk you
through the recipe step by step with
full-color photos putting together rich
flavorful meals should not be stressful
or intimidating each week you can
customize your menu to fit your
particular tastes and dietary
restrictions including vegetarian
options and blue apron has an extensive
collection of recipes so subscribers
won't encounter the same meal twice over
the course of a year cooking together
can help improve family bonds and blue
apron families cook together three times
more often I do I keep my my little
daughter Lex she stays in the kitchen
while I'm putting food together if it's
blue apron or not but the blue apron
meals are really fun because she likes
to play with the recipe cards while I'm
trying to read what my next step is so
it's a fun way to bond over food while
we're also singing her favorite Muppet
and Disney songs you will love how good
it feels and tastes to create incredible
home-cooked meals with blue aprons so

and get your first three meals for free
by going to blue apron dot-com slash
pocket now once again blue apron comm
slash pocket now and we thank them for
supporting the pocket knife let's not
waste any time and get straight into the
new Samsung Galaxy sa the Samsung Galaxy
s8 the Samsung Galaxy s8 something
galaxy si si si si si si f8 Alexei is
opposite the si si talking about
everything you need to know about galaxy
f8 but before I can talk about how great
this phone is I have to answer the
question that everyone is thinking would
it be too much to say that the Galaxy s8
is the best Android phone of the year
so moving on to a segment I'm very
excited about is we've got a sit-down a
conversation here joining us on the
podcast is mr. Evan Rogers
he's the social manager the social media
manager adding gadget do I have that
correct yes yes absolutely
okay good and he recently produced a
really provocative video starting a
conversation taking a look at the state
of smartphone technology reviewing on
the youtubes in the year 2017 I'm really
happy that you could join us on the show
and this is a video that spurred a lot
of conversation amongst individuals like
us you know like the content producers
on YouTube the people that are really
trying to dig into these smartphones and
tablets the sort of consumer electronics
space and so I wanted to start off first
because you you currently work at and
gadget you came from the verge now was
it at the verge that you became a
Samsung hating anti Android shill or got
some common logic that I break that up
over time yes yes not photographers so
anti Android people are made not born is
what you're saying uh yes I would
actually
we're joking but I would I would agree
with that I don't have all the joking
yes completely being facetious really I
wanted to jump in first this this to me
was a very honest video and we don't get
these kinds of conversations very often
on our side of this business I felt this
was a very heartfelt video and I felt
this was a very scathing look at kind of
where we find ourselves in information
versus entertainment and I was really
hoping you could maybe elaborate on just
where you were personally when you were
thinking about putting this video
together like how you came to this place
where this was a conversation you really
wanted to have yes
sure so I mean before before I was in at
a gadget I was doing some consulting
specifically on like just media company
YouTube management so like just how do
you run your YouTube channel as a media
company and while I was doing that you
know I've really found that
as a lot of media companies kind of hit
the same hit the same wall which is that
they're they're under a lot of different
constraints when it comes to how they
produce video even just generally right
but once you kind of enter once you kind
of enter the first the reticle of
technology journalism and then beyond
that even smaller into the reviews game
then you've got you know kind of a lot
of things playing into your workflow and
basically I just I was trying to figure
out a good way to provide commentary on
basically those constraints I also
didn't hurt that that I was like working
on the you know I was working in
researching for the Engadget channels
and just like looking at all the
embargoes that went up and just like oh
my gosh these are all these videos are
the same you don't I mean alright well I
guess I mean like the follow up to that
was so there wasn't really anything
unique necessarily about like the Galaxy
s8 launched as a phone it was more that
just the timing had kind of come to a
zenith where so many people were trying
to accomplish the same thing under the
same constraints and independently that
means we all kind of arrived at the same
quality of discussion right and so
that's that it's really I mean first and
foremost the very first thing that I
should say is that you know I know a lot
of people that do reviews and like it
just I can't emphasize it enough that it
is so hard to write them then beyond
that it's very time-consuming to to
compartmentalize and compact your
written review into a script and then
from there you know you have to get the
video shot and so that's really what I
wanted to talk about was less the kind
of creative liberties that reviewers are
taking and more about the constraints
that like lead to this place right you
know I mean I'm actually really glad
that you brought it up that way it's
something that I've noticed as
a significant shift in the discussion
the commentary when I started reviewing
actually I started by reviewing
recording equipment and then sort of
broadened into consumer electronics but
when I started it was all about writing
three thousand four thousand words on a
product and then you would have this
terrible YouTube video of these
disembodied hands molesting a gadget for
two minutes and that was you that was
your your coverage and you know even for
the inside baseball at pocket now when
we're getting ready to publish a review
the major focus initially is on that
video and then a couple days later like
I'm in the process of writing wonderful
galaxy essay plus review that's going to
go up on our site as a text piece they
we can get into even just a little bit
more granular details on the usage of
this phone but the primary focus was
pushing that video forward was pushing
that video out first so so I guess I
mean just in kind of for our audience
you produced this video and you know I
think it was the intro to your
discussion here that I think perked a
lot of eyebrows that that really got a
lot of people's attention as you were
doing these really aggressive cuts
between the various popular youtubers
talking about this phone and all kind of
landing on the same bullet points then
there's the camera taking a look at the
camera on the galaxy s 8 it is the same
as a lost year so it has the same specs
no dual cameras like some of its rivals
honestly you're not going to see too
much of a difference here on the rear
camera that's not really a big deal
though because they were great to start
with I mean the first thing I think
someone would ask is like was there a
lot of editing involved in that or were
you going through these videos seeing
like well this is the section that
everyone seems to talk about here and
this is the section that everyone seems
to talk about here and this is like
straight out of the reviewers guide that
Samsung supplies to all of these
individuals so no I mean so first off I
have never seen I've actually never seen
the press materials for the Galaxy s8
I've have gotten to see the Galaxy S 8
itself I was at the event but I've never
seen the press kit and if people don't
know for any new thing that comes out
there's like here points that like you
know the company will say Talking Points
Memo yeah yeah yeah like here are some
things that you could talk about if you
on it right and I don't that was
actually not my right um because I've
never seen it and I have no idea what
they sent although we all know pretty
much what they send in those things but
more it was that I was watching a bunch
of these and the language that everyone
was using you know I mean like when I
cut on a specific word like the camera
or the word comfortable uh like it's not
just that people are making the same
points in an abstract way sometimes if
they're making points in like using
literally the same language and that is
ones that's what I'm just like what is
that was another word I was like what is
happening you know what I mean and ya
know there it was so I mean your video
actually generated a lot of discussion
internally between the producers here
PocketNow because it's one of the things
on our channel where we have very
different styles for each of the
producers we don't really have kind of a
unified sense of how reviews should be
produced and it was one of the reasons
why they brought me on was actually to
try and shake up some of that commentary
with some of the technical aspects of
how we conduct phone reviews so as I was
watching through your video and seeing
sort of like we've got the dolly shots
we've got like the the same quality or
insightfulness for some of the the
individual features of the phone the
Galaxy s8 served as a really sort of
great platform for you to engage in this
discussion was there any fallout like
you know a tech community where people
mad reviewing community no yeah like or
no one like trying to throw you like a
false DMCA or anything like tabs
particular absolutely not
so I was yet no first of all I was and I
think that's totally fair if someone
wanted to slap me with a like hey you
use my video I mean the first thing I
would say is I've used this in sort of
editorial like quality but also like
that's fair like it's your video I don't
care if you want to do that go for it
but nobody has and then also like there
were people who definitely rendered some
feedback
but most of it was very agreeable from
like the actual tech community there
were some fans right who were quick to
point out that there are differentiated
players on YouTube and I don't disagree
at all actually like ah you guys are one
of them
but you know when it comes to the
players who are winning right like and
this is this conversation is deeply
about YouTube and smartphone reviews and
Technology reviews on YouTube and the
YouTube community right um it's you know
the regular tech press is going through
its own kind of whole thing but like I
write work in that so like it's not like
so they I'm really in a position to
comment on but when it comes to YouTube
specifically like the feedback that I
got again was really that that trying to
say that there are differentiated
players out there but that actually was
my point which is that choice is like
pocket now super staff marques unbox
therapy they are so different than the
traditional canonical review right right
but there are paradoxically you know in
recent times so many of them I think
that's really the point that I was
trying to make is it like there's
nothing unusual about a YouTube like a
corner of YouTube where there are four
to five big players but what I do think
is strange and questionably sustainable
is when you have you know 20 to 30
creators who fundamentally have the same
constraints right like you may you may
receive a review difficult to have sort
of I'm sorry to interrupt please I don't
have like a differentiated voice when
you're all working under very similar
constraints very similar time frames
kind of poking at the exact same product
and having to do that I think in the
same way because you know the audience
is sort of expecting a certain level of
cinematography well that takes up time
from really using the gadget oh yeah get
to know it to have that that process and
so I make I
felt like that was really the biggest
takeaway I feel like we kind of dodged a
bullet at pocket now because we weren't
part of that embargo um so oh yeah end
up in your video and in fact your video
on my on my Twitter channel actually
kind of upset my galaxy say plus review
and I was sharing or to eat like I was
looking at the numbers like your tweet
trended better on my Twitter on my
Twitter page than my review of the
Catholic CSA Plus did um so I mean you
know that's that yeah that's that's no
judgment I mean you guys are you guys
are hitting straight and I was I was you
know kind of like like offering a hot
sake and that's the injustice of Twitter
is often the break after the take
is like for whatever is more popular
than the actual thing but you know like
well but I felt like that really that
really um that really Illustrated
personally and one of the reasons why I
was I was being genuine when I said like
hey you know from your video there are
definitely some things I feel I could
learn from the discussion that you're
starting here I
it's the necessary evil you know the
galaxy s 8 reviews that were out prior
to ours trended really well hit really
hard on YouTube and we were late to that
discussion and just as you were
mentioning in that video commentary
about the reviews was already starting
to supersede the reviews themselves by
the date we were able to publish our
video and that timing I think was was
really precious for us and seeing the
practical application of what you were
describing in your commentary right and
this is the thing you know if I had
criticism for myself on this video which
as a creator you instantaneously do for
anything you create it's that there's a
lot of points kind of here and the very
you know one of the things that I would
love to explore more in future videos or
or maybe another written thing is that
there are like serious implications to
waiting right like what I proposed was
was they like you know taking the time
to do something different and that is
great as an ideal but at the same time
like you
for every actually for every hour that
goes by that you don't have you know
your video up relative to people who hit
at the exact embargo time you're you're
literally just losing one like there's
no other way to put it like you're yes
you're you're addressing your audience's
needs but when it comes down to
especially when you're competing with
YouTube creators directly it is it is
actually like a revenue thing you know
if you choose to do this at a much later
time you must simply by the nature of
YouTube and the nature of like the
audience Network like you have to
provide incredible cinematography you
have to provide incredibly salient
points and um you know it's can
definitely be done but at the same time
you know you can put out kind of this
like overview this kind of glossy
overview at the embargo time and reap a
majority of the traffic which is again
at Leena like this is part of the the
system that I don't think leads to
really incredible and differentiated
works I mean everyone everyone stuff
looks really good and they make very
good points but the reason why we have
30 reviews that look the same instead of
30 reviews that are wildly different and
personal is because of this phenomenon
which is that you simply must post when
everyone else posts in order to make
that money or to gain that audience or
whatever right and we're actually on on
this on this very day that this is being
recorded we're kind of in the same boat
again you know blackberry just took the
wraps off the key one and that initial
embargo push is was really only enough
time for people to put out sort of a
hands-on or an unboxing or a first
impressions video and I mean if you're
gaming because I you know think we
follow each other on Twitter by the time
we get to real reviews I'd be willing to
wager that the first two weeks of the 24
hours videos are going to significantly
help perform the first two weeks of the
actual knowledgeable reviews of the
product when people have more time to
actually spend with the gadget for sure
for sure and that's the that's that's
the crazy thing to which is that
like you know the audience segments that
like there is like AB I would I would
push back a little bit and say that
there absolutely is an audience who is
looking for that super deep dive but
that audience is much smaller the ones
that are both interested in that level
of granularity and also patient enough
to to wait for that or loyal to loyal
enough to your to your publication to to
wait for your particular voice it's just
a smaller number than people who are
like yo I just saw this Galaxy s8 thing
or whatever the key one or whatever in
trending and just watched it you know
like that's so different like those
audiences are completely different well
and so this is a this is a hypothesis
that I've I've posited on previous
podcasts so I apologize to my listeners
that I'm going to bring this up again as
technology has sort of become life style
right you know like the geek inherited
the earth right you know can't exist in
modern society without gadgets which you
know if I were to go back in time to
high school and tell myself that I would
be over the moon but as that transition
has happened my personal experiences in
talking about this stuff I kind of feel
like the people who are consistently
engaging with tech channels are doing so
more to sort of confirm their notions on
products and less to be educated about
products as many consumers have sort of
picked the team that they're going to
side with for what phone they use to get
through the day yeah I I would
definitely agree that there are for
stuff for whatever reason forces at work
that are stratifying people amongst
these things but that may be the case
but also I think that you know that my
opinion is more that phones are fashion
like technology is socially and and that
you know people are more interested in
being kind of involved in technology
culture then necessarily at the at the
intersection of a technology purchase
decision essentially run like hell yeah
like I have so actually the other day
like like the other day I was really
trying to find out if the xperia x zs
had like a textured back instead of a
brushed back and like I literally could
not find this like I like I could not
lay I looked at everybody like written
review because they have you know more
high-resolution photos look at every for
a review I'm like I can't like I was I
don't even want this phone really but
like I'd there's like Evan the most
important thing to know about that phone
is the super slow motion mode I mean in
the reviewers kit it's way more
important than the back material or and
I just say that like I would just love a
nice 240 hundred and eighty or sorry
1080p at 240 I don't like I just don't
care about 960 at 720 is okay what's on
crap but no but anyway so like I wasn't
even at I wasn't even at like a
purchasing decision I was more just like
what is this phone made out of and like
um you know I I that took me through
like seven videos you don't I mean right
and these like D first of all you like
you can't buy an expiry in a store but
what attracted me to the xperia is just
how it looks right it just looks like a
like to my eyes it looks like a
fashionable device and that is what set
me on a cascade of you know to be like
to be analytical or sterile with a look
at content consumption binge but but I
think that I'd also think that like when
that what drives what drives a lot of
people like what drives a lot of these
audiences is is somewhat the deep fan
base like the people who cruise reddit's
are / Android the XDA people but you do
have a much wider swath of people that
are really in it for the fashion in the
culture and those are the kind of like
drive-by audience members that are yeah
are the ones that
that will kind of hang out only as long
as the like embargo syrup really you
know like on the bottom bar go day right
well and I'm also found that those are
often people that have probably already
made their purchasing decision so when I
started reviewing gadgets that really
felt my it was my job because I had
access it was my job to help inform
where now the people that are most
engaging not necessarily even the most
number of views for a video but the
people that were most gauging with my
videos are people that know just as much
about the product as I have in some
times they've had the product longer
yeah is there a viewer no totally right
and they're there they absolutely
already know they want to have like a
discussion with you in the comments and
actually love that that's one of the
best things about the YouTube community
but you're absolutely right like those
people are not at the crossroads of a
purchasing decision where they need help
you know what I mean right there
they're deeply involved in the kind of
like you know and I think that this is
something that reflects in the reviews
to which is that you know oftentimes
reviews will take one or another kind of
cut right where sometimes reviewers will
kind of get a little in my distance in
my opinion they'll just get a little bit
over involved with like the history of
Samsung or like this is how much the
design has changed over the years and
you know in reality people are like is
it made of metal
does the batteries last all day will it
explode if I drop it and like is the
camera reasonably fine and slides and
then other ones other ones are like
other reviews are like these are the
benchmarks like you can run a Wii U game
on this like I can actually do that only
GameCube and Wii games right now it's
the dolphin and later but still but
still yeah it's my favorite when someone
does also like a ram tasking like we
loaded 30 i-n memory like okay that's
awesome no I mean like that's great
I've never done I mean there's there is
an audience for that it's like you know
what and like seriously there are like
they're like just like power user
teenagers I imagine who are on some kind
of like next-level Instagram tip that
that need that so I mean it was it was a
major point in your video because I mean
obviously the major evidence in in sort
of what you were trying to illustrate in
how these reviews can be similar was
pulling content from major producers but
I was hoping that you could also maybe
expand just a little bit on some of the
ideas or some of the commentary for
up-and-coming youtubers I mean we get a
ton of questions from people who are
trying to find their own niche in
discussing technology in reviewing
gadgets or just trying to join the
conversation and I felt like you had
some really important points to
illustrate for that side of the business
as well that YouTube can feel really
lopsided or top-heavy sometimes yeah
yeah so I mean there's a couple things
there and one of them I think is the the
major advantage that individual
youtubers can have over a publication is
that the publication for a lot of
different reasons needs to make a
canonical thing because that's the way
the website works the website has most
websites well I shouldn't say that big
the big tech like generalist websites
they're going to have one review and a
couple of breakout stories right and the
nice thing is that an individual content
creator you can take a few you can kind
of take a few tax which is that like you
really the unbundling is what's up like
people okay so like you have this
canonical review where the reviewer
could spend maybe 60 seconds on the
camera and even that is also that's like
a lot in video time yeah you know right
a little right and like instead of that
you know that's just such a bit in a
review like that 60 seconds is such a
huge budget for talking points but you
know there's no reason why you can't go
so ham on the camera and create like a
ten minute video that covers everything
you could possibly want to know every
scenario every lighting situation every
camera mode and like yeah you know it's
for the first look if you decide to do
this the first video you're not going to
get that many views because if you blur
it be like you really like went deep but
right people will come to know you and
trust you for the individual you know
perspective that you bring to it and
that's the thing is it like you know the
don't get me wrong
unbox and marques they have beautiful
cinematography but a they didn't always
and B I think you know one of the crazy
things about both of them is that you
could actually listen to their video as
audio and another tab and it's still
pretty enjoyable because what you're
there for is really their personality
I'm sure marques would hate that because
they put so much work into his visuals
red cameras ain't cheap so no no they
are not but that's the thing is that
like in fact I it's just last night
actually I was doing some like pre pro
for this call and just like kind of
grabbing some numbers here and there and
I forget I really should have bookmarked
this but I lost the tab it was like
phones versus and I think it might be
phone versus phone and this is just this
kid he's a young man who is just like
doing stuff like walking around and like
this is the stabilization on the
front-facing camera of these two models
of phones and like that's incredibly
useful you know I mean if you are trying
to decide whether or not to make a
purchase that kind of stuff is
incredibly useful like oh the problem is
the problem is really balancing all
these things and YouTube is just not an
ideal platform for doing that you know
what I mean like if I am at a crossroads
if I am trying to buy something like
right now I've got to Amazon tab open
right I don't I don't really care about
the legacy of Samsung's design is good I
mean I've literally felt it was it was
right before we were jumping and I
caught three different videos like I
forget one of them was every single
Samsung Galaxy S phone compared or
something that and it was like below
another video that was a comp
the same thing and then another one
where it was like s5 vs s6 vs. s7 versus
as a right a I'm not really quite sure
who that's for other than they can go to
someone images it can be for someone but
like that's the thing is like YouTube is
like look I encourage anyone out there
right like do this little analysis right
now look it's publisher YouTube's like
for example for example Bloomberg that
company has more money than God and like
their YouTube channel is not that strong
right right and the reason is is that
like YouTube channels are a often about
personalities but be even more broadly
they're really about one thing well like
one thing done well it's very just
incredibly hard to have a channel where
you do a bunch of different stuff and
take off unless your personality is like
so there but um you know like I think
SAS says in his channel trailer like the
thing that you land on in his page
he literally positions his videos that's
something that you should watch before
you buy something and so like that kind
of clarity I think really works and then
also like you know like for you know the
like Phil Nicholson and Michael Fisher
like they both are taking a very kind of
particular angle on the sort of thing on
on YouTube and look at their growth I
mean like if you get on social blade
just look at how quickly they've been
able to grow relative to like I worked
on the verge channel for the first two
years right and it like it was hard I
think it was like it was like pulling
teeth to get that thing to like three
hundred thousand you know I mean and
they they know they're well on their way
you know and not even beyond it now so I
mean like there's definitely to your
original question about what individuals
creators can do you have a huge
advantage over the big players you know
I mean so I would say like if you can
find a voice for yourself and find a
voice for what it is you seriously care
about in terms of these technology
devices like you have the biggest leg
up on publishers ever and like you if
you're interested then you should
explore that right on now I know we've
we've got to let you go here soon but
especially in kind of maybe Twitter
stalking you for a little bit um
especially over the last 24 hours
I wanted to change gears just real
quickly and and we don't to spend a lot
of time on this but just to get your
thoughts on the news that broke
yesterday about chairman PI a jeep I and
the is is public comments on the FCC's
plans for ending net neutrality and
Engadget had some phenomenal coverage as
because some of our coverage can be a
little boutique as it pertains
specifically you know smartphones
tablets and wearables um I I was I was
just curious like what your thoughts
were personally I mean also kind of
pointing to some of and gadgets coverage
writing about those topics tech in
politics definitely something that's
going to be a very I think passionate
subjects for a lot of our respective
audiences and the code for isn't coming
months and years absolutely of course I
mean so first and foremost you know I
you know my opinions here not reflect
about the company I work for etcetera
etcetera disclaimer disclaimer but you
know I'll just add myself to that too
yeah um but you know you really should
go read the thing that Terence wrote he
had something up really fast and he's a
really good editor and you know it's so
you should go read that but like my
opinion is this is completely
like you know the idea that the market
has performed well in levels of in
existing levels of low regulation is
just not factual and based in reality
like right I don't know if you ever saw
this in my backlog but like when I lived
in Tennessee I didn't have access to
internet like as just a thing and that
was wow that was in December of last
year and uh yeah we didn't have you so
you weren't in Chattanooga
no I was not in Chattanooga the most
fiber Laden city in the world apparently
but no so why I had to go out and get to
t-mobile like hotspots and connects to
the one tower that was like in my like
outside of Nashville zones that was that
was my life you know and I was paying
200 bucks a month o to do that to work
and like lives in the digital economy so
like to say that you know this
deregulation is helpful for consumers or
that this I forget what the exact quote
is and I am going to misquote it so I do
apologize but like that whatever the
quote was about energizing a
disenfranchised space like bro ro I
literally lived there like I literally
lived there and like I would tell you
what would be energizing it's like
having a portable access to the Internet
that would be energizing for my
community uh when I lived back in
Tennessee so I mean that's my two cents
you know well nigh and I thank you for
sharing that it's a it was um I put out
a little vlog on it and everything - I'm
trying to keep as much discussion on
this as possible because it's one of
these topics that I feel is framed as a
left versus right kind of debate and
even though I will probably wear that
bleeding heart on my sleeve I'm still a
capitalist and I don't really feel this
needs to divide people when we can point
to data points that we could be doing
better and we could be better serving a
number of communities I for example
apparently Tennessee still needs some
help and I know they just recently went
through some legislation to dump more
public money into infrastructure but
they're still preventing fiber rollout
ever I'm leaving Chattanooga so you know
one step forward two steps back or two
steps not taken yeah
two steps just I don't know some
direction I supposed like oh yeah I
don't do I don't think that this is I
don't think that this is a partisan
issue like nobody's going to align on
party lines when what like the lines
that people aligned on are like our one
mapped out by telecom providers right
you don't I mean like you have internet
or you don't
and like the the area around me in
Tennessee was a very low-income area and
you had only had two practical options
right which was Verizon's wireless
internet service which which is around a
hundred one hundred and fifty bucks for
twenty two gigs
um right and like when you combine low
access in a low-income area with a very
very high price you know offering like
you are just exploiting people you know
and then like right uh they're not so I
kind of feel like there's there is a
because I think this is a this is an
issue that I think my team the left has
done a very poor job of acting as an
opposition party in really trying to
move the needle on progress right for
this kind of stuff because I also feel
like we're leaving a ton of money on the
table for a lot of these underserved
communities and areas of the United
States where they've been harder hit
economically or they're facing more
significant job loss giving them access
to information improving healthcare
through better connectivity improving
education through better connectivity
only would only serve to give each and
every single one of these populations
regardless of race or socioeconomic
background or anything would only serve
to give them a more substantial leg up
in a 21st century economy right
I mean well there's some distant details
here that that I think shouldn't be
overlooked which are just that this is
you know this is the outing of a plan
yeah this is not the law yet um correct
and you know at least we have the
opportunity to provide comments I don't
there's something I need to like
actually dig deeper into like
specifically what was said in this
meeting because I've only had the
opportunity to look at write-ups about
it uh but I actually I would highly
recommend there is a c-span stream I
think it was yesterday at the Newseum
in ITC like news museum gaseum it's
about an hour long and the opening
comments are from a representative
representative of Freedom Works so a lot
of what you've been discussing from the
write-ups is on point because that's
obviously what was said but it was an
interest in my opinion again that
representing PocketNow directly it was
an interesting linguistic gymnastics
display as they were trying to conflate
regulations and other industries which
may or may not actually stein the
business progress but then also trying
to use this as a way to champion small
business and that to me became one of
one of the big qua moments was you're
talking about a deregulation a system
which would absolutely benefit I think
the top players in this in this market
but I see no evidence to to point to
that that would indicate that this would
be better for that tiny little app
developer or the next Netflix or
whatever type of future Internet service
it's going to be really hot and use a
lot of bandwidth being able to compete
fairly in a market like that yeah yeah
so I mean that it's hard because I
really like haven't done the due
diligence but like that kind of off the
cuff just seems like silly sound to me I
mean my my undergraduate you know I
studied econ right and like right
theoretically if you're believing all
the Keynesian sorry I don't
know if we can swear on this podcast I
really apologize okay that you know what
I mean we mark this as adults okay III
just try try try to maybe not drop a
bunch of f-bomb okay very forever
um no but I mean like you know there's
yes there's a delineation it's true that
in a lot of cases you can get short-term
growth by deregulating industries
because they will invest you know they
feel like though the door is now a jar
we are free to run through it and yes
you can definitely get some short-term
gains short term
gains out of that but I you know I'm not
an economist but uh you know whether or
not that that actually benefits small
companies that work on the Internet as
opposed to literally providing
infrastructure for the internet whether
that provides benefits to consumers who
are operating within a government
sanctioned monopoly or oligopoly that
dike doesn't really stack for me but
again like that's just my kind of like
off the cuff like that's like I don't
know yeah I you can also hide to be her
to well in and to me yeah I think
evidence is is sort of a key talking
point there but I along with you I'll
have to defer because you even have a
leg up on me because I was a theater
student incompetent
I have even less business talking about
the economy mr. Evan Rogers I want to
thank you so much for taking the time to
chat with us I felt your video was was a
very important discussion to have in a
future economy I mean again kind of
coming back to the economics on this
where we've been empowered to create our
own content and so giving people that
sort of insight I felt was really
beneficial to the discussion folks
