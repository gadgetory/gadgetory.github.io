pocketnow.com recently we showed you a
tour of manila 2.6 also known as
touchflo 3d 2.6 this is HTC's interface
replacement for windows mobile that has
really become pretty prevalent on most
of their devices version 2.6 brings a
lot of changes to make it better for
finger friendly navigation if you didn't
see that video we'll put a link up at
the end of this video so you can check
that out we found some new features of
manila 2.6 that we didn't show on the
last video that have to do with
multimedia so we can slide over to the
right and go to the photos and videos
tab okay so here we are and just like
previous versions of touchflo 3d we can
kind of flick through our pictures and
have them float in space here and we can
stop on the picture that we want tap on
it and bring it up full screen now
what's different is what happens when
you turn your device over into landscape
so watch this so here we are in photos
and video go into landscape wow we get
this awesome animation and now we get
kind of the photo chooser in a in a
landscape view which is really nice it's
a little bit choppy right now but it's a
great way to kind of get a full screen
view of all the photos you have on your
device if you're showing somebody a
slideshow or something interesting on
your phone now we can tap the play
button to do a slideshow of the pictures
just like you could do on any other
version of touchflo 3d but now it's
really easily easily accessible through
this screen we can go back into portrait
and we get that animation the next thing
that is different in this version of
touchflo 3d is the music and video tap
so we go over to the right here and of
course we can place songs right from our
home screen but if we flip into
landscape we get a really cool animation
and beautiful cover flow that allows us
to flick through our music and we can
tap on one of them if we like it and we
get a sidebar come over here we can play
the music right from this screen
and you can hide that or bring it back
out press pause bring it back flip
through it again or you can just turn
over into portrait again and get the the
long view display and from here you can
flick through your cover flow too so as
we continue to see future versions of
touch glow 3d it's apparent that HTC
really wants to keep us in the touchflo
3d interface not have this drill into
the standard windows mobile interface
too much which is a little bit ugly and
not as nice as touchflo 3d and they've
done a good job at skinning the photos
and video tab and also the music tab to
really take advantage of more screen
space so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
