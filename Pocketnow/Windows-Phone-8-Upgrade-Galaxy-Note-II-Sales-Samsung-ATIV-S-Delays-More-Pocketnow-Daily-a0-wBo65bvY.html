the works samsung galaxy note 2 selling
5 million units so far and the samsung
achieve that seems to be delayed until
next year I'm hi meta Ravenna seriously
considering a phablet this time and this
is out daily you know three
years ago it would have been crazy for
anybody to consider using a phablet but
these days it does seem like if it's the
new mainstream Samsung has reported
sales of 2 million units in just one
month of the samsung galaxy note 2 which
sums up to 5 million units ever since
the device was launched if you think of
it that's better sales than a lot of the
smart phones in the market that are
considered flagship and now we've also
got rumors of the galaxy s4 being dubbed
the I 9400 just makes you wonder what
Samsung's up to because they're
currently unstoppable in the market now
sadly not everything is fun and games
for samsung because they're at eva's
Windows Phone the left us drooling back
at Aoife 2012 in Berlin hasn't been
pushed to the market yet and new reports
have that Samsung's pushing the launch
until early 2013 for at least some
markets so we were planning on getting
one this holiday season well I recommend
you look elsewhere we've gotta hand it
to LG though after being dubbed the
cheap smartphone company last year this
year they've broken some records with
their optimus G up to the point of
making it to the nexus program with the
LG Nexus 4 new reports have them working
on a 1080p display device beings up the
LG optimus g2 for sometime in spring
2013 maybe around May so say two of our
coverage of mwc in Barcelona because
most likely that's when will we see the
device now even though Android is
dominating the mobile space that doesn't
change the fact that Apple is still the
king and growth year over a year when it
comes to sales Black Friday alone
accounted for a 20 point seven percent
growth in sales for Apple just to give
you an idea that's eighty eight percent
of tablets sold in the market compared
to android and every other tablet in the
market so any of you predicting to the
mists of Apple in the next coming years
because of low sales you better look at
another company to pick on and finally
for the contradicting news of the day
Microsoft is already reportedly working
on an Apollo plus version of Windows
Phone 8 to be launched in
early 2013 but what gets funny here is
when asked about Windows Phone 7.8
because all they say is coming soon they
don't provide dates they don't provide
anything so that leads me to the
question of the day are any of you still
holding old windows phone 7 devices
waiting for windows phone 7.8 in my case
I'd pretty much got tired of it but
leave us a comment down below and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow us on
pacquiao com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
high metal iveta thanks for watching
