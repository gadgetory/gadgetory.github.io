it's a 2017 flagship but you can take a
look at the specs for yourself while I
talk about how light it is for its size
I'm feeling a little ambiguous about the
substantiality here it's thin but
there's a ton of surface area and while
the aluminum unibody is nice it just
feels weird running around the showroom
floor with the force in my hand it was
like cutting through air with a bird
wind now if you're worried about having
the phone slip out of your hands about
the most you'll break it's probably
going to be the camera glass remember
the droid turbo to that five layer
shatter steel displays on this phone
last time around we found it stretched
fairly easily so maybe we'll see it
lasts a bit longer this time obviously
the company went set up a whole drop
station demo if it wasn't confident
about its capabilities yes that battery
metric is correct two thousand seven
hundred thirty million hours way down
from the previous letter Z force which
by the way was seven millimeters thick
and just barely an improvement from the
regular Moto Z even thinner than this
thing right here if you want substance
to cover your device well you don't have
to get a style cover or a moto mod
accessory if you're new to this concept
and don't know what they are we have a
whole video to explain them out for you
there are two new mods for this radio
the first which we're going to review is
a moto 360 camera mod which will let
users pull off 4k VR live streams for
$300 that's a big sell we did see some
choppy frame rates on some units at the
event but we'll test things out in the
real world and get back to you the
second yet to be released is a gamepad
it's a drool-worthy piece of kit that
features a couple of sturdy control
sticks pebble ABXY buttons an okay d-pad
and click shoulder pads
obviously there are Bluetooth
controllers out there in the market but
with the direct pin connection onto your
moto z2 force there are no delays to
deal with it's like a Nintendo switch
just a bit more massive this might have
to fight with your laptop for room in
your backpack we wouldn't be surprised
to see this go for hundreds of
once it comes out and it gets
complicated when the phone itself goes
above 750 on average by the way did we
mention it's on the five major carriers
in the US that hasn't happened for a
long time now so it'll be interesting to
see if motorola can rack back up
customer loyalty but before you lock
your pre-order and maybe stay tuned with
us we have more coverage next week on
the Rosie to force at pocketnow.com our
social channels and here on our YouTube
page if you like what we do
