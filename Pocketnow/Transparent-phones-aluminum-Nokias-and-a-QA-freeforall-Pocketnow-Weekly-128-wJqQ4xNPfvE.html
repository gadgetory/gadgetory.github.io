shoot us an email and we'll see if we
can't answer your question on a future
show that HQ and if you're listening to
the HQ build of the podcast I forgot
there was something I please read read
write us a review on things yes enjoy I
we were talking off the air before we
went live folks about how we're all by
we're all I mean everyone in this room
is uh is so so completely dead tired and
and just beat to hell by this year and
I'm looking forward this year being over
not the sense that like a lot of people
a lot of sad people are like oh this
year's was worse blah blah blah it
wasn't it was great year but it was also
really taxing I'm about to take like
like a few days off
and that's gonna feel real and R&amp;amp;R yeah
but speaking of time often time away
Taylor Martin what the hell has been
going on man people when people are
tuning in to hear from you is what's
going on yeah I've gotten a lot of
comments and questions about it and in
fact that my favorite one so far is
actually in the comment thread on the
YouTube video or the stream yes that
when is Michael coming back on
untethered that's the question I won't
answer i understad i know because this
is one of our agreement we never we
never ended that agreement Michael know
that is true that it our strategic
strategic alliance for me to be on every
show that you are on me yeah that you
know how that goes yes I know and I i
I've been listening to untethered on
occasion I listened to the coffee
podcast where I learned and I was
telling the guys over at tech beard I'm
like man when I listen untethered I
learned I learned so much about Taylor
mark because just unstoppable gets on a
roll and then all of a sudden we're
hearing we're hearing so much about how
Taylor Martin drinks his coffee and I'm
like Hades Joshua Vergara on the show he
hasn't talked in 17 minutes oh there is
okay well that that's because my podcast
doesn't really have a host I like to
play the part of hosts oh but it's kind
of like a ship that no one steers let's
wait like the thing about it it's like a
raft floating down Larry well I hit
record and anything goes like know about
untethered right we've heard about onto
others before we talked about in the
show we haven't heard much about what's
been going on at mod so what have you
built on mod before we get into the news
Taylor what have you been teaching us
how to do since since your departure
well this is what I did yesterday which
is uh quarks are too big for this thing
they just are but it's a it's a one-off
for some Christmas presents oh oh so the
core get a bottom part in the top is a
custom carved and stained wood wouldn't
stop her type thing yeah organizers for
you know to piss off cocoon her mind is
gobbling up something it looks like a
circle 4095 by chef but this oh yeah
we're getting some mod music up in here
yeah but this is just an organizer like
oh it's got chapstick in it and like
toenail clippers this is the gridded
cocoon grid-it and it it's like a slide
stuffy like a little cheap one for like
I gotcha yeah um I've been making all
kinds of crap keychain and everything
they're all covered in sawdust when I
tried to search for my other men yeah I
got covered last night i was making uh
like 15 of these little wine stoppers oh
man yeah I my brother and and and my
sister-in-law made those for their
wedding and they didn't make him like
that tho those are cool they look like
wooden wooden future space crystals or
something there yeah yeah they're
geometric that's the only name like
multifaceted I don't know well looks
like the sort of crystal Stoppers you
get on like a fancy big brandy thing
except there would ya they're kind of
figure out how to build a lot of stuff I
want to do bigger mods but or projects
but I did I just have to build up to
those because some of them are massive
some of them are really expensive and
the one that is the most requested out
of all of the stuff I've ever done on
the channel is the second part to the
nexus 7 dash install in my car oh my god
yet people have been asking for that for
like over a year and they've been
begging me for it and I will do that
eventually I mean I'm I've got my nexus
7 up and running again and I will work
on that I plan to work on that a week
after Christmas just do you know how to
weld I I do know how to weld I don't
have a welder need to build your own
motorcycle this is an ex logical yeah
actually dude because the the let me
know when you get an oxy-acetylene torch
on mod because I want to see that in
action my dad has one there's a
gentleman I just about burn his entire
hand with that one time well it'll do
look good that's like aldus we're over
10,000 degrees like 2500 degrees ain't
no toy i braised together a real nice
driveway sign with an oxy-acetylene
torch and metal shop in high school
pistons yeah anyway listen uh we haven't
talked about technology because the news
well brief is um is still the news and
it's still here and steven has to tell
us about some things that are I think
Taylor to you and me equally infuriating
particularly this first time so let's
have jewels sound the news annunciator
and let's do this thing
businesses seek right to block Wi-Fi
hotspots Stephen what the is this
and our Oh soon until I burn down a
Marriott I probably not too soon I think
this has very low chance of actually
happening so the back story on this is
that this marriott hotel and conference
center somewhere down south fish might
be in your neck of the woods taylor it
got in trouble with the FCC earlier this
year because the conference center part
of it was blocking the portable Wi-Fi
hotspots on guests smartphone so they
would use their network infrastructure
at the hotel there to break the
connections between your smartphone and
your laptop to make it very frustrating
if you're trying to get online when
you're traveling of course the hotel
itself was selling its own Wi-Fi package
and you were used to paying a lot for a
level listener at a nice hotel you're
paying a lot extra for like a daily
Wi-Fi pass but for the conference it was
ridiculous it was like 200 to thirteen
hundred dollars depending on the length
of time you were there so this big money
at stake and the marriott decided it was
going to prevent people from using their
own devices FCC got when did to slap
them with a big ol multi
hundred-thousand-dollar fine but and
that should have been the end of the
story but then marriott came back like
well okay you said we couldn't do this
but thing is we really really want to do
it so they filed a formal petition with
the FCC seeking uh maybe some rules on
if and when this might be acceptable and
they're describing this not as a tool to
you know dr Wi-Fi purchases getting it
sometime or you know buying so many
megabytes from them they're not doing it
like that they're describing this as
network management in that somehow by
having these non official Wi-Fi hotspots
pop up in their conference center it's
undermining the integrity of their own
network and part of me thinks like okay
maybe I can see how this is a problem if
someone created a Wi-Fi AP on their
phone that was named very similarly to
the Marriott one and was running
proxy in there for looking for
unencrypted connections trying to grab
passwords in theory I can see a super
remote possibility that there could be
some nefarious actions being propagated
by people with their own portable
hotspot but by and large that's not what
we're doing we just want to get online
with our data plans with our devices
that don't have their own cellular
connections so really really hoping the
ecstasy doesn't buy this argument a
bunch of tech companies have already
stood up in opposed to marriott and
microsoft is one of them but then there
are also companies that have been
backing the marriott group and cisco
systems which surprisingly sells a lot
of the hardware that might be used for
the network management things that
Marriott wants to do and more than that
just I think was to keep the market open
for their Wi-Fi management tools in the
future comments are officially closed
FCC hasn't ruled either way on this so
we're probably fretting a little too
soon but not dropping the flip side of
this it is troubling and the flip side
of course is that at if you have a
network that is tuned to work in a
specific configuration as nacho king p
points out in the comments people coming
in and stepping all over it what they're
their own access points can really screw
it up for any of everyone trying to use
the in-house Network I but get it I
understand why I is unlicensed spectrum
it's open it's supposed to be able to
deal with competition from unwanted
signals there's your there's no
guarantee that the Wi-Fi system you go
to all this trouble a setup is going to
be able to function unmolested by
intrusive signals that's just as part of
the deal if you want something that has
a guaranteed set of the spectrum
allocated to you you can license it you
can pay a crapload of money to the FCC
but this is part of the deal when you go
into the Wi-Fi you accept that there is
going to be this the potential for
people interfering with it did I tell
you speaking of the jamming thing Tara
I'll let you go on a second did I tell
you the that when I was working in a bit
of a shopping mall and the guy the
jewelry store moved in and they didn't
want people using phones in their store
they put jammer and then a legal one
yeah they threw the pajama in and we
didn't know we were like what hell don't
any of our phones work on the 800
megahertz band in here what the hell is
going on we know this isn't a
straight-up jamming as far as I can tell
it's not because they're obviously
wanting to use their own signal they're
using Wi-Fi hardware I assume to do
thent acade connections between the
personal hot spots and the devices that
people use rather than just putting the
general kill filled out that knocks out
all Wi-Fi I do not support a Taylor what
was your where we gonna say well two
things there was a one guy who recently
got slapped with a huge fine for putting
a cell jammer in his car and driving the
highway oh yeah that's just dumb yeah he
was an idiot um but there's also this
really makes me like it kind of reminds
me of these press events that we go to
these one-off press events where they're
like 800 signals and you know what can
actually yeah yeah no one can actually
get any sort of data transfer whatsoever
because everything is trying to go the
whole entire system is clogged the
network everything is just it's a
traffic jam is what it is and that's the
only reason something like this might
make sense yeah but but anything I'm
talking about like convention there was
a lot of people with their own devices
in one place so it makes a little bit of
sense it's crappy but but even in that
case if they're that mini Tramp people
trying to use the Internet I can't
imagine that a single network is gonna
work better than 50 separate networks
like it just their solution benefits
them in them only and that's why I don't
like it now I think we'd still have to
keep in mind there are other ways to
tether your device without using live by
you can tether over USB you can tether
over bluetooth if it comes to it's
probably less convenient than the Wi-Fi
but not much less isn't it isn't the
data throughput significantly reduced if
you tether on bluetooth I don't know
what's bluetooths next alone I don't
know I mean to that have a surgeon the
data transfer rates of Bluetooth have
actually come up but I don't know if
you're no mega deck range I assume
well I guess we'll see how this develops
I hope that they get get smacked down
and and you know this does not become
more of a thing than it already is i
just said that's that's a lot of that's
pretty brazen just imagine a future tech
event or press event where you have to
go to this place and pay 200 dollars to
use the Wi-Fi for an hour yeah that's
the ramifications of something like this
honest i mean with like a backpack with
like a 500-meter spool of ethernet cable
yeah trailing vine all right Steven
what's uh what's next on the run down
here let me say where did the
transparent Firefox phones that can't
wait to talk about that am I wrong in
thinking this is the prettiest phone
I've seen in a while oh no it's not but
we can do that now you are not wrong
yeah so Japan is getting its first
Firefox OS phone the platform's been
around it feels like a couple years by
now it hasn't really gained much
traction in what it has been in the West
in Europe we've seen sales the u.s.
hasn't been too keen to pick up with it
but I think a lot of the pushback that
customers have had against it is the
phones themselves have been kind of
shitty they've been really really low
end we're talking half vga displays very
low end processors may be 3g
connectivity so anytime you have a
phones even approaching like a modern
mid-ranger its kind of reason to get
excited so this new firefox phone it's
called the FX 0 which it's neat it
almost looks like it's like a
hexadecimal address but it's not Khloe
could be but it's made by LG it's not
being promoted as such but this is LG
producing the hardware being sold in
japan on carrier KDDI starting christmas
day it's gonna run a little over four
hundred dollars and the hardware is very
mid-range II saw some commenters we're
comparing it to the new Moto G and
that's not too far off it's got a 720p
display it's 4.7 inches snapdragon 400
16 gigs of internal storage with microSD
expansion and this really cool
transparent look in case yeah it's gold
and I don't know about gold phones but
you can
inside and I know there's no plastic
shielding you can't see into like the
circuitry but you still see like the
microSD slot the sim card all the
speaker elements it's very early like
clamshell custom super clear I'm sure
he's there was one game intendo had all
these Game Boys there was a transparent
what I always want to reminds me a lot
of them cool though that was like a
purplish pink translucent casing this is
an ugly I like Nicole yeah I do not like
the bronze tone to it i'll give that i
like i like a hint of blue in my
transparent cases and if you can manage
it some flashing LEDs behind there too
but really you're so so sorry tech
looking i love the picture they have in
the press to make here which goes the FX
0 titled over and over it's so like the
matrix phone it's very matrix phone was
just gonna say that yes absolutely all i
can imagine you saying that they make
some flashing leds all i can imagine
with this phone is like it's one of
those those light up shoes the little
kid wears all mental start flashing for
like 30 seconds yeah a little and the
sequel is gonna have like the pump you
know you're gonna have like a thing on
the back lane a couple times on the
phone a tablet the next room well that's
right a wheel and you can use it as a
one wheeled skateboard absolutely now
the the thing about this is that Jules
is making me dizzy with that scroll the
thing with this is that it's 415 dollars
and for this kind of price tag
especially for the markets it's
apparently meant for that confuses me
yeah I was trying to see what like them
moto G goes for in Japan because I have
I don't have a great sense of comparison
for japanese film prices maybe this
isn't as steep as it seems for the
hardware I think it's kind of reasonable
but then again compared to existing
Firefox OS phones which are
significantly lower I don't know yeah
I'm not sure I mean it's interesting I
don't know enough about the pricing
structure in the markets this thing is
on sale for de to comment too far but
that commenter as you mentioned who said
that this is basically the same the same
thing as the g2 as the moto g2 rather
yeah spec-wise but
like you to look like this yeah I wish
the g2 came in a clear in a clear case
the bloomingdales edition not the
android tablet that we are divided about
the n1 is gonna launch in very early
2015 as yeah speaking of stuff happening
in Southeast Asia we knew that the
tablet was coming to the mm would go for
sale in China in the first quarter of
the year and I think they even mentioned
owns from the commenters mentioned that
it was confirmed by the chinese new year
which is the middle of februari now we
heard this January seventh date which is
as nearly early 2015 as you can get
that's just for China and we know that
nokia has said the N 1 will be released
in other markets around the world I
think at least Europe was confirmed on
there but we don't have any sense of the
timetable if that's like later in q1 q2
q3 who knows at this point but just
getting it out there I think would be a
great start and we could finally start
hearing some first-hand accounts of what
this thing's like to use if that Intel
chip is as powerful as it needs to be
how it holds a candle to the nexus 9 and
other android tablets similar form
factor and considering how low the
prices on here this is a a really really
compelling bargain tablet and what it's
like to what it's like to buy it I'm
what it's like to deal with Foxconn
sales and customer support I missed this
comment before we moved on but in the
Q&amp;amp;A Dante solo button says I'm old I
love the idea of a transparent phone I
also want to have bean bag chair in my
room and an Optimus Prime bed cover
retro phones for the win outstanding and
I dig it the final bit of news is the
lumia 1320 successor which segues nicely
into into the first QA we're going to
hit after this for me I don't know what
it will do for you guys but this is
rumored as a significant upgrade rather
than what a forgettable one Steven yeah
talking about I'm kind of confused by
the Houthis rumor fits in with some of
the other things we've been hearing
about Windows Phone because this is I
don't know whether considers a flagship
or not it's getting a supposedly a 14
megapixel PureView camera but it would
stick with a lower end SOC I believe
that we say of step tracking 400
here yeah for Snapdragon 400 yeah so cuz
i'm considering we heard a rumor like a
week or so ago that microsoft might not
have another Lumia flagship until far
late in 2015 something right in
September maybe August this guy it
sounds like we're talking about it a lot
sooner um I mean there's no specific
date attacked it is because hearing but
at this point you have to assume they
will be out a lot in advance of that
late 2015 date I guess it doesn't count
as a flagship and would fit in with that
but it doesn't I mean it's a 720p
display and a friend but I Snapdragon
400 yeah but I mean like they're still
very clear straight striations in the
windows phone ecosystem and this is
decidedly on exciting loving it yeah i
mean the 1320 hi my makes good point in
the in his first lie near the high may
at their the 1320 was buried by the 15
20 when it went out you know came out
and certainly if you're looking to save
some money and you just wanted a big
screen you didn't want all the power but
i've never liked you know between the
galaxy mega and all those those devices
of universe really it's the 15 30 when i
hear about not some 1330 exactly right
and if we're not going to be hearing
about him for a long time that's
frustrating uh speaking of that what was
the worst brand the one that
disappointed you guys most this year
thanks Bruno Gomez asked and I utilized
that segue because you know it if you
had asked me this question two weeks ago
I wouldn't have been sure what to say
but with all this friggin talk with with
if this rumor is true and even if it's
not true the fact that I don't have a
1020 replacement here that I don't have
a follow-up to the 930 or the 1520 even
though it's a little early for the 930
the fact that we're not ending the year
on a really high-end Microsoft flagship
really really frustrates me and I think
Microsoft is the most disappointing to
me in that sense just because they
failed to keep up the the frequency of
updates that means necessary on the high
and now we talked about this a lot last
week so I'm not going to go into it too
much but Stephen yeah well I guess I
guess
remember that we were definitely at this
point not getting a surface mini tablet
this year I know it was kind of pushed
under the tool I had been holding out
hope maybe it would pop up in like late
November or something but I guess it's
not going to happen oh I was using the
surface pro 3 to uh to clean my lumia by
the way so I I finally got back on my
1020 last night and I was using the
house surface pro 3 to use the Lumia
recovery tool so I can start from
scratch that was a lot of fun but I
remembered what it was like to use
windows on the desktop and like I was
installing the microsoft software i was
installing like the Lumia recovery tool
it was like do you want to enter your
password so that we can make changes to
the system alright sweet and then it's
like oh it wants a it wants security
clearance to change this aspect of the
system and render your system password
okay fine seriously three seconds later
it's like it needs to change this other
aspect of the system enter your password
again it's like don't need to enter your
password i guess like yes each time you
do you need to i mean the way that our
service pro is three is set up its it's
apparently just the most secure settings
you can choose that no but i was so feel
the same one that that Adam Lane had
yeah yeah oh my god because the
passwords is not just you have to enter
the password is the password is so
ludicrous and weird he is it is weaker
but so share our passwords on the air
yeah Taylor you're still working with a
with it with a mac but in your off time
do you have any exposure to any windows
products and you're in your outside life
not anymore not right now I'm shaking my
face right here um I mean I have an old
tower from probably 1995 nicely runs
under the surface pro 3 okay it does not
now the service pros reruns well it's
just ask for information every time I
want to move the mouse pointer okay I
really wish my time with the surface pro
3 hadn't been so tainted with power
issues I really do now because now I
couldn't get the thing to turn on half
the time like I literally like I would
leave it charging overnight and unplug
it and then take it somewhere and it
it we can do anything about that yeah
yeah and that's been solved it seems but
I don't say because I didn't get to that
question thank you very much as I want
to say that I'm disappointed with every
brand because I stepped away from the
mobile market for two months now and I
was expecting like 16 core processors
like 40 megapixel cameras on every thumb
bigger screams before gigs of RAM is
finally gonna happen something it's been
two months guys come on yeah come on
should have phones with with rocket
boosters on him but yeah exactly god I
saw that for a gig headline and I was
like God why it which is why why why
bother because fix the underlying issues
first yes yes thank you Michael don't
make me wait no I'm multitasking to want
it to fix the underlying issues than
phones or apps will be using like 20-30
megs of ram not 300 a pop it's not the
memory management it's that apps are
demanding too much memory to begin with
hmm now is this might be a long debate
mmm do you have an answer Steven to your
brand oh I am I don't know and I kind of
want to hold off because i feel like
isn't this one of the collaborative
things will be addressing in the days to
come at the end of the year course it's
the end of the year so I'm disappointed
in so many things i'll have to to pick
one in particular I'm gonna have to
think about it yeah Bruno stay tuned
we're gonna run a piece on this so thank
you for for submitting that I don't know
anything about games guys and maybe you
can help me with this hey guys has Dante
so little boat head now Nintendo have
announced they're working on the next
gen console what what do you think of
the rumors of a Nintendo smartphone
would a phone with exclusive access to
Nintendo apps be a winner no no I don't
think she also didn't the wii u come out
like a year ago three years ago but it's
something also u-shaped i believe but I
don't know that was the coolest aspect
of the Nintendo you was its shape
anandpur portability but that's it like
yeah every time like it and go ahead of
town i'm sorry i was just saying
nintendo is really struggling right now
to find something compelling
yeah I think Nintendo is going to end up
like Sega did and become a software
company maybe I know any time they have
so many games that are classics that
people's yeah well yeah the most
valuable thing is they're their game at
the hardware is not good look at what
happened every brand that's tried to
build their own smartphone recently you
had view at facebook facebook tried it
twice and that's frickin facebook cred
but maybe the worries you well the
chacha the salsa and the HTC first right
there was another HTC phone I can't
remember there was another phone I don't
remember which one it was they tried it
before it ever made it to market I wrote
about it one time okay Roger yeah yeah i
think is sony and what it's been able to
do in smartphones and consoles which I
mean xperia play from a while back kind
of crashed and burned do either you have
a playstation 3 and i've tried using it
with an xperia phone so no there's some
level of connectivity between them but
expect just imagine how well it works
yes for Joshua Vergara from android
authority alta ps4 almost specifically
so he could also get the tablet z
compact and play his s4 games from a
tablet and I don't know that's badass
yeah I don't know if he's actually done
that yet but that's something I would
like to try out that would be so sweet
being able to like lay in bed and play a
full-fledged console game from a tablet
on your bed just totally agree it's like
Nvidia is trying to do with the shield
and the streaming from geforce cards on
the pc yeah but that one that one is so
neat like how many people actually pizza
not not imitate the really good video
card and the console hardware right so
who actually has that specific video
card and an nvidia tablet and wants to
do that like I that's about trying it I
think mine technically would work but I
was warned it's such on the bottom end
of the spectrum that it would be a
unbearably laggy experience worried to
try it so I haven't even ventured into
that I just wish it was I think it might
be Matt compatible I don't
member because i have an nvidia graphics
card in this macbook but i don't know if
its high-end enough to do that and
that's what i was looking into because
they were also offering that with the
shield but they didn't roll it out fast
enough before i had to get the shield
back to Brandon so I was really upset
this is a nice question that we all
three of us I think can have an opinion
on ello gentlemen says serve on Hutton
horan and I think I got close I would
like to know what you guys love and hate
about lollipop some are just got my note
3 with antigen mod 12 bumped up to five
dead 02 and I can honestly say I am
loving it also do any of you run custom
roms on your smartphone I don't do
custom roms do you guys used to I want
to get back to it I'm so dissatisfied
with lollipop stock I've been trying
roms ever since I left pocket now just
you know dabbling here and there and
just trying to make the most of this
inmate because it's starting to feel a
little old to me I still like it but
it's I just it needs something and I'm
done with since for now I converted it
back to a gpe and now it's running
official lollipop from google but i did
try signage ahmad and all these
different roms and it's just such a
hassle to like keep everything updated
and upgraded and current and i just said
screw it i'm going back to stock but
lollipop so far I really like it I
really do there are some things that
actually Dustin pointed it out to me
before we started recording the last
untethered um the colors some of the
colors and lollipop are hideous the
dialer is pretty bad but the calculator
is so ugly at sea foam green like who
chose that color why did I switch back
to Windows Phone before this vodka I
don't have I don't even have all I
population here here I'll show you like
no like I don't you think is the timer
like the timer and the clock and the
alarm clock those are all finished in
this like move or this is this odd
violet color that's just odd it's not
and there's a lot of sherbet in lollipop
I feel like like the cameras yeah oh
word like that is hideous what is that
what do you what kind of screen are you
even showing us there's like it's split
there's an office oh it's the calculator
yes the calculus this one out menu for
the calculator ah okay okay also um just
to the the many people out there who
like the new action launcher i would say
action launcher pairs perfectly
perfectly with lollipop because all
these other launchers get one thing
wrong and that is the the google now
integration this integrates perfectly
with google now still swipe to the right
okay and it's there but you also get
your app drawer and a bunch of you swipe
in from the bezel I said the new action
launcher good so many people ask me so
many questions about phones still and I
just can't answer them Justine well I I
Steven and I were on opposite sides of
the fence here because I couldn't stand
earth Steven couldn't stand a lot of
things about lollipop and I actually
really really really liked it I really
really like some things it's just it's
not enough to put me over the fence yeah
for me I've been running it on my Moto X
since I i finally got my update on the
Moto X and for the first like four days
ish was nice and then something happened
and I don't know what that something was
who knows that it wasn't me for sure but
something changed and suddenly my Moto X
started running like utter crap and now
i'm waiting for a lollipop on the Moto X
just as I waited for it on the Nexus 6
and it's it's just like it's so
frustrating to have lag honest on a
stock build or a near stock build of a
modern version of Android M you you
shouldn't be waiting for any modern
version enter oh god this no moment
realized I've been for like weeks now
dismissing Nexus 5 persistent it's time
for you to upgrade to lollipop
notifications they stopped appearing
I've been clicking later for weeks and
weeks and weeks it finally got the
message it got the hint that you didn't
want it I do want to say like I have one
gripe about lollipop yeah one so far
that I've actually really ran into I can
deal with colors the biggest problem is
no actual silent mode it's coming in the
next one well there is it it was an
actual sound getting everyone like just
keep pressing volume down
silent that's coming back you can int
just volume down and then put your phone
down you have to volume down in the tap
like yeah indirectly that's great and
that's an annoying because totally
annoying yeah because you know we go to
vibrate and I don't want like the
problem is that for some reason with the
new update I've been having issues with
Android wear and lollipop on the phone
where if I say silence the connected
phone it won't silence it'll just
vibrate oh that's the worst in vibrate
is your silence as we know oh my god so
I've been my i phone buzzes my m8 buzzes
and my watch buzzes and I'm just yeah
mmm Nathan that makes a good point he
says the browser bar colors are really
cool I do like that i like how the
notification bar now the color shifts
and adapts to whatever the palate of the
app you're in as i really like that
there that that's where luckily that's
where a chance for me is the really
really really small stuff the the
attention to tiny little details i love
that hate the multitasking though well
here's a here's another example of how
that's cool in action launcher i don't
know if you can actually see it the
search bar is yellow and it holds that
from the wallpaper and i'm using music
that's kind of neat so if i go to musee
and skip to the next wallpaper whatever
the color is when i go home was there we
go it kind of like a home other words it
keeps the color of whatever the
wallpaper is in the up wallpaper changes
every few hours that's pretty neat so
that's probably my favorite thing
although it's not working right now
that's my point like there it is it's
the small stuff it's a tale that
lollipop really wins that is just broad
performance where it suffers and i don't
think it's thanks to those animations i
think that that's it's an easy
conclusion to draw it's an easy thing to
pin the blame on but i don't i really
don't see those animations taking up so
many processor cycles I mean Apple can
do it just fine windows phone can do it
just fine Taylor showing us something
else better and so it's red there was a
main red color in there
bar and it changes the app drawer color
everything everything changes with it
and it's so nice everything changes
listener mail let's let's take a break
from the QA get into listener may a
little bit Jules why don't you let us
know when we can proceed by using the
webos pong bone sure sure or tough spot
you know whatever whatever however we
want to do it man music sex listen it's
your show man do it gadgets in hand
tough spot you know we'll just run
through the whole board hey the first me
up mails from men new yen who's written
to us before and this is something I can
talk about since i'm back in lumia 1020
when you guys commented on the state of
windows phone last week the panel
commented about the absence of the
platform and a flagship level and how
there's speculation that there will be
no flagship for the company until the
autumn of next year right so with that
information in mind i keep forgetting
about that one inmate i keep forgetting
to mention the damn one I made but it's
just a fab rates from a brain sorry
that's on the barrel that's me so with
that information in mind is there any
reason at all to buy a windows phone I'm
a windows phone user and while i love
the OS I'm seriously asking myself the
same question no your opinion you guys
are doing great job keep it up also
happy holidays guys Taylor says no happy
holidays to you man day and Taylor
justify your answer I being so far away
from windows phone has made me just care
less and less about it I have no no
windows phone no Mike yourself devices
in my possession in my I can't see why I
would want I would even recommend it to
anyone hey I finally respond that people
using it in public which I've never seen
before yeah I see it actually quite a
bit in Boston but it's all the low-end
stuff I see tractors and big trucks
mm-hmm um but a lot of wrangler jeans
around oh yeah we're gonna do
interesting I so the reason that I
wanted to read this one is not to have
an answer prepared but to say that I am
in the midst of try
to find out an answer for you men
because I was in danger of being in
Taylors shoes as I've said many times on
the show before i go from review device
to review device and usually that means
android cuz android is dominant right
now so i spent a long time not using
Windows Phone and now as of last night
I've switched back to my 1020 I'm very
happy to be back on it I was happy to
set up windows phone 8 dot one from
scratch and I'm going to spend the next
week or so determining how much I what
what of Android i miss on Windows Phone
how Windows Phone has grown since my
last Windows Phone review which was the
one I made for windows and whether i
want to spend part of the next year on
the platform as well so look for a piece
on that the announcement piece will be
tonight i think and then the conclusions
will be in about a week from now so all
we will see yeah it's convenient time
control what are you doing another voice
control challenge document no no no it's
not because it's not like it's it's
specifically not that it's like I'm
trying Windows Phone for seven days I'm
a freaking hero it's not that because i
own the 1020 already i 1 i've wanted to
go back to it for a long time but now
when you have very high profile people
in the industry leaving windows phone
and writing about how they're leaving
with this phone i just wanted to take
the office attack i wanted say okay i've
been away from it for a while let me go
back to it and see what's worth staying
for and interestingly or not it's not
interesting it's just it's interesting
to me so i'll share it my roommate and i
have been playing through the entire
halo series so I've got Cortana on the
brain like crazy because she's a big
part of that series and it's nice to be
able to have a virtual assistant with a
personality whereas Google now is
awesome and i adore Google now I'm gonna
miss it really hard but it's just nice
to like you've no connection to google
now exactly it's nice to have an
attachment to my personal assistant I
don't need to be attached to a computer
good for you
and so I'm sorry that you're playing
through halo that's such a terrible game
series oh man our own works to talk to I
for all the times you've accused me of
being a hipster friend I want to I want
to inform you that you your plaid
stripes are starting to come through on
that shirt right there you want to watch
out for the actually on the beds the
plans on the bed right no bad see they
did you sleep in it that's the problem
no I just never halos never appealed to
me ah that's so fascinating we're gonna
move on from that yeah go ahead I want
to say in it's sort of relative I want
to try the blackberry classic yeah yeah
we talked about on the passport this
week I no no no the classic math
apparent I know but if you're gonna
accuse a blackberry phone for the past
six month the classic is just like a
cute n in a shiny new package yeah but
the passport is a dope like a ridiculous
flying mattress well BlackBerry's
ridiculous this is this useful as the
passport this right here is the same
shape and sizes password mm-hmm nobody
needs that I got I got holes I don't
need a password actually just wear that
some black breakfast out there the other
day that's all it was like you too I
don't know in the blue flashes is
inspiring that and a lot of people I I'm
with you one hundred percent every back
track pads I which blackberry loved me
enough and you how much I used to love
them to send me want to be like hey
tried again but they don't I've said so
many terrible things about blackberry
that they just want you back but you
don't even know who I am anymore than
we've talked a lot about that I'll show
to we're not going to do it again we're
done with that we're moving on and we're
not we're not holding on to the past
who's next it's um it's Roy and Roy has
something to say Steven why don't you
give voice to his social concerns Roy
says hi to michael in the rest of the
pocket now team and asks do you guys
think that 2013 was a better smartphone
year compared to 2014 I've been
disappointed with most phones released
this year here are a few of my
disappointments nokia lumia 1020 vs well
it has no real competition on the high
end imaging
the nexus 5 vs nexus 6 with the six
coming inexpensive and a little bulkier
for some tastes the Moto G upgrade this
year we got a larger Moto G but not much
changing under the hood galaxy s4 vs s5
whether or not the design changes to
that dimple band-aid back were really an
improvement or not also in samsung
territory note 3 vs note for a better
stylist and he thinks note for feels
better but didn't really think the other
upgrades were worth moving to a new
model see some more here uh m7 vs m8
again design issues feeling inmates a
little too tall moto x yeah we got
better specs compared to release the
Moto G oh great situation but different
look and maybe the dimple on the back of
the smaller one that really fit right in
your planning a dimple anymore guess
that flat panel in the back was a study
attraction yeah oh and the iphones 5s vs
6 plus well that's pretty obvious bigger
screen but is this something that you
know Apple users have been asking for or
uh co and once I oh I yes I think on the
smaller devices as well um that's a lot
of territory to cover there um I kind of
agree with some of the points especially
when we're looking at these individual
models that we really liked last year or
expecting big things from their
successors I'll agree I kind of prefer
the look of the old moto x I think the
Moto G should have been more very upset
about the nexus 6 we were just talking
about how we wish there was a new 1020
he kind of has some points here he has
some points when I'm half and half with
it like for example that moto G the Moto
G on the Moto X both yeah I liked the
idea of the motor I loved my first moto
x sure but when I hold the new Moto X
next to my old moto x I'm like the old
one feels definitely less well made it
feels like there's a lot more plastic in
and you can tell and you know that's
that's so frustrating even though the
new X is kind of a weird mutant I like
the m8 even though it also is a weird
mutant compared to the m7 which is kind
of a gel disagree on
samsung's I like Samsung phones this
year yeah I disagree on the samsung's
too because the s4 was like the most
boring flagship I'd ever seen out of
Samsung it was like a dollar s3 with a
bunch of features that sucked if they
weren't useless where's the s5 brought
waterproofing at least of which I think
to was it was a pretty practical
addition it may be the heart rate thinks
a gimmick but it's something new there
trying all thrown in there on the
hardware side so yeah and then the note
3 verses don't for I certainly disagree
with this better stylist and feeling Han
but not worth the upgrade no I disagree
I mean it's a major upgrade yeah I'm you
know it was one of the best seasons ever
made that feel in hand is a major
improvement totally major and I was
carrying the note 4 to power the gear s
which this is a moto 360 the gear s
which I whose review goes live tonight I
didn't mind it was there was the first
time in a while where I had to go back
to a samsung phone to support an
accessory and I was like I actually
didn't mind I was like all right this is
the note for this is my buddy it's
awesome it's like so so no I don't think
2014 was materially different than it
wasn't it less disap was more
disappointing than 2013 I don't think so
no what do you guys think Taylor I think
it's the rate at which we're improving
and advancing is slowing down and that's
visible this year but i don't think that
affects the quality of the products all
that much i think they're improving
enough but you have to set your
expectations because you can't advance
at the same rate forever you just can't
that's not going to happen I mean if
that were the case we would have
insanely powerful phones they would be
paper-thin and probably completely
translucent by next year you know like
yeah it doesn't happen you have to gauge
those expectations and I actually
stepping out of the industry for a while
I started to not miss the new phones but
I guess opine for the newer models that
I never actually got to try because I
don't get to try them anymore like I'm
really craving a moto x me when
really really bad and the Nexus 6 the
nation is cognac leather one why Brandon
is selling his cognac leather moto x oh
I'd love that but I'm broke as hell well
if last year is any indication we're
gonna see big discounts on the Moto X
come January that's when motorola really
started pushing the original model
probably very true yeah but once you
gauge your expectations you're not
setting yourself up for so much
disappointment if you're expecting
everything via quantum leap from the
last phone you're gonna be disappointed
even more every single year quantum
leaps are small leaps not baked falafel
or or mac wanna bleep a giant leap there
yeah that's that one that's all but but
you get my point like if you're excited
I didn't know that every user yeah you
are setting yourself up for a
disappointment it's all there is a good
point so you want to you want it
tailored we didn't we weren't able to
send you the mail because apparently oh
you're ever email from me gets auto
archived and your gmail in fact yeah I
don't know why that is you may have been
sending me emails this whole entire time
and I've not gotten them so I'm apron
you'll never know you'll never know
working on a spam this is the final one
from who did it Luis hi their pocket no
team I listen to the show every week
while commuting in Sao Paulo Brazil as
we spend many hours and try lyrics here
you should have at least a 10 hour
podcast to given through the whole week
sorry I'm not going yeah thanks for the
brilliant job you guys do thanks for
listening when questioned google glass
seems to be delayed now basically
because of social acceptance issues
don't you think Google should change
lanes here and position this product as
a fitness tracker no I would love to
have something like that with the
following features GPS sweat-proof
materials GoPro like features music play
call answering real-time fitness data
standalone operation this would make a
lot of sense and I think a lot of people
would jump into this concept thanks a
lot regards Louis tube things Stephen
and then I'm gonna let you go one Louise
I think you are not wrong i think a lot
of people would probably jump on it but
to I don't think enough wood to justify
the transformation of glass which is
kind of in a category of its own into a
category that is so friggin crowded
right now because everyone it seems
everyone who can get ahold of low-cost
components and a reasonable design that
like attaches to your body somehow is
making fitness trackers and I think tell
me if I'm wrong guys cuz this might just
me be me hating fitness culture again
but I think even if you're a fitness guy
at work or lady you're probably burned
out on fitness crap by now cuz there's
so much of it out there marana yeah and
I don't know that I mean I'm not a super
fitness guy but I can't imagine you get
very useful data out of a lot of these
for like aerobic exercise maybe but if
you're you involved in any sort of you
know workout plan where you're lifting
and you want I mean you can track data
with these apps if you're manually
ending things but they're not going to
provide you any useful feedback on
muscle mass fat percentage the things
you need to know to know if you're
making progress yeah no no I mean making
a Tony and Jaime on here yeah exactly
and we've seen a samsung for example
bring out some really really great
health features that that really does do
a great job of monitoring everything
from your diet to your caloric X you
know expenditures to your blood oxygen
level and you're at least you don't get
something while you're running like you
know like that's that's a crappy thing
but it's a really good sweet it's a
really really good offering and that's
built right into your phone and if you
want to expand it a little bit you've
gotta watch to do it I got more to the
point of this question here of the this
feature list here nine out of ten wasn't
a most of them there would work just
fine as a SmartWatch nothing about
fitness tracking makes sense in the
besides video recording like a GoPro
nothing makes sense with a head based
form factor right and I'd like the idea
because it is an interesting way if it
were not Google if it were a company
with without Google's resources who
really needed to make glass a hit or die
I could totally see them doing this
because it's not a bad conversion right
i mean i understand why you would think
this i think it is a very smart idea but
i also don't I don't I don't see it
being successful
think is a smart idea in theory I think
it would not work well in execution
Taylor what do you think you've lost
like ten pounds in the last two months
right no I have not I was fighting when
I gained it back at 15 guys trip oh okay
listen that was what i was referring
jose i read me love about your then you
went to five guys and then what and then
I'm back where I started no well they do
things your bangs are doing a good job
because you can look very you always
look very cut and like you know like
chef felt in your in your Instagram
photos all rights thank you last night
was all the sawdust though that was a
sawdust that's right just gives you a
lot of texture um no there's only been
one fitness tracker I mean I've tried
like four or five of them there's only
been one that has ever peeled to me and
I think apple acquired it I can't
remember the name of it but the only
reason it was actually any different is
because it would actually track your
caloric intake um I don't know if I
mentioned that on the coffee podcast
because all like entering all the food
you ate no no no it used some sort of
light data to actually measure some sort
of influx in your bloodstream like light
technology I have no idea what it is how
it's powered is it requires right there
but if it did any sort of even remotely
um I'm just I was googling looking for
the name of this company and just
stumbled across a story someone wrote on
the site techhive wearable snake oil the
search for automatic calorie intake
tracking took a headline but if this
thing we're even remotely accurate with
your caloric intake and even remotely
accurate measuring your output or how
many calories burned then for me it
would be worth it because the only thing
that really makes these things worth it
is if you're actually taking the step to
track your own calories and do
everything that it asks you to do and
then at the end of the day you're left
with usually some some number that means
absolutely no nothing it's arbitrary it
has no real-world value like the Nike
Fuel points or the point you rack up
using a fit
like it just doesn't make much sense uh
arrow yes where is that arrow a ir Oh
Jules is bringing up hopefully in the
chat for us yeah that's the one it was
um so it was supposed to track your
stuff if i'm not mistaken apple bought
them or something i don't know what
happened there but outside of actually
like using scientific and inaccurate
numbers these fitness trackers are doing
nothing to actually help you there just
gamifying a fitness game is that not
helping though that gets you excited
about being active even if it's not
giving you useful quantitative info if
you're exercising that's probably a good
thing right but there's a problem with
the game of fine just about anything and
that's then it usually kind of wears off
after know like after a certain amount
of time because it requires your friends
to also gamify their fitness and if
everyone doesn't keep it up one falls
off then everybody falls off and
everybody stops because that's not fun
anymore what good is it to compete with
yourself like it's just so that they all
hinge on compete our competition and if
you don't have those people there to
compete with it's just I've tried them
all I was very very adamant about
sticking to the nike+ fuelband I did
four five six months and then all of a
sudden I'm like why why do I care if I
get to 10,000 or five thousand or 40,000
and one day doesn't matter as long as
I'm actually doing a little exercise so
that the problem is that they're all
arbitrary and at some point the the
newness and fundus of meeting your goals
every day wears off that's just my
person so we've got seven know it well
said well said to the both of you and we
had plenty of responses in the in the QA
and I think you know what we should get
next time we have high may or Tony on
the show will take some more fitness
questions until then I'm gonna fall
asleep if we keep talking about it so
I've been dropping on the Moto X from
Brandon where is that though well he's
not it's not don't know stay tuned in
with us because he was talking to me
privately about because I was asking him
for input before i published the leather
durability report what if the new this
from sunny Kyle kalra and I
we all can comment on a little bit what
if the new HTC hema maybe the m9 packs a
1080p screen would you be disappointed
with everyone coming with a 2k display
also I am most excited about this
flagship than any other debt build
quality sticking tongue out face you're
supposed to make the face Michael not
read it me I have an audio audience that
I that I respect and enjoy listen here
no no no no I wouldn't be disappointed I
would love it if HTC did a 1080p screen
on that device I don't need 2k at this
size no one really needs it and for the
love of God stop it everyone just stop
it now that being said that being said
if HTC does this I have no doubt that
they will suffer in terms of sales
figures in part because of this because
people have been brainwashed into
thinking that they need 2k and they just
don't but that doesn't matter because
it's it's one of those specs that you
don't need two K's because we're getting
their assholes right right near is
better both more better right I get the
phone with more geez yes exactly so it's
sunny will be talking all about the m9 a
lot this coming year ever feeling so
don't worry about it but listen this is
directly tied into Bruno gum as a
question I can't get how brands don't
focus on bigger batteries don't you guys
do you guys think brands will focus more
on longer battery lives in 2015 through
no this is they've been doing it it's
not going turbo as a 39 million power
battery the Nexus 6 is a 32-20 the note
4 has a three course the notes gonna
write but the point is as we've said on
the show a lot and as I've said in a lot
of my reviews and as I think an
editorial set in our site based on my
recommendation 2014 is the year of huge
batteries and only average endurance
because of those a 2k screens to a
certain degree not in Taylor taught us
right right yeah it's not every time but
Taylor set my brain correctly here in
some cases those big-ass panels are
indeed causing this battery drain okay
yeah and and it would stand the reason
that if there are efficient 2k displays
you would have even more efficient 1080p
screens so boom boom yes so yeah Bruno
it's not that the battery sizes are not
there but manufacturers are bringing the
added you know wat hours it's that
they're being utilized for features that
people have convinced themselves are
important and it's stupid give me that
4-inch WVGA phone with the 4000 milliamp
battery word up man I don't know about
that is it 1080p Svein and if it's lower
than 4.7 inches 720p works but that's
the threshold there there I want to know
what you guys are thinking about this
because I've ever feeling there's a
disagreement brewing are you sad there's
no G flex 2 out yet thought LG would
keep pushing curved displays XP Romania
I am gonna be happening I think I lost
no sleep there's enough flex to I've
been losing a lot of things part of the
reason i'm so exhausted I just can't
can't go to sleep at night because I
don't have a G flex 2 i love the g flex
and i really want to G flex 2 and I'm
hoping that we will see ones here hold
your breath I'm doing it you know have
an awesome feature called image
retention shut your mouth it's like a e
ink display you never knew you wanted
but right yeah a saved power because it
doesn't have to refresh do i do hope
that if there is G flex 2 they solve
that Vernon problem because that was
rather extreme it is it is good yeah um
stephen s can an interesting question no
he doesn't dushyant sri asks an
interesting question how do you guys
manage all your devices in long-haul
international flights with the
individual carrying limits and whatnot
I've never run into a carrying lemon for
mobile devices I've actually worked in
general you have carry on limits but
smoke phones are small you can fit a
bunch of a min oh you can stack so many
of them in and I carry them on my person
to cuz I'm too afraid to check him you
have your holster got a couple in your
pocket yeah come well d-west pouches
right here and there are no pants that I
like so much but no I always get scared
rolling into security especially in
other countries i don't know what's what
their thing is like the
here's a guy with 10 phones and two
tablets what's his problem but no I've
never been stopped for my bag of
electronics I got stopped for a candle
on my bag once but that was that was on
the way back from Berlin yeah we like to
freshen up our room yeah we have to
check out the latest wikileaks thing
they leaked a couple see CIA guides on
how to get things through Airport
customs you can get tips from the pros
on how to smuggle all your devices
through oh really I've never struggled
with that I think to vit I think every
time I go into an airport I'm like
they're gonna check me they're gonna
check me and they pulled me to the side
once because I had so many phones and
tablets oh they did yeah that was the
first time I went to sea ES and or the
second time I went to see yes and I had
probably 15 phones in my bag three or
four times macbook air and who knows how
many cables and they pulled me to the
side and pulled everything out of my bag
and checked it and put everything back
in oh like making sure that wasn't
really nervous absolutely yeah I was
really nervous going throught eagle on
the way back but it was fine no problem
I was mostly nervous because my bag
barely zipped like I had to wake rinche
it down and zip it back and you know I
didn't like opening a spring snakes in a
can like ever tablets flying everywhere
this is something I've never heard of
before in my life but it's interesting
Dante solo but says just wondering can
we remind people getting smart phones
this Christmas or Hanukkah or whatever
not to test them by calling the
emergency service what they have better
things to do than make sure your cell
phone works before you get your SIM card
obviously but who does that I don't know
like ice don't say I I looked up I tried
to look up this question while you guys
were talking and to see if there was any
trend if they're animators are you I
haven't seen like do you not believe
that the circular radio works you
checking voice quality with the
emergency operator Yeah right why your
phone from a known thief like yeah
what's the weather Elmo Rangers thing
but don't do it don't call anyone less
you wanna hear noise quality and you
don't have your sim yet put it in a
Wi-Fi download skype and give that a
spin blackity black that's what we're
talking about that was a um it was a
really new cool news story recently
about android skype vulnerability no no
no metal oh that was a guy he was
30-some years old but he was operating
at like a think of seven or eight year
olds level he had a someone had given
him an old unlike no longer used phone
to listen to music with and he kept
dialing 911 on accident over four
thousand times in a week dan and the the
dispatch office because they felt so bad
for him they actually bought him a new
ipod and gave him a hundred dollar
itunes card and a Merry Christmas and
took his phone from him here it was so
nice it's such an awesome thing like I
gave my mama phone to play with and get
familiar with that's only a Wi-Fi
there's no sim in there and you get that
emergency calls only screen all the time
and i put in airplane mode eventually
but it would be nice if there was just
some permanent switched other than
airplane to say just don't use the
cellular connection not interested
youngest wouldn't even show up as an
option this one has been uploaded
significantly and we've talked about it
before in the show but because it's the
most upvoted question i feel like we
have to address it and then after this
will do maybe two more than we gotta get
out of here guys why do you think the
Amazon fire phone failed asks Zachary
hey be bad carrier option pad OS bad
price bad everything I'll answer this
first bad carrier option no I I think if
a phone is appealing enough you you'll
jump carriers for it 18 s he proved that
with the iphone i think that was
overblown bad OS no i don't think so i
think it was actually pretty good
software bad price yes it was horribly
overpriced and that was the major
problem bad everything no i think
everyone thinks that because it got such
poor reviews i thought it was a great
phone with the wrong price tag what do
you guys think I kind of got everything
you know that everything's the obvious
answer there but I'm reading your review
Michael it seemed like maybe the OS
itself wasn't bad but the issues that
have brought with specifically app
access and being pushed into the Amazon
Appstore we use the side effect of not
having Google Play services it's not
necessarily a problem that's inbuilt to
the OS but it's the side effect and if
you're used to having really convenient
access to apps that's a big problem
yes yes they get rice I don't know the
price was bad it was our expectations
were different because we were so used
to kindle fire tablets being is very
very affordable options and we kind of
assume the phone would be a similarly
super budget model and it just wasn't
which might have been okay if we knew
that going in I don't think it would
have seen any guys I mean look at this
they were asking 199 on a two-year
contract you could have gotten a
top-tier android smartphone or top-tier
Windows Phone attire and an iphone for
the same price on a contract but it had
a lot of storage this at me was 32
gigabytes for the 200 wasn't it right
but with those with that ecosystem
disadvantage any game with great stuff
to came with to you a year of prime for
free or the other box right there but
all that stuff is is not enough to
counteract an inherent ecosystem
disadvantage as you were saying see the
thing is I would never recommend a fire
phone to to anyone because I would also
would not recommend the fire tablets to
anyone as they're super popular because
they were so cheap right is
budget-friendly as they may be the
ecosystem just isn't there if you want
some like bang for your buck find an old
ipad mini for sale find a nexus 7 or
something to that degree because you can
get much more bang for your buck and
that's how i will not like back away
from that this was one of the best
purchases that I hey drop Jenner yeah
the Nexus 7 I would rather brand skin on
there yeah yeah yeah nice oh yeah but uh
yeah after using the first couple of
fire tablets in just I can't get used to
the carousel you I it's not
user-friendly for people who don't
actively use tablets and want to learn
something vika I mean I've given my
grandma when she just could not figure
out the carousel you I it's just not
user-friendly it's not difficult but
it's not intuitive well how's that
differ from the volley pop vertical
carousel you I from what what do you
mean under the task switching but that I
mean that's that's one page versus an
integer with those archers yeah
yeah whereas I don't find the carousel
to be I think the carousel is fine but
then we get into talking about webos and
all that kind of stuff but I i think the
carousel as you I center is a pretty
good idea and I hate waiting the two and
sometimes three seconds it takes for
lollipop to bring up the carousel when
all I want to do is which apps I mean
it's so freaking frustrating did you put
in the center of this have it right
there anyway I've been trying to find a
good cue and I question to go out on but
you know so many these are so sweet but
guys God by the way da audience you are
submitting so many awesome questions
that we can't even handle it there are
so many questions in here and it's
really really cool amat Hassan makes a
very good point we need more Joe Levi on
the next podcast I agree and the thing
is Jose just so busy and I'm sorry but

possibly can Ariel Vice one says taylor

can live with that yeah it's not nice
not a bad thing I'm not ripping you just

making because I might turn it into a
mini mod I don't know we have a little
sneak peak can he can you hint at it can
you give us a give us a to close photo
that doesn't kill tell the whole picture

love that but I have to have to do some
holiday traveler and before that I have
to have to post some more
some more videos for you also have to
shoot a short video clip for me because

jewels feet after the mail oh my god

the audio is better but the you miss out
in some pretty wild stuff so i think
it's it's about time to go I want to
thank Taylor for for taking the time out
to tell us what life is like on the
other side you look happy you look
healthy and and you look well so I think
we're all pleased about that tea thank
you I'm very stress free these days and
it's nice to say that oh and that is
nice I wonder what's I like brother I
described that I'm just relaxed all the
time like a walking I get bored and I
build something I make a video about it
and then go back to sitting on my couch
plan as mad boss tell people where they
can find your videos because mod I don't
know if you know this is the single
worst thing to search for on the
internet if they're looking for you yeah
well it does come up now if you search
mud under channels on YouTube it's the
top option but you can find me at mod at
home on youtube so it's youtube.com /
mod at home that's where you find us on
or me on Twitter Facebook Google+
Instagram and on YouTube sand of course
my old twitter handle is still there
casper tech of course and we're gonna be

that i will be an all new person maybe
we'll get a haircut maybe I'll trim out
this beard maybe I'll put on a new shirt

is a perfect opportunity for me to feel
that Michael Fisher void
on the internet because I reached that
from the Patrian where I have to be
Michael Fisher so I haven't done that
you know that's true that's true and i'm
really at liberty slope man it's
actually happening this is gonna happen

everyone we're going to hear from Steven
and his auntie or any segment again when
there's more stuff to be about but you
know what it's a holiday season in the
news cycle is a little slow and you know
what Steven maybe you'll join me in this
opinion that's fine right now isn't it
yeah considering what's coming up for us

breather is well appreciated no one no

gonna get the flu before you go to CES

I might just drive into the desert and
