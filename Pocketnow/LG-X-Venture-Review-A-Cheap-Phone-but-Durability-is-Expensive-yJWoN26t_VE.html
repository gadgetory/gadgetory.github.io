time of year we'd usually be talking
about another rugged handset for the
summer but in the absence of that phone
LG is delivering a lower-cost rugged
option called the X venture entry-level
chipset paired with a big battery and a
rugged shell the X venture is ip68
water-resistant and tested milspec 810g
drop and shock resistant the whole focus
for this device individuals or
businesses who are concerned about
mobile gadget survivability and who
don't want to break the bank the shell
certainly inspires confidence design
accents that convey a sense of armored
plating a rear that recalls the grippy
back of the LG v10 it feels great in the
hand and in keeping with water resistant
design all of the buttons have a nice
clicky action to them LG fans might miss
the rear fingerprint sensor but
embedding this in the home button is
familiar enough what makes this phone a
bit complicated to discuss are the
hardware compromises made to reach a
lower price point the chipset is capable
enough to slide around some home screens
but it's not difficult to bog down the
Qualcomm 435 you'll need to exercise a
little patience when multitasking the
5.2 inch display is a 1080p LCD but it's
a fairly dim screen making outdoor
viewability more difficult this is
frustrating for a device designed to be
used by outdoorsy folks there's a
primary focus on battery life in here
the X venture wonderfully succeeds this
battery capacity easily delivers
multi-day runtime and Qualcomm quick
charge 2 is handy enough for a fast top
off ultimately considering that focus
this phone is a success there are people
shopping for a more rugged lifestyle
device who are willing to compromise on
flashy or fun features still we have
some reservations with the ex ventures
place in the market you actually pay
quite a bit for durability as phone's
priced $100 less can easily outperform
LG's offering the ex venture doesn't
live in a vacuum where a savvy shopper
might be able to pick up a 2-year old
phone that can best it for less just
maybe - up-to-date software it also
faces some competition and LG's own
stable of phones as the g6 doesn't
feature the same fat
life but is rated for the same water and
drop resistance not that we trust a
glass back as much as a grippy back and
with a little digging you should be able
to find LG's flagship for under $500
that's a 50% price jump which is not
insignificant but you will get more
phone for the cash the LG X venture
might be the exact right fit for someone
looking for wallet-friendly peace of
mind but we'd certainly recommend doing
a little comparative shopping first as
