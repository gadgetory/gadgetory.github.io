the iPhone 8 having a touch ID power
button the Google pixel xl2 and pixel
two renders emerge for your drooling
pleasure and meizu has just unwrapped
the screen behind the screen on its pro
7 and pro 7 plus i'm hi mary vera and
yeah i also want to believe but i've
been sleeping too little to even care
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with deals those of you
in the market for a great smartphone
sure the google pixels on its way out
right out Verizon's cut this really
irresistible deal 5 dollars a month for
this phone for two years but there's a
catch you actually have to trade in
phone that's acceptable there are
actually some conditions they can learn
more about in link in the description
i'll start about meizu the company has
just unwrapped its pro 7 in pro 7 plus
for those of you that saw the leaks on
weibo of this dual screen smartphone yes
it becomes live today dual cameras dual
screen and the whole purpose is for you
to get notifications use that secondary
screen for selfies etc etc the
specifications aren't really bad it's a
Helio X 30 in addition to 4 gigs of RAM
64 gigs of storage you can learn more
about it in winter description as well
and in today's WTF news believe it or
not Samsung is working on a W 2018
smartphone this is actually a flip phone
that brings all the bells and whistles
Snapdragon 835 4 gigs of ram it seems
that there's even an option for six
weeks of RAM 64 gigs of storage now the
reason why I would consider the
championship pulled at en d.f as well as
because apparently this phone is going
to cost an insane
two thousand dollars I know that there's
a market of people that will actually
pay for that but yeah two thousand
dollars for a flip phone now let's talk
about the iPhone 8 we have been covering
rumors of this phone getting things like
touch ID in the power button etc etc but
according to some trusted sources in
Japan that is not going to happen there
is no sort of machinery behind that
power button to enable this capability
according to the source and number two
for those of you that wonder the date
it's apparently going to happen early
November or late October and we will get
an earlier launch of the 7s or 7s plus
that is the
other claims that we heard other numbers
so stay tuned and finally the very hot
rumors today have to do with the Google
pixel Google pixel XL - mainly because
we've got some CAD renders on video
today if Google ever wanted to change
the forgettable design of the pixel this
is that these phones look gorgeous
but notice apparently this 18 by 9
aspect ratio is only coming to the
Google pixel XL - it seems that the
Google pixel - will be a regular
smartphone at sixteen by nine now that
this appointing part of these renders is
no headphone jack apparently Google
wants to compensate with stereo speakers
which is OK in the case of the stereo
speakers not in the case of the lack of
the headphone jack but it leads me to a
question today let us know what you
think about these renders do you like
what you see or not in my case I think
it's going to be Google pixel excel -
this year but leave us a comment down
