Rivera with pocketnow.com and guess what
we're right now with Jeff Gordon which
is the online communications manager for
HTC and he's now going to give us a
preview of the much expect that HTC
Titan to which by the way is going to be
my next device let me tell you that so
walk me through the device and tell me
about it you bet absolutely so this is
the Titan to that we just announced on
monday morning at 18v developer summit
at CES really excited about this device
because it's the first windows phone
from HTC with 4G LTE on a tMT's network
so I get your blazing fast LTE speeds
there for everybody who actually a lot
of web surfing on their phone which by
the way as the 4.7 inch screen amazing
this village inside yes it's huge it's
beautiful it's vivid it's a wvga
resolution super LCD that's great for do
annoy your web surfing with that LTE
connection so a lot of people enjoy that
I took to be honest with you windows
phone is for a large screen it is it's
perfect on a large room at the Metro UI
but just looks beautiful on this screen
the other big thing that people are
talking a lot about with this device is
I looked around to the back is an
industry-first at least here the state's
this is a 16 megapixel camera amazing
highest resolution camera as I said in
the States as well as obviously that HTC
has ever put on a smartphone so it takes
just absolutely beautiful photos we've
got a f 2.6 f-stop the dual LED flash in
the 28 millimeter wide angle lens
really just tremendous photos they're
obviously Windows Phone here is a 7.5
mango so all the latest and greatest
there for your xbox live games your your
office apps all that kind of stuff that
everybody knows and loves from windows
phone and in terms of other internal
specs we're running a 1.5 gigahertz
qualcomm s2 processor so very speedy
yeah 512 megabytes of ram and 16 gigs of
internal memory for holding all your
your media and particularly all those
photos that you can be taken with this
16 megapixel camera and as I show you
some of the other design elements you
can see that we actually have a little
bit of a curve to the design exactly or
school it's it you brought the hump that
we get on Android devices and it looks
awesome that pasta you know probably one
of the things that amazes me most about
the device is how sturdy it is mind if I
hold it'll be a go ahead it's it's
extremely sturdy and extremely thin at
the same time and the back of the device
is what is it metal it's an a in sort of
a aluminum unibody I suppose yeah so so
yeah one thing I would note about the
back is sort of this mesh right here
that you can see all right that piece
actually pops off thats we put the sim
card in and underneath the unibody here
we do have an improved battery over the
original type in bocas 1730 milliamp
hours so it's not so user replaceable
but given the people are going to be
using this a lot with LTE in the camera
and whatnot we definitely wanted to
increase the battery performance there
we're really happy that you were able to
pull LT on a Windows Phone we were
probably waiting for that to happen
around by the end of this year you know
with the usual Windows Phone life cycle
changes but so far we're really
impressed i mean we review the titan
recently it was an amazing device
overall I mean what the pixel density on
this device is the same as the Titan
right it's the same wvga resolution
display at the difference here is we've
got the front-facing video camera at the
top also yeah that's right we also have
1.3 megapixel front camera so right for
doing the
calls and something like tango or what
not you can certainly do that or just
taking pictures of yourself if you do
that right now that I remember the
original Titan already had that but yeah
obviously you know aside from the Titan
if you're out to purchase a new HTC
device from AT&amp;amp;T I'll be honest with you
this is my next device I really love the
windows phone UI and I love what HTC
does with the design I mean you can you
could consider Windows Phone to be the
same thing among the devices but
honestly I'm a big fan of HTC so
honestly this is my next device again
this is high memory data reporting again
from the HTC booth here and thank you
Jeff Gordon for your preview is there
anything else you'd like to add no we're
very excited about the device so it'll
be out on AT&amp;amp;T very soon we don't have
pricing and availability just yet but
stay tuned for that and check it out in
the stores as soon as it's ready can I
take it home with me I'm sorry thank you
very much thank you goodbye
