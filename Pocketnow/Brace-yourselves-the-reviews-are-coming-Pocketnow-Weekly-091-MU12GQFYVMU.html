than just an old adage to comfort your
friend on a turbolift ride it's the
truth particularly in the mobile
technology world for us and for you that
means an avalanche of Awesome reviews
are about to land at pocketnow.com we'll
talk a bit about this and cover the not
insignificant news of the week on
episode 09 one of the pocket now weekly
the once a week audio podcast where we
discuss smartphones tablets wearables
and other gadgets you dreamed of owning
when you were young from Boston
Massachusetts I'm your host Michael
Fisher editorial director at pocket now
and I'm joined on today's show by the
host of the pocket now daily our
multimedia manager and good friend jaime
rivera from honduras welcome back sir
I'm always trying to memorize what you
say at the beginning and I sad really
suck at I tweaked it a little bit each
time we're also joined by veteran time
traveler spring door fable Plex from the
year twenty thirty four aka chief news
editor Stephen shank welcome back to
2014 you intrepid explorer you thank you
very much what the flippity floppity
mike it is what they're saying in the
future these day that's a joke from from
twitter yesterday sprung from some
staffing difficulties if you follow us
on twitter listeners you will know what
we're talking about it's been sort of
like hell to get this show staffed this
week no no it's always a dream producing
that yeah oh yeah yes well it's
something at least twenty percent of us
look forward to at all times but the
staffing issues are crazy on this show
because we are very very busy this week
i'm much more so than usual and they
mean that this show will be a little
shorter than usual they mean that our
noise floor is a little higher than it
usually is because we're not necessarily
using the correct equipment and they
mean finally that we're going to kick
off this episode with a quick rundown of
announcements so these this list of
announcements is almost entirely as
focused on reviews and that's a great
thing because we have so many coming
soon so yeah so we have the probably
most prominently and you're starting to
see reviews trickle out already from
other outlets the galaxy s5 review is
coming i was about to say very soon
not coming very soon as coming soon
because our supplier for this one clove
technology has unfortunately had a
shipping delay so we're waiting for the
s5 to come in but as a bonus we're also
now waiting for two other devices
related to that device to come in the
gear 2 neo and the gear fit hey hey I
know we're gonna be buried in new
Samsung wearables powered by Tizen so
who's going to be walking around town
with the the two wearable devices one on
each wrist at the same time just going
to say I wonder if Tony's going to do
that that's another wonderful benefit to
this arrangement is that Anton denote
after a long long time away from reviews
is going to be taking care of the
Samsung material for us so that's
awesome I'm looking forward to seeing
his face again surely is the seat what
happens if you turn on the pedometer on
both of those they end up you know being
relatively close at the end of the day /
week or it depends on a few heavily
favored one of your legs I would imagine
depends on if you've been whacked by a
like a golf club or something angered
anchored the mob but in addition to
those reviews we have a the Oppo find 7
a review that's coming soon that'll be
coming from my offices here in Boston I
know very little about the device and
I'm really excited to get to know it
there's another one we can't talk about
so we'll talk about that when we can
talk about it and finally also coming is
the nokia X review I'm also handling
that one and that is going to turn into
a giveaway when we're done with it so
yeah God thinking that was gonna be
interesting it is gonna be interesting
yeah guys this is the plain old XO you
can be looking at not the exactly X plus
for the XL I think it's just a plain old
nokia X yeah well that one I think is
coming from negri and it should be here
today I think so yeah this is there's a
lot of stuff on the horizon as the point
it's going to be massive now that also
we should also mention that there are
some reviews already here ours ends
review week is under way you guys know
this stephen and i may but we have a we
have a fun relationship with a with an
accessory manufacturer called his ends
there a small little house that makes
some really great stuff we have already
posted what did I post the bigger
yeah the bluetooth speaker the booty so
it's not just a bluetooth speaker with a
great battery life but it also has a Qi
wireless charging plate on top so you
can drop your chin able phone I really
like the thing that's that was a lot of
fun to review you know I really want to
like it Tunes know what they do the butt
on the end of that are you just you just
mad that you can't that like do you want
me to send you your night I really want
to like it too calls ends come on i'll
send you mine because i don't have much
use for it i even though i like it very
much just in phila I don't like blast my
tunes in public often so but anyway I
like it a lot it could be good for for a
lot of things and Taylor Martin just
reviewed the cupholder qi wireless
charger from so weird what I don't know
you spend the design of it it wasn't
what you expect from a wireless charger
you're thinking place i'm gonna drop it
on this is it's it's cozy it's cool
right look yeah and it makes sense like
it's a slot in a thing that fits into
the cup holder and like you drop it in
your car and there it is and I you know
I don't know people who do people whose
continue to rail against wireless
charging eyes just so confused by
because why do you want to be in your
car fiddling with a stupid cable and USB
you're like holding it up to your ear
with it with a coiled cord attached to
the thing you know why why would you
want to do that why would you want to do
this why not just drop the thing into
your into your cup holder and say oh ok
it's charging when it's in the cup
holder and I can pull it out whenever I
want to deal the stupid wire I love it I
guess it's wildly optimistic of Zeb's to
assume that our cup holders are not
completely full of you know pennies and
recess and hard cigarette butt listen
way yes second I thought I thought I was
the only guy that did that haha my
concern was that they wouldn't make it
large enough cuz you know our cup
holders are getting larger to
accommodate our bucket sized soft drinks
at our American drive-throughs yeah
bingo yeah so I don't know so anyway
that review week is under way those two
reviews are already up and Joel Eva's
review of the more conventional zens
wireless power just kind of charging
plate is coming up soon so we're going
to three zens reviews up this week
that's so much fun I always love when
I'd like a new array or a smaller a
lesser known manufacturer comes in and
we were able to review their stuff you
just don't do enough accessories in
general that's what people have been
saying in the comments but you know it
tricky it's a tough balancing act
because while we do enjoy doing them
obviously they don't get quite the
audience that a mobile device review
gets and so it's right and we someone's
put in the right amount of time in order
to have a exactly good review of it so
it's a balancing act of our priorities i
guess so you know it's really
interesting to see the transition i mean
when i when i used to be like the guy
that used to handle the the things that
we would review we would do like ninety
percent accessories ten percent phones
like five or six years ago Wow is that
right yeah yeah if you look at our
reviews from like 2008 that was like
because hey back then how many
smartphones were built right now is it
was a really small market back then yeah
wasn't seven and we didn't go over or
the decision was made not to go over and
start doing dumb phones back then so no
yeah we I remember we used to have this
policy of doing three reviews a week but
then to fill that gap just think about I
mean wow how earbud is right for you
yeah multiply 52 x 3 and think about how
many phones were launched this year and
even even if we tried to do that this
year it would be difficult it's absurd i
ended up this week with something like
12 or 13 phones littering my desk here
and I I actually like I came into my
office to move something I had a couple
computers open I'm I had to like push
aside a wave of smartphones to put my
computer down it's and it's not all new
I guess not you know they're not old
school like things and y'all trade I'll
trade it for my turn anytime dude I'm
not complaining you know it's it's a
good times what also already here the
HTC One m8 for verizon that review was
done by Taylor Martin I think it's one
of his prettier reviews the layout is
gorgeous yeah the photos are beautiful
and his conclusions since they are in
line with mine are brilliant that didn't
it yeah now these it's a great review
should you should watch the video read
the review if you're thinking of an oven
verizon power to HTC One m8 I've spent a
long time at AT&amp;amp;T because that's my
personal line my provider and the one
that works best for me here in Boston
but verizon man they make a freakin
solid network I
put up a tower yeah yeah they know how
to erect a tower indeed and finally to
close out the announcements also already
here finally our blackberry 10
dot-to-dot 1 review it sounds like an
incremental upgrade I wish they had
called it something a little bit more
bombastic because this update is
significant and it's done a lot to
improve the blackberry experience so in
fact i called the review 10 pounds of
upgrade in a five-pound bag and that's
what it's well I'll tell you this much I
saw your video and I was like oh my god
I should go pull out the z10 yeah and
then I was like man and then I canceled
those plans well I have the z30 here and
I use that and it didn't conjunction
with the q10 to evaluate this review and
why what a great time by the way those
two units are why I've spent more time
at verizon recently did just above
necessity I had to and was like oh wow
not only is this network cool but this
platform is really awesome now that i
can install android apks as apps but
it's not yet quite as hassle free as all
that good I'll tell you this much is it
reminds me of Windows Mobile man I mean
there was a time when app stores didn't
exist yet to install the what was yeah
the cap files the cab files right and
with the booth Parliament was the same
way you had to sideload everything on
the palm OS would be the way to go miles
yeah there was one big exception I heard
about in the past week some high-profile
app that wouldn't work with the
blackberry side loading well all of them
anything that requires google play
services won't work so hangouts oooo
office you say it's the the free office
for phones the good they make when they
made the phone version of office for
Android available without a 365 account
Oh microsoft office yes oh i think that
doesn't work on B Block very sadly which
would really suck considering
BlackBerry's market was once yeah
business potatoes yeah well at any rate
some of that is addressed and they're
they're just a lot of native UI
enhancements that are that have done a
whole lot to improve the blackberry
experience and just check it out so that
being said we're we're now at a position
finally where we have in the
announcements out of the way we can
start talking about the news
we have a trimmed-down run down this
week but that doesn't mean there isn't a
lot to talk about so i will ask stephen
shank to kick us off with android down
run dan alright android down run down
trim down yeah all those it this is one
okay so a couple days back we heard a
report out of south korea of course
samsung a home turf here talking about a
little bit of a tiff samsung it got nuts
off into with the press over there
dophia yeah not the images here about
the galaxy s5 rumors specifically we
heard a bunch of rumors leading up to
the phones release about issues samsung
might even running into with production
of the hardware at warning you know
possible delays and all and at least two
distinct rumors looked at issues with
the GS 5s camera it supposedly they were
running into problems fabricating these
super thin lenses that stack up go above
the sensor really low yield rates they
said it's like twenty or thirty percent
and then supposedly samsung work this
out and there was another problem but it
doesn't seem like a big deal these sort
of stories we hear them all the time
every phone any any phone as big as the
galaxy s5 you're going to hear stuff
about its production on the
manufacturing process and samsung thinks
that this particular incident is somehow
out of line and it is going after the
news firm the gov tronic x new i think
look for my x ET news and they're going
after them in South Korea's it's it's
not the court it's like an arbitration
review board but they're looking for
like three hundred thousand dollars in
damages because of what they see as a
misleading report with the potential to
hurt gs5 sales I wish we didn't have to
go through translate to see a lot of
this because it would be really nice to
be able gap you and when you shove
something through google translator
whatever it kind of eliminates the
nuance you can't tell exactly how the
story the original story was presented
so i can't tell whether whose side to
fall on on this but of course my initial
inclination is to say wow
publication posts a negative story and
you decide to sue them now this is not
necessarily alien to anyone I mean we've
heard that from the herd of this a lot
before but I'm just risky it yet it's
interesting because it has the it
carries the risk of backfiring right
yeah just rice and effects is going to
draw more attention to the problem if it
is there but right i mean is this
actually a problem we don't yet know if
there really were these problems with
the manufacturing the the news agency is
standing by its report saying based on
what we heard our story was you know
completely aboveboard sampling doesn't
have a reason to be so upset here can
you imagine how many times we'd be sued
over our videos right of course right
exactly now what there's there's an
interesting debate going out in the
comments and a kind of an interesting
discussion happening down there about
you know there's something you know
things are different in south korea and
i remember hearing that on a on the
galaxy s3 launch weekend or whatever it
was the week when i was down in new york
city we were talking to some samsung
people and their had recently been a an
exposure of some kind of illegal
dealings by samsung some kind of
price-fixing or something i don't really
remember what are their yeah but
basically the way they solved it is by
paying off the government and this was
you know it sounds familiar sounds yeah
and and this was the way this was being
discussed was was kind of very because
it was all a bunch of samsung us folks
and they were they were basically saying
like yeah things are things are very
different over there doing business in
that market is extremely different
that's about as the most i can tell you
about it so it's like okay this seems to
go hand in hand with the mentality of
suing a media publication for posting
essentially a rumor or a report that is
negative but yeah it's not clear if I
mean we assume that sounds like we do
this because the report is not factual
but maybe just hurt feelings is enough
over there I don't know right i don't
know and then you have other
speculations saying that it wasn't the
initial report but the the
recharacterization yeah or their refusal
to
modify it and run a yeah action or
something which is the correct thing to
do I mean you already wrote something
standard oh well yeah I mean if it's
wrong you should you should correct it
obviously I mean we you know or every
media outlet code gets in that position
from now now do you think it could have
been you know a faulty unit or something
because we've had that problem all
that's never deal it's never leave all
to unit sorry it's just never a faulty
but here's a list of problems PR firm
that I've found with your review unit
can you comment on it we've never seen
that before let's send you a different
unit okay thank you now step it's just
crap no I don't know and we received the
tablet again and it doesn't reset itself
to our to us what's going on the top
reminds me of a specifically am things
happen you know and it's just like Oh
God so I don't know I this is I don't
like the chilling effect this would have
on on the freedom of outlets to tell the
truth about whether products are sucky
or not but this wasn't even a review
there's a news report about
manufacturing difficulty so this is a
kind of a different I don't know it's
just scary you know it and and there
seems to be an interesting division in
the comments between it's about 5050
between people who are like yeah this is
scary it shouldn't be happening and
people who think that the media already
has too much influence over the way
brands are perceived and that they
deserve to get slapped in the face yeah
I was digging through our tips mailbox
and I found an interesting email a
couple days back from someone claiming
to be a manufacturer part manufacturing
partner of Samsung and denying these
reports of the the camera problems
religion think this didn't come out
until we ran the story about Samsung
suing over this incident didn't happen
when we originally ran it it's coming
from a gmail account there's no way to
confirm this guy is who he says it is
who he is but it's interesting but at
least someone is responding so
passionately to this news yeah it's very
interesting stuff we're gonna have to
see what comes of it initially I wish we
had a follow-up by the time we went on
air today but it looks like this is
still we're still working with the
original information so maybe we'll
update that or maybe this will be have
enough
meet for a new post if we hear anything
but shall we move on to the other bit of
Samsung news Oh silly little business
yeah I like this yeah I like your
headline Sampson patents a whole Samsung
wonders what if we just put a hole in a
tablet yes so there's this design patent
that Samsung initially filed all the way
back in 2012 but it only just got
published by the US Patent and Trademark
organization yesterday and it's just
it's a tablet it looks like a galaxy tab
as we're familiar with and it's got this
little hole in the bottom right corner
there's no explanation whatsoever as to
what it's there for and so I'm
speculating wildly over sounds like a
possibly be up to here is this just like
do you get sort of hold it through the
whole idea hook stuff onto it does it I
like you're like I like your your your
stipulation that it might be like a
painter's palette I mean that that would
be cool it was a little bigger get your
thumb in there but other thing I didn't
iron right it doesn't make much sense
but what if it was like to put a stylist
in its I think it holds it up right like
you look like an inkwell on a
turn-of-the-century exact less room desk
yeah but wow wow but it would have to
have an angle for stylus like you guys
remember the old compaq I packs the the
the doc used to have a some style some
song how'd it does have a bit of an
angle to it because if i look at the
rear renderings the whole expands more
on two sides than the other two so it
sort of does have a shape to it it's
like just straight through but it's only
for lefties it's a whole it's bizarre
and then but then some commenters
pointed out and then us the power
readers are very smart ya know our
Barnes and Noble has been doing
something like this to the milk their
other you know not necessarily the throw
tablets we cover all the time here that
have been doing this but i'm not sure
why they did it either no that's that's
the thing like why is it I have always
wondered why it's there on the note
click is it i looked at the it's too big
to be a lanyard hole right two bigs a
villa in your hole
yeah I assume that a loon looks like
product page there would be some mention
of this like oh it's the awesome tablet
whole 2009 no nothing no it's probably
samsung's new technology for you to be
able to see where you're walking with
your tablet or something so you can more
easily hang your tablet up to dry after
it gets what I was just gonna say I was
just gonna say it's one of those I think
that the I don't understand why it's on
the nook HD I'm looking at it and I'm
just I've never understood it and I
wonder if it's just an aesthetic
improvement that or anesthetic touch
that Samsung decided to I mean it is a
design at and enough I should all patent
yeah but yet we did then look doesn't it
look like it's an adjacent anything yeah
you did it's just weird anyway maybe
we'll see this come to pass this is one
of those things where it's like many
patents are not are not leveraged but it
would be interesting to see this I liked
your speculation on the in the 2d sense
everywhere it's like we're looking at it
directly from the face and so glad this
could be anything it doesn't that feel
it could be a giant knob there's no
alpha channel in these a black white
patent renderings here anyway alright so
what else is uh what's what's happening
this move on from sound chicken what's
our next piece of news all that is this
is very interesting motorola names and
new president and CEO or a gastrula but
uh I'm trying to understand i mean the
company got acquired by lenovo the
transaction hasn't been made yet it
hasn't been legalized um but they have a
new present I you know Wow what exactly
is motorola right now is like the
biggest question I have well I think
that the the idea was to like to install
somebody for the transition to replace
Dennis Woodside and also to to try to
keep him on board after the acquisition
closes now I think that's what side was
only a CEO not a president this guy's
president and COO president and coo whoa
that is odd okay I misread them so there
might be a blue noble guy higher up SE
cayo I mean yeah well I mean that would
make sense because I agree with Hamid is
a little odd to have a personnel shift
at this high level right before a merger
early I haven't seen it much I think it
also make sense for what Lenovo's been
talking about what they want to do with
motorola that they want to have someone
who's been around for the past couple
years relatively up close to the top
leadership level to help steer where
it's going because I wanted to be
distinct from the lenovo offerings
absolutely and it absolutely should be I
really found it to be a little
comforting that Rick Osterloh has been
leading full product management so yeah
so he's got head had a big hand in the
Moto X right in the what's the other bit
not the Moto G but there was something
else I was interesting why is this story
much shorter than the one I wanted to
source to sorry maybe I read like Tony's
news stories like two paragraphs long
and I remember reading a piece that was
much longer and I guess I didn't read
hours what's the matter with me wait
there are other smartphone websites they
just pocket now absolute you're saying
yeah and rick is a silica this from
motorola rick is a Silicon Valley
veteran and a familiar face across
motorola he's been leading all product
management and helping to define the go
forward strategy for the past two years
oh this is weren't ready i read it on
motorola side okay yeah so you first
joined motorola seven years ago and he
between stints he joined skype i guess
that didn't work out too well and then
since his return he's had a key role in
the company's reinvigoration he's been a
guiding visionary on the entire product
front and a passionate advocate for our
philosophy to buzz word buzzer buzz word
but I I really like his his corporate
profile headshot here as well I think he
looks exactly like the kind of guy who I
would like to to have a beer at a BBQ
with she looks like jake busey is who he
looks like you see um does it looks like
he's down to have a good time like he
looks like a fun guy and the comment the
commenters have been talking about that
as well I think there's some division
about that but I'm just I'm glad you
know I think this is one of my biggest
concerns about motorola going to lenovo
has been losing that distinctive
motorola identity that has led to things
like the Moto X and
will eventually lead to the Moto 360 and
I really don't want to lose that so I
hope yes solutely move preserves that a
bit you know so we will have to see I
just thought it was worth covering we
will see in in other news from other
manufacturers LG has the there's been a
leaked screenshot of purportedly from
the LG g3 showing a tweak to you I yeah
obviously one of the things that LG is
not really renowned for his software
design it doesn't look too bad really
well it doesn't look too different
either yeah its exact it's almost the
same UI flattered um but it still looks
cheesy it does like the colors have been
changed to something like a different
different stripe of ugly oh yeah yeah
right it's like it's like a teal it's
like an institutional green that was in
the hallways of the 1940s instead of the
1930s yes that looks like prison green
yeah oh there we write but this does
stand as potentially further evidence in
favor of the 3g getting a 2k resolution
screen because this is definitely bigger
than 1080p oh ok and of course and you
know that would be very in character for
LG to do that right we know it's there
there they love being first two things
we obviously we talked about this every
time we talk about LG but um so yeah
that could help them out and steven are
we still looking at a possible early
release for the g3 I don't know there
hasn't been much talk about that lately
I mean these rumors about it being in
May or June are like a month or two old
at this point if not longer so there
hasn't been an update lately but there
hasn't been anything contradicting that
either so for now we're keeping it in
mind could be this quarter I think that
would be really interesting because when
you posted this story I kind of had this
moment it was briefly rossak oh yeah LG
because I was thinking when forgetting
the other side of the galaxy has five we
have a pretty big gulf to go but no
we've got LG and then Motorola so yeah
that's it's gonna be good it'll be a
good summer yeah yeah yeah
the only thing I'm looking forward to
his battery life I guess the for me LG
right now sitting them to battery life
oh god yes I mean the chief flex the g2
they're both excellent for endurance I'm
the g flex more so but yeah I mean why
don't you tell us about the HTC One m8
this new edition that might come for
sprint well I'm kind of confused about
this because I thought it was going to
be the sprint HTC One m8 that would
bring the special harman kardon that i
predict that i pronounced that right
speakers i think i can never know how to
I never know how to a Harman card on you
know I HTC is it I'm okay so the phone
is already available in retail stores
for everyone AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint and I
thought that the sprint edition was
going to bring this by the fault but it
seems that this would be a special
edition that'll come out at some point
but I don't know if Stephen D did they
promote this is such because I was under
the impression that sprint had not said
one word about this yet nor HTC and this
but no no no no HTC has just confirmed
that the phone is in retail stores it
sits right right but then that was the
confirmation but no eyeing a special
edition for sprint I wasn't aware was a
thing that had been said no no it hasn't
been said it's just something that got
leaked on XDA and yeah it got leaked on
XDA that there probably is a special
edition coming but you know it's I again
I was the one that got confused and
thought that the sprint edition was
going to be the phone all sprint phones
what we're going to include this but it
turns out that no apparently though
there will be a special edition coming
soon but again this is just the leaker
no this is just the littlest is da
everyone's and the leak on XDA seems to
include some strings yeah support Harmon
flag in a configuration file and some
pretty and Vincent looking you I hear
efflux first posted that there's going
to be the special edition and then later
these XDA guys chimed in no no there's
no special edition it's the one that
sprint already has it's just these
special features aren't being
prominently pushed their hidden away you
change a little line in an XML file and
all of a sudden you get this new setting
for a couple har
k drone that you at the EQ stuff there's
one this was to make the sound less
compressed there's another one it might
just be hot with software eq features
there's no sign yet that the speaker's
themselves are fancy or anything yes so
there's the thing like what can you can
you do that with software would would
Harmon I know nothing about harmony this
is the hope beats audio stuff isn't it
yeah right is but it's but it's a
company with them you know maybe a
better reputation a company that's maybe
a bit better respected among audio files
i guess but can you do that with just
software i mean i guess i guess you can
i think it's interesting worth it to do
is the question that yes and i think
that it will fall to us to determine
whether it's worth it it'll be
interesting to get our hands on one of
these and i also wonder if this goes
hand in hand with an event sprint has
been advertising for New York City for
the end of this month where they've
basically sent out these cryptic
invitations that say come hear it for
yourself and they have a lot of like
waveform on them it's obviously an audio
is very interested isn't it and we've
been thinking that it's sprint getting
ready to launch its nationwide HD voice
network or whatever for ultra clear
phone calls and it may well be that but
I canopy boat I was going to say can't
it be both I mean wouldn't it if you add
something like this waiting in the wings
the special HTC One m8 with a new brand
name audio experience wouldn't you want
to unveil that in conjunction with with
something else like that with a
conjunction with the phones long he's
bizarre this isn't the official already
yeah it is weird I don't know but then
it's sprint you never know what the hell
they're gonna do I mean they'll come up
with something crazy like this and then
they'll either botch the launch or
they'll launch something excellently
that nobody cares about you know sprint
is always a mixed bag you never know
what's gonna happen with them and I
guess that's the case with a lot of
carriers but why old car and yeah let's
do it yeah go ahead good I was gonna say
let's talk about Facebook but if you're
a closing point on that now it's just
the Sprint has been doing that for the
longest time they try to do exclusives
all the time and that's great you know
it's just it works out like sometimes it
does it didn't work out for the palm pre
but it worked out for the evo 4g
I knew you were gonna say say I I was
like waiting for palm pre i'm waiting
for ria what I was it's for everyone out
there playing the pocket and weekly
drinking game you have to drink when I
talk about webos you have to speak your
kool-aid right it's exactly right i have
to remind everyone where all their fun
innovations came from hey facebook is
going to start forcing itself on on
users well well here's the thing sorry
good so here's a thing for those of you
that didn't know probably all three of
you out there in the world didn't know
that Facebook had a messenger um so the
company and this is funny they are going
to force but they're going to force
something that's already actually
working on iOS like if you're if you're
on the facebook application and you get
a private best private message you can't
respond to it from the facebook
application it whenever you tap the
messenger it'll launch the application
on the side and it'll give you this
option to go back to Facebook whenever
you want but it's all it's been working
like that on iOS for like about a month
or two so they're planning to implement
this on Android and I was like wait a
second so Android can't do this so I you
know since I've been starting to use a
an android phone is my primary phone
lately um I started noticing the down on
on Android you really can't do that it's
it's like you can you can choose to
either use the messenger or use the app
but you know it defeats the purpose of
having you know a separate application
when you can still do it on the facebook
app and obviously they want to push this
facebook application because you can do
best yeah you can do SMS messages with
it you know it still has that cool chat
heads feature um so yeah it's not cool
is it still cool is the question I I
love to chat as when I came out and I
just saw I don't know I'm sorry I've
spent three days actually using it again
so I was like oh I forgot this was cool
yeah it's cool until your duty you know
until you realize when the paradigm
breaks down and you're like wow I have
this chat had constantly popping up even
when I close it it pops up again with
every new message and then I have to
move it around and if it's down at the
bottom of the screen i start typing in
another app that I'm tapping on the chat
head all the time and it's just a
it's I don't like it as much as i did
when i launched i really don't i don't
know what it is i just think the
notification shade is there for exactly
that kind of thing bing oh I have a
notification cool when you look up there
okay I'll either to deal with an hour
I'll deal with it later with the chat
head it's like you have a notification
and it's going to pop up right under
your thumb or very nearby it and you
have to either move the head or you have
to tap on it like its I don't know move
the head move the head or tap on it make
your choice I just found out of this
news the greatest irony in a month ago
we had Adam Wainwright a editorial about
how Windows Phone doesn't really need a
separate facebook Messenger app and a
facebook was smart it could integrate
them all into the same thing yet now we
see that Windows Phone is the one
platform Facebook is not forcing this
separate separation haunted uh if you do
it your own way not yet but the rumor is
that the next major version will will
you know we're lagging behind with stuff
you know I guess I like the way things
are going in in windows mobile with
windows small windows phone um could you
that made mainly because come on I mean
the power windows phone is that the
People Hub is like it's it's what three
years old its functionality is three
years old there are a lot of things you
can't really do with it right you know
fave a tweet no I mean if it's going you
know if windows phone is going to
continue being that slow platform then
the smartest thing is to just leave it
alone number one or number two to do a
you know HTC and motorola and certain
companies are doing which is making the
services part of their stores and where
you won't have to wait for a major
upgrade to the operating system to get
updates for those services yeah and I
think these are problems that that that
firm is probably working on but I'm just
much more interested in what what this
means for facebook on the whole like
we're now in a situation where software
builders at OMS are taking their cues
from facebook because it's big enough
and facebook Messenger is becoming big
enough to to be a force for change and
that's only going to get more pronounced
with the whatsapp acquisition you know
about to say that exactly i really want
to see how they plan to integrate that
because whatsapp is already cool on its
own I mean I would rather delete
facebook Messenger and keep whatsapp but
let's see how that goes yeah I heard
something about FTC putting the kibosh
on to what extent Facebook might be able
to use the whatsapp user base and their
data for future stuff so it might not be
as easy as Facebook hope things to be
but probably not but that you know
they've got staying power they can stick
around fix it yeah well let's talk about
Hardware a little bit the project are a
prototype yeah and i'm rather excited
about this what is the deal things are
happening weeks away what is happening
Stephen yeah we are at a very exciting
time in the development of project ara
right now the module developer kit just
came out the other day this is giving
hardware guys the tools they need to
start developing the individual modules
will slide into the ARA endoskeleton and
give it all the functionality that you
could possibly hope for the endoskeleton
itself with the modules that Google has
been developing should finally be in a
fully working prototype stage in just a
matter of weeks and we've seen a lot of
it already with you know wires hanging
out of it hooked up to silly scopes and
whatnot but we haven't really seen it
you know just working like a regular
Android phone and that could be
happening really soon we've got this
developer conference kicking off on the
fifteenth there'll be some videos being
published phonebloks promise they're
gonna host some videos from there so a
lot of cool stuff is happening right now
so this is published by the MIT
Technology Review but where is this
where's this conference happening on the
15th oh I don't know somewhere
California I assume I was gonna save I
wish it were happening at MIT because
then I could just walk down the road and
go Joe yeah lucky you awesome lucky it's
funny I actually asked this question
yesterday on the pocket now daily
because other news of project are is
that the developer kid is out there so
you know other companies can now now
the guidelines as to how to build things
for project ara and yes I asked the
question I mean do are people really
interested in modular phones and it's
you know I'm impressed at how many
people actually want this yeah you know
I find project are to be cool but the
man the phone looks so ugly it's just I
I don't know never cared how my
smartphone looks this is exactly what
I've been looking for in a phone are you
still wrong I still had my droid are you
still using a droid because if so then I
clearly understand why dude I liked how
the droid looked it was unapologetically
ugly yet I like that's an interesting
perspective Steven cuz I'm on the exact
opposite side I need my phone to look
good and to feel good in terms of
hardware build and fit and finish and
stuff like that so nice but I'm gonna
take something like this over a sleek
comfortable phone any day see now if my
phone looks good i will put up with so
much it can it can crash every app can
crash every two minutes if it looks
awesome there's just me you know i would
have less about our choice in
relationships yeah what does it say
about is those people you remember when
the rumors of moto maker came and you
know I I envisioned an idea where shoot
I could ask my phone with whatever
megapixel camera I want and whatever
size battery I want and that's really
what i would have preferred for a
company to give us that option like what
we can do with computers right now you
want a bigger processor just pay for it
you wanted more ram just paid now i'm
gonna trick out my casing i want to have
cooling fans on my phone that are
backlit by fluorescence and honest
that's what i want i'm just waiting for
the oneplus one with its denim that's
gonna be yes and what i'm really going
to be annoyed if one plus one beats
motorola to that because with the minute
motorola started teasing the moto x with
having alternative materials we've been
saying on the show for months like give
us denim give us a denim folks it gets
30 just throw it in the washing machine
yeah like a wash denim are you mad it
was there a guy who wore a pair of jeans
for something like 10 years or something
or maybe a year without washing them oh
my god
can you imagine that smell well
apparently they were fine yeah that's me
that they're stuck to my legs let's talk
about something else unless I'm a you
had a point of view by the way Michael
mountain view is where the conference is
up well I'm not going there okay I wish
it was happened to get amenity that
would be cool yeah HTML chrome a bunch
of stuff speaking of project ara there's
another project called Project Hera and
this story I don't know Stephen
considering what we've talked about
since you posted it the story might be
half not right right anymore no no not
necessarily so this is about this report
that came out a little earlier this week
about this massive change to a lot about
Android how apps communicate with the
web how we get notifications how
multitasking works and it's all very odd
and confusing and centered around the
idea of chrome or a very tweet specific
version of chromium acting as some sort
of app hub whereas in normal apps or
html5 based apps tell this Hera chromium
browser thing what to do it actually
does it then and it would give us
benefits like making our experience with
the apps more easily sync across
platforms we could do stuff on the pc
and then pick it up on the phone but
it's it's weird it's not at all how
Android works right now and yeah the UI
concept in the header image from android
police is interesting this mock-up of
like yeah these are all mock-ups so
michael was referring to there is we
there was a pic posted on reddit the
other day claiming that the the gmail
this is also tied to a previous leak
that I think geek com or recode someone
had about an upcoming revamp for the the
gmail UI which then later was assumed to
be tied into this Hera thing so the
actual screen shots we've seen our
inconsistent they might not all be
telling the same story but this rumor
persists but I don't know what to make
of it I don't know what to make of it
either i guess my question is does
android need a massive revamp like this
I wouldn't have thought as much but do
might have a vision for where wants
things to go that just you know if we
leave androids evolution to its you know
current devices it's not going to get
there without this big well just just
remember I mean who is the current
leader of Android centaur vechiles he
built the you know Chromebooks and I
guess what they're looking for is
probably some sort of integration with
Chromebooks and we thought that it was
gonna be the other way around and I
guess it's not right right mmm that's a
good point and also you have well now
that's true and and I'm looking at every
platform now and this is a similarity
that's been striking me across the past
couple weeks which is that every
platform is is similar in a couple
different ways you have almost without
exception a home screen area to play and
it kind of do what you want and
customize it to your liking and you have
a multitasking screen that shows you
what's running and you can close the
stuff and you have an apt or a tray or
drawer list where all your apps live and
now we're very soon every platform will
have a notification center too so
there's these concepts that that kind of
permeate the all of them whether you
talk my blackberry Windows Phone Android
or iOS and is it time that we had
someone come out of left field once
again and say we're doing something
completely different we're making I
don't know notifications the center of
the experience you know now one question
I mean aren't you sort of bored with the
current you eyes and the way they are I
mean they've existed for what 76 years
that's not only what I mean yeah I know
but I mean considering everyone uses a
variation on the theme now yeah it does
have the potential to get boring right
you know it's it's the longest time that
it slow you know that a UI is lasted
like like the paradigm of the UI has
lasted and ensure it's good it's
practical but it's not perfect there are
some caveats to it yeah I I don't know
how I feel about it because on the one
hand you can efficiently manage your
tasks you can anyone can pretty much
pick up any smartphone I remember my
friend dropped her iphone in the toilet
the other day and she needed a phone
really bad and look at yeah I know so
it's like okay borrowed this at Eve
Odyssey you know
prep for such a bad friend for for the
day really come on but the point is we
have given her a bit oh that's the point
the only smartphone she's ever used in
her life was the iphone and windows
phone pretty much can't be any more
different you can't get any more diff
from iOS and Windows Phone I don't think
and then then she picked it up and in a
matter of minutes was using it just fine
so she was complaining about in a matter
of hours right and now I think she liked
it actually I'm sure Santa karate I
thought but the point is you know that
that interoperability is valuable and if
you have a platform that completely
reinvents the wheel like and I'll say it
again like webos did for all the great
things webos brought to the experience
it also brought a very very steep
learning curve that made it difficult to
sell at retail you had gesture driven
stuff people didn't know where to look
for a home button and they didn't know
to swipe up from the bottom and stuff so
when you completely reinvent the wheel
you run that risk and it's a very real
risk so and it's it's happened for years
i mean i was i was looking at these
quotes um gizmodo posted these quotes a
couple of days ago of the 10 the 10
biggest publication mistakes in history
and one of them was like oh God look at
least Truman no I don't know what it was
but it was like there was this quote
from a journalist like 30 years ago that
was like this new computer from Apple
includes some pointing device that's
extremely odd it's called a mouse and we
believe people will not like it oh yeah
oh those are fun yeah yeah so you're
right so that's the counterpoint right
you would sometimes when you reinvent
the wheel it works it sticks and then
everyone copies you and then it becomes
a standard and your you get to be the
Trailblazer Trailblazer then right but
the mouse of course didn't didn't stop
apple from almost dying shortly
thereafter right it could've did and it
took like what five six years to become
the mainstream in Windows I Windows 3.1
to come on to come on board because it
never did on the Mac actually so I guess
the point is you there's still any
number of possibilities for where mobile
UI design is going it we could see a
reinvention like this would Android be
the one to do it though could be I mean
they have the willpower they have a lot
of stuff to their favor right now and
they've got ya know you have matias
duarte as well who's you know repeat
after me Matias Duarte Matias Duarte I
can't rule my are a little bit like a
mad water tea I can my yes love my dear
Saturday I like that that's nice you
should say every every name that I can't
say hey Stephen can you stick around for
windows or do you have to jet yeah I can
hold on review all right well let's give
Windows Windows Windows well let's give
a few minutes to Windows a few minutes
it's only fair it's only there is it
over yet I really shut up I'm it I I
really like this first news face a
windows phone to start flirting with
super super thin handsets ? fortunately
I don't think it's gonna happen we got
bed ridges lawd alright what's what's
the story so this Chinese mark phone
company called neo has this m1 phone
coming up soon I don't think it launched
yet but it had been presented as an
android phone and then all of a sudden
this sort of not really official render
shows up with supposedly depicting the
same hardware running Windows Phone it
was on the Neo of the company's forums
but I don't know this early means that
an employee posted it people pointed out
the colors are a long are a little off
the live tiles there so is this like one
of those mock-ups of the HTC One m8 with
live tiles yeah it might be like that
but then again we're also getting to a
point here where Microsoft is getting a
lot less strict with how it controls
who's making what hardware Windows Phone
we're off all these new OEM is popping
up supposedly we were going to get those
you know dual Android Windows Phone and
sets that I guess aren't going to happen
but that this is sort of in the same
light as that and there was a phone a
couple months ago it wasn't running
Windows Phone but it was the same
hardware they could support android or
windows mobile embedded whatever they
call that oh yeah so it wasn't that the
plan anyways for Windows Phone to at
some point be able to be installed on
any old
droid phone as long as your paperwork
right that was supposed to be one of the
highlights of 8.1 and the move to the
the virtual buttons is then we could
support Android hardware by you know
that also uses the same virtual buttons
we don't have to have the capacitive
stuff in place so we've make it no more
flexible and be able to be used on the
same hardware as these other platforms
so it's a plausible rumor in that light
I'm not sure the evidence is necessarily
very strong there I'm not sure it is
either but the super thin business the
notion of a five point nine millimeter
thick smartphone running windows phone
is would be amazing and you know if neo
doesn't do it if this is just turns out
to be some pipe dream that somebody
dreamed up and put on the internet you
know who should do it you know who
should do it Steve Apple no although
that would put a hole in the universe
that might be interesting to say who
should Sony oh these I you know I cannot
get past these persistent rumors of Sony
still developing windows found hardware
or starting the process at least it
would it's so wonderful and with
Microsoft on a roll with announcing more
and more hardware partners for windows
phone man I feel like that would be the
just the huge news over the year for
this platform ok bo bo bo bo wait a
second whenever windows phone 7 series
was announced then you guys even
remember that crazy name sure um you
know there were a lot of hardware
partners announced back then and a lot
of them ended up getting uh you know I
would love to see Sony come back i mean
the xperia lineup was born with the
windows mobile phone and they did
probably one of the best iterations of
Windows Mobile of its time with the
whole card you I was really really cool
and I remember how beautiful that phone
was by the way it was made by HTC um but
you know if we've been hearing so many
rumors and it's been happening ever
since Windows Phone 7 so it's it's
really hard to predict now I don't know
I think it's cool how some of those
early OEMs around for the seven days I'm
thinking about LG in particular go away
Windows Phone 8 and now it's supposed to
be coming back that says a lot for the
platform its maturity it absolutely does
and it's gotten to the point now where I
can pick up a Windows Phone install the
apps that I typically use and and with
very few gaps be able to run my my life
on it pretty well
what I'm saying is it's really easy for
you to just be like oh there's a you
know for anybody to create a rumor that
way just one this has been an ongoing
thing for a couple months now talking
about a sony windows phone for a couple
of years now dude and I don't know if
it's gonna happen especially with this
new CEO um I think he's like really
really stuck in tues Android um you know
mentality I don't know if it's gonna
happen that's gonna be weird wait are
you talking about the new Microsoft's to
you no no the new um the new so well the
current Sony CEOs been there for two
years okay I guess there's no there's no
actual story in the rundown talking
about this i just wanted to visit to
speculate about that because if anyone
was going to make a super thin windows
phone it would i think it would be sony
i don't think we're gonna see LG do that
they're their priorities lie elsewhere
in terms of as you said before i'm a
battery life camera experience probably
i'm sure display they're going to bring
something interesting i think will be
really cool to see LG like bust into the
windows phone or return to the windows
phone market in a really bombastic way i
think it would be so cool if they just
dropped science on everyone they were
like oh hey what's up ok good to see you
here's a 2k screen and then Snapdragon
805 an herbed screen verb screen windows
phone oh my god yes and then then
they're like oh my god wait windows
phone doesn't support 2k sorry about
that guys oh yeah listen to be screams
stop torpedoing my dreams with your
facts that's that's what the reality of
Windows who I no longer hide in the
curved screen then the curved screen can
be at 1080p as long as it's curved I'm
fine with it I'm curious I couldn't find
an easy answer to this I wonder what the
current thinnest windows phone handset
is ooh that's a good question it's
probably the Lumia 925 I would guess
unless I'm sure there are manufacturers
not forgetting i don't i don't think it
would be with that hump that's that's
odd well I know but no as it is average
well you don't count them out the
average stuff no the achieves are pretty
chunky actually this thing I locust a
few random Biggers and they're all like
nine millimeter ish none stood out as
really pushing the limits yeah
good point Lumia 925 specs I bet it's
the 925 though it's going to be my guess
I love that note i love nokia spec pages
they have everything you need on a nice
clean page eight point five millimeters
thick is what their and that's counting
the hump it looks like so i really think
the 925 is it but somebody out there
knows better than we do and they can
call it out maybe they may be huawei
actually maybe in one of Huawei's
because Huawei has those really thin
ascend phones and they've got the the
windows phone versions of those two so
it could be speaking of not that let's
talk about one of my favorite moves that
nokia has ever made we're probably in
the in the last few weeks if not days of
nokia nokia handsets division being a
nokia own thing I don't know is this
ever gonna happen I know right but I'm a
posted this story and it's I'm seriously
this is great with the Lumia 930 just
announced the international version of
the icon essentially the company is
going to be bundling qi wireless
chargers in the box this is something
we've been saying that they should have
done on the beginning oh so is that
happening with every 930 what's the deal
well here's the thing when by the way
this is apparently only going to happen
in the UK okay we're at least and okay
we're not it we're not sure um we're not
it's not confirmed yet until they start
doing it but um so now you will have the
you will have a bundled wireless charger
in the Box aside from the regular
charger and this is just my god how long
has it taken companies to figure this
out you know if you bundle a regular
charger on a you know on a box why would
anybody want to spend 70 dollars on a
separate charger only because it's a
wireless charger this was the way to do
it I mean I I would even consider just
getting rid of the whole wall wart and
and doing you know the world just
bringing the wireless charger but
obviously you need to have USB
functionality yeah you got it that's
that's that's the reason why the wires
there but you know this is the only way
that Wireless charges are going to be
happening if you know if you start
creating the necessity and that's what
no kids doing they they really want to
create a push they really want that you
know while I was starting to have the
justice that it deserves but you know
again they need to create a compelling
reason for people to want to buy it so
the first yeah I first saw this I was
very excited about the news for exactly
the reason you get said that this seems
like what you want to do if you want to
make wireless charging really catch on
but then I'm thinking this sounds very
familiar isn't this kind of exactly what
happened with the 920 because we had I
mean it wasn't but it was only temporary
and they did it only at the Microsoft
Store back no 18 he was sending them but
then when ATT brand out nokia stepped up
to fulfill the orders directly but that
was a play wasn't in the box oh yeah
that's gonna be a big Jackie right it
don't ask me a big enough difference
though to make it catch on well I think
it is so crucially different to have
something right in the box ready to use
on day one do you know how annoying it
is to be promised like oh yeah you get a
free wireless charging plate oh cool
just order yeah right exactly you go to
the store they give me your phone they
look okay here's your voucher now you
fill it out on this website in the Nokia
sends it to you in six to eight weeks
it's like what out of my face with this
nonsense no you put it in the box you
you tell people that the first thing
they do when they take out of the box
make sure you charge your phone before
you use it hey here's this really easy
way to do it just put it on this
charging plate after you plug that into
the wall and that is what hooks people
right then you wait four weeks for the
thing to get delivered you're already
used to plugging it into the wall just
like every other stupid phone that's
every season yeah you know so yet has to
be in the box and they needed to do this
from the beginning I think this would
have made a serious improvement in also
perception you can't just be UK specific
if they want this to be big well it
right but the 930 is already a limited
release device yeah you know I mean it's
it's not well I don't know if that's the
way to say it it's just it's not
happening in the US so you know I'm a
lot of publicity we did rise and give
away anything with the icon maybe one
supports it native wait a second one
native is yes was verizon giving away
that huge case that they sent to Taylor
with the icon the Pelican case that was
a nokia thing Nokia's been doing
interesting stuff with Heather package
review devices the 2520 came in a kind
of a regular looking box but the box was
made of aluminum bigger on the inside ya
know so um but I think everyone is
suffering from this unconscious
emulation of the way palm did it with
the and
I'm not just bringing a palm to home
because no no no man I'm serious when
when the pre-launch did the touchstone
was the thing like palm introduced
wireless charging to the smartphone
world but the touchstone was sold
separately at an astronomically high
cost of like 80 bucks or something
probably because pom needed the money
frankly and we've seen other larger
manufacturers take that same model of
like pricing these things really high
and betting on the buzz around wireless
charging to sell these accessories and
it doesn't really make any sense because
there has never been a lot of buzz
around it because no one's done it right
exactly exactly so I really hope that
this experiment works well for nokia
well enough that when microsoft when the
integration happens and we can finally
call nokia you know microsoft hardware
division that microsoft looks at the
data data and says okay every windows
phone from here on out that supports
wireless charging is going to have a
wireless charger in the box I just think
that makes so much sense and Microsoft
is already accustomed to losing money on
things and you know taking losses to
drive market yeah it's good for it yeah
I don't I just couldn't be more excited
about and yes even the answer your
question the icon does have native chi
and i've been using i have an icon again
and i've been using it the nonstop it is
great no then don't just love the fact
that nokia is going back to its roots of
bringing the functionality within the
phone and not having to add an accessory
to get wireless solutely because there's
nothing less convenient than detaching a
cradle to enable a feature that should
be bundled it listen it this is just
like up for example which they try to
remember guys which was the first phone
that you guys own that included
vibrating capabilities when you got a
phone call my very first one yeah I want
to say the same yeah wait a second how
old are you guys my first dumb phone was
2003 okay my first dumb phone was 1997
and back then it wasn't included in
phones you had to get a battery right
you had to buy a battery vibrating
battery a vibrating battery but so
here's the cool thing I mean this is one
thing that you would constantly use
meaning it was still a battery and
all it did was happy added functionality
it had this little hump at the back but
right is the problem with wireless
charging is precisely that you don't
remember about the charger unless until
you go back home at night and you put
the phone to charge but then other than
that it's really pointless to spend so
much money on an accessory that you
won't you will only use every now and
then so you know for me the
functionality like for example of that
cup holders like wow that's genius
because it's something that you you know
that doesn't bother you that's always
there you're always in your car most of
the time and yeah you know it adds the
functionality of placing your phone
somewhere that that will allow you to do
that but other than that man that's the
reason why it hasn't taken off and and
again unless they figure out a way to do
it like that and your car something
something can you know convenient i I me
I need a bathroom one of those things
and they're trying and trying like but
but but this stupid standards war that
exists is doing the opposite of what it
should it's not driving innovation it's
it end and it's not prompting
competition that's doing anything
meaningful it's just resulting in a
fracturing a fragmentation of standards
across devices and now we have stupid
charging pads and Starbucks that no one
uses because they use the wrong wireless
charging standard and you need a stupid
cradle on your iPhone to make it happen
it's just aa dumb stupid stuff just
choose one of them and let's go with it
you know let's talk let's have a
wireless charging specific episode at
some point the future in the meantime
Steven tell us about the schedule for
eight dot one to have preview yeah we're
finally narrowing down on Windows is
coming out it's been rumored for the
past couple weeks before a couple dates
Windows ranges first half of the month
last half of the month whatever Joe
Belfiore went on Twitter yesterday said
the Windows Phone 8.1 Developer Preview
quote-unquote early next week we already
heard fourteenth and fifteenth makes it
as possibilities so this bitch right in
with that so get your phone set up
register for that developer account
download the the preview for developers
app and you will be all set to install
8.1 as soon as it's available and you
very handily bundled some links into
your piece on that so it's the least I
could do appreciate that if you're a
windows phone user and you read Stevens
piece or
or the link in the rundown of this
podcast from your Windows Phone you can
just very easily join the developer
program get that app on your phone and
be ready to install the eight done one
dev preview when it does drop when I
would opt are they yeah you and you will
void your warranty but it's worth it
it's worth Lauren th more indie it's
very safe this is code come from
Microsoft I've never heard anyone having
a problem installing this so yeah knock
on wood you should be fine true we have
finally to close out the windows
category we've heard a lot about the
verizon samsung achieve SE lately right
sant on dinadh including some leaked
official press renders which make the
thing look a lot like old achieves there
for better or worse there's samsung is
stickin with the achieve design language
looks like the galaxy s4 look a lot like
the galaxy s4 with a hairline aluminum
finish on the back which is not real
metal no doubt a low-key introduction
rising just dumped this thing on the
market there was no announcement you
know what pre-orders are open i don't
know i don't know if it's verizon dude
or samsung it's a samsung has i'm sorry
it's just like lazily just squeezing out
these windows phones every so they're
like existing no we still like them yeah
and but wait a second and there is
nothing low-key about this phone dudes i
mean i'm in 1080p mo layout 2.0 three
gigahertz quad-core two gigs of ram 60
60 story microsd up to 64 gigs
13-megapixel camera 2600 milliamp hour
battery yeah that's a decent spec sheet
it's a pretty much a galaxy s4 running
Windows Mobile exactly's Windows Windows
Phone Windows Phone yeah how many times
and sorry about that you know when I saw
these rumors of the atif SC I was like
men what are these guys planning to do
the buttons are still there and I
thought that this was going to be a
windows phone 8.1 device but it turns
out to be a windows phone 8 eventually
upgradeable blood but the phone looks
cool man I don't see anything wrong with
it I'm really sad that Samsung is not
giving these phones enough justice I
mean there was nothing wrong about the
original achieve the TFS I've got quite
a high score for me I thought it was a
phenomenal thing but you know the thing
is in retrospect I would have dinged it
a little bit more for for design because
it's just
generic now you know what the cool thing
is apparently this phone includes the
watch on application you know that the
IR remote and everything oh that is good
yeah yeah because Samsung does a really
good job at building yeah that
particular app suite so good so if you
pre-order now if you're on verizon you
really want to Windows Phone you don't
want the blue me icon you want something
shoes yeah allergies that you really
want to Lumia at the Nativity icon it'll
ship by April 12 which is tomorrow is
the net the day after we record this
podcast which is pretty cool yes we've
asked for review units verizon doesn't
have them yet and samsung would directs
us to verizon so now i will get ordering
the phone because i'm making the people
in the warehouse work on a Saturday to
ship these things are you going to order
on a stephen are you getting one for
yourself no not now okay that's the
reason this or the Lumia icon Tony asks
so leave your leave your comments below
that that piece no wireless charging in
this one right womp womp womp indeed no
all right let's uh I'm I want you to
take us home with a little bit of iOS
news iOS news oh my god Wes tonight can
I just say that I think this I think the
story is totally bogus I just can't be
real so here's the thing i don't think
the price tag is so by the way these are
three pieces of news that but that are
pertaining to iOS and i would recommend
that you guys you know read it on
talking now because it's extremely
detailed so there's this it's not really
news these are predictions but the
problem is the the predictions are
coming from the source that's pretty
much nailed it for like the past four
years yeah on everything to expect from
the next generation iPads the next
generation iphones and the iWatch and so
you know to start with the ipad just to
run down quickly you're getting touch ID
we're getting the same designs and we're
getting the a8 chip and for those of you
that are waiting for the 12 point nine
inch ipad you're gonna have to wait till
2015 apparently um then when it comes to
the iphone of interesting so yes we are
getting the new designs but apparently
the 5.5 inch iphone is going to be the
first iphone to ever buy to a standard
and actually give you a 1080p
play and apparently Apple is planning to
push this phone to be like the highest
end phone because the other phone which
is the 4.7 inch device will include the
same 326ppi resolution only a little
bloated with its new resolution but so
it's it's funny how Apple wants to
continue that 326 pixel french design
where we have how much do you have on
that m8 or that Oppo find 7 how what's
the PPI on that thing actually I don't
know but the fine it's the fine 7a so
it's not the 2k it is the 10 y yeah well
I don't care but yeah but but the thing
is you know finally at was so apparently
Apple figured out a way and and the
reason why it's 4.7 inch and 5.5 inches
actually because these were the screen
sizes that would allow for applications
to not have to be rebuilt to fit the new
resolution oh cuz this is the yeah that
was the sticking point we were talking
about for ages right yeah yeah so this
is finally happening but on the
underwhelming side apparently this
iphone 5 this iphone 6 is going to keep
the same 8-megapixel of 1.5 how do you
say it minions or how do you know
electrons microns right right yeah yeah
microns so apparently that's that's
happening so cool we'll see how that
iphone 6 happens but apparently the
launches will be separate what is going
to happen first a 4.7 inch and then the
other one's gonna happen later which I
don't know how I was gonna do that but
you know the cool thing about this so
the iWatch news is that apparently Apple
is going to make two watches what is
going to be a 1.3 inch and one is going
to be a 1.5 inch witches like my god can
somebody give these news to Samsung to
actually copy this because not everybody
wants like a huge smartwatch and like us
monkeys are so new I don't yet have a
good conception in my mind of what's a
good screen size for them and how big is
1.5 on my wrist anyway with the phones
were used to it we know we're getting
with 4.7 and five then right I don't
know about well so what we'll see about
that apparently it's gonna have it's
gonna be Apple's first AMOLED display
that's not going to be built by Samsung
only the controller is going to be made
by samsung by the way
like 200 250 million power battery
apparently it's gonna work with the mac
the iPhone the iPad but you know even
more interesting is that apparently
Apple is finally going to consider NFC
ah really it shot yes it's it's finally
going to consider NFC and that even
includes the iphone apparently the
iphones are going to be the first ones
to include NFC so you know apparently
this is what's coming but you know the
the what Michael says is apparently
bogus is that it seems that the 1.5 inch
SmartWatch is going to cost thousands of
dollars there's no friggin way there's
no way no way is that we're gonna
release a watch because of Thousand Oaks
yeah nobody is going I mean can you
imagine do you look like for example you
know that the the Voyager what is it the
Explorer edition of Google glass is now
on sale for everybody or it will be next
week next week it will be but who's
going to pay $1,500 for a pair of
glasses that make you look really stupid
a lot of people are saying that this is
actually a pretty smart move on Google's
part because they're opening up to
everybody and it's a very very easy way
to gauge actual interest and I think
that's so enthusiastic I think that
interest is going to be 10 i think the
interest is gonna be pretty low don't
get me wrong but it's a good way to
gauge it though right and it's the same
thing with its it's the same thing with
the iWatch who is going to pay so i
could pay a thousand something dollars
even a thousand something dollars for
full fledged computer is expensive it's
exactly right Apple's got like those
four thousand dollar little plastic
looking computers what is that the mac
pro what would the trash not a plastic
looking computer that's another thing of
the thing of you think you t know well
but the mac pro can do like he can can
fly of the Space Shuttle you know yeah
you get a lot for your money that you I
think you'd be paying a lot and you have
a little thing on your wrist yeah
exactly right yeah here's the thing so
there are other rumors that this i watch
will include like a UV exposure sensor
and you know it seems like if Apple it
sounds like an apple is trying to create
I don't know like the sort of device
that is not only just health oriented
it's not just the pedometer and it's not
just the heart rate monitor but
apparently it
like trying to create a tool for people
that have you know any sort of medical
condition yeah they're not going to do
that like I I still I think that's bogus
too that's a samsung move you know that
that's something where it's like okay
cool some people are fitness addicts who
do our thing so we're gonna put a heart
sensor on the back of this phone but but
it's a bogus hard sensor man that's not
even the real you can do that with any
smartphone camera in a flash no sensor
is where the money's at right but no I
think it makes a degree of sense for
this for samsung to integrate it into
their watches but that's a very that's
something that's woven into their DNA
that's Apple is I think much more
conservative in terms of the types of
features they bundle in and much more
aggressive in perfecting whatever
features they decide to include all
right but here's the thing how can you
how can you reinvent the SmartWatch I
mean because it is not even done being
invented yeah you know it's still so new
that anyone can do anything well that's
the thing I mean it happened with mp3
players they weren't done being invented
and then Apple finally figured it out
with the icon and the same thing
happened with computers and with
smartphones so I guess the question is
what could this i watch do that current
smartwatches or done wat just can't do I
mean I'm you know now I'm not even
willing to pay a thousand dollars for
freaking Rolex what am I why am I going
to pay a dollar you're not I think we
need to throw that out the door right
now because that's totally BS but we're
not sure it is it a jersey laser that
can cut through the bottom of a train
from golden Oh bingo exactly right yes a
laser watch nice think of that oh you
guys haven't seen the new captain
america right not yet no spoilers I want
to go see that I forgot a pax though
this weekend I'm not covering it but I'm
just going taxis in a region yeah so I
think that's its but i may do you have
any the final thought do you have any
doubt that this is the gonna be the year
we see the i watch this is going to be
the okay so iOS 8 has no point in
existing with a toll health book and
everything which is being rumored by
9to5 mac there's just no point in its
existence without a health monitor I
mean you can't just strap the iPhone to
your arm and use it as a health monitor
you need a wearable right so you know I
for me to wait for
so for me to wait for the i watch until
the end of the year which is what this
guy's predicting is something that
doesn't make sense iOS 8 is going to be
announced at WWDC that's just though
it's gonna happen it's happened every
year it's there's that that's when
developers come over so you this is like
the smartest time for you to launch an
iWatch whenever you want to teach people
what to do with it and when is Windows
WWDC again it's happening the second
week of june all right well that's if we
see another watch announcement there I'm
gonna be really except i'll tell you
this you're on the first generation
iphone was launched it was announced in
january and not launched the market
until june june oh so because of all the
pens and everything um I think you know
I think this product could be
revolutionary enough to to warrant Apple
to announce something in june for it not
to be available until until I mean when
they launched the iPad we have to wait
like four months for the ipad is right
no no this is definitely a category
defining a category redefining maybe
product that they would absolutely take
that delay hit on they don't mind that
especially if they can come in and drink
Motorola's milkshake by doing it with
Android wear devices starting to hit the
scene this summer Apple needs to step up
and distract everyone exactly right they
need to stop everyone from yeah because
they don't want to be in a situation
where they launched the iWatch in
whatever august or September but
everyone's already bought a moto 360 and
like three people have bought the lg1
everybody lost the thing is it doesn't
look terrible it looks it looks plenty
of mine but next to the Moto 360 it
looks like the most boring thing I've
ever seen anything looks horrible
excitedly sees the LG watch them what
your 60 ones are all renders I don't
care I don't it doesn't matter when a
render looks that good I want oh man you
want the render you don't know that's
exactly right yeah right you should just
clear some oculus rifts and get preggers
just watch on your wrist it's actually
gonna be that were do me fine too and
now I could I can get my facebook status
updates as i look at my fake nails yeah
honest alright guys we got everybody's
gonna see you down the street and be
like oh there goes
mr. pocket now yeah mr. pocket now well
gentlemen thank you for joining me I
think we all have work to get back to
and it's the end of the week and we
should get to the business of ending the
week what do you say what is this music
in the rundown that's a lease pagnell oh
you haven't been on since we started
using Ali's music that's transition
music which we're not using on the show
because we don't have a feature but yeah
that's a lead is written a track called
radiation which is actually I'm it was
one of the ringtones on the Nexus 4 and
the Galaxy Nexus all right but it's
actually a full length song and she is
like millions of fans It's it's awesome
so she's really cool we're gonna have
around the weekly at some point to
interview her about that once everything
dies down but we can't do it yeah
whenever I listen yeah right no but it's
going to we're gonna have a gulf there's
gonna be a goal that's gonna be
wonderful and that's when i'm gonna do
microsoft immersion and i'm looking
forward to that and i'm a oh and that's
when I'm is gonna do is think you're
using mailbox on Android right now
aren't you oh yeah yeah all right we
can't talk about that this week no it
can't we're gonna talk about it soon and
then from Stephen do you have to get
back to your news shift yes yeah I guess
that'd be the best and I'm it has to
build the pocket out daily before the
power goes out again oh god don't remind
ya please okay well then I and I have to
go back to doing this secret thing that
I can't talk about so that is going to
