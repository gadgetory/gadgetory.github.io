Samsung to cut out their Infinity OLEDs
for the Galaxy S ten why is there so
much envy from my amazing physique right
earlier I was walking by Haim at CES
when he just happened to be recording
for this particular video and he legit
farted and had to reshoot the segment he
was talking about dude do not please do
not blame me for what you did I smelled
you I smelled you what I mean I need to
create more social media accounts so we
can hear your name more at the end mmm
that's right it's that time of the week
I am home it'll be better this is
PocketNow and this is the parking out
daily recap your comments for last week
and I apologize it's noisy it's raining
outside
so the question on Monday was the galaxy
s 10 and it's possible variance we hear
that there are up to 5 I told you about
the options I asked you what you thought
we had 351 comments Samsung thinks it's
the end of the world the company might
not but it's actually not a bad idea to
launch as many phones as they can at
least one of them will stick given the
fumble that Apple's going through S 10
light plus normal 5g 10 year anniversary
version that's probably the name for one
if it were on Sprint I think s tannest
and less than pro/5 GES 10 activist 10
light oh my god can you imagine if they
brought back the active I would love
that
then on Tuesday the topic was a possible
notch less iPhone feature as apparently
there is this company that's building
some technology that Apple will use
according to them we have 392 comments
ask you what you thought wouldn't be
hilarious if Apple added a fingerprint
sensor on the back to remove the knotch
oh my god I can't wait for that on an
iPhone or any other device an oculus
world is a better world totally up for
that definitely notch --less world and
headphone jack not Julis don't matter
anymore what matters is low price phones
with great features true that if they
can get their cameras right that's
really the biggest hurdle with phones
that are less expensive but on Wednesday
the topic was the Galaxy f apparently it
was showcased yet again privately to
people I'm nan
I can promise that I'm not gonna come up
with stories later I haven't seen it I
asked you are you excited about it we
had 383 comments they'll find a way to
make us drool about the foldable screen
for sure marketing is a power monster
yes it is a power of monster but they
don't always get it right and I still
feel that this is a solution in search
of a problem
I think galaxy f is the future every
great products first iteration will not
always be great true if there were a
purpose I mean have you heard the rumors
of a possible lg snap-on product where
you have the phone screen and then you
attach another one I feel that that's a
smarter idea so you don't carry you know
the bulk of an extra screen where you
don't need to foldable phone means a
large screen that fits in my pocket
means it will solve my problem dude sure
if only they figured out how to make
that thing thin and battery technology
hasn't gotten any better which is what
makes a product thick and then Wednesday
we covered something we never expected
to see iPhones getting less expensive in
China I asked you what you thought about
that
we had 484 comments $50 only that's the
price change not a drop Apple is just
trolling us got true that man you got
those likes and you deserve them the way
iPhone sales are going down Apple will
soon discover oil lol oh my god alright
best comment of the week I think 700 USD
is the sweet spot for flagships dude I
do too I mean they were 650 just a few
years ago I think that fine give $50
more $700 that's okay but it like I
don't understand how they went from that
to what they are now and then finally
Friday I mean we've been covering triple
cameras on the iPhone 11 Mac's for a
while
horrible humps and everything I asked
you what do you think these cameras
should do we had 397 comments that
camera bump is hideous
dude I I think it's too early for those
designs so I don't think that they're
real but who knows three cameras on
iphone one regular one ultra wide and
one to look for disappearing sales well
it depends on the price man oMG triple
cameras on iPhones this means iPhones
are getting more expense
I hope that's not gonna be the case
