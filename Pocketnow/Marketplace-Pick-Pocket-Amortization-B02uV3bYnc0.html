pocket calm and with interest rates
being so low as they are these days it
seems wise to either invest in a home or
to buy a new vehicle or even get new
credit cards to raise your credit so
today I'm gonna show you pocket
amortization and this is a free
application on windows mobile
marketplace so let's get started ok so
here we are on the pocket amortization
calculator and this is a pretty simple
program but very useful if you are out
shopping for either a house or a new car
or wanting to see how long it would take
to pay something off on your credit card
so let's say that you were to purchase a
used car for fifteen thousand nine
hundred and ninety-nine dollars at three
point nine nine percent which is a
pretty good interest rate for a used car
nowadays and let's say that you choose a
72 month payment plan which is six years
you can calculate that payment pretty
quickly all you just hit calculate
payment and it's two hundred fifty
dollars and 23 cents so let's say that I
wanted to buy a new car and let's say
that it was a thirty four thousand seven
hundred fifty-six dollars sticker price
so click select here and let's say that
I got a better interest rate because it
is a new car let's say we got a two
point four nine percent interest rates
so I'm just going to select and now i
can calculate my payment to five hundred
and twenty dollars and eighteen cents
but let's say that our credit is not so
great and we only get let's say we get
an eight point five percent interest
rate which is a pretty bad we can see
the difference between the five hundred
twenty dollars at a to point something
percent interest rate and the 8.5 so
let's click here and it's six hundred
and seventeen dollars so almost a
hundred dollars difference just for that
interest rate so let's see where to
calculate a house and our term of our
loan is 30 years we can select that and
of course it would not be
eight-point-five percent because if it
was you would be insane and to buy a
house at that price let's say with
current interest rates right now let's
say there in about there about four and
a half but let's say that we get a loan
and locked in at four point seven five
percent so we can slow
that of course the house won't be thirty
four thousand dollars unless you get a
great deal let's say it's around three
hundred and five thousand or something
like that k lassila select and see what
our monthly payment would be and it's
1591 dollars but let's say that we want
to see what it would cost per month if
we did a 15 year loan at course you
always get better interest rates at 15
year loan so let's say 4.25 or something
like that so select there and calculator
payment okay so apparently you wouldn't
want how to have a 75 year loan so
calculate our payment and it's two
thousand two hundred and ninety-four
dollars so for just a few hundred
dollars more a month you could have that
loan paid off in 15 years opposed to 30
years now let's say that you want to
calculate how much of a house you can
buy let's say you want to have it for 30
years of course and you want it to be
under a thousand dollars so let's try
one hundred and ninety thousand dollar
house and you'll select there at four
point seven five percent let's say
that's what you got locked in it and you
can select and calculate your payment so
you can buy one hundred and ninety
thousand dollar house for under a
thousand bucks at four point seven five
percent which is much cheaper than
running even some places so this is a
very useful application if you want to
calculate how much your payment is going
to be per month and this is pocket amer
ization and the program is free on
windows mobile marketplace and this is
another marketplace pic and if you liked
