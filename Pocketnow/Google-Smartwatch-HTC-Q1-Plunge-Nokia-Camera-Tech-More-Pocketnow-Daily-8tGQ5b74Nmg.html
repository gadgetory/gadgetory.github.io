smartwatch HTC's first quarter results
are in and they're very very bad and
Nokia's new pen points to significant
Cameron provements I'm hi meri beta and
after Google glass what's next a Google
drink this is out daily let's
start today off with the lame news Apple
is just released iOS 6.1 point for to
the public and the update is so small at
the file size is barely 11 point 6
megabytes it only includes some minor
improvements to the speakerphone
performance and no mention on battery
changes but make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well if we discover anything
we'll definitely film a video out for
you and let you know what the
enhancements are now let's talk about
HTC the company's quarter results are in
and they are catastrophic sadly the
delays in the launch at the HTC One were
definitely bad i mean the company is
posted 98% losses in profit in
comparison to last year that's right
there's only two percent left there and
obviously their revenue is down as well
not as bad but it's still down now
remember the HTC One was pretty much
launched in q2 so this doesn't reflect
what is going on with the HTC One so
stay tuned we are expecting for HTC to
see much better numbers next quarter now
let's talk about Microsoft digitizers
are pointing that the company is ready
to launch or pretty much announced their
second generation Microsoft Surface in
jun 26 under Bill Developers Conference
and apparently this device will not look
at all like the current generation
tablet at least in size if we do get any
options there'll be seven inches or nine
inches which is kind of interesting to
see Microsoft doing this so stay tuned
for the rumors now let's talk about
Nokia's the company has filed a new pen
that allows them to build a smartphone
camera with adjustable aperture this
will allow the camera to it just a
different lighting situations depending
low light good light doesn't matter but
obviously we still don't know if this
will be included in the possible Nokia
EOS or EOS camera smartphone that will
be launched in May a spur rumors you
know everybody's talking about the
catwalk so stay tuned we will keep you
posted on me and finally for the
interesting news of the day Google you
know that company that sells pretty much
everything except the kitchen sink and I
hope they're not listening before they
start selling one but now they patent a
new SmartWatch and given the fact that
we've heard the rumors
and I watch what took them so long but
wait a second this google smartwatch is
interesting if any of you know what
google glass does you know that it does
have this touchpad on the right side of
the glass and it allows the user to
navigate within the UI of google glass
in order to be able to you know navigate
through different menus or communicate
so the interesting part is that
apparently this technology will be
included in this SmartWatch to allow you
to navigate using the wristband which is
kind of interesting let's hope they
don't use rubber for that but that leads
me to the question of the day I mean
think about it if you have the option
google glass or g SmartWatch with pretty
much the same capabilities in my
particular case i'd be taking glasses
off all the time i'm not a fan of using
glasses and you know i just feel it
there the next bluetooth headset that
will end up in the glove compartment of
my car but you know obviously watches
are more ubiquitous so leave us a
comment down below what would you
consider you'd like a SmartWatch or
smart glasses and of course for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone is out roll
make sure you follow us on fog and calm
subscribe to our YouTube channel you can
also follow me on Twitter to have it
underscored iveta please give this video

hanging out of event thank you very much
for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
