for SmartWatch HCC's first quarter
results are in and they're very very bad
and Nokia's new pen points to
significant Cameron provements I'm Jaime
Rivera and after Google glass what's
next a Google drink
this is out daily let's start
today off with the late news Apple is
just released by iOS 6.1 point 4 to the
public and the update is so small at the
file size is barely eleven point six and
megabytes it only includes some minor
improvements to the speakerphone
performance and no mention on battery
changes but make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well if we discover anything
we'll definitely film a video out for
you and let you know what the
enhancements are now let's talk about
HTC the company's quarter results are in
and they are catastrophic
sadly the delays in the launch of the
HTC One were definitely bad I mean the
company has posted 98% losses in profit
in comparison to last year that's right
there's only 2% left there and obviously
their revenue is down as well not as bad
but it's still down now remember the HTC
One was pretty much launched in q2 so
this doesn't reflect what is going on
with the HTC One so stay tuned we are
expecting for HTC to see much better
numbers next quarter now let's talk
about Microsoft digitizes are pointing
that the company is ready to launch or
pretty much announced their
second-generation Microsoft Surface in
June 26 on their build Developers
Conference and apparently this device
will not look at all like the current
generation tablet at least in size if we
do get any options there'll be seven
inches or nine inches which is kind of
interesting to see Microsoft doing this
so stay tuned for the rumors now let's
talk about Nokia's the company has filed
a new pen that allows them to build a
smartphone camera with adjustable
aperture this will allow the camera to
it just a different lighting situations
depending low-light good light doesn't
matter but obviously we still don't know
if this will be included in the possible
Nokia iOS or a O's camera smartphone
that will be launched in may ask for
rumors you know everybody's talking
about the catalogue so stay tuned we
will keep you posted on May and finally
for the interesting news of the day
Google you know that company that sells
pretty much everything except the
kitchen sink and I hope they're not
listening before they start selling one
but now they patent a new SmartWatch and
given the fact that we've heard the
rumors
and I watched what took him so long but
wait a second this Google SmartWatch is
interesting if any of you know what
Google glass does you know that it does
have this touchpad on the right side of
the glass and it allows the user to
navigate within the UI of Google glass
in order to be able to you know navigate
through different menus or communicate
so the interesting part is that
apparently this technology will be
included in this SmartWatch to allow you
to navigate using the wristband which is
kind of interesting let's hope they
don't use rubber for that but that leads
me to the question of the day I mean
think about it if you have the option
Google glass or or G SmartWatch with
pretty much the same capabilities in my
particular case I'd be taking glasses
off all the time I'm not a fan of using
glasses and you know I just feel it
there the next Bluetooth headset that
will end up in the glove compartment of
my car but you know obviously watches
are more ubiquitous so leave us a
comment down below what would you
consider you'd like a SmartWatch or
smart glasses and of course for an
earlier scope of everything that's
happening in the smartphone it's out
roll make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com subscribe to our youtube
channel you could also follow me on
twitter to have it underscore Yvetta
