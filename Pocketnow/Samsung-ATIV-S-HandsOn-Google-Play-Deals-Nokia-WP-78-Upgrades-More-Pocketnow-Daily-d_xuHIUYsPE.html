eva's google counts down 2013 with daily
deals and nokia wasn't really serious
about Windows Phone 7.8 I'm home in
ravenna seriously wondering why Samson
then come up with a windows phone camera
as well and this is parking out daily
yes believe it or not it's finally here
our review unit for the Samsung at CVS
has finally arrived this device is only
a little more mysterious that Apple's
wide iphone for that took 10 months to
leave the oven the device is finally
landed at michael Fischer's office for
full review treatment you already
started his unboxing but don't let me
bore you with specifics make sure you
watch the links down below for full
details on his coverage there's a lot to
talk about with this phone some things
are good some things are not so good so
make sure you watch now speaking of
samson they just released a new device
that we're not sure if we should
celebrate about it's called the galaxy
grand and even though it looks a lot
like the galaxy s3 well it's not this
device sports a 5-inch display which is
great but it sports a painful wvga
resolution try remember what year this
is but aside from that it also has a
dual core processor and even though it
runs jelly bean we're not sure if this
is gonna be a really good device or not
quite hard to see why Samsung is using
these great designs like the galaxy s3
and throwing them away with a monster
spec like this one but we'll probably
see the device at CES 2013 so we'll keep
you posted now speaking of HTC we've got
good and bad news on the bad side
apparently the HTC butterfly will not be
a European the vice meaning we won't get
a carrier unlocked international variant
and there will be a US and asia
exclusive now on the good side
apparently we will be getting that HTC
m7 device sporting a 4.7 inch display
with the same 1080p resolution that
we've got on the butterfly for those
that found that the 5-inch display on
the butterfly was awkward will most
likely see this m7 be launched at mwc
2013 and there are some monster specs on
this device so stay tuned now on the
other hand Google is a bearer of good
news for the holidays as apparently they
are counting down until january first
2013 to offer daily deals just like they
did last year last year they offered
significant discounts and
locations and this time they have one
daily deal and even though this deal for
today probably is not the best deal ever
you could probably just wait till
tomorrow and see what they're offering
this deal of course countdowns until
january first 2013 so just visit the
google play store every day you could be
surprised and finally for the oh no what
are you doing news of the day nokia had
us all on the edge of our seats looking
for our Lumia 800 devices because
apparently they were launching windows
phone 7.8 for the device all of us here
at Pocket net were scrambling trying to
find our review unit and as it turns out
yesterday they broke our hearts by
saying that no they'll be launching it
until early 2013 which could be six
months in Microsoft phase if you know
what that means I'm just curious I mean
that made you to the question of the day
how many of you are actually still using
legacy Windows Phone devices I've got
two in a drawer and I'm not looking back
leave us a comment down below and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow was on
parking Eircom please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
kind of any better thanks for watching
see you tomorrow that's the same for
factor in design but this guy there now
speaking of sansom now speaking of
Samsung they just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
