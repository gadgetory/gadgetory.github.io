pocketnow.com in this video we're gonna
show you how to run the Android 4.0
emulator so that you can try out Ice
Cream Sandwich on your own and see how
you like it let's get to it alright so
step one go to developer.android.com
slash SDK I'll put all these steps in
the description so you can follow along
and then you will come to a page that
looks like this basically and then you
want to click on the left go to Android
4.0 platform and then the next step
would be to click where it says download
the SDK starter package it'll come
through as a zip folder you're gonna
want to extract the zip folder - I don't
know a place on your desktop or
something like that and you will get
something that looks kind of like this
what we want to focus on here is the SDK
manager so double click on that click
run and all that good stuff you'll get a
screen that looks like this and what
you're going to want to do next is put a
little check in the box where it says
Android 4.0 you'll have a button down
here mine is grayed out because I've
already done this that says install
packages you click that it will download
it'll take about two five minutes
depending on your connection speed then
you've got the the Android 4.0 ready to
go in terms of the emulator so close
that after you've downloaded 4.0 and
then go into AVD manager in the original
files that you unzipped presumably to
your desktop click run and this is where
you create the emulator and I've already
created an emulator I'll walk you
through the process of creating a new
one so we want to click new we're going
to name it let's just call it emulator -
you want to change the target to Android
4.0 and then there's not that many other
options that you want to change and by
the way it can't be emulator - it's
telling me contains invalid cow
characters so I'm gonna put a Z on the
end just be fun down here you want to
change the resolution the lower you go
the better performing the emulator will
be I'm sticking with WVGA but if you
want to go higher to the full 720p and
you've got the processing power to do it
then go ahead Ram size I like to change
to 1024 I don't even know if that does
anything but it sounds cool then you
click create a VD and then it takes
about five minutes for the Android
emulator to actually load its very CPU
intensive let me show you what it looks
like after you actually load the
emulator so I'm gonna pull up that's not
it here it is here is the Android
emulator and what we have here are some
controls on the right that you can use
so you can use the built-in keyboard you
can use the keyboard on your device and
then we've got the Android buttons here
and in 4.0 to bring up the multitask
launcher you tap and hold on the home
button since you don't get the special
virtual keys and everything else is
pretty much the same you got the back
button the Menu button you've got a
d-pad if you want to move around from
home screen to home screen if the swipes
aren't working and you use your mouse to
interact with it so that's how you run
Ice Cream Sandwich in the emulator hope
you enjoy that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
