pocketnow.com there seems to be some
misunderstanding some confusion about
Flash and Android you can still get
flash on Android just not quite as
conveniently as you might have hoped in
this video we're going to go into a
little bit of why that's the case and
how you can still get flash 11 on your
Android today let's go take a look so a
lot of people have hacks they have
hacked browser apks that you can install
with root and put into a specific
location assign permissions blah blah
blah we're not going to do that instead
head on over to adobe's website i'll
have a link for you in the article at
pocketnow.com from there we are going to
scroll all the way down here and take a
look at their archived older versions of
flash player and check this out flash
player for android four-point Ice Cream
Sandwich jelly bean devices and then
down here for two point x three point X
and older than that what we're going to
do is very simply the first one is flash
player 11.1 point 1 15 point 27 tap on
that and of course it's going to then
start downloading once that downloads
it's very fast you can see here this is
the ICS version there are some people
out there who are distributing the jelly
bean version but this should work just
fine on both we're going to go ahead and
install it you can see now I can't this
is a side load operation so I've got to
come into my settings and you guys know
this already I've got to come in here
and say yes I want to be able to install
from unknown sources I am going to
assume the risk and then we should be
good the hard part now is I've got to
find where that download wasn't open it
again but i'm lazy so i'm just going to
go ahead and tap on that it's going to
download it again it's really really
small and fast just adds a dash one to
the end of the name and once that's done
now i can install
it installs pretty quickly this is
Android jellybean 4.2 so it's going to
check that against it's known malware
database a little bit of extra
protection there for me and then it
installs and it's all done so what I did
is I headed over to congregate com
that's congregate with a k in my Chrome
browser and was told Oh chrome does not
support this plugin that's not
surprising so firing up Firefox headed
to the same site and I'm playing a game
here called kingdom rush you can see
I've got this little plug-in button it's
underneath it you can't read that it
says tap here to activate plugin so
let's tap there to activate the plug-in
take just a minute and there you go I've
got flash right there on my android this
is jelly bean but this should work on
Ice Cream Sandwich and up as long as
I've got a browser that respects that
plug-in which Firefox does so it's not
impossible to get flash working on your
android-powered device just a little
inconvenient hopefully it'll buy some
more time until developers game
developers come out with either html5
versions or native versions of their
apps for us kind of a fun tip takes an
awful lot of work to do but flash isn't
dead yet 4-pocket now showing off some
workarounds I'm Joe Levi thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
