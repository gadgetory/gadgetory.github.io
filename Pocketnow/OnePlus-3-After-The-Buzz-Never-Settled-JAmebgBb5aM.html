story every single time the media goes
crazy over every hot new device but
after that review period wears off so
what is the buzz behind that new tool
you might still want to buy but that now
faces new competition the thing is in
the real world things don't really
happen that way for most of us aging is
just as important as the moment you
unbox your product for the first time
it's how that device performs after
extensive use that really matters down
the line so let's do something about it
let's take a second look at the flagship
killer that from day one reminds us to
never settle I'm high not even I would
 it now and this is the one plus
three after the buzz let me ask you a
quick question have you ever used the
oneplus device if you haven't I highly
suggest you do because there is only so
much I can really tell you on a video
I'm not ashamed to admit that my first
time was with the recent one plus three
T review and I'm also not ashamed to
admit that ever since it's been really
hard to move away from it the truly
delight a customer a product really
needs to get a lot of things right and
it needs to do so for an extended period
of time
and I feel that this is where this
product shines the most actually aging
is a crucial factor that I feel oneplus
has handled gracefully this unit was
first reviewed by Wan before I used it
on our 3t comparison and the back is
still pristine the sandstone one plus
back has kept me company from day one
mainly because I feel it actually adds
texture to the overall feel and before
you cringe at me for always removing
screen protectors this display has the
least amount of scratches that I've seen
for a product this old
the vacations have also not aged at all
this 1+3 still carries more RAM and more
storage than the average flagship that's
charging through us BC is still one of
the fastest and the simple basics like
the volume switch still continue to be
on my list of favorites now honestly my
favorite thing about this phone is the
software for starters oneplus finally
delivers a timely update to Android 7
dotto nougat so you have the new quick
setting slider split window multitasking
and just about everything else that
nougat has to offer but even before the
nougat update what I love the most about
this phone as its approach to
customizability don't like the hard work
of positive buttons switch them off and
go with the software ones want to switch
their order go right ahead
want extra features to launch when
pressing and holding or when double
tapping there's also an option for that
as well best of all you want to lock
these buttons for gameplay there is also
a quick setting option to allow that and
I also love to get full-blown
notifications and music controls on the
phones on standby something that's
really hard to find on every single
always-on display in the market and yes
not everything is perfect I'm still not
a fan of how the launcher handle certain
widgets forcing me to use third-party
ones for basics like the clock and yes I
do hate this yellow tint on the night
mode whoever came up with this color
tone which I also can't find an option
on how to automate it and have it turn
on at 10:00 p.m. for example and as for
screen latency which I know is your
first question I can't really say that
I've had much of a problem with this
review unit but I do notice certain
cases that are hard to replicate where
the notification slider doesn't seem to
work for example
still it's really hard for me to pan my
minor complaints as the turns for the
user experience this phone is fast it is
fluid and it handles graphics intensive
games like a champ
and I joined one and calling the scone a
delight for music playback through the
headphones now battery life didn't
really start as one of my favorite
features after the new get update but I
have noticed that it only gets better
and better the more I use it now being
able to achieve a full day without a
problem now something very curious has
happened with the camera if there was
one thing that was keeping me away from
using this phone as my daily driver was
really how the camera performed in
certain scenarios but it seems that the
nougat update has brought some really
interesting improvements obviously your
typical photo during the day continues
to be great with crunchy color and deep
saturation but what I noticed is how
much it's improved at night it's really
significant I've noticed improvements in
color reproduction and giving you
accurate depictions of what your eye can
see at night which is the least that I
can ask for a camera so keep in mind
that it won't always be the most stable
and that stability problem also extends
to the performance on video where I have
noticed that it is a little more stable
than before the update but not at the 1
+ 3 P level obviously if you want the
best you have to go for the 3 P and
that's really the thing about the one
plus three at the moment certain markets
don't really carry this phone anymore
given the arrival of the 3 P but we saw
it fit to still do it after the buzz on
this device because mainly certain
markets still do and this is still a
great bone I can't think of a better
phone for those of you looking for a
flagship hardware stellar performance
and a decent camera all on a package
that cost at least $250 less than your
standard flagship even 7 months later
and at the same 400 dollars the oneplus
3 remains the undisputed flagship killer
of 2016 and still a device worthy is
considering in 2017 if your market is
limited only to the 3 honestly this is
still a great phone I highly recommend
it Bravo oneplus
