galaxy s 8 in the works the Google pixel
seems to be pretty water resistance even
if it doesn't claim it and yes your
latest and greatest idol for cough
blackberry is here I'm hi Mary vera and
I'm still shocked at the comments
yesterday predicting what the surface
style was I saw some porn there but
anyways this is pocket out daily
official lose today begin with
blackberry because the nudie tech 60 is
out pretty much the idol 4s in looks at
least but then you've got a bevy of
specs here quad HD display Snapdragon
820 processor 4 gigs of ram 32 gigs of
expandable storage this is truly a
powerhouse in a very beautiful chassis
we do love the idol for us for its
design the only thing is this smartphone
is pretty much targeted to the
enterprise market app true it will be
available and we will keep you posted as
a price tag is not really that bad let's
talk about Google mainly because of its
daydream VR program we thought that it
was just going to be standalone headsets
but the company has moved way far from
google cardboard now it seems that what
we're getting is enhanced functionality
apparently google is working on I
tracking and that eye tracking will
provide added features we wonder exactly
what kind of added features could be
brought with the eye tracking but I'm
not saying that it's a bad idea let's
see what we get now let's talk about the
Google pixel which I have been testing
for the past 12 hours so far it is a
really great phone but this is rather
interesting the great donphan morrison
recently tested the phone and its water
resistance mainly because google claims
i p53 which is splash resistant but hey
john pretty much set that phone for an
hour in the case and well be ours no BS
he literally filmed the whole video for
an hour and after that the phone pretty
much survive the camera works and
obviously it wasn't designed to be
submerged but it did pretty much reminds
us of how the iphone 6s was sort of
water resistant even if it wasn't
claimed that way we're not saying
submerge your phone we're just
it's not gonna die if you splash it in
the rain or something that's pretty much
it now let's shift focus to Samsung
starting with the galaxy note 7 really
interesting those of you that have
decided to keep your phone in Europe you
might as well not update software if you
want to continue using that phone or you
know what updates software because what
it's going to do is it's going to limit
your battery life to sixty percent and
given the fact that this phone has been
so dangerous it makes all the sense in
the world for this to force you to go
switch your phone's it's about time
really the only reason why I've waited
and haven't powered mine on is because
I've been waiting for different options
to see what I could switch to because I
already have a galaxy s7 edge but yeah
so far this is what's going to happen to
Europe it should happen to the United
States soon as well people please just
switch the phone and finally the very
hot news that they have to do with the
rumors of the galaxy s 8 this time we're
hearing specifications and this thing is
crazy let's talk about the edge variant
particularly because apparently we're
getting an 80% screen to body ratio here
apparently this phone is going to be
crazy beautiful in design but that's not
the end of it apparently we're getting
eight gigs of RAM believe it or not
apparently there's going to be a
Snapdragon 830 or an Exynos 88-90 5
processor here we don't have any storage
options though but apparently the whole
idea is that this phone is going to be a
beast and yes I know I've said
apparently too much problem is this is
still a rumor but anyways it leads me to
the question of the day what monster
specifications lure you to the galaxy s
8 next year or has a everything that's
happened just complicated your existence
in my case I do believe that that phone
will be great and I think Samsung has
learned its lesson let's just see leave
us a comment down below we love to know
