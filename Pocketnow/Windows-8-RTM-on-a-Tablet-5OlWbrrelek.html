now calm and windows 8 was released to
manufacturing so this is the final
version of windows 8 got installed on
this tablet and now there's a few new
things so let's check them out one of
the first things you'll notice that it's
changed from the release preview on
Windows 8 the final version is the set
up of sequence the first prompt asks you
you know what color combination you like
for the theme then you're just going to
go through some wireless set up some
Express settings so this appears to be a
tutorial about Windows 8 and this is
very important because Windows 8 is a
very different type of operating system
compared to what windows 7 and
everything before that was so we see you
can swipe in from the edge or move your
mouse into the corner here we have the
new lock screen image which is a pretty
nice illustration of a the seattle space
needle and so we just swipe it then you
get to the start screen and there's
something new down here we see a new
background image so let me go to the
settings and show you all the new
options for the start screen so here we
have a ton of new background images i'll
just go through a few of them real quick
and if i hit the start you can see the
full screen version of that let me go
back and there's some swirlies on the
bottom a little bird little flowers this
one is kind of nice and you see it
applies right away as soon as i select
it this one's pretty nice too that's
cool fish and we have
that and that some of them are pretty
horrible looking you can see what this
one looks like weird colors they're kind
of distracting and we have the little
circles and now we're getting to some
really bad ones like that and here's
some others and there's the blank one
let's go back to this one you can see
all this kind of distracting if you like
that and there's a blank one and we also
have some updates in the desktop there's
our new default picture and if you go to
personalize we only have two little
themes here well this is the windows
default and also earth and we have
flowers so more flowers and we got pink
and it's set to change colors based on
the image of the background so you see
that happening and but we also have
noticed this team is much more flat
everything's more flat more metro style
so it really goes better with the
metro-style interface MX style is what
i'm calling it and here's a theme that I
used on a previous version of the
windows 8 beta which was synced over so
that just came through in the cloud and
we notice is when I have a black color
theme none of my text is readable in the
heading up there see I can't see
anything in that main title bar there
that seems like a bug
can't even see the minimize button so
let's get back into the MX style
interface the new start menu and see a
few more new things here the email
program now supports imap accounts so
from here we can also add other accounts
this is a wasn't there before but now we
can I have it imap and pop3 as well as
Gmail exchange office 360 lucam hotmail
live com msn all of those are now
supported the calendar people and email
programs now sync properly with exchange
2003 and higher so that's really great
that they didn't remove exchange 2003
people app now has some new features if
I go to meet tile there I can post to
Facebook or Twitter that's a great new
feature that wasn't available in the
beta of course you can see your own
stuff here and notifications and photos
all that good stuff and here we can see
the people that are online you can see I
have it checked online only and we can
start chats with anybody the Photos app
has seen the update as well now we have
this ferris wheel background image
however we can't seem to change the
background image it seems to be stuck as
that for now at least and you can see
photos from all your different locations
the music app has been updated and it's
a xbox music now and you can just take
your store and this is a great feature
that I like if I swipe the charm I can
do whoops i meant to do share and i can
share it on Facebook or Twitter
and it gives you a link to market plays
xbox calm and it'll let whoever clicks
on it check out the album or download it
if they want there's your twitter link
same for the video app it's now xbox
video we sign in and you can see
television store movies highlights and
your own videos on your device
and again we can share these on social
networks or any other app that has a
share support so that's a quick look at
some of the new changes in the final
version of Windows 8 we're sure to see
some updates to a lot of these apps that
are included because they're all you
know updateable separately but mostly we
have bug fixes and a few theme changes
the start screen and the desktop
backgrounds as well as the colors not a
lot different from the release preview
but some nice changes be sure to give
this video a thumbs up and that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
