carry on lock our full Nexus 10 review
is now live we'll show you just how to
get adobe flash on newer Android devices
I'm hi mera Lavetta one drain of adobe
flash is still as hot as it used to be
and this is parking out daily that's
right the sign that Apple is finally
meeting the man's when it comes to the
iphone 5 is finally here once you start
seeing that they sell any iphone with a
carrier and lock it means that their
problems are almost over you can out
pick up an iphone 5 without a contract
for 650 bucks for the 16 gig model and
then addict next for 100 bucks for the
32 or 64 gigabyte models respectively
now this means that you can finally use
your iphone on tmobile obviously and
second that the prices will now begin to
drop on places I ebay now the company
that hasn't even started meeting demands
a samsung with the ratty VES it was the
first windows phone 8 device to be
announced and it still hasn't even been
launched it was recently announced in
Taiwan for a non specific date and it's
also being mentioned now in Canada for
mid December launch but it just makes
you wonder if Sammy is actually waiting
for windows phone 8 to actually crash or
mean something before they dive in
interview we're interested in a
microsoft surface pro they have just
shared the pricing with the public the
64 gigabyte model will retail for 900
bucks and then the 128 gigabyte model
will retail for a thousand dollars no
touch or type covers included and as
with everything microsoft there are no
specific dates included only early 2013
now the interesting part here is the
fact that even though these things are
pricey you are getting a full computer
but then when you compare it to the full
fledged 11-inch macbook air that retails
it that same price range you wonder if
it's really worth it and our full Nexus
10 review is now live and Joe Levi gave
it a lot of praise as being one of the
best android tablets in the market now
this review is really special because
Joe recently reviewed the previous
half-sibling samsung galaxy note 10.1
and you didn't like the note 10.1 even
with the s-pen so make sure you watch
this full review and learn why the Nexus
10 is so special because so far it
actually is and finally for the hot news
of the day
if you thought that Adobe Flash was dead
for new or Android device as well Google
tried to kill it with Android 4.1 jelly
bean and beyond but Joe Levi shows us a
full video on how to get it to work the
full walk around at all the steps so you
have to follow which is actually quite
simple so make sure you hit the links
and that leads me to the question of the
day just how important is adobe flash
for you on a mobile device in my
particular case i rarely use it but i
know of a lot of people that do use it
so make sure you leave us a comment down
below and if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet will make sure you
follow us on pocketnow.com please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I'm hi Natalie better thanks for
