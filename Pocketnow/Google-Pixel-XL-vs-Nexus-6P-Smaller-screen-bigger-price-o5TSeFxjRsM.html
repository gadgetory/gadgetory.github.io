calm ah the one-year upgrade it's a
tricky recommendation under the best of
situations but this year's Google
upgrade path is also complicated by a
rather stark shift in consumer direction
if you're currently rockin the Nexus 6p
is the pixel XL enough of an upgrade to
part you and your hard earned cash it's
time for a showdown
first a little confession I've never
been the biggest Nexus fan I've always
appreciated that Google was instrumental
in starting the budget-busting
discussion which really came to fruition
this year but as individual devices they
really weren't my jam this was
compounded by the fact that I genuinely
prefer smaller phones and last year's LG
built Nexus 5x was an inoffensive if
somewhat underwhelming option for stock
Android only after receiving the pixel
XL have I been able to spend any
significant time with the Nexus 6p but
enough about me what we have here
represents a significant shift for a
company to achieve we're not talking
galaxy s6 to s7 refinement we're talking
about appealing to completely different
customer demographics the 6p exits the
scene as the peak of developer focused
handsets the pixel is Google's first
attempt at a soft around the edges
consumer all-rounder as such the design
languages are pretty different
sure aluminum is used for both but the
Nexus has a harder or more professional
look
while the pixel strives for a friendlier
first impression in looking at the more
unique aesthetic elements I'll
personally take the bender Rodriguez
camera strip on the 6p over the glass
back on the pixel we're working with the
same screen resolutions those stretched
a tiny bit further on the larger Nexus
display and the pixel outperforms the 6p
for maximum screen brightness now the
Nexus represents one of the best
performers of last year to use welcomes
controversial snapdragon 810 chipset it
shouldn't come as any surprise that even
though Google is under clocking the
Snapdragon 820 1 in the pixel it scores
an easy victory looking at one of the
toughest gaming benchmarks we can show
Marvel future fights struggles on the 6p
where it's much easier to keep a
smoother frame rate on the
so after a handful of missions the Nexus
is also significantly warmer to the
touch the 8:10 just won't go down in the
books is a great processor but the 6p
does better than most in getting the
most out of it looking at photography
the pixel features a subtle but critical
improvement to camera performance
neither has Hardware Oh is so tying
stabilization to the phone's gyro is
inspired especially as the Nexus lacks
any software stabilization when shooting
4k video output for photos and good
light is fairly similar especially for
all of googles auto HDR processing and
both are some of the best performers
you'll find for slow motion video
but gyro enabled software stabilization
for video works very well in calming
down the shake in most shots the audio
situation is something of a tie we've
heard better stereo phone town but
between these front-facing speakers in
the bottom firing pixel mono speaker
will happily choose the Nexus the script
flips on headphone playback though where
the pixel represents small but
significant improvements to audio
quality noise dynamic range and includes
a slightly more powerful amp nothing
earth-shattering but the pixel does pack
the better Jack lastly looking at
battery life both phones have the same
size battery but with the more efficient
chipset and smaller screen we see
improvements to runtime on the pixel in
our media test streaming 30 minutes of
HD video over Wi-Fi at 190 Lux our one
year old Nexus during seven percent
while the pixel drained five percent we
originally messed up our first battery
run on the pixel XL and our iPhone
comparison but more recent tests are
generating more consistent results as
this was a community Nexus here at
pocket now we sort of lost the charger
which came with our 6p so while it's not
a true fare out of the box comparison
using the pixel charger for both phones
after 30 minutes the XL hits a 37%
recharge while the Nexus topped off at
34% it should be mentioned again the
Nexus was also warmer to the touch while
recharging so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us between the Nexus 6p
and the pixel X out when your upgrades
are tough a part of the issue hinges on
the fact that the Nexus has never really
had a unified brand identity each
manufacturer involved put its own spin
on a Google branded device the sentiment
also remains that the next
this was a far more economical solution
for hardware specs which don't feel that
much more evolved now that we've moved
on to the pixel Google's new consumer
focus seems to come with a healthier
margin on each device soul so should you
upgrade we're inclined to lean towards
know unless gaming performance has been
an issue you can't wait for the new
assistant or you really want those gyro
improvements to the camera for people
who want to make sure they're using the
newest version of Android with the most
complete version of Google's vision a
sleeker launcher the fingerprint sensor
shortcut and fingers crossed for Verizon
users timely updates
