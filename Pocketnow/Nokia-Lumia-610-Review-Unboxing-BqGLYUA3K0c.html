now the Nokia Lumia 610 has low
specifications and a low price point
it's aimed at emerging markets and it
also tries to compete with low-end
budget Android phones so stick with us
we're gonna unbox this baby and show you
what the experience of unboxing is for a
budget Nokia Windows Phone those of you
who follow Nokia probably will recognize
the box as a standard blue card in nokia
box with device pictures on the top and
on the sides and no other information on
the back however you will see that this
is a Windows Phone and it comes with
Nokia Drive Nokia Maps and Nokia music
of course there's a nice representation
of what's inside the box but we will
open this ourselves
and check it out when you slide out the
box you will see the phone which is
greeting you right on top of the
packaging we'll put it to the side and
you'll see the battery which is just
underneath the phone it is one of 13
hundred million powers we'll put that to
the side too and check out what else is
here under the carton we should expect
some literature that's right we're not
going to spend too much time on it we
have your pair of headphones with their
buds we have one cable for syncing and
charging and we have one wall plug with
a USB port on it standard matte black so
that's the box itself let's put
everything to the side and let's take a
look at the phone let's take a closer
look at the battery it is one of 13
hundred million powers as you can see
right there now the packaging is not
blocking it and let's check the phone
out which is all nice shiny and new and
feels good in hand it has a speaker on
the top just above the Nokia branding
right there and it has a 3.7 inch wvg
screen of 480 by 800 which is the
standard for Windows Phone 7 beneath the
screen there's your start back and
search obligatory buttons and your small
microphone Hall there's nothing on the
left side on the top there's your 3.5
millimeter headphone jack and a microUSB
port for syncing and charging
you will see all your buttons on the
right side with the volume rockers for
volume up and volume down this is the
power button and this is the obligatory
shutter button for camera activation and
shutter release at the back there's your
five megapixel camera with the tiny LED
flash
Nakia embossed branding and your speaker
grille here you can see that it's nakiye
610 let's break this one open insert the
battery insert a SIM card and see the
first boot this phone is powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 processor
clocking at 800 megahertz and it has 256
Meg's of RAM and the same amount of rom
it also has 8 gigabytes of internal
storage now this wouldn't be such a big
problem of course there is no microSD
expansion slot since Windows Phone 7 and
7.5 don't support microSD expansion
cards but 256 Meg's of RAM could be a
problem for certain applications such as
Skype for instance as you can see here
it accept accepts micro SIM cards
- already inserted and let's plug in the
battery and fire the baby up slide it
back and let's do it up so here we are

Lumia 610 you have watched the unboxing
