of the iPhone always meant you've got
more not only did you get a screen with
more resolution but you also got a much
bigger battery for example the iPhone 8
plus has a 47% bigger battery than the 8
while the 6 plus had a whopping 61
percent bigger battery than the 6 but
this year the increase is only 19
percent not only that but the plus
models would bring more advanced camera
systems for example the 6 plus had oh is
but the 6 didn't and then the 7 plus 1/8
plus brought dual cameras unlike their
smaller versions and plus models also
had different software to take advantage
of the bigger display such as a home
screen you could use in landscape but
now with the 10s max which is the
biggest iPhone ever you would think that
you would be getting more but this year
that is just not the case after using
the 10s max for over a week
I think that the tennis max is actually
kind of pointless and let me tell you
why yes I do agree that the tennis max
and even the 10 R are the hottest
iPhones of the year because really the
10 s is such a minor upgrade over the 10
sadly I'm really regretting paying
almost $1200 for the 10s max one of the
clearest examples of why the max is not
much better than the 10s is in the
battery department sure the max has a
bigger battery but only by 19% versus
the 47% plus increase found in previous
years
so while battery life will be better on
the max it's not by much
plus some of the gains are negated by
the larger display which obviously
consumes more power
another example is software I think
Apple really missed an opportunity to
optimize the max for the added screen
real estate we saw it with the 8 plus
but it seems that Apple just forgot
about the max there is no landscape home
screen no split screen multitasking no
floating apps really the software on the
max does absolutely nothing to take
advantage of the extra screen space and
then there is screen density on Andrew
you can adjust the screen density to any
value you want through developer options
so that for example you can scroll less
on your note 9 or 1 plus 6 and see more
content but on the tennis max everything
is just blown up as you can see here
despite the screen being much bigger on
the max I can't see anymore of this
webpage sure the speakers are a little
bit louder and content on the screen is
a little bit more immersive and text is
a little bit easier to read because it's
bigger but these are minor differences
and really the tennis max is just a
blown up tennis and while this has been
essentially true in past years this year
the upgrades are so minor and
non-existent that really the max is
pointless it just doesn't make sense
obviously this is my opinion after a
week or so of use let us know in the
comments if you agree or disagree do you
really feel you're getting $100 more
value versus the iPhone tennis I say you
aren't but would really love to hear
what you think while you're at it make
sure you follow us on social media and
subscribe for more videos like this one
you can follow me everywhere at Brandon
minimun I'll see you next time with
another topic for debate see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
