galaxy x lineup apple's R&amp;amp;D budget has
already begun to tease a new pivot
coming soon and the 1+3 continues to
appear on major leaks I'm Jaime Rivera
and there is a major party outside and I
am here recording a video when I should
be out there little ads of them this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals there are at least 3
coming from sprints but the most
important ones are the fact that number
one the HTC 10 is 20% off to Sprint is
even offering a year of Amazon Prime and
Boost Mobile is now offering more data
you can learn more in the links of this
version and an other sort of official
news meaning sort of because google
hasn't really said anything but because
we pretty much just confirmed Google's
developer portal just teases the fact
that there is Android VR just like
there's Android where Android auto there
is a new category called Android VR that
uses the same icon as Android wear
because obviously this is new but stay
tuned Google i/o next week's show is
more now one phone that we are highly
anticipating as the oneplus 3 we've
covered a few rumors about its
specification z' we've seen a few leaks
over how the phone looks and today we
see leaks of the front we see leaks at
the bottom we sadly we're not able to
see what happens with the back but yes
USB type-c in addition to that
fingerprint scanner are coming let's see
what new type of back is coming
hopefully the sandstone back remains and
I'm not even going to start talking
about the Apple car but trusted analysts
are claiming that there is a 10 billion
dollar budget or above when it comes to
Apple's R&amp;amp;D for this in next year
meaning that there is clearly a pivot
Apple is clearly working on something
new coming and true we know that Apple's
R&amp;amp;D goes up for every iPhone launch it
could just be the next iPhone but so
many billions of dollars could also mean
a car or something else stay tuned and
finally the very hot news they have to
do with the samsung galaxy wrote an app
for 2017 we've got sources claiming that
the company is planning major things and
we know that Samsung is a company you
can trust for pulling out whatever their
R&amp;amp;D department can come up with so we're
hearing the Galaxy s8 and future Galaxy
Notes might bring a new type of 2.5 k
display instead of quad HD I wonder
where that falls into but even more
interesting a galaxy
X lineup with a new type of pentile
display in addition to the capability of
doing something with 4k which we assume
would be the display but not necessarily
there's a lot on the table here over
what to expect you can learn more in the
election of the description but I would
like to know in the comments today what
would you like to see Samson pull out
for 2017 because in my case I don't want
to point 5k displays or 4k I want Sam
sent to focus on one thing
battery life figure out battery life
something leave us a comment down below
