i'm listening to old timey tunes in new
york city because that's what you do
when you go hands-on with the country's
first - art phone join me for a quick
look at the ZTE axon you heard me say it
so you know it's true
the mysterious axon phone comes to us
from none other than ZTE but unlike the
Nubia Zindzi maxes that came before at
the axon has been designed from the
ground up to lay a foundation for an
unlocked flagship smartphone line here
in the US CTE has done that by packing
it with features it calls must-haves a
fast hi-def camera elaborate audio
enhancements a bright high-res display
and a powerful set of specs the
must-haves don't seem to include
wireless charging microSD or optical
stabilization by the way still there's
some great stuff here specs include a
Snapdragon 810 processor with 4 gigs of
RAM and 32 gigs of storage a 3000
milliamp hour battery with quick charge
2.0 and 4G LTE plus with carrier
aggregation this is a GSM phone by the
way
so Verizon and Sprint need not apply the
screen is a quad HD TFT panel at 5.5
inches protected by Gorilla Glass 3 that
looks exceptionally bright but then
everything does in this demo hall so
stay tuned for more on that around back
there's a dual camera setup that reminds
us of HTC's duo camera with a 13
megapixel Sony Exmor RS sensor backed up
by a 2 megapixel focus assist module
controlled by a dedicated camera button
sorry though it's not dual stage the
twin lens setup allows you to do things
like change focus after the shot is
taken again stuff we've seen before but
the F 1.8 aperture should make for nice
low-light shots and the 0.15 second
autofocus will be handy for action shots
as well for video you've got full 4k
support and apparently the ability to
capture clear audio from up to 20 feet
away
the audio enhancements include dual
front firing speakers that wait no they
don't only the bottom unit is actually a
speakerphone the upper grille is for the
earpiece only kind of lame but ZTE is
hardly alone in this bit of trickery
plug in some headphones like I've got on
though there JBL earbuds that'll be
included in the box with pre-orders of
the axon and the sound gets crazy I've
taken a few of the Dolby sound profiles
for a test drive and even as a non
audiophile I'm very impressed
then they've got the brainwave scanner
to prove it seriously though I compared
the sound to the audio coming out of a
droid turbo I had handy and while the
latter was no slouch the axon really
delivered like dominos with its dual
dedicated audio chips and custom
software there are enhancements to noise
cancellation and sound reproduction on
the voice calling side as well there's
lots more for us to test drive including
the 4G LTE plus radio stack and ZTE
software skin which isn't exactly stock
Android but is much thinner and lighter
than other ZTE skins we've seen also the
axon will come with android 5.1.1 when
it begins shipping on july 27 if you
want in on pre-orders there up now at
places like amazon ebay new egg and of
course from ZTE itself the phones
available in three colors and it'll sell
unlocked for just shy of $450 not
exactly a budget phone but holding its
own metal chassis and listening to its
outstanding audio I understand why
whether it's ultimately worth that price
tag we'll have to wait for the full
review as will our thoughts about
whether this phone is good enough to
serve as the base for ZTE snek stamped
to capture the interest of US buyers for
now I'll just say I'm excited to try it
for more on this device stay tuned to

media
till next time has been michael fisher
from pocket now captain two phones on
twitter reminding you to keep your axons
firing we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
