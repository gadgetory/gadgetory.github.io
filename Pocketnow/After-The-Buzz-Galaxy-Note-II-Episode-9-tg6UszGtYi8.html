when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappeared
I'm sure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of a review to see how
they feel after a couple weeks so let's
do something about it let's take a look
at one of this year's surprising success
stories the phone tablet hybrid
Samsung's Galaxy Note 2 I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is
episode 9 of after the buzz
now the Galaxy Note 2 isn't an old
device in fact it just launched the
other day on Verizon Wireless America's
largest network but it was announced
back at Aoife in August and it was
released in September that's a long time
in tech years especially with the
holiday season coming up so how has the
Galaxy Note 2 held up not surprisingly
since it's still a relatively new
product this Hardware still turns heads
everywhere at the barbershop the other
day my haircut was delayed for about
five minutes while I answered questions
about my Sprint Galaxy Note 2 with no
other competition in the phablet space
the big beefy casing of the note 2
stands out in a big way if you're one of
those folks who likes to get noticed
look no further people will ask you
about this device in public a lot one of
the things that might not age as well on
the physical side is the devices design
now this is all taste dependent but look
at the device next to some smart phones
that have landed since the note 2
debuted as we've said before Samsung
basically just blew up the design of the
galaxy s3 and squared off it's more
bulbous teardrop elements the result is
a plain looking device that relies
almost entirely on its size and S Pen
Stylus to stand out from the crowd but
the build quality is good and it's
withstood quite a few drops and knocks
with very little scratching speaking of
that s-pen we loved it in our original
review and we still enjoy it today but
unless you're buying the device
specifically to take advantage of pen
input you'll probably find yourself
using it less often as the days go by
when you do have a couple hands-free to
take it out and use the device to its
full potential though the s-pen
continues to highlight the note 2's
advanced capabilities of course an S Pen
is nothing without a display to write on
and we still like the Note twos panel
display enthusiasts though will want to
take note that the 1080p revolution is
upon us
the 5.5 inch screen on the note 2
delivers 720p resolution but its pixel
density isn't top-notch at 267 PPI and
it's overblown color saturation compares
unfavorably with newer technologies like
the Droid
NASL cd3 display it's still a beautiful
screen and at the greater distance from
the eye you're going to be using it at
its perfectly wonderful but if you've
used a 1080p display the differences
will be apparent if you haven't you
probably won't mind at all on the flip
side of that resolution equation is
endurance the 3100 milliamp hour pack
inside the galaxy note 2 is already a
mega sized battery and its performance
blows away that of the batteries
powering higher resolution devices the
fact that it's removable allowing
swapping with a fresh battery away from
home is also a huge bonus
wrapping up the hardware side of things
the speaker continues to impress us with
its bassy loud tones and the camera is
quite nice more on that in software in a
second the only Hardware feature that
consistently got under my skin
was the power standby button which is a
little easier to press than I would like
but let's face it when you're picking
nits that small you know you've got a
great hardware story to tell overall but
you can't talk galaxy note without
talking software how is Samsung's
TouchWiz nature UX holding up over time
in short very well indeed the TouchWiz
UI layer adds the usual wait time to
Android updates and our sprint unit here
is still on jellybean 4.1.1 in exchange
though you get the full suite of
software improvements that Samsung is
bundled into TouchWiz like notification
shade utility toggles Samsung specific
widgets and all the s-pen specific
enhancements like hovering and quick
memo more importantly there's also
support for Samsung's innovative
multi-screen allowing two apps to run at
the same time on the display as well as
pop-up browser and pop-up play for more
lightweight multitasking
even multi screens side dock is handy in
itself as an additional app dog these
are really the headlining software
features of the galaxy note 2 because
they let the device live up to its full
potential they bring in the tablet
functionality that makes it a phablet
not just a comically oversized
smartphone
once you learn to use them they are
incredibly useful features and you miss
them when leaving the device behind for
another the Samsung modifications to the
camera suite continue to impress and
they work in concert with some excellent
hardware to produce some truly solid
images that hold their own just fine
against competing devices both indoor
and outdoor in fact Samsung's Galaxy s3
and galaxy note 2 camera they're
identical hardware and nearly identical
software are near the top of the pile in
my opinion for a consumer smartphone
objects all this customization generally
results in a fair amount of lag on most
devices and it is possible to slow the
Galaxy Note 2 down at spots but you
really have to try if you have some
third-party apps like HD widgets loaded
you can induce stutter on the widget
menu and chrome will occasionally bog
down though that's probably more due to
Chrome than anything else I include this
only in this period of completeness
though TouchWiz has been a lag-free
oasis even since Ice Cream Sandwich on
high-end Samsung hardware and that
continues with jellybean on the galaxy
note 2 in our full review we gave the
Galaxy Note 2 a 9 out of 10 now that's
one of the highest scores we've ever
given a device and the note 2 continues
to earn that praise from its
multitasking to its s-pen add-ons to its
battery life to its voice quality to its
data speeds to its processing horsepower
this thing is still a beast a powerhouse
a hybrid product that aspires to be both
a very good smartphone and a very good
tablet and unlike many other hybrid
products the Galaxy Note 2 continues to
succeed at playing both roles for the
right buyer we continue to fully
recommend it everyone thank you for
