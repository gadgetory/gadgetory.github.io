nothing more than a tablet I'm here to
answer that question i Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is going
tablet only for a day
ever since Apple announced its first
iPad and even when the very first
tablets were created the idea of
replacing your typical machine with
something much more portable simple
effective and wealth fun has filled the
minds of many myself included of course
the naysayers are in mass why would you
want to work from a tablet what sort of
benefit does it pose or simply that's
stupid but some have persisted truly
believing it's possible to leave your
laptop at home and get real work done
from nothing more than a tablet is it
really possible can you actually work
from a tablet the answer isn't so clean
cut there is no blanket answer for
everyone we all do different types of
work you have different needs and most
importantly different tolerance levels
for dealing with and learning to
overcome the sacrifices that inevitably
have to be made to go truly mobile I
want to answer an easier question first
is it really more portable yes my laptop
is an early 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina
display it's 1.8 centimeters thick and
4.4 6 pounds the tablet I use every
single day is an iPad Mini with Retina
display paired with the Zagg Keys cover
combined as 13.8 millimeters thick and
637 grams the macbook weighs 1,300 and
86 grams more and it's larger in every
dimension by a significant amount
affordability is objective number one a
tablet and keyboard combination wins
every time
even against devices like the MacBook
Air or an ultrabook the larger question
is of functionality can you actually get
everything done from a tablet ultimately
that depends on what your work requires
are you hammering out emails all day
long the setup will excel in that area
with the proper email client are you
creating spreadsheets it may not be as
bad as you think writing this set up is
fantastic
no seriously 90% of all the words I
published on pocket now or you hear me
speak here on YouTube are written from
an iPad in fact I'm writing this very
script using an iPad Mini
every day I love it it's easy to talk
hypotheticals though sure you can take
care of business from a tablet but at
what point do you stop and pull your
hair out how much can you actually
accomplish from a tablet before time
wasted trying to find workarounds
defeats the purpose altogether
why not actually put it to the test
that's exactly what I did last week I
set out to spend an entire day working
with nothing more than an iPad Mini and
the Zagg Keys covered
I chose a long-form piece I had been
scheduled to write which needed research
and a lot of fact-checking and I went to
town not allowing myself to use a laptop
unless I hit a wall the writing aspect
is something I'm largely familiar with
I've written literally thousands of
articles and scripts from iPads there
are literally dozens of plain text or
markdown editors that are perfect for
the job
I use I a writer for its minimalism and
Dropbox Inc and they're also just as
many office suites which offer rich text
formatting perfect for that term paper
writing this article was no different
aside from the additional fact-checking
I had to do the one thing that makes me
more productive on the iPad it's
comparatively poor multitasking is also
what makes browsing and researching a
little more difficult and time-consuming
with the keyboard shortcuts however you
can quickly switch tasks and jump back
and forth between writing and
researching with the exception of
writing actual words everything from a
tablet seems to take two to three times
longer this is the part that takes
patience and temperance I've been doing
it long enough to have found a rhythm
that works well for me start to finish
writing the feature comparison of the
HTC One m8 Galaxy s5 and Xperia z2 took
around two hours and copy-editing for
mobile is hardly any different from a
fully fledged OS transforming those
written words from a body of text into a
finished piece however is where this
experiment transition from a casual jog
into hurdles
very quickly there is an official
wordpress application for Android and
iOS and used it in the past and it works
it just isn't my favorite instead I used
blog Z the UI is cluttered and it has a
learning curve but it's easily the best
iOS based blogging tool
hands down it was smooth sailing from
the start I typed in the headline and
paste of my edited text into the body
porn and a categories tags and the
custom slug all fine then I stuttered
hyperlinking all the references not a
single problem adding pictures was the
first hurdle you can pull from your own
WordPress database of images but I can
safely assume blog Z isn't built to
handle image databases heaviest pocket
now's so instead of scrolling through a
single column of thumbnails that
wouldn't even load I had to find the
images on Pocket now download them to
the iPad re-upload them to the site from
within block Z and then drop them into
the body the other images I gathered
from around the web I added it using
photoshop touch a fantastically capable
and awesome mobile photo editor this
wasn't so bad except when I added
pictures my formatting started bugging
out big time random line breaks were
added and no matter how many times I
deleted them from the HTML editor it
would reappear the more I tried to fix
the formatting the worse it got another
issue with blog Z is that while it tries
to be a one-size-fits-all client it
doesn't have support for third-party
WordPress plugins so our SEO plugin
wasn't supported after roughly four
hours of tinkering with format and
adding pictures I decided to save and
try once more from Safari there I added
all the typical SEO stuff and saved
again I reloaded the latest draft from
within blog see one more time to try and
fix the formatting again no cigar the
more I tried to fix it the worse the
situation got after a total of nearly
five hours tinkering with it I caved
broke out my laptop fix the formatting
and was done in a matter of minutes this
article on any other given date using a
combination of a tablet and a laptop
would have taken me approximately four
hours total
but going mobile only double the time it
took for me to finish and I still had to
break out a laptop it's easy to write
this off as a major lose on the part of
mobile tablets but it's not nearly that
black and white tablets have strengths
they can be utilized beyond playing
games or reading 30 reasons your cat is
your actual soul mate I discovered years
ago that I focused better when I have
one thing in front of me and it's
actually difficult to switch between
tasks over and over one of iOS is worst
features is actually one of my favorite
things about working from the iPad most
importantly the line of work you're in
most definitely matters
I wouldn't dare try to edit a serious
video from the iPad I don't even have
enough storage to load all the raw
footage on the tablet it's illogical as
long as you set your expectations and
don't approach mobile work with an
unrealistic goal working from a tablet
can be enjoyable and beneficial I
journal using day one on my iPad almost
every day I prefer it I prefer writing
anything and everything from the iPad
but I know its limitations and I either
use them to my advantage or use another
device to fill the gap with so many
applications at your disposal there is
an application for virtually everything
Office for iPad is surprisingly
impressive Photoshop Touch is a mobile
photo editor on steroids
and there are hundreds of other
productivity apps I haven't even heard
of not everyone will be able to or even
want to work strictly from a tablet but
the takeaway is that it's a possibility
growing more and more likely every day
