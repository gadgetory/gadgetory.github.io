iPhone 5 hey guys it's Brandon Minnemann
from pocket now and in this video we're
going to compare these two guys so let's
get to it so this is an interesting
comparison because the HTC One is
inspired by the iPhone 5 and don't let
anyone tell you otherwise the iPhone 5
was one of the first devices to have
kind of the small aluminum construction
with the metal on the back and the
middle of the back means that when you
pick up the phone it's cool to the touch
it's a really interesting sensation that
feels super high quality a lot better
when you're considering build quality
than Samsung's all plastic phones and on
the HTC One it's a little bit more
dramatic than that in terms of the use
of aluminum the entire backing is
aluminum here instead of just sort of
this centered part so a lot of coolness
in your hand when you pick it up another
way that the HTC One is inspired by the
iPhone 5 the iPhone 5 has a chamfered
edge but unfortunately on the iPhone 5
it is extraordinarily fragile if you're
not using a case within a few short
months these edges that were once
beautiful and shiny are going to get
chewed up we did a durability report on
the iPhone 5 and found that this phone
is so incredibly fragile in fact the
aluminum on the back has gotten nicked
down here and scratched and I've even
got a scratch up here in the glass HTC
claims that the one is more durable and
we really hope that is the case because
we've got the chamfered edges here as
well on the front and the back so you
get that ruggedness of a large metal
phone but it also looks a little bit
fancy and something that you could take
out with you at a bar and and have a
look good sitting next to you got the
chamfered edges as mentioned we'll do a
durability report coming up in about a
month or two to let you know how the HTC
One is holding up to the test of time
hopefully it's not as fragile as the
iPhone 5 now in terms of enhanced feel
the iPhone 5 is really made for people
that like to have a better one-handed
experience you can reach all corners of
the screen by just using your thumb
because it's got a four inch screen a
modest-sized screen on the HTC One we've
got still a relatively modest sized
screen I guess in today's standards with
the galaxy s4 going up to five inches
we've got a 4.7 inch screen but even
people with why
sighs hands are gonna have trouble
moving around on the screen without
taking out a second hand to steady the
phone which is not that big of the big
of a deal now only that these phones are
very different is how they look on the
front we've got two front firing
speakers boom sound which makes the HTC
One extremely loud although previous to
the one the iPhone 5 held the place as
the loudest phone because that a really
good speakerphone didn't doesn't display
doesn't distort it all it just sounds
really good we're gonna have a test on
boom sound versus the iPhone 5 and some
other devices so you can see how the HTC
One compares in terms of loudness now in
terms of other dimensions if we flip
them over to the back and we place the
flat on the table here the iPhone 5 is
indeed thinner than the HTC One but only
at this thickest point you see HTC does
this party trick where it has a really
thin edge and then it gets thicker and
so what you'd feel in your hand is this
thinner edge and it kind of wraps around
and it's got a nice little smile thing
kind of like Nokia phones just feels
good in the hand and it feels thin with
this edge so if we compare just the edge
the HTC One actually feels a little bit
thinner in the hand if you're comparing
them that way now if we stack them like
so we see that the HTC One is
significantly wider as mentioned
significantly taller there in terms of
weight the HTC One is 143 grams so
relatively hefty but it doesn't feel
that heavy and the iPhone 5 still won if
the lightest phones ever made a hundred
and twelve grams this thing is crazy
light but you know the HTC One doesn't
feel so bad in the hand itself okay so
let's turn on the displace here we're
not gonna do a boot up test because the
HTC One is going to win it's got
fastboot it turns on so incredibly fast
now I've got both these devices set at
maximum screen brightness as you can see
here so can really compare apples to
apples a little bit here in terms of
looking at the quality of the screen now
something doesn't note is screen
resolution we've got 11 36 by 640 on the
iPhone 5 that's a 326 PPI the HTC One
kind of kills it in terms of PPI here
we've got 1920 by 1080 that's a Full HD
at 468 PPI
you can't see pixels on either of these
so it really comes down to screen
quality so as we can see here we're
looking at a white screen and the whites
on the iPhone 5 are definitely whiter
than what we get on the HTC One which
isn't to say that the HTC One has a bad
screen because it doesn't it has an
amazing screen just in this case in
terms of contrast at least the iPhone 5
is a little bit better so we're gonna go
into the web browser and do some speed
tests of course we've got a OS here iOS
6 which is in total need of redoing it
is old it is boring it's the same old
thing since the iPhone came out in 2007
basically and Android keeps evolving we
get new updates to Google now it gets
faster with jellybean and you know HTC
Sense makes Android look elegant and
pretty so it's taking a very functional
pretty good-looking Android base and
making it even better so we're gonna go
into the web browser here and we're
going to start off with Google and we're
going to look at some images compare
screen quality a little bit more so
we're to go over here to images and go
to images do we're going to type in
Beach here
alright we're both over the same Wi-Fi
network here it says please wait logging
in or something here we are we have the
same results and I'll take a look at
this let's see how many rows of images
we get to see on the iPhone 1 2 3 4 5
and on the 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 plus a little
bit more that's what you get with a
higher resolution screen you can see
more on the screen at one time less
scrolling let's tap on this and what we
can see here is 2 again very good
screens the whites are a little bit
wider the colors are very natural on
both in fact I really can't tell the
difference look at the green and the
tree and the blue on the sky they're
very similar just the sand is a little
bit wider on the iPhone 5 so over here
in this picture pretty much the same
story here the iPhone 5 is just a little
bit brighter a little bit more contrast
II and we have a back rack a back black
round here and you can see that the
black on the iPhone 5 is more of a deep
black almost AMOLED like on the HTC One
it's still a nice black but it's a
little bit grey so let's do a web
browsing speed test now
bring up the address bars will go to
pocket now here
alright one two three go my good the
mobile site okay and they're off and the
HTC One looks to be going ahead and the
iPhone five finish first we have not
found a phone yet that beats the iPhone
5 in terms of web browsing speed and
maybe the HTC is the one to do it we've
got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 quad-core
CPU here on the HTC One with two
gigabytes of RAM the iPhone 5 is a
dual-core a6 CPU with one gigabyte of
RAM so let's flick down the page note
checkerboarding no white space that's
good
likewise with the HTC One let's
pinch-to-zoom see how long it takes to
four texts to clear up release literally
at the same time let's click on this
headline see which gets there first
watching the progress bars progress bar
and iPhone 5 finished slightly ahead
miss check screen rotation speed that
was actually the HTC One beat the iPhone
5 there about eco really tough to tell
let's zoom in make text really big on
the screen so maybe we can get a sense
for pixels see if you can see any pixels
the iPhone 5 zooms in more so let's try
to get it about the same size as the HTC
One I'm going to bring the screens close
to the camera and see if you can see any
pixels at all so here's the iPhone 5
very clean
can't see pixels and on the HTC One
you're definitely not going to be able
to see pixels I mean there's just so
many dots on the screen making up the
image it's just really difficult to see
pixels and let's see which of these
devices opens third-party apps faster
probably the most level playing field
kind of thing we can do let's launch
Facebook one two three Facebook at the
exact same time let's check out YouTube
iPhone 5 got there first
and let's go to Twitter wherever that is
here is one two three Twitter okay it
was faster on the HTC One so in terms of
device speed both of these devices are
very very fast the iPhone 5 comes out a
little bit ahead in terms of web
performance but the HTC one is
absolutely no slouch so the iPhone 5 is
a phone that we know is great it's best
it's capable and is good hardware
although the hardware is fragile the HTC
One has also characteristics plus it's
new and exciting it's got a design that
no other phone has it has real
innovative features like boomsound and
an all-metal design and it's just a
pleasure to use compared to the iPhone
which feels like a phone from 2007
that's been modernized a bit with better
hardware and faster hardware so the
choice is yours which do you think is
better do you have an iPhone 5 and are
looking to upgrade to the HTC One let us
know what you think how these films
compare in the comments we've got a lot
more comparisons coming up thanks for
watching and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
