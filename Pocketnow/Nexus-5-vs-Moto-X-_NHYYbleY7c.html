pass at a smartphone built to deliver a
pure Android experience a device built
to Mountain View's specs meant to
showcase what Google's operating system
is capable of but we no longer live in a
world where users need to buy a nexus
branded phone to experience that this
past summer Google owned Motorola
released a device running very close to
stock with a few extras that actually
improved the user experience that device
was the Moto X and it challenged our
conception of what is and isn't a Nexus
phone so which of these is the better
fit for use is actually a more complex
question than it seemed but let's try
and answer it anyway I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow and this is Google
Nexus 5 versus Motorola MOTO X put
simply these phones are not built for
the same kind of customer the Nexus 5 is
a testbed for developers and Android
enthusiasts that also happens to be a
very affordable high-end smartphone by
contrast the Moto X was designed
specifically with the average Joe in
mind the customer who doesn't realize
just how friendly and useful Android can
be that these phones target different
user types is evident from their design
the Moto X resembles a well-worn bar of
soap or something with smooth contours
and a curve that feels great in the hand
and it even features a special dimple on
the back a tactile guide for where to
put your finger by contrast the Nexus 5
is a sharp cornered phone more
reminiscent of the slabs dominating the
rest of the high-end Android space even
though it's about four grams less
massive and over two millimeters thinner
than the Moto X the Nexus 5's added
height makes it feel bigger
it doesn't feel more durable though and
it's definitely not as water-resistant
there's no moisture repellent nano
coating on the Nexus as there is on the
X in exchange you get a display on the
Nexus that's 5 inches on the diagonal
instead of 4.7 on the Moto X and it also
sports a resolution of 1080p
versus Motorola's 720p that's a
significant bump and some people will
prefer the Nexus 5's LCD technology over
the Moto X's Super AMOLED as well but to
our eyes the Moto X has higher
saturation and far deeper blacks make it
more appealing than the Nexus 5's panel
which appears a bit washed out by
comparison
especially when you view it from the
side this off axis issue on the Nexus 5
gets worse in direct sunlight while the
Moto X stays somewhat readable which
screen you prefer will depend on your
priorities if for us the trade-in
resolution and size on the Moto X is
worth it thanks to its richer colors and
higher contrast down under the hood
things get a little more interesting the
Nexus 5 has been lauded and rightly so
for its high horsepower relative to its
price the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 at its
heart is one of the most powerful
processors around today more powerful on
paper than the custom x8 mobile
computing system under the hood of the
Moto X the Nexus 5 is built for more
markets so it's more broadly compatible
with 3G and 4G bands around the world
and it also features support for goodies
like qi wireless charging which we liked
a lot the end result of this heavy
feature load and the extra power is that
the Nexus 5 wins in the few benchmark
tests we use and when playing intense
games like asphalt 8 it's capable of
rendering the more graphically intense
sequences rather than falling back on
the pared down version the Nexus 5 is
definitely the beefier of these two
phones but as we keep saying over and
over more power doesn't always equal
more ability even though we're comparing
a device running the latest build of
Android to a device running an older
version the Moto X has a lot of fight in
it even given that handicap now Android
4.4 is certainly no dog in terms of
features and expandability KitKat brings
a cleaner flatter more reserved
interface and a handful of useful
features like internet search capability
in the dialer basically giving you the
yellow pages without requiring
cumbersome dedicated app it's also
greatly improved Google now which is
easier to set up and lives in a
permanent slot just to the left of the
home screen and according to Google
KitKat also uses fewer system resources
than the jellybean build on the Moto X
these advancements are all excellent and
the Nexus 5 does deliver as smooth an
Android experience as we've ever seen
but there was very little room for
improvement next to the Moto X app
launch times are comparable and
responsiveness is excellent on each but
more importantly the Motorola device is
just more innovative where the Nexus 5
stays conventional with things like
voice input requiring the screen to be
on before the phone can be addressed you
can talk to the Moto X with a voice
command at any time where the Nexus 5
relies on a traditional notification LED
the Moto X uses active display to give
you message previews and only when it
knows you're likely to be looking at the
screen where the Nexus 5 still requires
you to manually unlock the screen to
launch the camera the Moto X can do it
with a gesture of wonky looking one but
that's nonetheless handy and while the
Nexus 5 doesn't really care whether it's
resting on a nightstand or sitting in a
car hurtling down the highway the Moto X
does and it'll let you interact vocally
with things like incoming messages when
you're driving yes some of this
functionality can be approximated with
third-party apps on the Nexus 5 but not
to the degree that the Moto X is custom
hardware allows now both devices bring
an outstanding Android software
experience but we think the Motorola
phone wins the day in terms of utility
and innovation and we don't see that
changing when it gets its own update to
Android 4.4 in the coming months in more
conventional arenas the results do a
little more swinging back and forth the
Moto X does a solid job of living up to
Motorola's proud history of excellent
call quality but surprisingly the Nexus
5 doesn't fall far behind callers said
we sounded good on the lg device with
some even preferring our sound on the
Nexus on our end we like the Moto X
better thanks to its louder side tone
which results in a somewhat warm
call feeling overall and the Moto X is
speakerphone though its rear firing is
much louder and clearer it easily bests
the raspy loudspeaker mode on the Nexus
which really isn't very good at all in
phone calls games or media play that
it's far harder to judge a winner in
terms of the camera well we prefer the
Moto X is streamlined viewfinder
interface to the Nexus 5's more tap
happy layered software the Motorola
phone has never been our first choice in
terms of its 10 megapixel camera and
from what we're seeing of the Nexus 5's
eight megapixel shooter it wouldn't be
our first choice either it's pretty
tough to get consistent performance out
of these cameras one minute white
balance is way off on one and dead-on on
the other and the next minute that's
completely inverted some indoor photos
come out sharper on one and others are
sharper on the other colors from each
are either comically over saturated or
totally washed out about the only
consistency here is in low-light
photography which is pretty weak on each
notwithstanding the Nexus 5's optical
image stabilization now some shots are
truly beautiful in both cases but sadly
you never know what you're gonna get
from these shooters that's fine for a
box of chocolates but undesirable for a
smartphone camera about the only
consistency you're likely to find is in
video output where the Nexus 5 well and
truly owns the Moto X the combination of
Hardware stabilization with solid
saturation and auto exposure and
reasonably quick autofocus Trump's the
Moto X is noisy washed out scene and
outcome that's disappointing if not
entirely surprising
we have a lot more to learn about the
Nexus 5 we're still testing its
endurance in terms of battery life for
example
it'll have those complete thoughts and
more in our full review we're also very
aware that there's a huge gulf in
availability and sometimes in price
between these two devices depending on
where you're located around the globe
the Moto X is after all assembled in
America and indeed that's a big part of
Motorola's pitch when it sells to US
customers it so is its industry-leading
customizability with over 250 color
combinations to the Nexus is black and
white assuming you are in a market where
both of these devices are available and
if you can get them for roughly the same
price out of pocket which should you get
well if you're the straightforward type
the person who wants pure Android on
solid hardware with fast updates and not
a lot of nonsense and you're trying to
avoid getting trapped in a carrier
contract while you're at it the
affordable Nexus 5 can't be beat if
instead you're looking for something
special a truly unique and useful
feature set wrapped in the most
customizable and comfortable hardware
available we think the more innovative
Moto X is the better choice
