pok√©mon calm and today I'm eschew a new
plugin for spb mobile shell 3.5 and this
is actually n skips pro+ elegance so as
you can see the first thing we have is
the lifestyle Pro layout here so on we
actually have seven separate pages that
we can flip through and select different
widgets or whatnot so as you can see
there's a little bar here one two three
four five six seven so I'm just going to
start at one will flip over here so
here's the first one we'll just go back
as you can see we have seven pages and
the most you can have on the spb mobile
shell 3.5 is actually only five and
another cool feature about this is it
allows you to change the background
images so if we flip through
professional the default image on this
of course just a black background so we
can also of course have five separate
screens on this one but that's of course
a setting inside the spb mobile shell
3.5 settings there just flip through
another cool feature about this is if
we're on the professional screen we can
just click this middle button and it'll
bring us to our task managers so we can
either close or end programs go back and
if we flick back up or down we bring it
brings us to our life style layout so we
can click on this center button and that
actually brings us to our calendar of
course there's nothing in here right now
well actually go into the carousel and
you'll see that the images stay on the
carousel so that's pretty neat of course
the new spb mobile shell 3.5 has this
three-dimensional carousel which rotates
on many different accesses let's see if
we can actually get it to work here so
as you can see there goes and spends
around it's pretty cool so the cool
thing about this program is that you can
actually change the background to any
image you like of course you will need
to specify a near screen resolution so
if you have a qvga screen you'll need to
have it at the same resolution as qvga
and of course a vga vga and so on and so
forth and i'll post Linkin Park mounted
comments to how to get this program as
well I will post the instructions on how
to change the back room thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
