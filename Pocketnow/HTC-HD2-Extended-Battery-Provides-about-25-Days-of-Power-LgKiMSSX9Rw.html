i'm here with the hd2 and its extended
battery you can see it on the back it's
kind of big lump and a kickstand I've
been using it since sunday around three
thirty now it's Wednesday morning around
7-730 a.m. and haven't charged at all
times of us you know well over two and a
half days of battery life which is
pretty nice usually with the old what is
this 1230 milli ampere hours battery I
can get a half a day full day depending
on how much I use it so the added
battery life is really really
significant other things I like about
the extended battery is the kickstand
some great way to set it up and watch a
movie and with the extra battery life
you you don't have to worry about how
long you're watching movie for because
it's going to last all right another
thing that's nice since the battery
extends further you're not not setting
it on the camera lens and it's nice and
flat all right of course you know people
like this is ugly so maybe you want to
go back to the original but it's not
like you're going to lose is so you can
always switch back whenever you feel
like it but the extended battery cover
is pretty nice for watching movies and
you know longines battery is that at
ten percent right now so that's going to
die soon but as you know two and a half
days pretty nice for a battery that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
