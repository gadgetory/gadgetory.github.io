we're right in the middle of a very busy
review season we've published three
reviews this week alone with more on the
way and we just unwrapped the new
iPhones over the weekend to begin our
testing we're working to bring you
coverage on as many devices as possible
the latest of which is a Susan's new
SmartWatch the Zen watch - which we saw
it Aoife earlier this month so let's get
into it with a quick unboxing a soos
chose to go pretty simple with the
packaging so beyond the typical product
shot and spec list there's not much to
see here lifting up the lid brings us to
the main event though well set that guy
aside for just a second and underneath
its holder is a small box packed with
only the bare essentials and a sous
branded wall charger and a fairly short
cable with the watch's proprietary
magnetic connector opposite to the USB
ok back to the watch we already went
hands-on with design watch a few weeks
ago and not much has changed with the
watch or our impressions since then but
it's important to know that there are
multiple versions and we'll be testing
the baseline model meaning a bigger
display and a texturized rubber watch
band the build quality is surprisingly
solid given that some watches relatively
low cost starting at 149 and if you
don't like the stock band you can swap
it out pretty effortlessly thanks to the
quick-release pins let's go ahead and
power this thing on the Zen watch 2 is
conveniently launching right on the tail
end of Google announcing iOS support for
Android wear so we're gonna be testing
it with the iPhone 6s for the first half
of our review cycle but rest assured you
compare it to any Android device - we're
gonna have more Zen watch - coverage in
the coming weeks so be sure to stay in
the loop you know where to find us
