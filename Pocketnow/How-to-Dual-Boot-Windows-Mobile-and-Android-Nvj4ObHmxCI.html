pocketnow.com and in this video we've
got something awesome to show you
especially for the windows mobile users
out there so for a while now you've been
able to load Android onto your windows
mobile device using a Linux bootloader
so you put all the files on your storage
card launch charity XE and be put into
Android within a few minutes and the
Android functionality worked pretty well
on most most devices and it's always
getting better over X Day developers now
we have a troll dual boot solution and
there's not many phones out there that I
know of that can boot into two different
operating systems so when you restart
your device you're loaded up with Gen Y
dual boot and from here we can enable
auto boot or fastboot which will
automatically jump into Windows Mobile
or into Android or we can manually tap
on either the windows icon for Windows
Mobile or the little Android guy for
Android so right now I'm just going to
manually launch into Android and down
here it says booting Android and from
here it goes into the bootloader which
will take a few minutes ok and here we
have the what appears to be the Nexus
One startup animation and that was about
2 minutes and we are an Android now so
it says HTC touch diamond2 this wasn't
intended for the touch pro2 which is
what i am using it on
and we're just going through the screens
here running Android on the touch pro2
which is very nice and here we are in
Android working working pretty well
Android 2.0 so we'll post a link in
instructions on pocketnow.com on how to
get gen-y dual boot so that you can try
dual booting between Android and Windows
Mobile it's a really an amazing
development we're really happy to
finally see it come to windows mobile
devices that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
