review treatment both here on the tube
and at pocketnow.com so you already know
how impressed we are with Samsung's 2015
flagship but if you're trying to save
some money on your next Samsung phone
you might be wondering what you'll be
missing if you go for last year's model
instead I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and I'm here to answer that
question for you in Galaxy s6 vs. galaxy
s5 brought to you by squarespace we're
not going to focus too much on software
for this comparison because we have
every reason to believe that Samsung
will port many of its new interface
features to the galaxy s5 anyway that
said keep in mind that older phones
almost always have to wait longer for
software updates the s5 that we're using
here is still on Android KitKat for
example also manufacturers don't support
them as long and they often can't run
some of the new fancy features because
of hardware differences how deep those
differences go depends on which phones
you're thinking of while all versions of
the Galaxy S six use Samsung's Exynos
7420 processor the galaxy s5 packed
either in X and O's 54:22 a Snapdragon
801 or a Snapdragon 805 depending on the
market we covered those differences
across a few videos last year the gulf
between the older s5 models and the
newer s6 is mainly architectural but
it's not insignificant and further
complicate matters there were
differences in display resolutions
across s5 last year too so to boil
everything down succinctly let's just
compare the US versions of these phones
okay the screen size stays the same at
5.1 inches but the s6 brings a jump from
full HD resolution to quad HD very
visible from an inch away and important
if you're planning to go all gear VR
with the thing but not as noticeable in
standard everyday use there's also a
bump in ram from two gigs to three on
the newer phone and internal storage
options get an upgrade as well
aesthetics are of course subjective but
they're also one of the biggest
differences here
the s5 s so-called glam look with its
golf ball-like back cover and 1950s
diner stool edges was questionable in
2014 and it hasn't gotten any better
with time plus it's play
and a pretty soft plastic at that factor
in the wider bezels and the cumbersome
cover over the charging port and I think
most people would agree the glass and
aluminum galaxy s6 carries the day in
the look department that superiority
also translates to the feel in hand
while the s5 is actually slightly
heavier the s6 feels more substantial
because of its material choices the
mechanical action of its buttons is also
far superior and the fingerprint scanner
under its HOME key is much easier to use
but don't go thinking this is a shutout
as we turn to secondary features the s6
actually loses some of its edge pun
intended because of the sacrifices
Samsung made to make it so pretty
the older phone already lasts longer
than the s6 thanks in part to its bigger
battery and you can extend that even
further by carrying a spare power pack
and swapping it out on the go you can't
do that on the s6 and you also can't
expand the newer phones storage capacity
with a microSD card as you can on the s5
if you're moving a lot of data from
phone to computer and back again the USB
3.0 on the older phone will do it a lot
faster than the smaller 2.0 port on the
newer one and the older phones cover is
there for a reason
the galaxy s5 is rated ip67 for dust and
water resistance the galaxy s6 is not
what all these spec variants is mean to
you will depend on what kind of
lifestyle you lead but we'll leave that
for the conclusion on the way there
let's take a look at the cameras the
galaxy s5 brought a solid game last year
with its 16 megapixel sensor and the
galaxy s6 is content to stick with the
same resolution the s6 wasn't content to
stick with the same software though
thankfully on the new phone jumping into
the camera is a simple matter of
double-clicking the HOME key its
viewfinder is much more streamlined than
the older phones and a full suite of
manual controls is also here for those
with precision shots in mind more
importantly perhaps the s6 brings the
aperture size from F 2.2 to F 1.9 and
adds optical stabilization as well the
result is much better low-light
performance on the s6 and smoother video
also
for selfie lovers the front-facing
camera gets a big promotion from 2
megapixels to 5 megapixels on the new
phone and it retains the wide-angle view
as well for the full array of photo and
video samples from the galaxy s6 see our
full review at pocketnow.com other
variances are more subtle as we hit the
homestretch
while you could add wireless charging to
the s5 with a special battery door or an
aftermarket solution on a s6 it's built
right in and it supports both qi and PMA
standards point s6 the s5s speakerphone
has been moved from its position on the
back cover to the bottom edge on the s6
better for most applications but not
quite as convenient for gaming because
it's easier to accidentally plug up with
a finger we'll call that one a draw and
the s6 brings enhanced LTE support
bluetooth 4.1 and the smaller nano SIM
newer phone newer features more points
for the s6 keep in mind most of those
improvements are on the subtle side I
mean do you really care what size your
SIM card is wants it's inside the phone
the more important factor aside from
cost comes down I think to a lifestyle
question if you're more likely to find
yourself in an office when you're
working at a nice restaurant when you're
not and at a resort when you're on
vacation
well the s6 should feel just right in
your pocket if instead your workplace
demands a tool belt your weekends are
spent on the boat of the beach and your
vacations take place in the woods the s5
is probably the phone to put in your
rucksack yeah it's an imperfect
simplification but it captures the
difference in spirit here for a better
