smartphone games for us all Google fixes
the memory leak but that's been plaguing
lollipop users for a while and I will is
clearly working on making its Apple TV
relevant again I'm hi Marietta and thank
you very much for your comments
yesterday I did miss you too this is
parking out daily brought to you by
Squarespace in its new seven-point oh
you I the official news today are both
good in bed and have to do with Google
as the company has sort of made it
official that now their memory leak
that's plagued android 5.0 and 5.1
lollipop devices has been fix internally
so the reason why that's good is number
one because they figured it out number
two you probably won't need a new
version of Android to get the update
which is great for us that don't have
nexus devices the bad part is that we
still don't have an ETA so we'll see
when that happens now even though
wearable technology has not sold like
hotcakes samsang still believes that
there is a market out there just like
Apple does as well and we've been
talking about the same thing orvis for a
while we've talked about its processor
yesterday in addition to a lot of the
things that come with its UI and design
but if you're wondering when you're
gonna get it apparently that's going to
happen in the fall of this year Aoife
probably and yeah most of Samsung's gear
smartwatches have watched it but anyways
so it seems that we're gonna have to
wait that long apparently because
Samsung wants to get it right I guess
Apple watch is more influential than you
think and speaking of Apple let's move
the spotlight to Cupertino reports habit
that the company is working on a new
buyback program that doesn't only
involve iPhones and iPads currently you
can take it all the iphone and get AG
apple store gift card and buy a new
iphone or anything else in an apple
store and as it turns out it seems that
the company is planning to do so with
other smartphones and tablets the
question is how much money are you
getting back when Apple considers
everything that's not an Apple product
to be junk we'll see about that in other
Apple news it seems that the company is
taking its Apple TV more seriously from
dropping its price to making HBO
something that's exclusive to the apple
TV see if the company doesn't plan to
stop there apparently it's working with
as many as 25 different channels
ABC CBS NBC and others for them to
stream content on the Apple TV it's the
only question that's left is how much
are these channels going to charge for
this to work as HBO is charging 15 bucks
what can we expect from the rest we will
see and finally for the very hot news of
the day believe it or not Nintendo has
woken up to smell the coffee up to the
point where the company is now
partnering with a new company called
Dina or DNA which is an expert in
building smartphone and tablet games and
yes we are getting super mario brothers
in addition to other Nintendo titles
launching and smartphones and tablets
very soon the company has finally
figured out that this is where the
market is headed console games are not
as popular or at least not Nintendo's
lately and it does lead me to the
question of the day what particular
Nintendo title would you like to reach
your current Android or iPhone or
Windows Phone in my case super smash
brothers but hey if I could get
everything how about Ninja Gaiden from
the old Nintendo days even Super
Nintendo leave us a comment down below
