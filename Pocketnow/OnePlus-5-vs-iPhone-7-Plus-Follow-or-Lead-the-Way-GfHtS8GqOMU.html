we've been dancing around this
comparison in other videos talking about
design inspiration and similar
approaches to camera implementation
though the iPhone 7 plus is nearly a
year old at the time this video was
produced it is still the top option
offered by Apple we know we'll get
cranky comments about comparing older
and newer phones but if anyone were
shopping between these two right now
this is what they would be able to buy
more to the point since one phone is
clearly following the other in terms of
aesthetic and we're pretty sure Apple
will be making a more daring design
change this year it's worth taking a few
minutes to see just how well this
flattery stacks up against the original
1 + 5 vs. iPhone 7 + sure why not let's
do this iPhone or Android you should not
be using the same password for every
service you sign into so we partnered
with LastPass to bring you this
comparison LastPass relieves the trouble
of looking for passwords and the anxiety
of getting locked out of your accounts
you don't have to keep updating the
post-it note in your office drawer
LastPass keeps track of it all for you
so you can stay sane LastPass protects
your data and gives you the power to
make passwords impenetrable no need to
answer a million security questions
everything is right at your fingertips
no typing required and users can easily
and safely share account details with
family and friends a get started for
free with the link in the description of
this video and put your passwords on
autopilot with LastPass now I always
kick comparisons off with design and
yeah the oneplus 5 looks like an iPhone
previous one plus has pulled a bit from
HTC but the only remaining accent there
is delivering more of a curve to the
backplate compared to the iPhones flat
back and that's about it dual cameras
sure with the same layout for LED flash
and the rear microphone palm treo mute
switch same spot though oneplus adds an
extra click to there's and angled
antenna bands running towards the edges
of the phone at least the circular
speaker holes on the oneplus are a
little bit larger the difference is on
the front face stand out a bit more
circular fingerprint sensor to a flatter
oval the ear speaker has a grill
selfie camera is a little bit larger but
even breaking down the matte black
finish it's exceedingly difficult to
look at both phones and not see a strong
resemblance though many in our comments
have tried to convince me that I'm
blowing this out of proportion
this further reinforces why I like the
sandstone case for the oneplus recalling
my favorite experimental back from the
oneplus 2 and while I love powerful
phones with good internal specs I also
care about design I like a phone that
stands out I like getting into
conversations with people about gadgets
and from even a short distance no one's
really going to be curious about the
oneplus 5 sure the overall footprint is
a bit smaller Apple wastes a bit more
space but at least the iPhone 7 includes
enhanced water resistance and that's as
good a place as any to shift over to the
tech inside these two phones arrive at
very different ideas for delivering
high-performance hardware oneplus is
packing the guts of this phone with a
top-of-the-line chipset and a ton of RAM
while Apple continues to focus on more
modest hardware and relying on
optimization to keep things speedy
oneplus delivers one of the smoothest
Android user experiences we've yet
reviewed but for being nearly 10 months
old
the seven-plus doesn't feel like it's
fallen much behind smartphone
manufacturing is pretty much normalized
on what a modern pocket computer should
resemble an Apple's presentation is well
polished these two phones book into the
discussion and yet managed to meet in
the middle on crowd-pleasing performance
same sized screen same 1080p resolution
though the oneplus is using an AMOLED
panel while the iPhone tax and LCD Apple
delivers one of the more color accurate
screens available on a phone though the
contrast ratio and saturation on the
oneplus might be more eye pleasing for
some consumers know the biggest
difference is of course software we tend
to avoid full-on Android versus iOS
debates when comparing to individual
phones but more than any other factor
people are likely buying premium phones
these days based on ecosystem as iOS has
gotten more complicated we have noticed
a few more twitches or frame drops the
initial lag as the news feed populates a
little pop is the home screen resets
after pulling down the notification
shape dropped frames when sliding
through multitasking car
no computer is free from processing
delays though the iPhone has always been
the gold standard for responding to user
input and masking transitions as
programs load the one area where oneplus
isn't trying to mimic the iPhone is in
keeping a fairly stock build of Android
one of the few Chinese manufactured
devices which has not flirted with
eliminating the app drawer and happily
the oneplus 5 keeps a fresh look on
features like the camera app speaking of
that camera both phones support dual
sensor hardware with standard and zoom
lenses the one plus 5 is a respectable
performer for its price range but the
iPhone is one of the most consistent
performers we've reviewed for image
processing has class-leading HDR and
slow motion video
while both phones can produce
high-quality UHD video the oneplus lacks
any stabilization where the iPhone
smooths out handshake really well and
with dual sensors both phones can use
software to blur photo backgrounds
performance here is similar for software
processing and oneplus a solution is
nearly identical in operation to Apple's
portrait mode oneplus produced a capable
camera but considering the price
differences the iphone takes an
appropriate victory in overall
performance the audio fight is a bit
closer Apple takes a win for including
higher quality stereo speakers against
the mono loudspeaker on the oneplus
though the oneplus is a touch louder for
notifications and alerts
the flipside 1 plus al performs the
iPhone for headphone performance 32-bit
playback better dynamic range and
similar amp output to drive headphones
the convenience of having the headphone
jack built-in and it's a higher quality
solution to boot the similarities extend
the battery life to the 1 plus 5 is one
of the best Android performers we've run
through our media bench and while the
iPhone is still better optimized the
lead is getting smaller where Apple
needs to catch up is in recharging the
one plus - charger is remarkably quick
not just a marketing claim a half hour
plugged in really can keep you powered
for a day so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us between the 1 + 5 and
the iPhone 7 + it's completely
understandable when a good idea or
popular design element filters through
the smartphone market we've all sort of
arrived at the same glass rectangle is
the final evolution of the modern
smartphone but there's a significant
difference between organically arriving
at similar design elements and producing
a phone which follows a market leader
almost like a disciple the danger of
following if this phone is so similar
but performs poorer in certain popular
areas it starts to reinforce why you
might just want to buy the original the
full conversation is obviously more
complex balancing the personal
preferences between Android and iOS or
the Google and Apple ecosystems and we
shouldn't overlook the fact that this is
a terrific performer which can be had
for $300 less so maybe that's the
takeaway similar look similar features
lacking a few lifestyle options but a
smaller hit to your wallet this is a
much better deal than the time I bought
those knockoff Ninja Turtles at the flea
market as always thanks so much for
