should pick that up if it doesn't look
hungover just ugly right back at you I
never understood your jokes can you make
them simpler yeah why not why did the
chicken cross the road that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi Mary that
this is pocket now and this is the
 out daily recap the last week we
begun last week on Monday asking you how
much would you be willing to pay for
Anna Seuss hollow lens as we know
Microsoft is charging three thousand
dollars for the developer kid in a sous
was apparently working on its own
version but then again obviously we
expected not to be priced so high we had
722 comments we start with it depends if
I can watch porn with them the value
goes up why did your comment get the
most amount of likes I wouldn't pay
anything over six hundred dollars
considering how much you can get on an
xbox or PS and start making games it's
not worth much it's me at least and you
know much of the gaming companies will
probably consider what HTC is doing so I
feel that it's something that will
happen at some point I probably pay up
to about six hundred dollars for it I
try never to buy anything when it's
brand-new though that's just setting
dollars on fire wait for a few months
for it to drop and you're right
especially on Amazon and that's
particularly the case with a lot of new
technology it's extremely expensive at
the beginning and then six months later
it's just dirt cheap I'm Tuesday even
though YouTube bread wasn't yet
announced I asked you if you would be
willing to pay for youtube or would you
rather use ads as the rumors where the
YouTube revels gonna happen and it did
two days later we have twelve hundred
and fifty-seven comments thanks a lot
guys we start with me I hate ants so
much youtube you have to pay ten dollars
for watching our videos me that I say
how much I love ads and yeah 347 people
agree and so do i I would rather have
ads than have to pay for you to
particularly never used at blocks
because I know this would happen and I
want to support the creators like pocket
now as for example thanks a lot selfish
at block users you just ruined free TV
control and
I'm not really sure that's the reason
why YouTube bread exists but you do have
a point a lot of people block ads and
you're right I really do appreciate your
support particularly because it is the
ads that keep these videos coming advies
is the answer getting good on YouTube
and you know this is extremely true ads
on YouTube have become really compelling
they know how to keep you watching
during those 15 seconds that you're
forced to watch the ad and then the ad
just become something delightful and
that's actually a great thing that's the
way advertisement should be it shouldn't
be annoying it should be actually
helpful and actually entertaining as
well once they asked you which was your
favorite placement for a fingerprint
scanner the rumors were the iphone 7 the
possible sapphire display and obviously
a home button dying so we're wondering
exactly where the fingerprint scanner is
going to be back then we had 1174
comments thanks a lot again we start
with sinus best then the back and the
worst is the front you know that's
actually odd because I actually feel the
other way around I like the site
mountain ones but I prefer the one at
the front particularly when you have
your phone on the table which is the
behavior of a lot of people so that
means samsung galaxy s 8 will not have a
home button too and I was waiting for
this comment to fingerprint scanner will
be incorporated on the screen itself the
phone will lock when you press hard on
any place of the screen this technology
already exists and yeah the technology
already exists but Apple is not famous
for being the first at it on Thursday
the topic was a blackberry prig we heard
that it would be press around seven
hundred and fifty dollars I asked you
what did you think about this price tag
and well or shocked another 1057
comments thanks a lot again we start
with pay apple a grand for 64 gig of
storage but then cry when blackberry
charges for better security uh well
that's the thing you're right it's not
worth it free to pay so much money for
an iphone but then again paying for
security when security should be not a
bonus but what bones should do computers
do it as well why should you pay more
for something that company should do out
of the box for the price of the
blackberry curve you can easily get a
nexus 6 feet and two hundred fifty
dollars left in the park
and that is exactly my point I mean the
Nexus 6p on its own is a very secure
phone it's got its own fingerprint
scanner as well it's got a lot of things
going for it it's a really cool phone
and it doesn't cost so much why would
blackberry charge so much for security I
think the proofs price can be justified
that it brings something to the table no
other modern phone does a physical
keyboard and that's because that's what
obsolete bones had and finally Friday
the topic was the galaxy s7 edge and
edge plus the rumors are that they will
launch at the same time but then we
didn't hear anything about a galaxy s7
without the edges and I asked you if it
would be important for you to have a
regular variant or not we had 740
comments we start with if the edge
variant this price is the same as the s6
when it's launched and yeah I'm okay it
would not be a disappointment and yes
because of the price difference it does
make sense for samsung to now be able to
charge a lot less for technology that's
now more common true I'd be disappointed
they didn't release a regular variant
cos just comes so much into play and the
regular variants are a bit cheaper but
yeah obviously they would have to price
it at the same way I would be
disappointed because I don't really like
the edge display much it's a little
cumbersome to hold samsung gets rid of
the normal variant of the s7 then the
price tag of the edge will drop it will
probably still be higher than the normal
variant of the s7 but it won't be as
expensive as the s6 edge and probably
it's really hard to anticipate what
could happen right now but Samsung will
probably announce it in January again I
do feel that it would be better for
samsung and safer if they kept the
regular variant and probably just price
at a hundred dollars less than it is
right now and then sell the s7 edge at
the premium price give them the drop in
prices of flagship phones like the Moto
X and the Nexus 6p in addition to others
that is that for the out daily
