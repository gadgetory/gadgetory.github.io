allow headphones through the Lightning
port amazon is already announcing an
event to launch a probable smartphone
and new render show us the Galaxy f and
it looks hot I'm hi meta meta and if
you've got an F you failed so I wonder
why did they pick such a ridiculous name
for phone this is out daily
let's begin today with some of the
official stuff is Apple has just
published a specification to allow OEMs
and manufacturers to build made for
iphone accessories that will allow them
to use audio for the lighting port we've
heard rumors of the company working on
bringing HD audio playback on your
iphones and apparently current devices
only require a software update and then
we hopefully we'll see some HD audio
coming from I don't know beats
headphones and stuff aside from other
probabilities let's see what we get and
if you're wondering when exactly Windows
Phone 8.1 launch trust me I bet there
are people in Microsoft that are asking
themselves the same question but there
is a carrier already Vodafone in
Australia which is just confirmed that
they will be pushing the Windows Phone
8.1 over-the-air update to current
Hardware in mid-june or late June so
this is really interesting as usually
OEMs launch their new phones and then
offer software updates let's see how
that goes and speaking of carrier soon's
agency couldn't buy t-mobile they look
for another partner we've heard the
rumors of sprint wanting to buy t-mobile
for the longest time and apparently the
bids are ready apparently everything is
almost set and it seems that something
will happen in the next couple of weeks
and it seems that Deutsche Telekom will
retain twenty percent of whatever
company comes out of this which is
interesting though you know this whole
uncarrier thing from t-mobile great
marketing and great products in the end
so it's kind of sad to see this
happening but let's see if this is
actually in benefit to customers as
obviously we'll have to wait for the FTC
and speaking of hot bones that were
waiting for we've got some renders from
EDD leaks of the galaxy f from Samsung
this could probably be the galaxy s5
Prime only a new name and it is a
ridiculous name but still apparently
we're getting great specifications a
quad HD display aside from the usual
bells and whistles that we
heard from the galaxy s5 prime so stay
tuned this could be your next phone and
finally for the very hot news of the day
as on has just sent out invitations for
an event that's happening on jun 18 and
they're publishing everything with this
ad so please hit the link to the
description and watch the full ad as
people are being surprised / wow how
intuitive this is how awesome that
they're not really telling you what it
is so we are assuming that this is that
whole three duy that they were planning
with the smartphone with the pork
cameras and everything but that they
just use the question of the day what do
you think amazon is going to launch at
this event because in my particular case
i think it is the smartphone i just
wonder how and would have kept that
thing be it's a phone leave us a comment
down below what do you think it'll be
and friends you know the drill if you
want to get the news earlier before this
video is snow machine follow us on
pocketnow.com it's strep trying to
channel as well it also follow me on
