there is not much change to expect
remorse claim that Android silver is
very far from becoming real if ever and
more leaks show was the HTC Nexus tablet
in the works I'm high memory that I and
since I am not getting any younger let's
breeze through this video so that I
could get some coffee
this is pocket out daily let's begin
today with what's official which is
actually a lot motorola has just begun
pre-orders for its Moto X the new one
along with more stocking for the Moto
360 and also the moto hint and the other
accessories that are out there these
products are already available on AT&amp;amp;T
and the Motorola website as well though
this is very interesting Motorola has
also launched moto voice for last year's
models and including the Droid lineup so
this is really interesting as this is
the first company that actually makes
the old model be as good as the new one
odd NVIDIA has also launched pre-orders
for its tablet shield but this time the
LTE variant it'll just cost you $100
more than the existing Wi-Fi 16 gig
model though you're getting LTE
connectivity on this tablets along with
32 gigs of storage so it could be that
they're not selling many of the Wi-Fi
models or it could be that they want to
try something new because the price tag
is compelling this will be shipping in
late September and again it'll cost you
400 bucks speed of Nvidia and speaking
of tablets we get some leaked images of
a keyboard built by HTC that is designed
for tablets and given the fact that HTC
does not build tablets we can assume
that this is an accessory for the HTC
Nexus 9 is interesting as we've never
seen an Nexus accessories that go beyond
the cover so it's great to see that
there are accessories to come let's just
see when we get the tablet and for those
of you that are wondering since we're
talking so much Nexus why aren't we
talking about Android silver as it turns
out there are some internal leaks that
claim that the project is kind of dying
it's dying because of the departure of
Google executive Nikesh Arora which was
the person that was in charge of making
Android silver happen apparently after
he was retired for the company for
reasons we don't know nobody's really
talking about this nobody
pushing for Android silver to ever
happen so let's see where things go as
glue the shin phones are kind of sucky
right now and probably for the
interesting news of the day let's talk
about the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6s
we've got some comparisons in benchmarks
for a phone that's not really in the
market yet interesting but yeah there
are some benchmark comparisons showing
us that the change between the iPhone 6
and the iPhone 5s is not really much a
couple of points even though Apple was
touting that there was a 25% boost in
performance and a 50% boost in GPU
performance when it came to the iPhone 6
is not the case according to benchmarks
obviously we will have to test these
phones but even more interesting it
seems that if you're wanting to you know
tap iPhones in order to share things
with NFC that's apparently not gonna
happen as it seems that NFC is only
going to be for Apple pay and Apple pay
won't be available yet but that leads
you to the question of the day do you
really use that tapping between Android
phones in order to transfer stuff
because in my case honestly I haven't I
don't have friends that do it and in the
case of iPhones we use a you know
airdrop
so leave us a comment down below what is
your case friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
