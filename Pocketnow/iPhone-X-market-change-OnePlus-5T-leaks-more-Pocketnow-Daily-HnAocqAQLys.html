the dynamic of the market according to
analysts we get leaks of the probable
front of the one plus 5t with some
changes and we already get to hear about
the fingerprint scanner on the samsung
galaxy s 9 i'm hi i'm adam Iveta
definitely a bittersweet day as i'm
packing up and heading back to New York
this is pocket out daily the official
deuce today I have to do with deals if
you're in the market for any of the new
Samsung Galaxy devices talking Note 8 s8
and si plus best part currently has
shaved off $200 off any of the AT&amp;amp;T
variants you can get 250 dollars off the
verizon variants you can learn more
about the deals in the link in the
description definitely a good time to
buy other interesting news have to do
with the razor phone that has not yet
been announced
mainly because Scott Royal which was the
mastermind behind HTC design and later
the next bit Robin Design who also most
likely designed the razor phone has just
left the company to form his own design
firm called attic and the whole idea is
that they want to provide better design
options and even insight for other
companies this is a very interesting
change I am a big fan of Scott's work
ever since the HTC touch diamond2 I
can't wait to see what he does next
now as will the spotlight over to the
samsung galaxy s 9 mainly because we've
got this patent application in Korea
that shows that Samsung wants to bring
back the fingerprint scanner to the
front I don't know if that was a pun or
not but anyways apparently it's going to
change back to the front and the whole
way that the company plans to do it is
that it won't be an admitted fingerprint
scanner to the display but instead some
sort of like a recessed part of the
display more like what we see with the
essential phone with the selfie camera
only at the bottom instead of at the top
whatever the case may be it's hard to
predict if it will make it to the s9
with all the changes that we're
expecting but hey let's see and speaking
of fingerprint scanners let's discuss
the 1+5 mainly because we were expecting
some sort of a change like the Oppo f5
and instead we're noticing that leaks
show us that a fingerprint scanner is at
the back and the recent leaks of Today
Show is that the bezels will be
dramatically reduced because the
fingerprint scanner is no longer at the
front obviously we can't really predict
what the final design of the phone will
be I mean last year there wasn't really
a design change
with a 1 plus 3t so stay tuned and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with research that confirms
that the iPhone 8 sales have been not
necessarily terrible but sluggish you
have to know that Apple never really
publishes numbers over how much it's
sold of a specific iPhone but according
to research and market demographics
apparently yes the iPhone a has sold a
lot less than the iPhone 7 and a lot of
it has to do with the iPhone 10
obviously according to the research the
iPhone 10 is changing the market dynamic
a lot up to the point where we're
actually even seeing more companies to
launch new products later in the year
the question for you today is I mean do
you think that it's a smart idea I mean
do you think that it's better for
iPhones to be launched in November and
we're closer to the holiday season
will you rather go back to the September
times just like we did with the iPhone 8
as you know how Apple likes to change
things every now and then in the past
there was a dead WWDC now it's later
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion in my case I prefer
him closer to the holiday season friends
