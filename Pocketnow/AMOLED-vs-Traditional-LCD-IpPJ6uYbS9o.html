pocketnow.com and in this video we're
taking a look at the photo viewing
experience on an AMOLED display versus a
traditional LCD display with a standard
backlight now both of these devices are
at maximum brightness right now we have
the ammo LED display up here and the
traditional LCD display down here and as
you can tell from the image while the
LCD display seems to be a little bit
brighter it's kind of washed out from
the back light whereas on the AMOLED
display here on the omnia pro be 7610 we
really get a high level of contrast that
really lets us see all of the texture in
the dog's fur or the dog's hair plus the
the texture in the wooden floor wears
down here we kind of have this washed
out look that really makes it difficult
to see things so let's change the image
to something else let's go to this image
okay and here they are again and again
we get that washed out kind of image on
the bottom here on the touch pro 2
whereas on the AMOLED display things
come across very very crisp thanks to
that high level of contrast so not only
does the AMOLED display really helped a
lot in looking at pictures to be able to
see all that detail thanks to the high
level of contrast but it also helps a
lot in power consumption I think in the
future we're going to see a lot of
devices move towards AMOLED display
technology it's a huge battery saver and
it looks great too that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
