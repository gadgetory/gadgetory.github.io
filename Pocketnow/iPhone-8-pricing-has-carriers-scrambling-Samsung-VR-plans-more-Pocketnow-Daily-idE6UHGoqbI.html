already has carrier scrambling over how
to sell it
Samson seems to have a very cool idea of
what it wants duper standalone VR and
between Apple and Sam's like it seems
that the mine chair is actually tipping
over in Asia
I'm hi Natalie that and a quick little
question if I had to ask you what your
dream job would be what would it be it
was a comment down below
this is out daily the official
news today begin with some very
interesting developments I mean I don't
know if you've noticed but over the past
couple of weeks
Nokia has been making the news every
single day that's because this company
continues to do things that make a lot
of logical sense in gaining back their
limelight one of these for example has
to do with a partnership that the
company has just made what Xiaomi it
seems that the company actually wants to
work with Xiao Jie's new chipset in
addition apparently the companies are
collaborating in patents to the point
where it seems that Nokia wants to work
on something that's VR related and also
wants to work on some sort of smart
phone that uses shown these new chips it
definitely both companies are going to
be in our radar more often going forward
another company that's usually under the
radar in the United States is just
emerged and that would be meizu the main
reason why is because in Weibo some
images have just emerged of a dual
display smartphone there in mind the
only other smartphone that can do this
is the yotaphone but with an e-ink
display this is actually a color display
even though smaller than your standard
dual display that we've seen in the past
so let's see if that phone actually ever
gets out of R&amp;amp;D and speaking of R&amp;amp;D
Samson seems to be working on a
completely new approach to VR we heard
the company was definitely going to
adopt daydream and the whole standalone
VR thing connected to your smartphone
through the USBC cable but apparently
the company wants to go beyond and wants
to create standalone VR with a VR
headset that's its own thing it's got
Sonne processor its own content and
apparently the company has already begun
showcasing what we can expect now
obviously this is very ambitious because
no company does this currently you
either need a computer or smartphone for
this to
work so let's see how that goes and
speaking of Samson nation is top 1000
brands information has just emerged
where we get to know which ones are the
most popular and believe it or not it is
no longer Apple which is such an oddity
because Apple is actually not an Asian
brand but still it's one of the
best-selling ones and no actually now
it's Samsung in the top number one spot
then we have Apple and then you have
Sony in third place and we wonder why
Sony is still there given how the
company has really pulled back and
market appeal and still if I were to ask
you do you believe that these numbers
are fair do you believe that Samson
should be at the top we would love to
know your opinion in the comments and
finally the very interesting rumors
today have to do with Apple the iPhone 8
and it's crazy price tag speculation has
it that this phone is going to cost up
to a thousand dollars and we also know
that analysts believe that this phone is
not going to be a crazy sell it's going
to sell well but it's not going to break
any Apple records so really it's got US
carriers and carriers from other
countries scrambling over how to sell it
up to the point where we hear that these
carriers might have to provide tons of
subsidies or at least tons of discounts
in order to make this smartphone
appealing that's rather interesting it's
rather interesting to see that these
companies are willing to sacrifice their
own profit in order to sell the iPhone
because clearly people will want this
iPhone but anyways it leads me to the
question today I mean do you believe
that the iPhone 8 will not bring enough
innovation to warrant $1,000 because in
my case I do feel it does not bring
enough innovation to cost so much money
but we would love to know what you think
in the comments down below
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get to news earlier before the
video was filmed hello listen for gonna
