pocketnow.com in this video I'm going to
show you three augmented reality apps
that can make you look fat old and bald
it's a lot of fun let's get to it now
we've covered some of these apps
previously in our weekly after review
shows but I wanted to circle back and
talk about them individually because
these are the coolest apps that I've
ever seen
they're a ton of fun if you're around
your friends and family you want to
impress them with what smartphones can
do with augmented reality of today so
there are three app apps here from a
company called pity and company there
are $0.99 bought booth aging booth and
fat booth now if you're on the Android
platform you can get fat booth but only
iOS has aging booth and Bob booth let me
show you how it works
it's really really amazing so I'm gonna
go into fat booth here and yes you
already get to see some of the pictures
I've taken here so I'm going to go to
the camera and I'm going to take a
picture of myself with the self-portrait
camera okay there we go and what fat
booth will do is put a circle around
your face kind of a bad hair day there
but we'll work with it so it's going to
use face detection which is awesome then
it wants you to change these markers so
you have to locate the chin the mouth
and make sure each eye is set up just
right then you click ready go it does
some processing and look what happens
you'll get a picture of me as if i sat
on the couch all day pretty amazing
stuff I mean it it really looks like my
face blown up so you can actually shake
and it will show you the before and then
the after just a whole lot of fun that's
fat booth let's jump into the next one
called aging booth this one's really
creepy it works in about the same way
you can already see a bunch that I've
done here so I'm going to go to camera
and take a picture of myself again so we
get the marker alright same deal applies
here I'm going to click use we're gonna
get the face detection going and then
we're gonna line up my chin a little bit
better get the mouth right on there the
eyes look pretty good and now ready go
we're flipping through time here you're
gonna see what I'm gonna look like as an
old man potentially it's not perfect but
it's pretty amazing it makes this
skin gray makes my hair gray adds a lot
of wrinkles makes this face sag just
really awesome looking and finally let's
go to Bald booth members of my family
have lost their hair the older one so
I'm sure I'm going to look bald one day
so let's go into bald booth we'll do the
same thing here we'll take a picture of
myself one more time and this time you
have to line up the eyes okay there we
go and this one's a little bit more
sophisticated in terms of what you have
to do with the face detection we have
three sections here we need to adjust
the eyes as before we click on the next
one now we have to move the ears around
try to place them as best as possible
you don't have to get them perfect and
finally eyebrows need to be right in
order to get the bald effect going that
looks pretty good let's go and let's see
what I'm going to look like you know
about 10-15 years this one's probably
the least cool of all because it really
just adds this this kind of white spot
to your head but let's see the before
and the after there so before okay
things are going well I've got a full
head of hair and then a male pattern
baldness happens to me so if you want to
see what all of these look like I'm
going to post the pictures on
pocketnow.com so you can see me old fat
and bald it would be cool if they could
combine all three and really have the
ugliest picture of me possible again
these are called fat booth aging booth
and bog booth you can get them all for
iOS for $0.99 or if you want to get fat
booth on Android that's also available
in the Android Market so if you like
this video please give us a thumbs up
and have fun looking that old and bald
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
