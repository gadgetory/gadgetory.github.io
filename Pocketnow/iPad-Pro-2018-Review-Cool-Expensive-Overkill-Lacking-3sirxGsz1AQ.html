version of Apple's latest and greatest
flagship and as I mentioned in a recent
collab with super staff my favorite non
smartphone gadget of 2018 I know many of
you judge this product based on how Pro
it is and the fact that it truly can't
replace your computer all valid
arguments but seriously for me it's not
about trying to replace anything it's
more about the fact that there are
certain things that you can do on this
that you can't do in a traditional
computer I'm hanging out together with
pocket now and let me explain to you
what in our full review I guess the best
way to start this video is to reiterate
the most important fact about any tablet
or smart watch you do not need one yes
it is true there are certain tasks that
tablets just can't - and you'll have to
fall back to a regular computer but
notice that's actually the case for some
of you if you've got specialized PC
applications in your workflow or if
you're into heavy video editing like I
am then true and I've had is simply not
good enough now a very interesting trend
has been happening lately and it's the
fact that I've noticed that a lot of you
actually don't need a full computer
either people like my sister don't even
own a computer everything she needs to
do she's able to do from her phone there
are people that are just on social media
that are just doing email where even an
iPad pro like this one is overkill now
my use of tablets is actually unique I
rely on tablets for a hundred percent of
my video process so let me begin this
video by telling you what's great about
the iPad pro for starters I script a
hundred percent of my videos on a tablet
you all made hate iOS for its lack of a
true window base UI but this is actually
what I like the most
see when I'm scripting I prefer to avoid
distractions and interruptions in order
to remain inspired
a single app on a full screen is
actually ideal in mimicking the old
typewriter user interface second I hate
battery and anxiety for me it's actually
a waste to use 30% of my battery just to
create a script while I'm on the go
which I always am you guys know that so
for me an iPad is actually really
convenient because of the Third Point as
well which is the fact that you can't
really use a pro computer as a note pad
where the size of this iPad pro actually
makes it rather convenient for me to use
this tablet as my shot list where I can
highlight everything as I'm filming this
actually helps me ensure that every clip
that I need will be filmed using the
Apple pencil as a highlighter and then
the second element about being a note
pet is that if it's gonna compliment my
macbook throat it has to be thin and
light at nearly 1 pound the 11 inch iPad
pro was my choice because it seriously
does look and feel like a note pad the
element of finish at the back along with
the design and the borders is quite
sleek using this tablet without any sort
of case makes it feel so light to hold
with one hand and the fact that the
Apple pencil now connects magnetically
to the side makes the form-factor even
more convenient and then there's content
consumption I've seriously stopped
traveling with portable speakers the
speakers on this tablet are insane great
def and it doesn't matter how hard you
tax them they are loud and they never
distort the vacation Android flagship
users are accustomed and then there's
this screen which I actually praised for
its color reproduction contrast
brightness and direct sunlight and this
120 Hertz pro motion is seriously
awesome and then last but not least the
specifications are killer we're talking
about an 8 12 X Bionic rammed it depends
on your storage option which is 4
gigabytes for those of you going for 64
to 512 gigs or 6 ego bytes of RAM if you
choose one terabyte as an option we also
have a 29 watt hour battery and to our
surprise it even includes a fast charger
through USB see in the box if you could
call this a fast charger but then the
topic of the USBC is we're all
transitions of the things I'm mixed
about when it comes to this iPad pro as
there's actually no female USB seats a
lightning adapter so I'm stuck with a
ton of accessories that are made for
iPad and iPhone that don't work on this
tablet anymore like for example my
microphone which pretty much enabled the
pocket out daily I'm now using an iPhone
as the host for this microphone because
this tablet is no longer useful for that
and then there's the fact that even if
you do have a broader support for
peripherals external drives don't work
this is seriously a good move but with a
bad implementation which leads me to the
reason why the implementation is bad the
bottleneck that is iOS I mean sure it's
got the best tablet applications and the
most complete ecosystem but the
reluctance of Apple to better its file
system makes sharing files with this
tablet a huge nightmare and then the
whole desktop experiences both
inexistent and just inefficient I think
it's time for Apple to wake up to the
fact that the only way that consumers
will take this tablet as a pro device is
when it moves away from iOS there is a
need for an iPad OS I'm not saying that
Mac OS is the best solution for this I'm
saying that we need something else
something in the middle that will allow
consumers to be able to do more pro
tasks with it as definitely iOS just
makes this feel like a bloated iPhone
and finally even if I like that face
ideas now included it is super fast but
I end up covering it half the time
whenever I'm using this tablet in
landscape mode and then there are the
things that just flat out do not make
sense about using an iPad for the
day-to-day the things that I don't like
like for example the fact that there are
applications that are still not
optimized for this tablet like for
example Gmail I rely on it heavily but I
can't really use it a multi window which
is one of the major selling points of
the previous version of iOS meaning I
think that Apple should actually force
developers to optimize their
applications for them to be supported by
new tablet or simply not be available
because honestly it just makes the
experience cumbersome every now and then
there are apps that do work there are
apps that don't and this inconsistency
is truly annoying and then there's the
fact that even if Apple brags that there
is no
you see as powerful as the iPad pro we
get a mobile browser and not a desktop
one making even the cheapest and most
underpowered Chromebook looked far
better for certain web tasks and second
queuing this keyboard cover which
actually looks really dirty it doesn't
age well but probably the most important
reason why I chose this keyboard cover
is because if I chose the regular cover
it would also provide a flap for the
full back of the iPad and it would just
add extra bulb that was like you know
for the price difference I'd rather have
functionality with a keyboard all that
was great but then the implementation of
this keyboard is actually not great at
all for example it's not backlit for its
price and using it in tablet mode means
that there are keys that get in the way
even if they remain off so it's just not
good design for its price even if the
typing experience is good and then for
me probably the worst thing is the fact
that you're buying this tablet because
it's thin and light and this makes it
thicker than a Mac just like seriously
it doesn't make sense
third and to continue with design
choices that don't make sense what's up
with this hammer humph I don't need a
professional camera on an iPad nor do I
want my notepad to wobble on a table as
I use it which only forces me to buy one
of those hefty covers and then last but
not least the price tag I mean this
Apple pencil two plus the iPad and 256
gigs that I bought plus the cover which
I have here all this combination is
$1,200
the entry-level price for a lot of Mac
books that is a lot of money for a
tablet and sure there is a less
expensive option but 64 gigabytes on a
tablet just does not make sense it does
make you question if you want to buy
this or a MacBook Air to conclude let me
return to my initial premise of this
product you don't need an iPad Pro or
any tablet for that matter heck for most
of the typical scenarios where a tablet
is convenient this iPad pro is seriously
overkill just by the nine point seven
inch iPad for less than $400 and you
should be fine and I do understand that
Apple calls this the iPad pro
but I feel that the name is deceiving it
is pro but not for productivity for save
you can do a ton of things like Excel
sheets on this thing but it's not
necessarily that kind of a pro product
this is a pro for designers cartoonists
that rely on professional work with the
Apple pencil and I've even heard of
music creators that rely only on iPads
to get their work done I'd even say that
unless you're really hooked into Final
Cut Pro like I am apps like Lula fusion
will provide multi-layer video editing
for a good price for me the iPad pro is
seriously just a very convenient product
it's a way for me not to need to use my
MacBook Pro I'm shocked at how much I
rely on using this iPad for just about
everything else do I recommend this iPad
pro well I love it so sure I can
recommend it I just again feel that this
product is overkill
most of you won't need it and it just
really needs an iPad OS that is the only
way that pro people are gonna consider
this to be a pro tablet is it good yes
it is
is it overpriced yes it is is it great
and cool for me it definitely is folks
