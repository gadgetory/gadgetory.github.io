early announcement concept renders show
us a blue iphone 7 that might grab some
attention and scientific tests actually
show a very durable galaxy s7 active I'm
hi Mary vera and I'm not ashamed to
admit that it took me forever to watch
civil war but I love that thing this is
parking out daily as we try every single
day the official news today begin with
deals probably one of my favorite
watches is the Huawei watch the only
reason why I'm not using it as because
i'm testing watch os3 right now but so
far well amazon just put it on another
sale two hundred dollars off on certain
units obviously if we go for the lower
tier you'll only find a hundred dollars
off but still two hundred fifty dollars
for a huawei watch is an amazing deal
indeed more information link in the
description and speaking of Amazon we've
heard a ton of rumors of the company
wanting to branch out its prime service
as much as possible there are some
indications that some of these services
are going to be branched out at some
points i'm already are but we hear that
prime music is going to be a major deal
and we should expect some changes coming
very soon just not sure how soon and for
those of you that have been asking for
torture test of the galaxy s7 active in
our review well we're not necessarily
against that it's just that nobody
really buys a phone to torture it so we
really focus on reviewing products for
the way people actively use them this is
very interesting there is this video
that i highly suggest you watch in the
link in the description from phone buff
an amazing video that shows us the
galaxy s7 active going through fifty
drop tests on its face and surviving now
obviously this is not an indestructible
phone if there would be a pebble on the
floor and you drop it face first
obviously that will smash the display
but this is just to prove how well
manufactured the galaxy s7 active is if
you want to learn more watch more again
the video isn't a wink and even though
we are not fans of concept renders some
of these are very good and very close to
accurate and after the rumors of the
blue iphone 7 that we heard recently
well there are some concept renders that
show us what the phone would look like
in blue and i'm not
why it looks very good I'm not saying
that I would prefer it over space gray
because space gray continues to be my
favorite color but blue is very very
cool and watch and see more images in
the links and finally the hot news that
they have to do with the samsung galaxy
note 7 set your calendars there are some
leaks of the probable invites for the
device apparently it's not going to be
announced that Aoife it will be
announced earlier in New York City on
August second then we've been covering a
ton of rumors that tell us that the
phone might be announced early it makes
all the sense in the world given the
fact that Samsung does want to fight
that phablet fight with Apple but it
leads leads to the question of today do
you think that it is a good move for
such an early launch do you think that
it would be smarter to wait for the
iphone 7 plus in my case I think that
first come first serve and for me my
favorite phablet continues to be the
note line I believe is a comment down
below we would love to know your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get these news earlier before
