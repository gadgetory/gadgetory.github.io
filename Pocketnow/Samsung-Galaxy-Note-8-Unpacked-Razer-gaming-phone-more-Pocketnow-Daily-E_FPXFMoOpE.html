event in New York City just in time to
steal everybody's thunder razor is
reportedly working on bringing us a
smartphone for parkour gamers we start
hearing of collaborations between LG and
Apple on new battery technology for a
future iPhone
I'm hi Nevada and the TGIF should be an
institution that is celebrated hopefully
even every day I mean why not
this is pocket out daily so even though
I thought that Black Friday was a
November best I decided to make one
early in July it started actually today
it ends tomorrow at midnight and the
deals are actually compelling only not
all the products are compelling as well
mainly because well you have the Huawei
watch 2 which I do recommend but then
all you have are like iPhones from last
year iPads from last year still if
you're looking for a product that's
decent and is very aggressively priced I
highly suggest you follow the link in
the description to learn more how many
times have we heard of a Facebook phone
seen a Facebook phone and actually seen
Facebook fail at making phones or
collaborating turns out that apparently
the company is still wanting to figure
something out
and the funny part is that is actually
inspired by project ara meaning this is
actually either a very modular phone or
other reports claim that it's actually a
modular speaker you know Mark Zuckerberg
there is a world beyond your Facebook
and I actually live that everyday and
I'm sure everybody else does as well but
anyways now let's talk about a
collaboration between LG and Apple is we
hear that both companies are working in
some l-shaped battery or some iPhone
that's not going to be the iPhone X or
iPhone 8 this makes a lot of sense I
mean LG has been innovating in battery
technology since the LG g2 we've seen
the company come up with some really
awesome designs for batteries on
smartwatches as well so yeah apparently
the future iPhone maybe the iPhone 9
will bring this new technology then this
will allow you know Apple to be more
efficient with the design of its future
phone let's see what we get now about
razor as we hear that the company wants
to finally use its acquisitions to build
a smart phone remember the company
acquired next but in addition to other
companies that are focused on smart
phones and the funny part is that what
they want to build is apparently a
hardcore gamer smartphone which is
thing that next bit was still whatever
it is that may happen we can't wait to
see others ends of being and finally the
very interesting news that they happen
pretty much about an hour after I had
finished editing yesterday's pocket out
daily yes Samsung has sent out press
invitations for its impact event to
happen in New York City on August 23rd
and I actually spent the following hour
buying my plane ticket yes we will be
there covering it live we have so many
expectations for this next-generation
Galaxy Note and we've seen so many
renders we've heard about specs and
everything but in today's question the
biggest one today would be what is this
phone going to be named because if you
remember there there was already a
Galaxy Note years ago it was a tablet
that was eight inches diagonal so if
this phone is not going to be main
Galaxy Note what do you think it will be
or may it be that they're just going to
be using Galaxy Note and the eight stuck
at the note that's something that
sentence been doing since the note 5 in
my case I just think they're just going
to call it Galaxy Note just Galaxy Note
it would make a lot of sense of the
company just started the branding again
but leave a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get the
news earlier before the video is filmed
follow us on Fargo comment subscribe to
our channel for more videos like this
one and also follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscore leave it on Instagram if I
marry that are please give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw I am
high in that we go thanks so much for
watching we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
