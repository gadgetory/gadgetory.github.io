pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at some of the
really cool enhancements made to the
toshiba g 8 10 okay so let's start with
a hard work tour of the device as i said
before it's a flush touch screen there
are no edges and i want to show you
something really interesting after i
take out the stylus in the extremely
awkward place i hate i hate the stylus
it's it's plasticky it's crappy it's
really annoying to use but anyway you
see these buttons i mentioned that
they're completely flat so they're
touch-based right they actually have the
same characteristic as the touchscreen
so you know if you ever tilt your device
to the side and you touch the screen you
can see the kind of the the colors Bend
because it's pushing down on the screen
the screen actually has some play the
same thing can be said about these
buttons they use resistive touchscreen
technology which means the two layers
touch each other underneath the button
and that's how the device knows that
it's registered a button press so they
require a little bit of pressure to get
them activated but not too much here we
have a d-pad and it takes a little bit
of getting used to to not have not be
able to feel for the the edges of the
button let's see we have a home button
which takes you back to the now screen
on spb mobile shell start menu to
completely useless a soft key buttons
the reason i say that they're useless is
because just you know three millimeters
above that you can press on the actual
screen to get that soft function to work
here we have start just call start and
call n button and on the bottom we have
a microphone and some branding from
toshiba on the bottom it says qualcomm
3g cdma on this side we have a a slot
for the microSD card but why is it
exposed there should be a filler card
here I don't want it dust and such to
get trapped in there to the left of that
we have a soft reset whole a power
button and I actually like the placement
of this power button because I pick up
the device with my left hand I use my
thumb to tap on the tap on the device
and then I whip out the stylist with my
right hand I think it's better than a
placement on the top here we have a
volume up and down button
nothing on the top and this is what it
looks like when you take out the stylus
and then there's a button here for
record for voice notes and camera
shutter button and here's the port for
mini USB flipping over to the back we
have the three megapixel camera with
autofocus so that's good self-portrait
mirror and a fill light okay let me show
you some things about this device that I
didn't show on the second video that
talked about software enhancements to
flip from screen to screen you know we
have these three different screens in
spb mobile shell you can actually swipe
your finger look at that and you can
change that animation I'll show you
where to do that in a second there's a
second animation that takes place when
you click on an icon so right now we
have the rolling cube icon going and
that will work for other things too to
change these animations you go into the
settings button and we go to spb mobile
shell settings for toshiba i'm going to
click on the animation tab and here we
can change the more and back functions
and the main window function so i'm
going to change them up just to show you
what other options we have for the main
window we're going to change sliding to
sweeping and for the more and back we're
going to change it to folding so I click
OK takes me back now let's see what we
have ok now it's a sliding action and
you can also use the soft key buttons
down here to toggle through the screens
though some may prefer just to press the
buttons along the bottom ok so then the
question is how do I get to that now
screen when I'm doing something else in
Windows Mobile the standard interface
well there are two ways one of them is
to press on this home button and we're
back and press the X and another way and
I think this is kind of an undiscovered
feature of spb mobile shell if you take
your finger and drag from the top of the
task from the top bar down you get this
this will let you toggle between the
three different spb mobile shell windows
so we have the phone application here
Affleck
asian launcher and then the regular now
screen so that could be a good way to
quickly get to a particular screen of
spb mobile shell rather than just
pressing the home button and going
straight back so that's another way to
do it now I want to show you the the
flick scrolling enhancements made to
this which only work in some programs we
get the flick scrolling enhancements
from spb pocket plus so I'm going to go
into internet explorer and here we have
pocketnow.com mobile loaded and let me
show you how this works it's it's quite
precise I know exactly how much the page
is going to move down because it feels
like an iPhone it feels like it should
you can go pretty fast you could stop it
very quickly you have to you have to
double click on the screen and I think
this probably works a lot better with a
stylus to highlight text yes exactly and
this flick scrolling also works in
something like contacts so go to
contacts and I flick hence top and flick
and flick and flick much better than the
flick scrolling of the HTC touch flo
found on the HTC touch and tighten too
and that sort of thing and the last
enhancement I want to show you is spb
full screen keyboard which in my opinion
is the worst on-screen keyboard ever to
land on Windows Mobile so here i am in
word mobile and i'm going to click new
to open a new document and here I've got
the standard windows mobile keyboard
on-screen keyboard and I'm going to
click on this button in the corner which
will cause me to rotate the device and
reorient my fingers so that i can type
on this keyboard this keyboard covers
the entire screen so that I can only see
one line of text so that is not very
convenient today is Friday I've been
practicing with this keyboard and even
with practice I'm still not that fast I
don't find the touches to be very
precise for some reason it's got really
good word completion so I don't have to
spell a word fully it kind of knows what
I'm trying to say if i misspell a word
it will correct it for me but still the
whole idea of covering everything on the
screen
to get a keyboard and you know having to
turn the device into landscape to type
is just silly I think you're much better
off getting a program like touchpal
which give you aa gives you options to
have a t9 like pad and a shirt typepad
rather than just the standard windows
mobile keyboard or this horrendous full
screen keyboard okay so that's it for
this video if you like what you see

videos all the time and that way you can
keep abreast of when we add new ones
I'll be back with the full review soon
