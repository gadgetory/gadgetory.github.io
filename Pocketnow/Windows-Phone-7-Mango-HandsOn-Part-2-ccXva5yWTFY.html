way they can shortcut hasn't even got a
throwback button so you just press and
hold the back button or well get full
visual back stack of everywhere you've
been so you may sit you may already said
this how do you get rid of them yes the
way you get rid of them is you basically
keep on a back button every time you
know someone went to say this every time
you want an appt to go into memory you
leave the app by pressing the start
button and now that's that's zeroed in
so basically that exact screen that I
was honest I mean it's great because
it's a full dehydration of the apathy or
you wouldn't happen on the second time
to start button and have running the
text message comes into this memory
state where it will skew save for you
and if you get back to it in study you
never popped back for the beginning of a
nap or whatever more in the middle of
your thought that you were writing who
are clones what can I do that you get
beyond the way that it works is
consumers I think we have such a muddy
idea of what multitasking is now I think
the consumer benefit is they want to be
able to switch instantly quickly between
stomach the reality is we actually have
the applications always this ready to be
resumed state and if they need to access
those like the network or revocation we
use a number of background agents that
will develop video see you later today
that we've offered that allow them to do
things like get network traffic so if
your twitter app or they say every 30
minutes i'm gonna feast on the network
is that when you reload or when you
switch back to that twitter app it looks
up to date you know what i mean and so
to the consumer it looks like that apps
been running the whole time you never
had an impact on battery life or
performance and your fan with you know
uses an out of control and things like
that so we wanted to be smart about the
ways that that all work together so even
script stuff to go ahead and pull some
in the past yeah okay show provide for
in in essence is being stored in its
christian memory and then resume
distribution yeah we basically do a
bunch of that stuff on the time that
they happen so this is getting a little
cakey but they have this thing called um
i think it's called background services
so we can choose which applications use
background service in this case i have
flickr up that's actually taking
advantage of her
it's going to continue to get new
information maybe to update a tile the
age location of pushing a new creation
is solving the British application Gertz
letting me know hey you're late i need
to get on the road right now your point
passes available things like we have
another so all that's available here in
developers starting today will be able
to xbox indicate whether or not they
want to take advantage of the production
on services actually have to pull Derek
in about two minutes be time I one more
question of anybody barneys it when you
get to from skype rivals snatcher I
middle that you get to all of your
photos of course those just magically
show up in your lectures and then all
office documents as well as things like
PDF anything that you store that's a
document type stuff I like the only
really something that has an application
yeah yeah and that's the thing too I
mean we didn't go into any little detail
because there is so much we don't want
to focus it but uh with SkyDrive and
specifically we've done with office we
have the ability to help you find
application so if I click on something
actually the help i'll show you example
so they're actually have music that's
come in I mean all that stuff is
available if I go in and find some
documents for instance let's see what a
good example would be trying to see if
there's I want to find a PDF that's my
point so let's see here if I scroll down
far enough perfect here's a bunch of
PDFs ok give me up you need a reader for
that right and so what happens when I
tap on this is it actually download a
PDF dynamically from Sky Drive in this
case is loving it down with me and it'll
actually understand that I even have a
penny up reader for this and it will
make a suggestion on the application the
marketplace that would be most equipped
to open this which in this case or the
adobe reader so applications when the
motors are writing can also specify
their final association so you get a
screen another week says get the app to
open smiley movie your PDF reader often
has to go get it imagine playing a
YouTube infinite says hey to play this
uhm even YouTube app that's like
probably so yeah all of those documents
music stuff like that I'll show up
anyhow guys right there in our home
