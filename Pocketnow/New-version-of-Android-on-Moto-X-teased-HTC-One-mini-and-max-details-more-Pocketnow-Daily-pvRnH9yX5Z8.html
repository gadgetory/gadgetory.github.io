get shown off on video the HTC One mini
and Max get more spec leaks and possible
dates and the BlackBerry a10 phablet
also gets the attention of the camera
I'm hi meri beta and if you had special
superpowers wouldn't you love to the
lead certain days of the week this is
 out daily looks like as they off
with some interesting leaks that ended
up turning into news as we've got some
leaked banners of HTC teasing the one
mini smartphone coming up soon we've
seen the photo and images and everything
we know how it's going to look but it
seems the company wasn't really
intending to publish this poster today
and now they did and according to them
well small things are capable of big
things or something like that lead to
the description for the full banner and
the whole argument that they've got
there I want the HTC one minute looks
kind of interesting now let's go to the
other side of the turf let's talk about
the HTC One Max's we've got new reports
that the company is working on bringing
this phone with the Snapdragon 800
processor and a design that looks
exactly like the HTC one only bigger but
interesting is the fact that the company
is planning to launch this phone in
early September and yeah that's the time
that Eva happens and that's the time
that the samsung galaxy note 3 gets
launched so this sounds like an
interesting sperm competition the
question is if HTC does believe that the
HTC One max is going to be as good as
the note 3 and I'm talking about i spent
functionality mostly speaking of
phablets we know that even blackberry is
working on their own and their dubbing
at the a10 and in the past we had some
leaked photographs but we couldn't
really see how big the phone was until
now that we see it on video it's kind of
a small video sadly I can't give you
much details on what to see but it is
clearly big depending on the size of the
hands that are holding it but I just see
a bloated version of blackberry 10 which
is sadly not something good believe it
or now we're going to talk about more
families as we know about the Sony
Honami that phablet is coming up with
aluminum chassis and apparently a 20
megapixel camera but this is really the
hot news apparently the sensor of the
camera is now leaked
it looks significantly different to
every other sensor that we've seen
before and bear in mind sony builds the
smartphone sensors for the cameras of
the iphone 5 4 s all the galaxy lineup
so we do know that they make great
camera technology the question is why is
the sensor so different links in the
description for full details on its
differences and hopefully this is some
new innovation coming to the table so
stay tuned and finally you're not going
to believe this but for the hot news of
the day I left the Moto X but it's not
really about the Moto X we've got this
leaked video from rogers and canada
since apparently they're going to be the
exclusive partner but what's interesting
is that they're demoing a new version of
android which we still don't know if
it's a custom motorola version of
android for the moto x or if this is
android 4.3 or five point no but we've
got two interesting things number one is
that you can call on the phone and turn
it on saying okay Google now just like
you can turn on google glass by saying
ok glass what I think to say okay now
well that does sound funny ok Google now
sounds a little better but other than
that we are getting this new version of
notifications where you do get this
translucent notification area within the
display and not an LED indicator which
we've seen in the palm treo pro years
ago and we also see now in the galaxy
lineup so that leaves you to the
question of the day I mean what do you
think this is do you think this is a
custom version of Android for motorola
or do you believe this is android 4.3 or
five point 0 and if so do you believe
that these two things are good
innovations i believe this is a new
version of android just what the fact
that you could call on google now saying
ok cool now that says a lot but still
it's kind of gimmicky how many times
you're gonna be like ok Google now and
can you imagine somebody across the
table with a moto x doing the same and
turning on your phone leave us a comment
down below what do you think is gonna
happen of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and taco
machine follow was a nail
