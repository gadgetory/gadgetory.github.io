pakka calm and one of the best things
about an Android device is that has a
built-in digital compass so the cool
thing about that is you can get your
location without having to use the GPS
on board so today I'm gonna show you a
program called compass which is pretty
simple but with many different skins and
a few extra features so let's get
started ok so here we are on compass and
actually see we have a few other options
on here we have in actual GPS location
it also gives you our direction
so as you see it uses the magnetic chip
inside of the digital compass to locate
which direction we are traveling so we
can go in down here and we can change
the compass type so I have a few other
options I have all these other ones I'm
not going to show you them all but I
have analog so I can go there and it
looks kind of like the type that you
would use if you were out camping or
whatnot you can also go down here and
change the background so if I want it to
be mesh it's kind of a little more
futuristic there I guess a little more
techy so we can go down here again we
can also go into some of the settings so
I can either display true north or
magnetic north so if I change this it
will show me the true north I can change
the noise filter it's our type sensor
rate display location so if we want it
to display my current location above the
compass I can select that there I can
look change the location text color I
have two choices but it's only green
white so I'm gonna leave it at green and
buffer display include altitude if I
want so I can have the current altitude
of my location include Direction include
address include location include speed
vibrate if I want distance location
speed so there's a lot of options on
this free compass on Android Market so
we're just going to go back and if at
any point I need to calibrate the
compass it wants me to draw a figure 8
another cool feature about this program
is at any point all you have to do with
click nope
location and if you have three banana
loaded on your Android device it will
save it and you can also add a QR code a
picture or whichever thing you want and
just click Save and now your location is
saved so this is another Android Market
pick and the premise called compass and
it is free on Android Market thanks for
watching and if at any time you want to
download this program to your device
just navigate using Google Goggles to
the image of the QR code on the screen
and snap a picture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
