for a device to get forgotten once the
review period is over but there are some
that managed to stand up to the
competition and thus stand the test of
time these are the ones that get the
meaningful designation of daily driver
the pixel to excel is one of those
phones and with the latest edition of
Google smartphone on its way it is time
to take one last look at a phone that I
have always been happy to revisit even
now this is PocketNow and I'm Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody and
this is my pixel 2 XL after the buzz
you'll notice that my phone kind of has
a different coat of paint despite
initially wanting the Panda edition of
the pixel to the black on black version
of the phone was plenty attractive to
use as a daily driver until the short
wayward drop cracked the only part of
the back that is made of glass I've
dropped this phone on a few different
occasions but it only took that one to
change the phone's look for the worse I
was devastated but the power of social
media got me in touch with D Brant who
sent me a skin to cover up the only
blemish my phone has gained over the
course of a year the rest of the phone
has stood up to my daily wear and tear
but it's clear that this is a JV device
you can even see where the pop socket
stuck around for a long time on a
related note while I have always loved
the usability of the smaller pixel - it
was actually never enough to make me
regret having the larger addition as I
said before I was always happy to return
to the pixel to excel over the last year
but right now might be the best time to
enjoy one of the last Android phones to
not feature uh knotch
if the incessant leaks of the pixel 3
are any indication a dip at the top of
the display can be expected pretty much
in every smartphone moving forward and
that's fine but it also made me
appreciate the screen of the pixel to
excel a little bit more for this video I
also did not have any of the big color
issues that some users experienced
during the first few months of the
phone's release while a tiny bit of blue
shift can be observed in my unit at
certain angles it is the only real issue
that I've had with this screen could it
have been more vivid in the colors
absolutely but I still enjoyed all of my
media and all of my games even more
recently released ones and those recent
games are running just fine on the pixel
twos and now outdated hardware carried
by the snapdragon 835 obviously there
are some real games to be had with the
845 in current phones and in the
upcoming pixel 3 but I've had no issues
with performance even one whole year
later it remains one of my more reliable
smartphones I can go back to it whenever
I need my project fy'y sim activated for
travel I can go back to it for the
latest versions of Android and I go back
to it for a reliable camera experience
yep this is Android PI on this
smartphone making it one of the most
fully up-to-date Android phones
currently available part of the reason
why Google back devices are sought-after
is because of that update cycle after
all this 1-year old phone just got a
much-needed refresh due to the release
of hi this might be a good time to give
some hot takes on the new features here
are some things I love the volume
controls appear next to the volume
rocker and even show you different
sliders based on your context when
you're casting something to chromecast
this is really useful also awesome is
the smart rotation button and with the
new digital wellness layer there is a
grayscale screen setting that
accompanies the nightlight which is
great for reading ebooks through apps
like Kindle here are a couple of things
I don't like I'm still getting used to
the full screen gestures and the muscle
memory of the short or long swipes to
bring up the app drawer haven't fully
sunk in and it just feels like a bit
more tuning is needed to make sure the
occasional stutters are ironed out which
should be the case in the new phone so
it should be obvious why being able to
talk about Android 9 on here is
important a good update cycle breathes
new life into a phone that is past its
heyday if you have a pixel - chances are
you aren't feeling the pull of a new
phone quite so hard after the latest
version of Android has dropped but
there's one more reason why you would
feel that way the camera let's take a
second and appreciate the fact that the
pixel 2 remains one of the most reliable
camera experiences without having to
resort to more than one camera on the
rear or the front extra lenses have
their uses don't get me wrong but the
pixel put the power of Google behind
every frame captured that crazy amount
of processing made even low-light
photography digestible shaky footage
easier to salvage and selfies easier to
capture I have taken my pixel to excel
on a number of different trips even in
the last three months using wide-angle
attachments to achieve the looks I want
in good lighting taking some care with
the exposure slider man great photos and
locking it and the focus meant awesome
videos even the slow motion capture
proved great for my vlogs and selfies
were given that portrait mode treatment
with mostly great results the only time
I have seen the
front-facing camera put at odds was due
to the beauty Mouse the pixel 2 doesn't
provide much control over the different
beautification settings and actually
goes for more detail in selfies when
compared to phones coming out of Asia
okay so now might be a good time to
address what the pixel 3 might bring to
the camera table while the rear camera
will remain a single shooter based on
the lakes and based on the actual phone
that was acquired in Hong Kong dual
lenses may actually adorn the front for
the purposes of wide-angle selfies this
strikes me as a good choice while it
might mainly mean more people in your
portraitures it could also mean that
this phone will be a great blogging tool
too many front-facing cameras are too
narrow for vlog so hopefully this does
well in that situation and consequently
becomes a trend
aside from upgraded performance specs it
seems the latest version of the pixel
will be addressing specific needs like
in the front-facing camera the pixel 2
still gets the latest version of Android
and should benefit from many of the app
updates of Google rolls out alongside
the new phone and you know what for that
reason I think if you aren't about the
bleeding edge it might be tough to
recommend an upgrade the pixel 2 is
still very relevant because it seems not
too much will change from 2 to 3 perhaps
the best endorsement I can give is that
the pixel 2 will probably remain in my
drawer forever and if I somehow can't
stay current this would be more than
enough for me to enjoy as always thank
you very much for watching and hope you
enjoyed this edition of after the buzz
based upon my pixel 2 XL are you still
using the pixel 2 let us know in the
comments down below how your phone has
fared did you crack the glass on the
back like I did and how is the
performance holding up after all of your
usage in the past year also let us know
what you think about the leaks and all
of the specifications and everything
that we've heard about the pixel 3 and
to look forward to all of our content on
the pixel 3 and the pixel 3 accel after
their launch which were really excited
to go to there's a lot to look forward
to in the coming week so make sure you
stay tuned to pocket now and if you're
interested in even more perspectives on
all of this tech you can also head over
to my channel youtube.com slash - Joshua
Vergara the links are available right

look forward to a lot of pixel stuff in
the coming weeks but with that I'm gonna
