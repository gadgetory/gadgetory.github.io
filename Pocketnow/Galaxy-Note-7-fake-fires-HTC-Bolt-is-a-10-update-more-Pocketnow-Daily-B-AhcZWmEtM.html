explosions were actually made-up renders
of the HTC volts show was a company
wanting to try it out once again and
rumors points of blackberry leaving the
smartphone business I'm Jaime Rivera and
I explicitly tell my kids not to follow
this t-shirt but they always disobey
this is par get out daily official news
today have to do with deals those of you
wanting to get yourself a good premium
mid Ranger I highly suggest you follow
Amazon right now there's a limited time
deal right now on turn smartphones like
the next with Robin in addition to other
phones like the Moto G 4 plus so again
more details of the Lex will the
spotlight over to Apple those of you
interested in testing the latest and
greatest from iOS well iOS 10.1 beta XS
non-public it was previously only
available for developers advantages
include better battery life I'm not
really having the best battery life on
my iPhone 7 plus review unit but second
to that apparently you also get access
to the portrait mode now I haven't been
able to confirm that's a billable on the
public one I do know that it's available
on the developer 1 so hey give it a try
sorry about some probable set but very
expected news we've got a ton of
analysts already predicting that
Blackberry is going to leave the
smartphone market the reason why
according to them it makes a lot of
sense is because the company has been
hemorrhaging so much money when it comes
to the smartphone division that if the
company continued doing that for the
next three years it would just go kaput
and you have to think about the fact
that BlackBerry has a ton of patents
a ton of other services that keep it
being a profitable company except the
smartphone division so that would make
sense
exactly and now let's talk about Samsung
we do know that the Galaxy Note 7 is now
available on certain retailers certain
carriers and you can also replace your
existing unit which is great
now just to add a little more drama it's
just kind of interesting that Samsung
has just published some information
claiming that 26 of the claims of fires
are actually made up and it's
interesting because even if 26 of these
are made up there is another 75 of these
that
were real so anyways actually and
finally the very hot news did they have
to do with the HTC bolt this is the
codename for a smart phone that we're
assuming will be an exclusive to Sprint
very soon according to Evan blast but
the interesting part here is that we've
got some renders of the phone we see a
move flash but also something you don't
see in the renders that apparently it's
not including a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack and what is it with these companies
like hey you want to move away from the
3.5 millimeter headphone jack fine do it
just give us another USB type-c
connector or another lightning connector
for us to be able to charge the phone
and also listening to music and hey
while we're at it why don't we just head
to the question of the day do you think
that this is a smart move for companies
to start doing this I feel that it's not
how Wan has covered it extensively the
fact that there are really no
improvements but hey leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your iPad
