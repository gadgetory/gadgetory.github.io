now calm and in this video I'm going to
show you a program that can help them
prove one-handed usability the program
is called virtual mouse and in spite
company called innovis soft so devices
like the samsung ethics and the samsung
omnia already have this optical cursor
on the screen so if we turn on the
device and we move our finger around on
the optical d-pad we get a cursor on the
screen and this allows you to kind of
keep your thumb in the same vicinity
rather than having to hold the device
with one hand and tap on the screen with
the other and so the Omni is the same
way and it's it's really important for
the Omni especially because the screen
is so long and it really helps to have
this on screen mouse cursor but what
about other devices well here I've
installed that program virtual mouse on
to the verizon touch and it doesn't work
as well as the epics in the omnia but
what it does is it makes your d-pad into
a kind of up down left right mouse
cursor you see that and you can adjust
the speed and right now it's kind of
slow so let me show you how to make it
faster here's the program settings and
I'm going to just slide to the right the
the speed a lot and now it's much faster
okay and here it is on the HTC touch pro
and it works quite well here as well
although one of the difficult parts are
one of the problems with the touch pro
is that the d-pad is often hard to feel
for but once you get once you get the
hang of it you actually can move around
the screen quite fast and you know if I
take my hand away I can move around
pretty well without actually touching
the screen the biggest con to the
program is that it costs 2495 but it if
one-handed usability is really important
to you then it's probably worth the
price I'll post a link on pocketnow.com
on how to get it and there's a trial
available so you can try before you buy
it that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
