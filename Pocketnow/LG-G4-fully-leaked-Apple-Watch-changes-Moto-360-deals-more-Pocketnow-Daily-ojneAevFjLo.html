need to know about the LG g4 android
games yet another way to unlock your
smartphone and you might get the Apple
watch earlier than you expected I'm hi
meri behna and for some of you the
Monday jokes are getting boring them how
about if I get some suggestions in the
comments down below jokes I mean this is
parking out daily the official news
today obably have to do with sprint a US
carrier mainly because the company is
preparing to launch a new product called
sprint Direct to you way that works is
you pre select the phone that you want
and an employee will go to your home and
will help you set up your phone
completely with everything and will help
you bring all the data from your old
phones of the new one and so many other
things even though this service will
initially be limited to only people that
are upgrading for obvious reasons they
don't want to deal with new customers
that don't want to make up their minds
and lexi this referral details of
everything else the service will do but
you'll have to wait until September for
that to happen next up let's talk about
Google as the company thinks that fish
to unlock is not the only way you should
unlock your smartphone now there is ok
you little trusted voice where ya can
unlock your phone with your voice
obviously not the most secure way to
unlock your phone and we wish that
Google would figure out a way to make
fingerprint scanning sort of a standard
because that is a very good benefit from
iPhones and sort of convoluted and kind
of crazy when it comes to android
devices because of the different
protocols now we still don't know
exactly when the launch to your specific
smartphone but yet the service is there
let us know how many other people with
your same voice were able to unlock your
phone up next startup the Moto 360 that
smart watch that i just recently bought
and that just became extremely
affordable it was a $185 last week in
amazon and best buy and now you get it
for as low as 165 bucks which if you do
the math that's pretty much the same
price for one Apple watch for two moto
360 s with the horween leather band you
pay a little more for the stainless
steel band but yeah you can get a moto
360 now and one for your friend as well
if you didn't want to get the Apple
watch and speaking of the Apple
if you're disappointed over getting your
SmartWatch in June and trust me you are
not alone and it seems that Apple wants
to do something about it it's not
official but apparently to cook add some
conversations with somebody and claim
that the company will do everything it
can to have smartwatches before June but
given the fact that there are no
guarantees for that yeah you can still
return it if you want and finally for
the hot news of the day it seems that an
LG micro site has just leaks everything
we need to know about the LG g4 and no
by the image don't think that this is
the NASA sent phone to this is the LG g4
the company is definitely bringing
different types of backs they're
optional it seems that you can swap the
leatherback option it seems you can swap
to the plastic option and other
different materials that will apparently
be available now one of the confusing
parts about the microsite is that
apparently we're getting two variants of
the g4 what with lesser specifications
as 16 gigs of storage tunings of RAM
another with three gigs of ram 32 gigs
of storage and there are more confusing
portions with the camera we're getting a
13 megapixel shooter in 1 16 megapixel
shooter in the other we don't know if
we're getting the same f 1.8 aperture
lens there's a lot to speculate here but
the the LG event will happen very soon
and it leads me to the question of the
day look at the links in the description
look at the images and tell us what do
you think about the LG g4 is this your
smartphone because in my case yeah I
like it and even brings wireless
charging so yes I do want to get anyone
but it was a comment down below what do
you think friends you know the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video is still mushy follow us our
parking our comment subscribe changing
channel as well you'll follow me on
