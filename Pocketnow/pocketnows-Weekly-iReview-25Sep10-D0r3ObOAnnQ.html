make it to walmart soon ringtone maker
apps are the new thing at the app store
and there are fake jailbreak services
out there that are stealing your
passwords all this and more coming up
right now hello everybody I'm hi another
event and welcome to the pocket nail I
review the show we go through all the
week school and they're not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
as always let's start off with the cool
one of the things we actually caught
ourselves this week was paperwork at
Walmart mentioning a white iphone 4
being released soon no details on dates
or anything all we know for now is that
it's the 16 gigabyte model of the white
iphone 4 being released for 197 dollars
no specifics on anything else again no
dates no nothing let's hope it's not
another verizon iphone rumor of
something that will not be concrete we
never know you know how rumors up
another cool thing happening this week
was Apple filing for two different
patents that are kind of weird one of
them for example was Apple actually
filing for a different type of casing
that can actually allow you to have
multi touch sensors around the phone
meaning for example you're not going to
only have a multi-touch screen from now
on you're also going to have a
multi-touch case that'll allow you to I
don't know grip the phone differently
and give it commands with your fingers
on the back or your fingers on the side
the other patent that came out was for
making an accessory transceiver for ipod
devices meaning well you know about the
spiel gadget that actually turns your
ipod touch into a phone well it's
something like that but the interesting
part is why is Apple doing visit they're
already having a phone could this be the
option that they're going to offer for
other carriers to be able to carry and
ipod touch turn into a phone we never
know let's see what the rumor ends up to
be you know how pens are they take a
long time to be published so let's hope
it's something good from this outcome
eventually another cool thing that's
happening is that as apple continues
loosening up their policies and what
apps can be built in their app store we
all saw the GV connect application that
came for offering google voice last week
GV mobile has finally also been offered
but one of the cool things is happening
also is that Apple's now allowing for
ringtone apps to make it to the App
Store if you remember a couple of weeks
ago it was kind of a hectic when itunes
10 was released and for some reason the
ringtones feature was pulled out from
the iTunes service and well I really
didn't complain about that because for
some I mean paying a dollar for a
ringtone of a song that I already own
and already paid another dollar for was
kind of hilarious kind of stupid so you
know the fact that Apple's actually
allowing ringtone maker apps to come
into the App Store and offer you
different services to get ringtones is
cool because I'm actually getting you
know kind of bored of the marimba
ringtone out there anyway okay so let's
start off with the not so cool one of
the things that really has is concerned
is that there is this jailbreak service
called green poison for the 0 instead of
a no at the end that is actually
offering you an ios jailbreak for
anything over iOS 4.0 point2 and
apparently I'm not really sure they're
charging for it or not but the problem
is you know to be true to you there's
very little possibilities that there is
a real iOS 4.0 point to or above
jailbreak service already available or
at least it's not available from the dev
team just yet or the chronic other death
team out there so beware because
apparently this green poison services
out there to get your passwords and do
something with them you know we're not
sure if they want to sell or actually
use it for piracy we really don't know
so just beware if it's not the iOS 4.0
point to 4.1 or 4.2 jailbreak that we
published where you can actually do this
on the iphone 3gs on the old bootrom
versions I would not considered valid
until we actually post it on our site so
beware be cautious and again if
somebody's actually posting it I don't
think it's true again let's see when
depth team comes up with the real deal
eventually and yes everybody just what
you've been waiting for the iphone
double rainbow app ah I'm not really
going to even comment on this but the
fact is that the guys actually
publishing an iOS app
to allow you to take pictures of
rainbows everywhere meaning you can
actually take a picture of any scene out
there and it'll food two rainbows one on
top of the other just like his uh I
don't know intriguing double rainbow
experience he's actually cashing in on
this because the app is not free it'll
cost you and he's actually having a
contest for the best double rainbow
picture that submitted meaning you'll
get a free t-shirt if you win the
contest I mean talk about the cheapest
prize that everybody could offer I mean
double rainbow guy just quit it i mean
we're over it you've already got your
billion views already i mean just get it
over with or come up with something new
i mean i don't know double sandwiches or
I don't know double iphones for free
that could be cool and for more not cool
new sadly NBC has just confirmed that
they will not be offering TV rounds for
a book on iOS devices and Apple TV why
because they feel that they could charge
more they feel that 199 is actually the
magic number and they already offer the
service on itunes for buys not Reynolds
which I mean to be honest with you who
actually watches an episode more than
once I mean I could actually do it twice
probably a third time and then I'll
probably be bored of it but again
they're saying that it's not really a
good idea they're not going to offer
their services just yet which is
actually bad news because the TV roles
for a buck is it's good i mean i could
feel it would be even better or more
compelling if it were for fifty cents or
something like that but you know the sad
part about this is that we're not going
to get any more services aside from the
ones that are already offered for now i
don't know we'll see what happens
eventually that's it for today's I
