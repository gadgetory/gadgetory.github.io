what about those of you who just don't
want to wait I'm Joe Levi this is pocket
now that's what we're going to talk
about on today's episode of the android
guy weekly other than a very few devices
you're not going to see jelly bean on
well any phones or tablets not
officially anyway officially you might
be able to see it on some Galaxy Nexus
you might see it on some galaxy 7s the
new 7-inch tablet from google that's
about it unofficially however there are
a few more devices that you can see it
on particularly Galaxy Nexus that didn't
come with it already installed or didn't
get it OTA for example me I've got it
running on mine works just great there
are some rough edges let's call them
Google was up front and they said this
is a developer preview release and that
it is to top that off i also then have
it kind of hacked and slashed and cooked
and it's not official let's just put it
that way so what can you do to get ready
well there are really two things number
one well two things to consider not two
steps number one do you want to root
your phone and get a custom rom if
you've already done that great you're in
the second group if not then you may
want to consider waiting if you've got
one of the newer phones i'll leave that
up to your imagination if you do or not
you might want to hold out for an update
from your manufacturer your carrier to
get jelly bean on your phone if you're
in that second group you we have already
rooted you've already unlocked your
phone all of that fun stuff then why not
go ahead and get a custom rom if there's
one available if there's not there will
be if you're in the first group now is a
good chance for you to kind of jump over
that fence you don't have to do it right
away so for example you can go ahead and
unlock and root your phone and continue
to run the
on that you've got on it just fine be
advised some unlocking procedures do
wipe your phone so bear that in mind
before continuing but go ahead and get
the foundation all laid so that you can
flash ROM when it comes out cyanogenmod
10 no it's not going to be 9.1 cm10 is
going to be jelly bean now jelly bean
hasn't been released to the AOSP yet so
you're not going to get it from the AOSP
yet cyanogenmod is an AOSP distro they
can't even start on it until probably
mid July that's the date that Google
through around when they were announcing
jelly bean everybody else you've got
ports ports either from the SDK the
emulator don't do that one that's bad
it's an emulator it's bad you don't want
that one okay and then moving right
along you've got stuff that's been
converted from the OTA updates the OTA
or over-the-air updates have been coming
down to the devices that came out at
Google i/o and then they've been
modified and ported to various other
devices right now the first devices they
started with of course or or Galaxy
Nexus like I have that aren't running
the special version of ice cream
sandwich that came out at Google i/o so
you can't just do it in place over the
air update or a kind of a patchwork
update you've got to do some other stuff
so I've got a deodexed pre routed all
that fun stuff that I showed you how to
do on the video it works great that's
going to be coming to your phone in all
likelihood again if it's a recent and
more popular phone all you've got to do
is keep your eye out on pocket now will
tell you when there's new stuff coming
out and you can go ahead and do that I
know that's two options but there's a
third the third option is stick with
what you've got what do I mean by that
you still want jelly bean features and
functionality but without the entire
operating system on your phone you can
get bits and pieces of the operating
system like the the Google
now you can get that you can get updated
keyboards you might even be able to get
an updated launcher you just have to
wait for someone to rip it out make it
work on your OS and release it whether
that's through xda-developers routes
wiki or through an official distribution
in the play store again watch pocket now
calm as those come up we will give you
links and instructions on what you need
to do to get those bits and pieces from
jelly bean running on your non jelly
bean phone there you go if you've got
questions head over to pocketnow.com
make sure you leave them down in the
comments and everybody who has an answer
to that question a viable one go ahead
and answer back and participate I'll be
doing that as well so we can get the
questions that you have answered as
quickly as possible one question I'll
answer right up front when is cm10
coming out i'm going to give you their
answer when it's ready for pocket now
talking jelly bean i'm joe levi
