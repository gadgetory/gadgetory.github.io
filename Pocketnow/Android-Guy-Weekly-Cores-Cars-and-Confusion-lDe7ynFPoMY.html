are some quad core chips not performing
as fast as some of their older non quad
core chips in today's modern tablets and
smartphones that's a very complex topic
but we'll try and scratch the surface in
today's android guy weekly okay so let's
start with a couple misconceptions first
of all megahertz and gigahertz aren't
everything they help but they're not
going to influence your speed as much as
chip architecture second cores doesn't
matter if it's dual core tricor quad
core heptachlor doesn't really matter
cores help with one specific thing and
not for general everyday stuff and I
know that's just made a whole bunch of
you bristle but hang on with me okay so
let's go back and talk about topic
number one the first thing we've got is
megahertz oh the megahertz myth the
faster you run something the better it
is that's that's the myth and it really
is a myth the faster you run something
doesn't necessarily translate into the
faster you get things done in fact
especially when we're talking about
Mobile smartphones in particular tablets
a little bit less because I've got such
a big battery in comparison ultrabooks
notebooks netbooks all that stuff the
faster you run something the more power
it takes the more heat it puts off and
the more battery life gets sucked down
when you're trying to do that with a big
asterisk there okay that big asterisk is
to combat that energy-sucking heat
creating run it faster run it faster you
have make it smaller the smaller you can
make a chip or an entire system
generally speaking the less heat it puts
out and the faster you can run it the
less power it takes all that stuff so if
you want to go faster you've got to make
it smaller if you make it smaller well
there
other things that you run into there but
that's the gist of it you combat your
heat you can bat your power consumption
by making things smaller look at the
chips that we have today I mean they're
the size of a thumbnail and they'll do
what we were doing with desktop
processors that were how big were they
size of a silver dollar just a few years
ago it's ridiculous how small we've
gotten and how efficient we've gotten
things and it really really is great hey
so that's that's kind of that the
megahertz myth that comes into a special
importance let's say when we're talking
about mobile devices because when when
you're on mobile megahertz and gigahertz
aren't as important as battery life and
efficiency now I don't know if you've
ever done this or not but if you've got
if you've got a phone or a tablet that
will let you go in and look at the
processor speed usually that means
you've unlocked it and you might even be
running a custom rom or a custom kernel
at the very least but you can actually
look and see how fast your processor is
running now unfortunately it's not going
to let you do it all the time there are
some apps that put a little water mark
up that shows you you know how fast is
your processor running when it's doing
process X Y or Z but most of the time
you're just opening up the app and
you're looking at it and seeing it it's
idle state and that in fact is kind of
indicative my galaxy nexus which is
sitting right back there usually runs at
about 350 megahertz now I turn it on I
look at it and 350 megahertz whoa what's
going on here it's a dual-core 1.2 why
is it only running at 350 megahertz so
here's what I'm talking about this is my
phone and it's right now running at 350
megahertz it's got an interactive
governor I believe which means it's
going to scale up and down as necessary
and there you see it just scaled up to
700 and back down to 350 so it's not
doing enough right now that I really
need any more processing power than 350
megahertz so why would we want to have a
1.2 well there are K
is where I need a 1.2 and what I'm doing
really graphics intensive stuff video
decoding being really core among those
no pun intended there but when I'm doing
video decoding I've got not only video
which this is an HD screen so that
requires quite a bit just because of the
raw number of pixels they're also the
frame rate that's coming in at 29 30
frames per second and then I've got
audio that I need to decode as well well
that's an awful lot of stuff if we just
count it up there's the operating system
and all the idle stuff that goes on in
the background the video decoding and
the audio decoding and then the
displaying of that and the playing back
of the sound well it sounds like six or
eight things and in that case it makes
sense then really helps out to have
multiple cores that I can split all of
these processes across you remember way
long ago when you were watching stuff
that you're streaming well you'd watch
the video and it would sputter and
hesitate and a lot of times people
thought that was a problem with their
bandwidth with their connection speed
and sure a lot of times it was but even
more people didn't realize this it was
because their system their processor and
ram and and the whole thing working
together couldn't keep up with the
demands that we're putting on it so the
audio would be choppy or the video would
drop frames so it could keep up with all
of it because it just didn't have enough
power to run it all at the speed that it
needed to to be nice and smooth and well
smooth and buttery like we know ice
cream sandwich is supposed to be so
let's look at another analogy here okay
let's say I've got a really
fuel-efficient commuter car you know I
don't drive very very far I don't drive
it on the freeway I just drive it on the
surface streets it's a three cylinder
doesn't have that great of a
transmission doesn't have that great of
a suspension or handling or whatnot but
it gets me where I need to go fabulous
well let's say that this car
manufacturer wants things to go even
faster they want to appeal to a bigger
group of people that are honestly
they're buying their competitors car
because holy crap that one's fast well
what do they do they take out that in
line three cylinder
engine they replace it with a v6 oh no
no no let's go even more than that let's
do a v12 so they put a v12 in the same
chassis in the same car you got the same
size gas tank you've got the same tires
the same suspension the same
transmission everything it's the same as
the old car just a bigger engine now
what's going to happen here sure now you
can go well let's go back to our analogy
first if I'm getting to work I can get
to work driving 30 miles an hour I can
get to work driving 120 miles an hour of
course when I'm doing 120 I'm gonna get
there faster right but I can still get
there doing 30 and well maybe when I'm
driving on the road it's during rush
hour and I'm not even topping out at 30
miles an hour I'm 2015 who knows what
but I can't even max out my little
commuter car so why would I want to have
this super fancy car with a v12 or even
a commuter car with a v12 I'm not going
to be able to take advantage of it well
that's one scenario but let's go back to
the car now in order for me to go 120
miles an hour I have to have an
infrastructure that's built to support
that I have to have good roads hey my 30
mile commuter car works just fine on
dirt roads which I don't drive on dirt
roads by the way but you get the point
there to do 120 you've got to have
better roads you got to have a better
Road base you got to bet have better
better pavement you know less potholes
your curves have to be smoother and
wider rather than you know tight curves
you can do it lower speeds you might
have to bank the terms or the curves to
be able to keep the car on the road
you've got to have ways for other people
to get onto the road and off of the road
very smooth and fluidly you know no stop
signs here on this street okay so in
this analogy the infrastructure is the
apps it's the operating system it's all
the stuff that we're running on the
architecture on the chips and whatnot so
if we don't have apps if we don't have
an operating system that takes advantage
of and really exploits all the been
it's of in this case multi-core
processors or in our other case you know
the super fast car it doesn't do us any
good it's driving a Ferrari in Main
Street during rush hour just doesn't
make it looks nice sure hey about that
but it's not going to do what the car
was designed to do so back over here if
we have our our super cool souped-up
commuter car with a v12 in it it's just
not going to work right you put that
next to the Ferrari on the Autobahn and
that poor little car is probably going
to blow itself to pieces because it just
can't handle it all but that's kind of
what we're doing so what do I mean here
let's switch back over to technology the
cortex a9 processor is a good processor
it's been around for a while and when I
say the processor I mean the
architecture because lots of people
license that architecture and build
their own chip based off of it some
people are even whoa making quad core
systems out of it it really wasn't
designed to do a quad core just like our
commuter car wasn't designed to do v12
but they're doing it and it works and
they've done a little bit better job
than I did making my commuter card
because I haven't seen any of them
explode yet probably won't but what
we've got there is still kind of an
older technology well let's come over to
the a-15 a 15 is newer technology it's
faster it's smaller it's got all of
these added benefits that the a9 never
had but all these companies have been
busy building on top of the a9 with more
cores and whatnot that they haven't been
able to keep up to speed or keep up to
date rather with the a-15 technology so
an 8-15 quad-core hey that'd be awesome
but everybody's building a 9 quad cores
because it takes a while to bring one of
those to market you with me ok so that's
kind of answers the question and this
was sent in by one of our viewers why is
a quad core a9 so much slower than an a
15 well it's because the a-15 was
designed differently it was designed for
the new roads
that those smartphones and those tablets
are running on whereas it's kind of more
of a marketing gimmick to put multiple
cores on to an older architecture you
know that a nine and what not so what
about the Tegra 3 the Tegra 3 is amazing
it's awesome we saw all kinds of of
demos and benchmarks and holy schmoly
that thing just blew everything away but
in practice not so much why is that
while the benchmarks and and all the
demos that we were shown were optimized
to run on that Tegra and all the stuff
that's out there right now is not it's
optimized to run on everything that it
can run on if you are an app developer
what would you rather do do you rather
have one app that runs on everything and
by everything I mean we're talking what
18 gazillion I think is the number of
Android users out there so 18 gazillion
people are buying your app for a dollar
so now you're an 18 gazillionaire who
sends them over that to me I'm Joe the
android guy over pocketnow.com if you
anyway so when you're on the other side
you can make your appt super awesome
with bells and whistles galore and run
it on a Tegra 3 and make it look
fabulous amazing awesome but you've only
got 13 people that are running it so now
if all 13 of those people buy it you
make $13 go out and grab a nice lunch so
you see you see where I'm going with
this we need to have common a common
infrastructure we need to have a common
core we need to make sure that the cars
that are running on our roads all can
run on the roads efficiently and well
but when we need performance the
performance is there the marketing
gimmick is more cores more of course
have their place they do help you take
that Ferrari out on the track and you're
going to love it but when you're
commuting in it not so much but when
going with more advanced chips you know
the a-15 we're getting some advantages
there that you might not have by just
going with an a 9 quad-core Tegra 3 is
somewhere between those it's
not really yeah it's it's own thing it
has its own challenges and it's trying
to compete in this this whole ecosystem
that already exists it's doing pretty
darn good but it still has room to
really take advantage of what it can do
we need to have more apps out there that
can take advantage of it just like we
need to have more racetracks out there
more autobahns out there to take
advantage of that Ferrari so I hope that
makes a lot of sense maybe just a little
bit of sense for you analogies between
cars and computer chips don't really
hold up all the time but it kind of
helps communicate the differences
between them because more people
understand car engines and understand
you know computer architecture at least
I think so maybe not if that's not the
case let me know in the comments okay
now a lot of this stuff has been
generalized not specific so I know that
there are some some technical
inaccuracies between what I've said in
the a9 a-15 the Tegra 3 and whatnot but
for the case of making things simpler
for more people to understand that's why
I've presented them the way that I have
if there's something that you just can't
stand that I said that you think was
just completely wrong or would like to
clarify again please leave a comment
down below use the time mark so we can
go back and I'll reference that did you
know that on YouTube you can put like
one call in one for space whatever and
it'll hyper that hyperlink that to that
particular point in the video yes you
can do that on youtube so you guys who
are watching the video over a pocket now
you can comment down below but of course
you've got to take advantage of a hyper
linking to the time over on the YouTube
comments so about that this kind of
wrapped up three user comments into one
relatively long video I apologize for
that guys but they were also similar so
related that I thought I'd just lump
them all together the point that I want
to make here is the the inspiration for
this video came from you it didn't come
from me it didn't come from anyone over
at pocket now this came for you this
pocket cast is for you I said pocket
cast we don't even have that anymore the
android guy weekly is for you that's why
we put so much emphasis on the comments
we want you to comment we want you to
contribute we want
you to ask questions we want you to send
in recommendations for upcoming episodes
I know we can't get to every single one
in this case we got to about three of
them and for those that sent them in
thank you you know who you are I
appreciate it fabulous topic just so in
depth that I hope I did it justice and I
hope I answered your questions for you
it's that good all right leave your
comments thumbs up the video if you
liked it thumbs up the video even if you
didn't like it and thumbs up the video
if you like fast cars and car analogies
I think I covered everybody out there
head over to pocketnow.com so you can
read the article relating to this video
and to get up to date on news tips
tricks solutions everything that you
would want not just for Android but for
all of the major os's smartphones and
tablets I'll like four pocket now and
the android guy weekly i'm joe levi
