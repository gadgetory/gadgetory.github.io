Samsung Galaxy s5 each represents some
of the best its platform has to offer
and each is available on America's
largest network for about the same price
if you're due for a new phone and you're
on the fence which should you choose
ultimately that decision is yours and
yours alone
but we're here with some information to
help make it easier I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and this is Samsung
Galaxy s5 vs Nokia Lumia icon just a
quick note folks the Lumia icon is a
Verizon Wireless exclusive here in the
United States but it's functionally very
similar to the Lumia 930 available
globally so use this comparison as a
loose surrogate for that faceoff if
you're outside the US also we've already
given each of these devices the full
review treatment so if you want more
detail check out those reviews at the
links down the description and please
subscribe to us both here on YouTube and
on social media to keep up with the
latest from pocket now if you're
shopping on specs each of these
represents the creme de la creme of its
respective platform for CPUs you can't
get much powerful than the Snapdragon
808 o1 and 2 gigs of ram is plenty in
each case here in the States the icon
edges out the galaxy s5 in onboard
storage but the Samsung phone offers
microSD expansion while Nokia does not
Samsung's larger battery is also
removable it's USB port is faster and it
has many more sensors than the icon
including a fingerprint scanner and a
heart rate monitor the displays are the
same resolution they run on the same
technology and they're about the same
size but the Samsung panel can be made
much brighter and also much dimmer on
top of all that the galaxy s5 casing
keeps out dust and it's water-resistant
so if you're looking for the ultimate
combination of specs and customization
as always it's tough to beat the galaxy
but that feature load comes at a cost to
quote our own review observation from a
design standpoint the plastic galaxy s5
seems to have been engineered to avoid
offending surprising or
really moving anyone it just kind of
exists whereas the icon definitely makes
a statement its corners are aggressively
squared off it's aluminum sides adorned
with bold racing stripes its display
glass curved at the edges like a puddle
of liquid about to spill over the sides
it's heavier thicker and frankly less
comfortable to hold than the galaxy s5
but it also conveys a much stronger
sense of quality and craftsmanship it's
got four microphones for audio recording
and noise cancellation built-in qi
wireless charging and most importantly
it uses a nano SIM instead of the
galaxy's older micro sim okay maybe
that's not so important so let's talk
about something that is the camera ready
for a shocker
turns out Samsung 16 megapixel sensor is
no slouch and holds its own against the
icons 20 megapixel PureView shooter
under quite a few lighting conditions
this is surprised because the Lumia line
is known for its optical performance and
that's not just because of the dedicated
shutter key Nokia's PureView technology
is supposed to deliver superior output
and it certainly does but under
automatic settings we actually found
ourselves preferring the Galaxy s5s
pictures quite often as they're more
colourful and seem more alive under a
lot of conditions
Nokia's edge comes in low-light start
experimenting with indoor and dimly lit
environments and the contest just goes
out the window the icons camera is
optically stabilized so it can better
compensate for hand movements which is a
big deal if you're taking a long
exposure shot to let in more light the
galaxy s5 can't do that and as a result
the Gulf and performance is quite wide
in near pitch black conditions
the Lumia accomplishes much more with a
much cleaner interface if you really
want to kick up the resolution and shoot
19 megapixel images and RAW format you
can do so or you can manipulate ISO and
shutter speed to warp time which we did
with this 2.5 second exposure of a car
going down the street at night more
casual Lumia users can also keep it set
to standard and expect to get great
results more often
not the icons optical stabilization
comes in handy for video as well despite
its software stabilization the galaxy s5
really can't deal with any kind of hand
movement during video recording as
happens if you're panning around a lot
or just on a windy day but again the s5
surprises us here its colors may not be
as accurate but the slight over
saturation looks pretty good and the
aggressive audio cancellation on the
icon means our test audio can't really
be heard over the wind many times even
with those four mics a whole lot of wind
coming from my right hand side the bus
is heading in the direction of the wind
were checking auto-exposure considering
the galaxy s5 can also shoot in high
speed for slow motion playback and can
shoot Stills and video underwater well
the camera comparison is no shutout
we'll put it that way in software the
gulf between the icon and the galaxy s5
could not be wider aesthetically and
functionally these are black and white
Star Trek and Star Wars Google and
Microsoft and so we're not spending much
time talking about them not just because
that would take twenty minutes that we
don't have but because deciding what
platform you prefer is not an
afterthought Windows Phone or Android is
an entirely different question on its
own but if you need a quick summation
will say this the software story mirrors
the hardware situation samsung will give
you almost every feature you can think
of wrapped in a fairly complex visually
inconsistent experience but it's one you
can change with a custom launcher nokia
gives you an elegant simple and very
responsive user interface but one with
very little customized ability and
nowhere near as extensive an ecosystem
using these devices on separate networks
meant we couldn't directly compare
things like reception and voice quality
though for what it's worth both Verizon
Wireless and AT&amp;amp;T offered outstanding
coverage and good data speeds in the
Greater Boston area on 4G despite the
difference in battery capacity
endurance is comparable though the icon
doesn't feature the ultra power saving
mode of the galaxy s5 and once again you
can't swap its battery like you can on
the Samsung phone and this speaker
performance is also comparable loud
enough but nothing to get too excited
about considering the rear firing
loudspeakers on each device
we often say this but that's because
it's often true either where you go here
you're getting a variation on the best
each platform has to offer so no one
should be returning a phone or
regretting a purchase based on this
comparison still the differences here
are legion on paper the s5 is definitely
the winner it's a much more versatile
more powerful device from a few
perspectives some of them truly
surprising to us while neither its
hardware or software will be winning any
beauty contests it'll probably get the
job done for you whatever that job may
be especially if you're deeply dependent
on Google's ecosystem or you need a
smartphone that can handle a little
rough and tumble action near the
seashore but where the galaxy s5 is a
sturdy utility vest
the Lumia is more like an expensive
dinner jacket more limited yes but also
much more regal more polished well it
doesn't do as much unless you're a heavy
office or outlook user the things it
does it does with almost liquid
smoothness and it looks great doing them
also though it's camera didn't destroy
the s5 by any means it still offers more
tools and capabilities for photographers
who want more control over their photos
or for those of you who spend most of
your time in the darkness so where do
your priorities lie which would you buy
let us know tell us which one appeals
more to you down in the comments and
