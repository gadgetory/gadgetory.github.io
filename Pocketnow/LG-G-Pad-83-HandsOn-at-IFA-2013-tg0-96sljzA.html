in Berlin at the LG boosie diba and we
are giving you looks empty LG G pad 8.3
let's check it out if you mistake this
with the LG g2 you are right this looks
like an LG g2 which is not a bad thing
this is Shelly and this feels like
summer premium tablet because of the
aluminum on the back which you can see
it is real aluminum that blends in with
the white plastic surrounding it of
course this is the white version there's
also a black version which we don't have
here but you can know exactly how the
black one looks the aluminum is a little
bit darker this is natural aluminum what
the other one is anodized coming up to
the front this screen is an eight-point
green screen with 1200 x 1920 resolution
this is a first on a tablet on this
perfecter says LG and under the screen
there is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
processor clocked at 1.7 gigahertz aided
by two gigabytes of ram 16 gigabytes of
internal storage can be extended by a
microSD card slot right here up and
ended up and while we're here we should
mention that the camera is made out of
LED flash but a 5 megapixel shooter
paired with a 1.3 megapixel webcam on
the front unfortunately it's not for 23
and not the upcoming fourth quarter to
two android version running on this and
of course with LG's own custom UI which
brings a couple of new things and it
also borrows a couple of features from
the LG g2 for instance we not on and not
off I cannot demonstrate because
automatically otay but we'll play the
demo but you get the idea once your
tablet is locked you can double tap to
wake it up and double tap well if
I'm fast enough
in this case I am also the queue
applications the queue mono the accused
light are all known for previous LG
products QP results or something
interesting you can receive
notifications from your phone directly
on your day but probably the most
interesting feature is slide aside which
you know from the LG g2 for instance if
you fire up gallery and you swipe with
three fingers to the left you open up
for instance calendar same thing sliding
to the left and then another replication
which could be your email application
slide away to the left and well not this
one but you get the idea once you slide
back with three fingers we have your
applications and you can of course
easily tap on whichever you desire and
you can of course either click on the X
button to kill it or swipe up which is
very webos ish but now since LG owns
webos we can understand the feature so
this is a very quick look at the LG G
pad 8.3 iben anton coming to you from
fifa lgb michael behind the camera thank
you very much for watching comparison
coming up stage how long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
