year or so to some of their competitors
Samsung Motorola and others they're
trying to reclaim their crown with their
new one series of devices with the one
series they hope to regain a new
software experience better hardware
quality and choice so your choices are
the one V the value model the one s the
model that we'll review now and the 1x
their new flagship so the question is is
the HTC one s a good choice for you
let's go find out like others in the HTC
One family the 1s comes in a recycled
paper box it feels cheap and it touts
its environmental friendliness with
packaging from renewable sources which
is printed with soy based ink and is
100% recyclable and biodegradable the
box is wrapped in a simple but elegant
sleeve which highlights the phone on the
front and includes specifications on the
back lifting the lid you'll find the
phone with protective films on the front
and back a few manuals a micro USB cord
european-style power adapter and tangle
free headphones sadly they're not Beats
headphones but they do the job the phone
has an aluminum unibody construction
it's cool to the touch and it feels
hefty without feeling heavy it feels
like a quality device something that
we're missing in today's smartphones the
power button is on the top and a large
volume rockers on the right side on the
top is a three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack and on the right is the
microUSB port the top and the bottom of
the device have dual microphones one for
your voice the other for noise
cancellation the front of the phone has
a very nice looking speaker which hides
the notification LED which is near the
left to the right is a front-facing VGA
camera on the rear is an 8 megapixel
camera with one LED flash which can
record 1080p videos at 30 frames per
second ironically the video app is only
set
to record a qHD from the factory what
that means is if you want to get 720 or
even 1080p recording you're going to
have to go into the settings and
manually increase it while that's not a
problem it's curious so we recorded a
couple videos to see why they set it
that way is there some kind of
technological reason to it we couldn't
find any so you may want to just go
ahead and bump that up to 1080p right
away a few of the features that we like
in the HTC camera app include the
ability to take still shots while you're
filming video but this usually results
in a jitter in the video due to poking
the screen with your finger the still
camera has a burst mode that will take
continuous shots while you're holding
down the shutter button when you release
it you're asked to pick the best picture
and all the others are deleted the still
and video cameras share the same
viewfinder so you don't have to wait
while you switch from one mode to the
other what don't we like about the
camera
there's no panorama mode like there is
with other Android 4.0 devices and video
recording can take a full second or two
after the shutter sound before it
actually starts recording the camera is
good for both still and video but it's
not great
most people will be entirely satisfied
with it but the HTC One S won't replace
your high-end camera or your SLR inside
the phone is a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with 1
gigabyte of RAM and 16 gig of storage
space a little over nine of which is
available to you unfortunately there is
no microSD card so you can't expand that
if you want HTC addressed that by
including 25 gig of Dropbox storage for
free for two years that does mean that
you're going to have to be connected to
the Internet to use a lot of that stuff
and it means that after 2 years you're
going to have to start paying for that
additional storage we use the usual
benchmarking utilities to measure the
phone's speed the results were some of
the fastest we've ever seen quadrant
topped out above 50-100 did that
translate into a snappy experience when
using the phone we'll come back to that
in a minute the HTC One S is well
so how does it do with basic phone tasks
the 1s takes a GSM micro SIM which is
easily accessible through the removable
panel on the top of the phone since this
is a European phone it's not locked we
were able to get both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile
Sims working just fine though data
speeds through t-mobile were limited to
edge battery life was quite acceptable
lasting solidly through the day but
requiring a charge to be able to make it
through the evening so how does the HTC
One S fare as a smart phone
after all it's based on Android for
specifically Android 4.0.3 which is Ice
Cream Sandwich and then HTC went and
laid since over the top of it it's more
intuitive than ever before it's less
in-your-face and more refined around the
edges speed has also been improved but
not enough and rather than using Ice
Cream Sandwich is task switcher like the
one Vee does the 1s sheds the stock
Android Ice Cream Sandwich tests with
your UI for a more webOS like 3d panel
switcher thing sure it looks nice but
it's significantly slower and adds extra
hesitation in time to something that's
supposed to be really really quick
pinching on the home panels however is
quick and it brings up the traditional
leap screen that we're accustomed to
with other HTC Sense phones it not only
lets you jump to another panel really
quickly but it lets you add and remove
panels as well and is very intuitive
adding icons and widgets to the screen
however there's a little bit different
than what we're used to and it's a
little bit laggy the HTC One S comes
with Beats Audio you don't have to do
anything to take advantage of it if
you're listening through the front
speaker or even the included headphones
Beats Audio doesn't do much for you at
all just plug into a quality speaker and
you're good to go
bass was deep high notes were clean it
sounded nothing short of beautiful Beats
Audio definitely had something to do
with that since one of the major things
that we do with our smart phones is
surfing the web how does the HTC One has
to do with web surfing let's fire up
pocketnow.com
on both the HTC One S and the Galaxy
Nexus both
connected via Wi-Fi using 802 11 n
notice how quick the 1s renders the page
and how smooth scrolling is the Galaxy
Nexus isn't bad but the 1s is definitely
better the HTC One S is a good sized
phone but it does a really good job not
feeling big or bulky but how does it
compare to some of the other bigger
phones as far as size goes the 1s is a
little thinner than the Galaxy Nexus and
just a bit thicker than the Droid Razr
screen sizes are about the same though
the 1s has a qHD screen whereas the
Galaxy Nexus is 720p HD that said text
was just as readable on the 1s colors
were sharp and vivid and the viewable
area actually looks a little bit bigger
on the 1s because of its translucent
status bar
unfortunately the 1s sheds the Ice Cream
Sandwich soft buttons for capacitive
buttons that we've become accustomed to
with pre Ice Cream Sandwich phones
that's not really a problem and they
work really really well except when you
launch apps that have a menu button in
that case all the space that you just
saved is now taken up by one menu button
overall the HTC One S is a fabulous
phone with great specs it does really
really well in the benchmarks but it
doesn't really play out well when you're
using HTC Sense it slows things down
where they should be fast and responsive
it's a bigger phone but it doesn't feel
big and bulky so it gives you plenty of
on screen real estate without getting an
awful lot of bulk in your pocket overall
we love the phone but we've got to give
it a 3.5 out of 5 stars for the little
bit of lag enos that is well everywhere
and the few other nuances that we noted
throughout the review if you liked this
video make sure you give it a thumbs up
