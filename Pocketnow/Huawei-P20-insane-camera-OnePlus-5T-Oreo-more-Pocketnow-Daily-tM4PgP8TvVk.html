it teases an insane camera that we've
never seen one plus five teen users
should expect a very important software
update coming soon and legal entities go
after Apple for throttling iPhone
performance without alerting customers
i'm Heineman rivera i'm reporting from a
flooded city that's pretty much
surrounding the studio it doesn't stop
raining so it might be a little noisy
but this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with the 1 + 5
t for those of you that have been
waiting for the android oreo update for
the Spohn me particularly it has
reaching phones today so yeah it's gonna
take a little while for it to deploy
meaning it probably won't reach your
device today probably tomorrow or in the
next few days so stay tuned for that and
you know on the other side for those of
you still waiting for that oreo update
on the essential phone we just got word
that that's going to have to wait for an
undisclosed amount of time but
apparently it would only be a few weeks
now let's talk about google search and
there's actually a Google home here in
the room so if I say the hot word it's
gonna launch itself so let's avoid that
you know the drill but think about it as
apparently Google is going to implement
new ways to call on it not just ok or
hey you will actually be able to
customize it in a future update that
we're not exactly sure when but
apparently that's not the only of that
there are a few extra commands that are
coming you can learn more about them in
the description
okay so vive wasn't really in our radar
up until the company implemented the
whole fingerprint scanner in the display
recently and the reason why we're going
to cover this new phone that's mainly
gonna probably be based in China is
because the specs are insane
we've got sources claiming that there's
this vivo x7 play and what makes it
special is that apparently we'll have
somewhere between the Snapdragon 835 or
8:45 we still have to confirm that but
listen to this 10 gigabytes of RAM 512
gigs of storage and apparently it'll
have a 4k display now I know 4k displays
are possible the 512 gigs of storage
were also announced recently but 10
gigabytes of mobile
that's something that I still haven't
been able to confirm let's see if they
pull it off there is no possible launch
date though now let's talk about Apple
as the company continues to get some bad
publicity when it comes to its practice
of throttling phones to perserve battery
as we hear now both the DOJ and the SEC
are after Apple over explanations of why
the company did what it did and
apparently it's necessarily over the
practice of thawing that makes
scientific sense the problem is why did
the company not tell consumers what it
was doing so let's see how that drama
ends up at some point and finally
believe it or not the hottest news today
for the first time ever will belong to
wall way as the company has just sent
out invitations for an event in Paris on
March 27th so definitely it's not going
to happen in that WC it's gonna happen
later we hear it's going to be about the
Huawei P 20 and the company says that it
doesn't take photos it makes them and
the teaser and here's the thing the
rumors that we have for the P 20 are
significant we're talking about the Cure
970 that's great we're talking about a
better facial recognition feature than
what's on the iPhone 10 I'd like to see
that but even most interesting a triple
lens a 40 megapixel camera with 5x
hybrid zoom that has never been done to
my knowledge and I cover the news all
the time for years that sounds awesome
but it leads me to the question today I
mean you know that Huawei has been
taking photography seriously since the
p9 I believe it is so what do you think
would this make you buy a Huawei
p-series the new approaches the camera
because in my case I'll tell you this
much I love the companies approach to
monochrome photography and color
photography as well so I would but there
are a few things missing on Huawei
phones like audio quality for example
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion now let's talk
about Google search as for those of you
that are tired of saying okay Google
which is actually the newer way to say
it
