to take a look at the sprint samsung
moment which will launch for one hundred
eighty dollars on november first with
android 1.5 first we're going to take a
look at the device into an unboxing and
then we're going to go ahead and do a
hardware tour so let's go ahead and do
the unboxing so let's go ahead and open
the box and see what's inside at the top
here you have the sprint samsung moment
which we're going to set aside for just
a second lift up the trade we have a
u.s. are a USB charger which plugs into
your wall and it looks like this is an
energy star compliant charger which
means it will use less power when it's
idle and not plugged into your device
you have a USB to micro USB sync cable
for your computer headphone stereo
headphones with a microphone and a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
audio jack and you have a stack of
manuals with a getting started guide on
the front and it looks like sprint also
included their recycling back so you can
send in your old phone and you have a a
SD card which is a microsd adapter so
let's go ahead and set aside all the
accessories and do a hardware tour of
the sprint samsung moment the device has
a 3.2 inch glass AMOLED display which is
capacitive touch it is powered by an 800
megahertz Samsung arm11 chip let's go
ahead and take a look at the back of the
device first it has a 3.2 megapixel
camera with an LED flash and speakers
here on the bottom pop out the battery
cover underneath you have a battery and
a microSD card which holds up 22 gigs
although you can replace that with up to
a 32 gigabyte
SD card although 16 is what is supported
on the market right now you have volume
up and down switch on the left side of
the device at the top here you have the
lanyard hole you have the
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack which is covered by a rubber flap
on the right side of the device you have
a camera hardware button on the bottom
here you have the voice control shortcut
button and the micro USB charging port
which is also covered by a rubber flap
on the front of the device you have a
home button menu and back button which
is built into the capacitive touchscreen
which is an AMOLED display you have also
the call send and end button and an
optical trackpad in the middle here you
also have a keyboard which slides out on
the keyboard actually feels good it has
a good tactile feel and the keys are
domed and nicely spaced out some
annoying features here is that the
spacebar key is actually built into the
bottom roll with the rest of the letter
keys but you do have a dedicated row of
number keys and a search shortcut button
here the AP is actually squished in
further than the Z key because of the
function key next to it the keyboard
actually glows a nice blue color in the
dark the device also has an
accelerometer so that it can
automatically rotate when you're in the
browser mode this is a google experience
phone is marked on the back with the
google logo so it doesn't have the
customizations offered on other android
devices like the HTC hero which is also
on sprint's network the HTC hero
actually has a 27 home screens whereas
this only has three home screens on the
device as she has great haptic
feedback when you're in the keyboard
mode and you do have an on-screen
keyboard so let's go ahead and navigate
to the pocket now homepage it has a
satisfying click sound and also a
satisfying on-screen feedback
so unlike phones like the HTC hero which
has the sense UI the google experience
doesn't have some of the nifty gestures
that are supported such as the double
tap to zoom or the pinch and zoom
capability capabilities like on the
iphone mb palm pre instead what Google
has is that you have the zoom in and out
button on the bottom of the screen here
and you can also pan around as well so
let's go back to the home screen and
let's see some of the programs that the
moment comes bundled with comes with all
the typical Google Android applications
and sprint also included a couple of
useful applications they've included the
typical NASCAR NFL sprint navigation and
sprint TV apps you also get the nuance
voice control application so you can
make calls and send text messages from
your phone so you can actually command
your phone to look up things or send an
email or text message you also have an
exchange or work email application which
allows you to connect to your corporate
exchange server the AMOLED display is
actually very crisp clear and bright the
black is actually very rich and dark and
the colors pop out more so than on the
HTC hero which actually feels a little
bit milky next to the display on the
moment I did not have any problems with
the moment in an overcast day it has
been overcast in LA as of recently so
i'm not sure how the screen would work
under direct sunlight but it is very
bright outdoors as well and you get the
three home screens that google comes
with and a number of widgets so this is
a quick look at the sprint samsung
moment which is on a sprint now network
compared to the touch pro to the moment
actually doesn't feel as solid it
actually feels a little bit wobbly but
next to the competing motorola moto cliq
on t-mobile's network the moment
actually feels a lot better than the
motorola cliq it's actually in between
the HTC touch pro2 and the cliq in far
as far as build quality it actually
feels a lot larger than the than the
hero or it looks a lot larger than it
feels compared to the hero but the
devices are roughly not that far apart
in terms of size so thanks for watching
and this has been a quick look of the
moment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
