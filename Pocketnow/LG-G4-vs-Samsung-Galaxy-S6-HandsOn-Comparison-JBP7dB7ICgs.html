they'll require a very exhaustive
comparison when we have the time for now
we're gonna do it on the quick i'm
michael fisher with pocket now and this
is a hands-on comparison LG g4 vs
samsung galaxy s6 you'll notice we're
using the edge variant of the galaxy s6
and that's for no other reason then
that's the version we happen to have on
us on the other side we've got the
all-new LG g4 in both plastic and
leather trims and no matter which of
these you look at s6 or edge g4 space
age or g4 cowhide they almost couldn't
be more different
the s6 is slick and smooth and glass and
metal which makes it feel expensive but
also makes it irresistible to finger
prints the g4 is plastic in one build
ceramic coated plastic in another and of
course leather and I mention it for the
third time in a minute only to emphasize
that which one you buy will majorly
impact the feel in hand my early sense
is that the Samsung foam feels more
high-end than some of the g4 trims but
I'd argued that the full grain leather
version while very different feels
equally high-end plus it doesn't smudge
and you're less likely to drop it once
you get used to its rear mounted volume
and power keys that is when it comes to
the edge here
each is special in its own way and I
don't mean that in the condescending way
instead of an edge screen with special
features the g4 settles for a very
subtle curve to the cover glass over its
five and a half inch quantum IPS display
larger than Samsung's 5.1 inch AMOLED
and I'm sure very different in terms of
color reproduction and brightness
they're similar in pixel density though
technically Samsung edges LG out 577 -
538 but if you can spot that difference
I'll eat my hat
Samsung bragged its face off about the
camera in the Galaxy s6 and for good
reason we ended up calling the 16
megapixel F 1.9 shooter one of the best
smartphone cameras ever when we reviewed
it earlier this month
LG wants a piece of that to cranking the
aperture size open even further to 1.8
and building in something it called o is
2.0 for 3 axis stabilization also the
front-facing camera on the new chief
borer has gotten a boost to 8 megapixel
besting Samsung's 5 how they perform in
the real world remains to be seen but
it's interesting to see LG introducing
new features like manual controls and
raw support while Samsung has focused on
streamlining this time around two very
different hearts beat at the center of
these phones Samsung relies on its own
home-cooked Exynos 7420 while LG makes
use of the Snapdragon 808 how those
processors fare and daily usage remains
to be seen but the accessories
supporting them are starkly opposed
while Samsung opted to ditch the
venerable removable battery and
expandable memory slot this time around
LG stayed the course and included both a
larger replaceable battery and microSD
compatibility on the g4 though it didn't
opt to include wireless charging as
Samsung get to induction recharge the g4
you need a special case finally in
software the picture is inverted
somewhat here Samsung is the one that
flipped the script taming its formerly
overgrown TouchWiz user interface in an
effort to simplify simplify while LG
only seems to have made a few cosmetic
changes to its heavy LG UI what this
means for usability remains to be seen
but as heavy interfaces don't seem to
age very well this decision to change
little does make the LG seemed a little
bit behind on the software front
we left a lot unexplored in this quick
look from voice quality to speaker
blowouts to browser tests and beyond
we've got a lot more to learn about the
LG g4 and how it relates to the galaxy
s6 and galaxy s6 edge so stay tuned for
the full comparison coming soon but if
you want a little sneak peek after an
afternoon with the g4 I'll bet this is
one face-off that's gonna be a close one
