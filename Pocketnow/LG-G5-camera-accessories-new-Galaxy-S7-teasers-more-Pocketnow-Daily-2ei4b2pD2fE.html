g5 magic slot will be about Samsung
Galaxy s7 teasers continue to point to
waterproof enhancements and can you
imagine smartphone cameras without a
lens I'm hi Mary vetta and I'm not sure
when this video is going to go up
because all the packing is just driving
me nuts this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with
encryption obviously the news about
Apple not wanting to the crip the iphone
5c in the whole San Bernardino case have
garnered a lot of buzz in the media and
other CEOs from the technique also
backing apple with the send our pitch i
just recently tweeted the need for
encryption and the reason why we
shouldn't open up to devices being able
to be hacked and so many other things we
would love to know what you think about
other CEOs backing Apple in this as
obviously there are reasons for this
particular phone to be decrypted and
speaking of Google for those of you that
are interested in the gmail experience
to work on your current email meaning of
you're currently using outlook or yahoo
gmail has a the tool for that they just
launched the service called gmail fi and
the whole idea is free to sign up with
your outlook accountant for it to behave
like it were a gmail account meaning you
can archive email easily you can use
labels if you use a lot of the tools
that are really cool about gmail
obviously that is dependent on your user
preferences I could not live without
gmail but I'm sure that other people
could we would love to know in your case
what is your favorite email service and
how do you use it correctly and if you
think the whole endeavor of thin and
light is going to end that's actually
far from the case we've got some
engineers publishing a new way to
flatten the lens necessity of a
smartphone camera meaning you will no
longer see a lens on the phone it'll
just be a pinhole because pretty much
the sensor only needs light to go in
through the pinhole for it to be able to
capture the lighted needs for the
photograph this is a rather interesting
change in design but we wonder exactly
how that will look on smartphones in the
future even though it would be great for
us to move away from camera humps
anyways not your thang let's move the
spotlight over to the Samsung Galaxy s7
a Samson continues
it's teasers this time we see a girl
dropping her phone on the pool so yeah
the phone is definitely going to be
waterproof or at least we hope that at
least one of the coolest variants will
be because Samsung is like that not all
phones get all features but then again
we also hear some trusted sources
claiming that indeed this will be an
always-on display which is something
we've been waiting for to see on samsung
phones like forever and finally the very
hot news they have to do with the LG g5
as we hear details on what that purpose
or the magic slot will be apparently it
will be for camera Griffin this camera
grip will allow you to add a battery in
addition to probably expandable storage
and support for other peripherals it's
rather interesting though we don't know
if it will only be limited to this
camera grip which would be interesting
but it does leave me to the question of
today how much would you be willing to
pay for an accessory like this one is it
something that you would look out for
because in my case I will be honest with
you I have never considered paying for a
camera grip but given the fact of how
phones heat up at times whenever you're
taking too many photos I probably would
for 100 bucks leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
