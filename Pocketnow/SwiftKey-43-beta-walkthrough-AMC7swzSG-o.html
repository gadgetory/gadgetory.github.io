keyboards are saved a major update today
as a public beta I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and this is a walk through
of the layouts for living SwiftKey beta
today an update for one of the most
popular third-party Android keyboards
SwiftKey was released in the form of a
public beta dubbed layouts for living
the version number is 4.3 and what this
beta build brings is quite fantastic
useful intriguing and a long list of
other positive adjectives at the surface
it would seem little has changed it's
still the same ol SwiftKey as before
even digging through the settings you'll
only find features that have been there
for several versions now such as flow
the gesture style typing capability
themes the ability to add a row of very
helpful navigation arrows and kind of
support the ability to back up your
saved words and personalize your
experience from various services and
social accounts even opening the
keyboard from within any text field
doesn't immediately show any dead
giveaways so what is new about this
version of SwiftKey first in response to
never-ending requests the developers
have consolidated the tablet and
smartphone support into a single
application certainly a welcome change
but that's not the meat of this update
long press the numeric key or the Swift
key Menu key and will bring up a
settings menu which would normally give
you a shortcut to Swift key settings
voice input support and the ability to
share the SwiftKey keyboard to a number
of places in this beta long-pressing the
symbol key brings up several more
options for instance there is now a
shortcut to themes from within this
popup menu
swift is also added to new layout
choices a split thumb keyboard and a
side mounted compact keyboard
not unlike Samsung's one-handed keyboard
whether you like the thumb keyboard
compact or full size keyboards you now
have the ability to resize each of them
five different sizes to be exact in the
full and thumb keyboards resizing only
adjusts the height of the keys and the
compact layout however resizing changes
both the width and height of the keys
and there's one more particularly
awesome feature the ability to undock
the keyboard regardless of which layout
you choose the full keyboard winner
undocked can be moved vertically along
the display the split layout divides
into two separate keyboards which can be
moved together or apart
and the compact keyboard can be placed
virtually anywhere on the display moving
in two different dimensions to redock
the keyboard simply drag it back down
towards the bottom of the display the
whole point of this update was to cater
to varying sizes of smartphones and
tablets who said you have to use a
keyboard in a certain way with this
layouts of living Veda you can use the
keyboard in the way which suits you best
for instance a floating keyboard is very
helpful on a larger smartphone like the
one Max and especially the Galaxy Note 3
with its multi window and pin window
features as I noted in my review of the
note 3 the floating keyboard is
something I've grown quite fond of and
used frequently the ability to use that
feature in Swift key on any Android
device is certainly welcomed though I do
wish the keyboard would stay undocked
unfortunately it Redux every time the
keyboard is minimized you can try the
Swift key 4.3 beta yourself today if
you'd like simply visit the Swift key
