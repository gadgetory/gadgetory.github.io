from Samsung's history of more daring
experiments we're now looking at the
fourth generation of phones to feature
flagship specs in a more durable shell
but before we can really put this one
through its paces we've got to get it
out of the box i'm juan carlos back now
for PocketNow and here's our first
impressions of the galaxy s7 active this
is an 18 T exclusive device so it was a
little surprising to see a blue box
instead of the normal orange soda retail
packaging it's typical fare the phone
greets you up front with an it can wait
sticker slapped on the screen we've got
a small collection of pamphlets no one
will ever read a USB cable the charger
and a helpful little USB OTG adapter
it's been interesting watching Samsung
include a storage accessory instead of
the more common cheap headphones
immediately this phone feels familiar if
you've held an active since the galaxy
s5 era the s7 active this year follows
very similar design aesthetics we get a
reinforced shell noticeably bigger than
the regular s7 and a slight bit taller
and thicker than the s6 active a small
part of the difference in hand feel
comes down to the rear of the phone
having been filled in no more trench
around the edges and the camera no
longer bulges from the rest of the
backplate corners are nice and chunky
the edges are rubbery and grippy and the
camo is printed onto a textured plastic
helps keep the phone in your hand
regardless of weather conditions in the
past the move to a rugged shell usually
came with at least one compromise over
the regular Galaxy S 4 active had a
lower resolution camera and the s5 and
s6 actives lost the fingerprint sensor
we gotta find an action button in
exchange while the s7 has clicky
navigation buttons as opposed to
capacitive buttons it's the first rugged
phone from Samsung to keep that
fingerprint sensor under the home screen
eliminating one of the last major
compromises oh and we still get that
action button to launch a whole series
of little mini rugged outdoor lifestyle
applets Samsung has been utilizing open
water resistant ports for the last year
so it's not a revolutionary idea but
it's still impressive to know you don't
have to cover anything up with a floppy
plastic guard to protect from water
damage the SIM card tray also gets a
redesign the s6 door could just be
pulled out with a thumbnail probably
easier to implement with the
Gasquet needed to protect against water
but the s evan brings back a pin tool
ejection switch this tray is also
double-sided to bring back micro SD card
expansion a very welcome return after
last year's active the rest of this
phone is still very much an s7 a quad HD
AMOLED display micro USB port with a
bottom firing speaker and we also
retained the impressively quick camera
system super fast launch times and the
fastest focusing system we've ever used
often manufacturers just assume people
who shop rugged phones must not be
interested in taking photos picking up
an active is always a welcome change of
pace what's the point of going out on a
beautiful hike if you can't take a
decent picture of the landscape where
some people might point to a compromise
this is a thicker and fatter phone than
most flagships it's very much like
owning a regular s evan with a
permanently attached bumper case this is
a more practical design focused on a
durability demographic but it wouldn't
be a surprise if someone preferred the
glass and metal look of the standard
galaxy phones happily that extra chunk
also comes with a larger battery this
puppy packing a 4000 milliamp hour cell
a 30% increase over the regular s7 which
would be a welcome addition for screen
on time junkies lifestyle and durability
have become bigger talking points over
the last couple years LG flirted with
enhanced drop-in shock resistance Sony
is well known for making water-resistant
phones HTC added a little splash
resistance to the 10 and Samsung's non
armor-clad phones are better able to
survive a dunk so what about the active
there are lower-cost
tough options for businesses and while
rugged phones are advertised to
consumers as lifestyle devices they
don't often seem to be the most
appealing choices for folks who also
want pretty phones a word is a phone
like the Galaxy S seven active fit into
this equation well you'll just have to
