if I owned the new galaxy cherry Samsung
had great marketing but the hardware was
flimsy the camera was terrible and Oh
God the software we even had running
jokes about how terrible touch was was
it wasn't until the launch of the Galaxy
Note 4 that we noticed the new trend the
hardware was great the software was
getting better and the camera for that
camera it's made owning a new galaxy
almost irresistible so you can imagine
how this honeymoon phase has been going
lately I'm high metal even I was pocket
now and not to spend 24 hours with the
Samsung Galaxy s8 brought to you by D
brand like a fine wine there's something
about the Samsung Galaxy s8 that's hard
to describe in words great build quality
is not unique to this phone but the
overall package and feel is probably the
most elegant that I've seen from Samsung
a glass back that's less prone to
fingerprints thanks to the orchid grey
finish a glossy trim that actually looks
like it could take a beating and thank
you Samsung for the black finish on the
display across all your color variants
this just makes content consumption more
immersive and yes this display Super
AMOLED blended with ultra thin bezels
that are curved on the borders is just
an invitation to continue staring at it
yes I have to admit that I am in love
setting it up for the first time we
notice a few subtle changes from
previous galaxy setups I'd call it more
of a similar trend of minimalism that
we've seen from the company lately I
love that there's no need that's
happened go anymore for the phone to
detect the latest backups from Google
you do have the option to use Samsung
Smart Switch but I decided to keep it
basic given how slow it can be what's
cool is that Samsung cloud is now
working you can even restore from
previous syncs to the surface I actually
didn't give it a try on this s8 but I
did on the si+ and it works quite well
even syncs up your launcher order and
every
the rest is just setting up the way to
unlock your phone which I chose
fingerprint and iris scanning because
yes the face to unlock is not something
I'll trust and after that meet your new
galaxy there's a Samsung experienced
version 8.1 running on top of Android
7.0 those of you that complain about
Android skins should not include this
one on your list it follows the
fundamental elements of the pixel
launcher like sliding from the bottom to
launch the app tray or using the
fingerprint scanner to column the
notification shade though some of these
features you actually have to activate
from the Advanced section then there are
the other things that it actually
improves from stock Android in the same
advanced section you'll find the way to
slide from the bottom or triple click
the home button to reduce the screen
size in order to improve your one-handed
usability yes this is a huge plus if you
don't like the order of the navigation
buttons you can switch them up and yes
please switch the pump and my favorite
are the new notification alerts which
don't cover the status bar or any
portion of the content like seriously
every OEM should do this I'm actually
surprised that Samsung even decided to
adopt the context menus when you heart
press icons on the launcher just like
you can with the pixel I'm a little
disappointed on the Samsung keyboard
because it's still not fully
multilingual so yes SwiftKey was a must
here one thing that I'm really liking is
this new always-on display which is now
more colorful and now includes a
tutorial over how to activate specific
notifications and there's a new option
for face widgets the edge display is
also here for quick shortcuts and
different lighting options for whenever
you get a phone call and as for bixby
well press on the button set it up and
the menu populates with a very
convoluted list of things that it thinks
are important to you police is still not
ready and well you can always enable the
Google assistant in addition to the
Google feed which I actually needed a
widget to activate it from
so far it's a little too early to judge
my experience with the phone you can bet
that the camera lens is already smudged
beyond belief due to the placement of
the fingerprint scanner which has
already stressed my hand a lot with me
trying to reach it and I have large
hands as a solution what I've done is
enabled the hidden home button to
activate the display in order to make
the Irish scanner feature a lot quicker
to launch oh and about battery life well
three and a half hours of screen on time
is not the best for day one but remember
this should get better over time now
wipe this camera lens off and you're
greeted by some of the best photos a
smartphone can take or in juan-carlos
back and I was already working Harmony's
real camera review but in the first
couple of shots I've taken it's clear
that Samson continues pushing the bar
and image quality both during the day
and at night even if in the case of the
primary camera are we almost have the
same hardware I also love this new user
interface where you can launch the
camera with double clicking the power
button just like you can on the pixel
and this new zoom slider on the camera
trigger which is a new Samsung
improvement overall it's clear that
Samsung has practice phone with an
infinite amount of software provements
to match its new infinity display these
are just our first impressions of what
we've learned over 24 hours our full
review is still on its way in addition
to a ton of comparisons thank you so
much for your suggestions in the
comments down below did you know that
pirates wore eye patches so that when
they went below deck they could remove
