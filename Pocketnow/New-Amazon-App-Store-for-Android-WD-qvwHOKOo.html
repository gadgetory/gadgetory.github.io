pocket now calm if you use an Android
phone you're probably very familiar with
the Android Market so the place should
go for the hundred thousand plus
applications all within one roof has a
really nice interface but Amazon thinks
that they can do one better and today
they've launched the Amazon Appstore in
this video we're going to talk about it
let's get to it so you might be
wondering why did Amazon launch an app
store well we have three explanations
that could be possible here number one
they want a piece of the pie the app
store industry is very profitable and
amazon wants to get in on it number two
amazon wants to integrate apps purchases
with amazon.com they want to use their
recommendation engine they want to
feature apps on their homepage they have
a lot of people going to amazon.com
every day and they want to leverage apps
and get people to buy apps when they buy
a phone or they buy cell phone
accessories and things like that and
number three
amazon.com probably already has your
credit card information so that removes
one barrier to entry you login with your
username and password that you've been
using to buy your amazon stuff and boom
you're in so the first time you launch
the amazon app store and again we'll put
a video or we'll put a link up on the
video so that you can download this
you're asked to log in and we've already
done that here and this is what it looks
like it works in landscape if you wanted
to but we're actually going to just show
it in portrait and there's a spot right
at the top for one feature that which is
Angry Birds Rio this is one of the very
few exclusives to the Amazon App Store
it's a really cool game I've already
downloaded it and played it a little bit
and what we get here are some categories
you can swipe through with your finger
or you've got top paid and top free apps
right here in this listing so let's see
when we get to an app and we want to
actually buy it or download it let's
find something here we will go to
Wolfram Alpha
okay so we'll tap on that and here is
the screen where you come after you've
tapped on the app and we've got
screenshots here we can flick through
you can tap on a screenshot and get a
full-screen view of of it we get up
product description these pages look
just like the amazon.com mobile app in
fact I'm sure they use the same engine
in fact if you scroll down you can see
reviews let's go to another one that
actually has some reviews we will go to
say it's a fine one that has some
reviews brand new store there really
aren't is it
there isn't much activity going on here
so if we go to this application for
example there's one review and you can
tap on the reviews and see what people
are saying about it
or from here you can just click buy app
I'm not going to buy that app that
doesn't look too fun let's find
something that does look fun I've heard
good things about asphalt HD really cool
game they've removed one barrier to
buying an application here it's one
touch and you buy it watch this boom and
it goes to the download screen it
doesn't have that extra screen that asks
for the permissions okay so it's
downloading this is the my apps section
from here you can go to the all section
and see all the applications that you've
already downloaded through the Amazon
App Store and if you go over here you
can see all of the updates let's see
what happens after the download
completes this is a larger download so
we're gonna cut back in in a minute okay
and it's done and it takes you to the
install screen and within a minute or
two you've gone from downloading the app
to installing the app it's a very quick
process so I'm gonna click done here so
the Amazon App Store it looks pretty
nice
again we're not exactly sure why someone
would use this over the Android
Marketplace because this says far fewer
apps only about four thousand at lunch
something else forgot to mention we can
drill down into particular categories if
you want and further categories are
shown at the top so we can go to the
business category see the apps and go
from there so really what we'll be
looking at for it are exclusive titles
to the Amazon App Store that's really
the only reason we have to visit it the
interface isn't revolutionary there's
nothing about it that is much more
compelling than the Android app store
that you get on every Android device so
download it and let us know what you
think about it we're going to put a link
up on the video now
so that you can go to the mini URL and
download it right to your Android phone
it's free to download the app you should
definitely try it out and let us know
what you think about it if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
