today we're going to do a hardware tour
of the verizon droid Eris by HTC this is
an Android smartphone and it comes with
version 1.5 of Android but soon it will
be upgraded to 2.1 which includes the
Google navigation software which will be
great when that occurs so on the front
of the device we have the speaker at the
top we've got a 3.2 inch screen which is
320 by 480 HVGA we've got a set of
dedicated buttons at the bottom of the
screen here for home menu back and
search we've got the talk button we've
got a scroll pad here and then we have
an end button that also serves as the
power button on the device on the side
we've got volume up and down when you
hit the volume all the way down that
goes into silent or vibrate mode the
other side is clean no buttons there on
the top a great feature for HTC which is
a dedicated headset jack which is new to
their devices on the bottom we have a
mini USB for syncing and charging plus
the microphone is right above there on
the back we've got the five megapixel
camera which has a 1 X zoom in his video
capable inside the unit we've got a 1300
milliamp battery which is removable and
we've got a micro SD card the unit comes
with a an 8 gigabyte card but you can
put in up to a 16 gigabyte card
your maximum storage for the unit is 16
megabytes the internal storage we've got
a 512 and B ROM and 288 and megabytes of
RAM the processor is a Qualcomm 528
megahertz MSM 7600 in the unit weighs
about four point to three ounces now
let's compare it to other devices that I
have the big comparison let me grab the
iPhone here is this is an iPhone 3GS it
is smaller than the iPhone 3GS the
iPhone 3GS is has more curves on the
side but it feels much more slippery
than the year as the Eris is a beveled
angle here and and feels quite good in
your hand on the iPhone 3GS I actually
have a rubber case around it to make it
feel more secure in my hand but I don't
think it's something that I would need
with the ears compared to a windows
mobile device we've got a rise in omnia
the screen is about the same size but
the iris is slightly thinner and I think
a little lighter as well then an older
HTC device is an HTC touch diamond2 much
smaller screen in as much thicker and in
today's terms this actually looks fairly
clunky so if you put all these devices
together you can see that out of all
these devices the ear is smaller but yet
doesn't feel smaller especially when
compared to the iPhone yes the iPhone
has a little bit more screen real estate
but I haven't found that to be a problem
with the ears so that does it for our
hardware tour and I'll be back with a
software tour next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
