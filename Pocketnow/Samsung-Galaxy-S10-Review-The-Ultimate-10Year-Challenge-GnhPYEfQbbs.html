smartphones have evolved in ten years of
galaxy what was once regarded as a copy
of others has spent the last five
generations sending its own bar from one
of the first with water resistance to
one of the first with a fingerprint
scanner to the dominant innovator of
smartphone displays and cameras to the
first with a curved screen to the
trendsetter in the return of glass on
glass and the death of the bezel there
is no denying that it's a great legacy
but the question is legacy a far should
this be the phone you buy today I'm high
mentally better with pocket now and this
is our Galaxy S 10 plus review brought
to you by D brand
love it or hate it it's hard to ignore
the reason why Samsung is at the top of
the Android food chain the company has
never really used the non compromised
slogan but for me this is the best way
to describe the Galaxy S 10 plus so
let's begin this video by telling you
what I like about this phone the first
this phone has everything at a time when
phones are blue zhing ports and bring
excessive notches Samsung didn't follow
the trends we have a headphone jack
that's well tuned by AKG with a good
pair of AKG headphones in the box the
Infinity o is not a perfect solution for
the knotch
but it's far smaller than most notches
and at least you can dress it in style
with some of the recent wallpapers you
can find on Reddit I honestly can't
believe this has become a thing
second it's one of the most powerful
phones right now we have the latest
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 with enough RAM
expandable storage a large battery and
faster LTE and Wi-Fi than most in
addition to XI wireless charging and
then there are cool tricks like reverse
wireless charging and all regardless of
the Varian that you pick third this
phone is the best and things that truly
matter the six point four inch dynamic
AMOLED display the quad HD plus
resolution has been rated as
best-in-class and we agree it's also one
of the brightest that I've seen on a
smartphone at 1200 nits and then match
it with some of the loudest dual firing
speakers that I've tested on a phone and
yeah it's a whole content consumption
package here forth this phone is
gorgeous and feels great this prism
white finish has quickly grown on me
when viewed from different angles and
then Samsung has also shaved some of the
footprint and weight from its
predecessor so even if large the feel is
rather surreal v
let's talk about the cameras I have a
full separate video on how this camera
performed in montserrat so I'm not gonna
bore you with specifics what I will tell
you is that even if Samsung is not the
first at bringing a wide-angle camera
it's the first of doing more with it
than just giving you wide-angle shots it
enables genius features like super
steady video thanks to the wide sensor
and which I highly recommend you you
if you've got the right lighting for the
occasion it enables better portrait
photos where you won't have to step back
from the subject to get a good shot and
where you can switch the bouquet after
the fact and not get a completely
different photo like before best of all
you can play with the effects and make
colors pop if you fancy a more dramatic
effect and yes you do have a wider field
of view for more epic photos match also
with the versatility of the primary
shooter that has two aperture options
and the telephoto that helps you get a
really good proper street photography
that variable aperture proves to be
essential in low-light with the night
mode included in scene detection I still
feel that Samsung needs to work on
moving subjects and low lights but I
can't deny that this phone is really
good at pulling detail in low-light the
selfie camera also found some major
improvements now providing more detail
and capabilities for 4k video recording
and also a wider crop I call this camera
versatile in my previous video and after
a final software updates now with the
inclusion of Instagram mode I stand by
that assessment more now than before
obviously this is a review not a love
letter so let me tell you where I'm
mixed and where I don't like this phone
it begins with one UI and a positive
front you'd say that
om shouldn't try to reinvent Android but
there are certain things where one UI is
just more logical see large phones are
hard to handle and Samsung has moved a
ton of the buttons and interaction to
the bottom of the display the problem is
really not Samsung's fault but obviously
the rest of Android which thinks that
buttons should be at the top so the
result is hit or miss and then what is
Samsung's fault is a power button so
high up that the effort and the software
just seems like an irony I like that the
edge menus are still here for shortcuts
and I also love the gestures are now
embraced sadly there is sort of a
cumbersome interaction between Samsung
pay and these gestures and the Google
assistant so my advice to you is to
disable my favorite card settings within
Samsung pay and then there's the total
lack of palm rejection which also makes
handling such a large and slippery phone
a problem I highly recommend the deeper
skin to address that and add some grip
now features I never thought that I'd
miss are the iris scanner or the
standard fingerprint scanner
sadly facial recognition is not at all
secure and while I do find the
ultrasonic fingerprint scanner to be
cool it's not always reliable
Samsung claims a software update will
fix this but we don't know exactly when
and then let's talk about battery life I
mean some of my colleagues are claiming
stellar results but mine is just okay
you'll end the day okay but you won't
get an extra day like you can with
certain other competitors last but not
least Oh Bixby
I feel the service doesn't deserve all
the hate that it gets and a lot of
automation and quick commands is genius
the problem is when it lags so behind
the Google assistance and absolutely
everything else and how even if you
remap the key you can't fully disable it
and folks before we conclude this video
let me tell you more about our sponsor D
brand if you want to avoid those
fingerprint smudges and pimp out your
new Galaxy S 10 D brands new black swarm
skin is fantastic and of course that's
just one of the many options they have
available to cater to your tastes follow
the link in the description below to
choose the skins that match your style
most to conclude even if this device is
not perfect notice that all the things
that I'm either mixed or don't like
about it are all software based and sure
I agree some of these things are
probably knit fix and absolutely
everything that matters the galaxy s 10
plus excels you've got the best display
of 2019 some of the best specifications
a versatile camera and a design that
turns heads no matter where you go match
this with the fact that Samsung has
decided to not follow Apple in the price
and the offer is even more compelling
this is definitely a more mature Samsung
one where eco systems are now being
nurtured with products like the Samsung
Galaxy buds and smart things in my
opinion the Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus is
a great phone and one that I definitely
have no problem in recommending
