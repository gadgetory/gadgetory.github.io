with facial recognition and no notches
Tim Cook T's is a feature iOS update
that will help undo throttling
altogether and be where a new hack that
could completely disable your iPhone
through text messages again I'm Jaime
Rivera and you know some of you are
right my uber driver yesterday claimed
that my name is the weirdest one she's
ever heard this is PocketNow daily the
official news today again don't begin
with deals it's kind of slow right now
but most important MWC teasers have just
begun Nokia are pretty much hmd has just
confirmed that we should expect an event
to happen at MWC where we will see some
awesome new phones from the company we
have been waiting for Nokia to go back
to its roots and show us something
really bold and flagship like let's see
if we do actually get something this
time now for all five of you that have
been waiting for the home pod we are
still waiting for Cupertino to provide a
solid date as to when the product is
going to ship we've got some good news
apparently manufacturing sources claim
that they have already shipped 1 million
units to Apple and they're not expecting
that Apple will sell more than 12
million of these in 2018 so yeah there
is progress
there's just no official progress now
let's talk about chai OS and it sounds
like iOS for a reason for those of you
that don't remember those text hacks
where you'd get a specific link and you
click on it and it makes something
really weird with your phone there's a
new one out there that's called chayo s
and well the developer actually wasn't
planning to launch this the reason why
he did this is because he reported the
bugs to Apple Apple didn't respond to
them so he's like alright fine I'll make
it public just to prove to you that it
does have a problem so yeah if you click
on the link the phone will start boot
looping which is the least worst problem
that you'll have you can learn more
about the precautions and what you
shouldn't click on in the link in the
description and speaking of iOS Tim Cook
was recently on record to claim that
there will be an iOS update that will
get rid of throttling if you choose to
meaning we're expecting it to be iOS
11.3 probably and the whole idea here is
that you will get the option to have
throttling in order to have better
battery life in addition to better
battery longevity or you can choose to
disable it and Apple will apparently
give you a warning of what you're about
to encounter so I can't wait to see
exactly how bad it is to disable
throttling expect the video whenever
that launches and finally the very
interesting news today I have to do with
Samsung and a new patent I heard a lot
of complaints when we did our iPhone 10
review about the notch on the iPhone 10
and apparently Samsung wants to do away
with the notch altogether but in a very
interesting approach instead of giving
us minimal bezels with facial
recognition and everything and well
Samsung is envisioning a display with
holes meaning a hole for the camera a
hole for the speaker grille a hole for
the home button at the bottom but the
user interface actually works all around
these I'm not exactly sure of the user
interface will adapt to these which
would make all the sense in the world
since samsung provides such a heavy skin
but yeah that's a very interesting
approach to a new UI let us know in the
comments do you think that you would
prefer a notch or you would prefer holes
in my case if you think about it the
notch to a certain degree serves as a
hole it's like a mole on the display
that doesn't allow you to see things in
full screen anyway so I don't think any
approach would be better but the hey if
Samsung can pull off holes and have you
know these features work without it
hindering the user experience I would
love to give it a try leave us a comment
down below let us know what you think
