pukka now and this is the software
review of the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc
in this particular device is the
International unlock version it's it's
running Android 2.3 Gingerbread so let's
get to it
so the Xperia Arc is working with
combination of the Sony Ericsson Xperia
user interface which is what they're
calling it and Gingerbread so we can go
into the about information on the phone
here and now let's go all the way down
and we can view that it's Android 2.3
point 2 so not as new as the Nexus S but
still pretty good and the great thing
about this user interface is the on the
front page is the home page you can
pinch to zoom out and you can view all
of the applications and widgets that you
have stored directly on your home page
so I can just go back to one of them if
I want or I could just go back out
unless they want to view the media
player out do is click here and I can
view the media player so if I go into
the applications we have the pretty much
basic applications that come on every
single Android one thing that's
different is you can see that the live
wallpaper on the back is behind all the
applications which doesn't occur too
much on many phones so I have the
default applications of the Android race
it comes with asphalt 5 so that's a
pretty fun game and I'll show you that
in just a second we have the calculator
which is Reese kind-- with the sony
ericsson user interface and just go back
we have our calendar which is pretty big
on this device because it is a 4.2 inch
screen we get a nice large calendar we
can view our events go back and up and
down all the great stuff we have a
camera the camera on this device is
absolutely phenomenal take some of the
best pictures that I've ever used a
mobile device for them some of the
videos are pretty excellent as well it
does record in full 720p HD so it allows
you to have all these different settings
let's see it can change it up to 8
megapixels of course that's a 4:3 aspect
ratio so I can just go back and I put it
back on 6 so let's go back to some more
apps we have to clock our contacts let's
see if I click up here is going to show
my phone number and it looks like I
haven't set all those up
so as myself so that's not too bad
looking view all of our contacts if you
like can view our downloads which we've
downloaded directly from the internet we
have our email our Facebook FM radio
which allows this device does have a
built-in FM radio but you probably will
need the headphones plugged in in order
to use that Salah we'll just skip that
our gallery which is the default gallery
on every Android device our Gmail Google
search we have Google Latitude let's
golf which is the 3d cartoon style esque
golf game live live where manager which
allows you to predetermine what occurs
when you plug a certain accessory into
your device so if you plug your
headphones in you can go to phone or
media or any of those great great
applications with Google Maps that
market I haven't installed market
enabler because I wasn't all the apps
weren't showing up on this device we
have media server which allows you to
set up a use this as a media server
device you can play videos and whatnot
on the device or you can also share over
a DLNA network and you can also share
other files to your computer the
messaging with MSN Messenger we have our
music applications navigation news and
weather a small light version of office
suite which lonley allows you to view
documents our phone dialer of course
this device still does not have the
speed dial so if you start dialing
something the phone number does it come
up with the most common phone numbers
you have stored in your device we have
the play now which allows you to
download various games and other things
from the PlayStation Network so we've
seen that on the Xperia Play and I need
a SIM card of course to install to have
that activated we have post card which
allows you to send photos as a post card
I've installed quadrant standard we have
our settings our setup guide which goes
through practically everything of this
device helps you set it up really easily
we have sync which allows you to sync
with the Sony Ericsson Network Google
Talk Timescape which integrates Twitter
and a few other clandestine messaging
social networks that I haven't seen
before because this this is from China
so have these other accounts down here
so I've either Twitter or Facebook and I
can
we'll include my messaging and email in
that application the track ID which is
similar to Shazam and it allows you to
view the track information as well as
who the artist is and all the other
great stuff so we'll just go back voice
search YouTube and a few other
applications I believe did a couple of
them on this phone because I don't
really know what they are another cool
thing about this is that you can
rearrange your icons from your own order
alphabetical most use and recently
installed so that's that's great to
organize your applications so if I want
to play a song I've do is click on the
media player and the audio quality on
this device is pretty excellent I was
surprised because the speaker is so
small I didn't assume that the audio
would be so great so let's go home and
view the live wallpaper we don't have
too many let's see bring you to a blank
page I believe it has just the basic
live wallpapers that come with Android
Gingerbread so let's see here
yeah pretty much just the basic ones
that come with Gingerbread so we can go
back home let's look at the widgets we
have a few other widgets that are
included so nothing too spectacular we
do have these buttons that allow you to
turn turn off things so let's just go
back so now we're gonna run some
benchmarks these are from the
applications that we think are the best
three benchmark applications available
on the Android Market so let's do that
real quick so it looks like the Xperia
Arc got a sixteen hundred and five on
the quadrant standard so let's run a
couple other tests okay so now we'll use
smart Ben's 2011 we'll run this
benchmark and come right back so it
looks like the Xperia Arc are the
thirteen hundred and forty-one it says
that the average for Android 2.3 point
two is around 1350 to looks like the
Motorola Xoom is really fast so we'll
run the last one which is Linpack for
Android and we'll do that real quick and
it looks as though we got thirty eight
point four nine 1m flops in a time of
two point one eight seconds so that's
that pretty fast so so now I'll show you
those other games that were on the
device that were included so we can go
to asphalt 5 which is a pretty simple
racing game we'll just wait for it to
load okay so here we are on a quick race
and we'll just skip this and it's pretty
simple to control the controller
accurate actually it's a much better
than a lot of other mobile devices so I
can move it around and I can also use a
boost and the game continues on like
this and we just race the graphics are
really good the screen is phenomenal the
camera does not do this screen justice
so let's go to the golfing game ok so
here I am on let's go off and I can move
my player either side to side and what I
want to do is select my strength and my
accuracy and let's see how well we do
and it heads the ball flies over this
body of water we'll see how close we get
and it looks as though I landed in a
sand trap that is just my luck anyways
the last thing I'm going to show you is
the media player because the video on
this device when you play video it uses
the Mobile BRAVIA Engine so let's go to
some videos ok so here we are on a video
of a Final Fantasy game and the video
quality is very superior this device is
capable of playing 720p video resolution
and another great thing about it is the
HDMI port on the top if you've connected
to a Sony at bravia television it will
automatically turn the TV on and display
exactly what you're seeing on the screen
on the television of course you can also
do that with other televisions that have
HDMI capabilities but the sony bravia
televisions are able to turn on when the
device is plugged in so this has been a
software review of the Sony Ericsson
Xperia Arc and if you like our videos
