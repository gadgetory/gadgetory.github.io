pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a closer look at the HTC Vivid from
AT&amp;amp;T so sit back relax enjoy the show so
the HTC Vivid does not really have much
going for it as far as in hand feel it's
a little awkward with these rounded
rounded beveled edges that is and this
back plate here the HTC logo where it's
cut out is actually fairly sharp against
my skin not enough to catch you but
enough that after a few days of holding
out of the Vice the HTC logo starts to
pick up a little bit of dirt gunk in it
that needs to be wiped out it's also
very hot down in this section here where
these little dotted area is and I found
that with a little bit of just a minor
amount of use that the device gets very
very warm in hand which I didn't really
care for it's abnormally heavy compared
to a lot of devices that are on the
market today especially compared to say
the samsung galaxy s2 here or in this
case the epic 4g touch from sprint and
while it doesn't look like it's much
taller it's just a smidge taller in hand
or just looking at the side of the
device it seems larger because of the
beveled edges that gives the impression
that the device is larger than it is as
far as the construction goes it seems
very solid but the buttons on the sides
do feel a little bit cheap in comparison
to the rest of the solid construction of
the device battery life is as expected
there's no major issues there in fact
with very minor use of the holiday
season I found that it lasted quite a
bit of time just sitting by itself
without a lot of phone calls coming in
which what I normally deal with the 4g
service didn't seem to cause any
problems with the
life either the or rather the lack there
in I imagine that once you have real 4G
service that the battery life diminishes
greatly screen is bright and very nice
looking but the black edge edges here
especially compared to a super amoled
plus screen r is a kind of a dark grey
and you can kind of see that little
better here in the settings menu the but
the color differences with this being
only 262k in colors according to the
documentation there I haven't been able
to find a whole lot of color differences
between this device and the epic 4g
touch there is only for multi touch
points in this on this screen versus the
10 plus that you can get on some devices
which was a little disappointing but you
know it for the type of device it is is
not terribly surprising it does a
contrary to our unboxing test we got a
little phone tester in here and found
that it does it contain all the gamut of
the sensors including a gyroscope which
we didn't think was included because it
wasn't in the documentation originally
it's a very speedy device with this dual
core processor but I found that it's
constantly crashing having problems in
fact if you look up here in the corner
you can see that it's got a little cell
tower issue here and while I was setting
up this device to review it the phone
actually crashed three times which is
not a good sign for it at all call
volume is good out of this speaker here
but out of the speaker on the back it's
really tinny sounding and not very
desirable to listen to as far as like
watching videos in any sort of loud
environment it gets really noisy or
rather everything else the noise
overpowers the speaker very quickly
compared to other devices the 8
megapixel rear facing camera is fairly
decent it does a good job of still
photos does an okay job on video but
again this is something that is not
really terribly surprising that it's
going to be that great overall I found
that for what it is and for the type of
device that it is it just going to do a
good job for the type of photos as you
and want to take on the go but it's not
going to be anything spectacular again
same thing with the
facing camera here on the front end
there was one important item to mention
down here on this small port here at
this micro USB not micro SD as I
mentioned in the unboxing it can be used
for HDMI out compared to other devices
on the market today is specifically the
epic 4g touch and the droid 3 here the
HTC Vivid sits nicely between the two of
them it's smaller than the droid 3 but a
little larger than the epic 4g touch but
in the you know picking device between
these I would certainly go with the epic
4g touch before I wouldn't go with this
HTC Vivid based upon my experiences as
how it feels in the hand even the droid
3 feels better in hand in my opinion
that wraps up our closer look at the
hardware on the HTC Vivid from AT&amp;amp;T if
you have any comments or questions would
like to see some spit something specific
in the software portion of the tour
which is coming up let us know in the
comments below give us a thumbs up if
