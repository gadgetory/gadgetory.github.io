LG continues to deliver the most unique
take on including a second sensor now in
its third generation LG's v30 continues
to deliver one of the most feature
complete packages for mobile content
creation here's a quick tour through
this powerhouse camera no we're not
quite ready to produce a real camera
review just yet this phone is a
prototype anyone trying to show in-depth
analysis right now isn't really giving
this thing a fair shot but using it as
my primary phone for Aoife in Berlin
this year we can handle II share some
early impressions this camera of rocks
we were somewhat concerned by the
slightly smaller camera sensor over the
V 20 but LG has jumped through a number
of Hoops to help balance that against
actually improving photo and video
output using a wider aperture allows the
v30 to largely reach parity with phones
that use a larger sensor but the bigger
marketing claim this year LG using a
higher quality glass lens element to
correct for distortion and improve light
transmission and clarity is this just
marketing buzz speak well we do see some
early evidence to support the claim
especially in low-light shots like our
creepy tunnel less lens flaring sharper
crisper lines coming from these lamps
and better image processing for reducing
noise and retaining clarity a smaller
sensor often represents a deficit but
generation to generation this is
definitely progress the wide-angle
similarly is improved like the g6 before
it far less Distortion a little more
light to improve exposures at night and
for phones focused on changing the focal
length this is the more flexible
solution and LG's enhancements make a
useful feature even better
all of these hardware improvements would
be moot without a killer app to use them
maybe the one aspect of the V twenty
second screen we miss where the quick
toggles four modes docked off the main
display the V 30 is a touch more
cluttered when trying to switch camera
modes
once you get into the manual modes
however you're treated to some
phenomenal controls newest for the LG
platform is this ability to shoot a
controlled zoom a really pretty way to
get a smooth close-up on your subject
and for those who really have a vision
in mind for their content
LG's log files are already showing
promise for color grading even if you're
absolutely terrible at that like I am
happily for folks who aren't as keen on
a more cinematographers approach to
creation across the board this phone's
auto modes are delivering better output
than the LG's we've previously reviewed
so much so that I handily relied on it
for personal videos vlogs and about 20%
of all the footage I shot for our Aoife
coverage came from the V 30 we faced few
issues blending it in with more
traditional mirrorless camera footage
were early days in Indo were on pause
while we wait to get our hands on a
finished retail unit these first
impressions have been formidable we
mentioned in our Aoife podcast this is
likely the top option for folks wanting
to create content on the go we could
literally shoot record soundtrack edit
render and upload all from this phone
without feeling too heavy a compromise
in the process as always thanks so much
for watching this will be an ongoing
conversation as our coverage evolves so
