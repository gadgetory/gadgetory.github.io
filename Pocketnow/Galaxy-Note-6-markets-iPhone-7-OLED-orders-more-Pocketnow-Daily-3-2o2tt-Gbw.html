broader launch to other markets apple
and Sampson continue to flirt overall
LED futures for the iPhone and US
carriers are now giving away data for
android pay I'm high Meadow vivetta I
will be in see China next week but you
know that I'll do my best to give you
the news even while there this is
parking out daily it seems that not many
of us are actually using Android pay as
a the company continues to try to figure
out ways to have as you use it up to the
point where if you want to use android
pay right now and you're on verizon
since it took a little for it to reach
that well verizon's actually gonna give
you two gigs of data and that's actually
going to port from this cycle to the
next in your payment which is really
cool links to the description for more
details one of the coolest features of
the HTC 10 that I reviewed yesterday was
HTC connected the whole airplay support
it's the only one on Android right now
at least out of the box and now HTC has
decided to bring this to older HTC
devices the m eight pm-9 even the m7 so
yeah looks to the stripper for more
details and hey if you've got those
speakers you want to switch from an
iphone to android this is the way to go
overall one of my favorite vr headsets
after the HTC vive is definitely that LG
360 VR because you don't have to snap a
bone on your face and while we decided
to do something about that the company
has just launched its own VR headset
that connects through USB type-c
obviously to huawei handsets the only
problem is up apparently that's only
going to be available in china at least
for now we cannot wait to see it to
reach these markets because those are
more practical headsets now we have
heard that Apple and Samsung are
flirting over an OLED display for an
iphone in the future 2017 is the date
but well if you read the news and you
read the sources in the past it only set
oullette and samsung it didn't really
say what products a lot of people assume
that it had to do with the Apple watch
but we've got trusted sources now
claiming that there are firm requests
for 5.5 inch OLED displays for 2017 so
yeah now we can add the iphone
officially to the list or not officially
we know the way this works and finally
the very hot news that they have to do
with the galaxy note 6 in the past that
we wanted to get a note 5 in Europe it
was a
because Samsung for some reason only
launched that in the United States we
don't really understand why but now we
know that the code name for the galaxy
note 6 is Grace and that there is a
variant according to leaks that is going
to launch in Europe so those are great
news but it leads me to the question of
the day do you think that you know the
galaxy note 6 just didn't sell well in
Europe why do you think Samsung decided
to only launch the galaxy s6 edge+ in my
case I think that was the case I mean I
feel that the company can find ways to
see the people either just want a large
phone or want the added functionality
but hey we'd love to know your opinion
in the comments down below friends you
know the way it goes if we want to get
