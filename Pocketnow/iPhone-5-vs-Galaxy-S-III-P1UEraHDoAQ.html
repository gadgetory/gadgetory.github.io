pocketnow.com in this video we're going
to compare two of the hottest
smartphones on the market the iPhone 5
and the Samsung Galaxy s3 let's get to
it so just look at these two devices
they are vastly different in so many
ways it's very clear that the company is
behind these phones think very
differently about how people want to use
their smart phone Apple thinks that
people want a smaller screen with better
one-handed usability Samsung thinks that
people want big screens big beautiful
screens that they can watch movies on
that are in standard resolution formats
let's start off with specs the samsung
galaxy s3 has 1280 by 720 resolution
that is true 720p the iPhone 5 has kind
of a weird resolution 11 36 by 640 so it
doesn't playback Full HD video it kind
of down samples it a little bit and
we're going to look at 720p video in a
minute and see if you can really tell
the difference now depending on which
galaxy s3 you get you'll have different
specs if you've got the international
version you'll have the quad-core 1.4
gigahertz Exynos processor with a gig of
ram if you're in the u.s. you'll have a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4
CPU with 2 gigs of RAM wherever you get
the iPhone you get the exact same phone
it's a dual-core a6 Apple chip running
at about 1 gigahertz in each core and it
has a gigabyte of RAM which is double
what the original iPhone had now both of
these devices have pretty much the same
specs if you go down the list they both
have LTE they both have 8 megapixel
cameras on the back and higher
resolution cameras on the front head
around 1.2 1.3 megapixels they both have
Wi-Fi ABG and bluetooth 4.0 the galaxy
s3 has NFC support the iPhone 5 does not
have NFC support ok nasty different
devices we're going to compare the
software experiences of both and let's
start off talking about the hardware now
one thing you're probably noticing
already is that the galaxy s3 has an LED
notification light some people like that
because it you don't have to turn on
your
own to see if you have a missed call or
a new SMS some people hate it because
it's annoying Apple doesn't think that
people should have an LED notification
light ok we both have again front-facing
cameras here we've proximity sensors
we've got a dedicated home button on
both devices and huge differences in
screen for inches here 4.8 inches here
let's turn over to the side the galaxy
s3 is technically a little bit thicker
than the iPhone for us but it really
doesn't feel that way because it's just
such a large device in the hand you kind
of just get the sense that it's razor
thin maybe it's helped by this nice
silvery bezel along the side so if we go
to the other side you've got this sort
of curve so you've got this sort of
curve here on galaxy s3 very straight
like an arrow on the iPhone 5 here at
the top we have a headphone jack on the
galaxy s3 and then just a power button
Samsung likes to put power buttons on
the side and you know there are pros and
cons to that it's good for people that
are right-handed but if you're
left-handed
well you're kind of out of luck now
we've got the volume rocker on the slide
on both devices and on the back very
different designs the Galaxy s3 has this
really shiny plastic on the back and I
always recommend to people that have the
Galaxy s3 to get a case because it gets
dirty and greasy easily the iPhone 5
it's still new remains to be seen
whether this brushed aluminum gets dirty
and greasy so far so good
and on the bottom samsung went with the
standard microUSB which is nice and
Apple went with their own proprietary
port called lightning so you know you're
accessories won't work with that but
they will work with the galaxy s3 death
that's just the way things are so let's
turn on both devices we move the N water
to unlock and we slide to unlock over
here and here's what we get we could we
get a bigger screen here and a smaller
screen there we have Android on 1 which
of course lets you configure widgets and
really do anything you want with the
software Apple doesn't like that idea
and that's fine Apple likes to keep
things simple iOS hasn't changed that
much you get rows and rows of icons
Android kind of invented the
notification shade
here you pull it down and you can swipe
notifications off the screen
Apple allows you to tweet and add a
Facebook post from your notification
shade when you do have notifications
though I must say on the app on iOS it's
a little bit frustrating because you
can't swipe off individual notifications
and save the ones you want for later
it's kind of an all-or-nothing thing it
groups them into categories and you
really can't have that level of control
over sort of which notifications you
want to see and which you don't so in
Android and iOS very vastly different
operating systems it's just a matter of
opinion whether you like one over the
other and we're not here relate to judge
that trying to keep this video objective
so let's talk about speed let's go to
the camera app on both and see which
gets there first first let's clear out
the memory on both so we'll go over here
hit the trashcan and over here we will
do the old tapping clothes right which
there was a close all button there too
but okay equal playing field let's open
the camera app see which gets there
faster and by the way I should mention
this is TouchWiz jellybean so it's going
to be a little bit faster than those of
you that have Ice Cream Sandwich this is
the elite TouchWiz jellybean operating
system so it's a little bit faster a
little bit nicer by time October comes
around everyone that has a Galaxy s3
will probably have jellybean so camera
let's go ok the iPhone 5 is a little bit
faster there let's go into settings so
we've got settings here and here a
little bit faster on the iPhone 5 okay
let's open Facebook to different
Facebook apps iOS Facebook ad it is
native the Android one is not so that
might have an impact on performance it's
not exactly an equal playing field here
iOS should be faster just because it's
native and it is it went right into the
screen next let's test s voice versus
Siri and series been improved on in iOS
6 on the iPhone 5 kind of gets it done
faster so let's go into voice we'll tap
and holdin what's the weather going to
be on Tuesday
looks like nice weather coming up
Tuesday up to 73 degrees and sunny cast
for Tuesday's mostly sunny and nice okay
there we go
what's the nearest Italian restaurant
okay okay so I have to test the iPhones
faster and half the tests the the galaxy
s3 is faster let's give it something a
little bit different what time is it in
Sydney Australia time in Sydney
Australia is 5:40 a.m. and 49 seconds
yes okay you get very similar answers
the eye it looks like the iPhone 5 was
faster three out of four times okay
let's jump into the YouTube application
see if we can see any perceptible
difference between HD video and of
course iOS doesn't have a YouTube app
built into it anymore now it is in the
Andrew and of course iOS does not have a
built-in YouTube app anymore you get it
from the app store which is great
because now YouTube can control the
application and when it's updated and
what it's like and so forth so let's go
into the YouTube app see which opens
Fester okay so we got in there a little
bit faster in the iPhone to the sports
category maybe we can cat capture some
some high motion and it looks like we
have the same video listing over on each
side which is great we're going to play
the same video at the same time just a
little note here on color saturation the
iPhone 5 has improved color saturation
over the iPhone for us but there's
nothing like an AMOLED screen AMOLED
screens have this insane amount of color
saturation some people think it's very
unnatural some people love it it really
depends on personal preference so let's
click on this video see which one loads
it faster
iPhone 5 faster
and oddly we're not getting a
full-screen view here on the iPhone 5
but it's really beautiful here on the
galaxy s3 filling up the entire frame
and I'm Galaxy s3 you know where HD ok
this might not be kid-friendly but
that's okay in the youtube app for iOS
you really can't choose sort of the
level of quality so let's find something
else that we can watch hopefully in
hi-def ok he'll this one
I always got there faster let's see if
we can fill up the full screen and again
you get some rid of your display issues
here on the iPhone 5 on the galaxy s3 it
seems to always fall out the frame and
really dude like one of the most
immersive video experiences that you can
get on a smartphone so let's pop into
the Internet here we're gonna do some
web browsing speed test alright and that
was about even actually so let's go to
pocketnow.com here and we'll just have
the iPhone go first
okay we're getting the full site on the
galaxy s3 and let's switch to the the
desktop version here so we're kind of
looking at the exact same thing and then
we'll do some speed tests see which of
these guys is faster and if we go into
landscape iPhone 5s a little faster
getting into landscape you get this nice
full-screen browsing experience here on
the iPhone 5 everything kind of
disappears here on the galaxy s3 you
still see the status bar at the top of
there's a way to disable that so let's
move down zoom in clear self Auto almost
immediately takes longer to clear up
here on the galaxy s3 there's no doubt
about that let's click on this link at
the same time and they're off at the
same time knowing pop-up ad but the the
iPhone 5 one even though this was kicked
back to the mobile site which is
actually kind of awkward so let's load
that again and we'll move around on the
page once again and both of these
devices the end of they are very capable
web browsing machines it seems that the
iPhone is doing a better job and what
watch when I let go it clears up a
little bit faster here on the on the
iPhone front
okay so now we're on the reviews page
and I'm going to load a review which has
tons of images it's going to be slow
let's go into the pocket on razor M
review here and we're to tap them at the
same time see which gets there first
okay good they're both going into
desktop view and it looks like the
iPhone 5 finished first Galaxy s3 is
still going there and it finished second
and again both these devices are very
smooth you don't get any checker boards
everything's loaded into memory right
off the bat checker boards are really a
thing of the past thanks to jellybean
and newer versions of of iOS but again
you can really just see the difference
in in how these screens treat images
color saturation is just a lot richer
here on the galaxy s3 perhaps you could
say it's more realistic more warm on the
iPhone 5 it's really a matter of
personal preference both
very high quality screens so a lot of
these tests the iPhone 5 came out ahead
the galaxy s3 in terms of speed it
loaded webpages faster
it opened apps faster Siri it was faster
than s voice and so forth but the end of
the day you're stuck with the operating
system and you're stuck with the
software and a lot of people are really
tired of iOS and they kind of want the
flexibility of Android and Android no
longer is that operating system for
techie people it's now for techie people
but it's also for everyone else that
wants just a smooth nice experience
jelly bean has really changed the
experience to be dare I say iOS like
everything is just smooth and it feels
like it's a put together operating
system so in terms of sheer speed the
iPhone 5 wins but it's up to you to
determine which of these two devices
suits your needs better whether you want
a big screen a small screen if you want
Android or iOS it's really up to you
these are both great great smartphones
and what do you think which of these
phones is better and why drop us a
comment below and if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and let us
know what you want us to compare the
iPhone 5 to we're going to do more of
these thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
