tablets compare I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and this is the 2013 Nexus
7 versus the iPad Mini with Retina
display believed by many to be a nice
balance of additional utility over a
smart phone and more Portability than a
full sized tablet smaller tablets are
all the rage when two companies with
very different philosophies such as
Apple and Google create their own
miniature tablets the outcome is to
vastly different slabs which barely
exist in the same category for example
the new Nexus 7 and iPad Mini with
Retina display are these tablets worth
your cold hard cash which is the better
Buy let's find out to be blunt
these two tablets have practically
nothing in common and the series of
disabilities begins with the design and
build quality it's not that the 2013
Nexus 7 isn't built well it is but just
as our own michael fisher explained in
his in-depth review of the smaller Nexus
5 the hardware is understated and for
good reason the matte finish plastic
feels nice and the narrow bill paired
with tapered edges makes the tablet
quite easy to hold with one hand well
there isn't anything particularly
impressive or mind-blowing about the
design the Nexus 7 feels solid and it's
built exceptionally well the latest iPad
Mini like last year's model is as high
quality as ever the chamfered edges
along the front machined rolled speaker
grille and aluminum backside easily make
it the best built small tablet to date
Apple took care with the design and paid
close attention to detail at 200
millimeters tall both the Nexus and iPad
are the exact same height but the iPad
is notably wider and more squared 20.7
millimeters wider making the Nexus 7
much easier to Palm which also means
it's far more likely to slip into a pant
or jacket pocket the iPad is a bit
thinner 7.5 millimeters thick as opposed
to the 8 point 7 millimeter thickness of
the Nexus 7 yet due to the more premium
materials the mini hits the scales at 41
more grams than the Nexus on the inside
the differences are even more abundant
Apple's iPad Mini comes with practically
the same internals as its larger sibling
the iPad air it bears the a7 chip set a
1.3 gigahertz dual-core CPU in a
quad-core GPU 1 gigabyte of RAM 5
megapixel camera and 4 storage capacity
options 16 32
64 and 128 gigabytes running the show is
a 23 point 8 watt hour battery the Nexus
7 comes with a Snapdragon s4 pro at 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Krait 300 CPU with
an Adreno 320 GPU double the RAM a 5
megapixel camera and two storage options
16 or 32 gigabytes it's 39 50 million
power battery is rated at 15 watt hours
of course the Nexus 7 also comes with
Wi-Fi AC and NFC support while the iPad
Mini does not both however support
Bluetooth 4.0 the displays while they
differ in size and resolution are
remarkably similar in density and type
the Nexus 7's display as the name
suggests is a 7 inch 1920 by 1200 pixel
resolution IPS LCD the I've had minis
7.9 inch IPS LCD display there's a
resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels and
their respective densities based on the
same calculations are 323 and 324 pixels
per inch the Nexus 7's display appears
to be more heavily saturated and
brighter while the iPad minis display
sports higher contrast and maybe a hint
of deeper blacks frankly the more
important factors separating these
displays are size and utilization the
iPad minis display is obviously larger
but it also makes better use of those
pixels considering a quarter inch of the
bottom of the display on the Nexus 7 is
dedicated to on-screen buttons hardware
is quite easily summed up by saying the
iPad Mini is unquestionably one of the
most premium filling tablets around the
Nexus 7 also feels great in the hand but
there is a rather large margin
separating the two in the end we've got
to hand it to both apple and a SUSE for
creating such premium pieces of hardware
though the iPad Mini is quite clearly
built better
both of these tablets come running the
very latest software from both Google
and Apple respectively the iPad Mini
with Retina display ships with iOS 7
with its newer more fresh appearance and
a handful of notable new features such
as control center the improved task
switcher menu and slightly more useful
Notification Center the Nexus 7 as of
yesterday is now running Android 4.4
KitKat which brings improved performance
fullscreen immersion mode printing
framework full SMS integration with
hangouts and emoji support as a Nexus
device it provides the absolute purest
form of the Google experience with pure
unadulterated Android exactly as Google
intended
the software between these tablets
believe it or not has quite a few
similarities
for example quick access to settings
toggles pull down on the top right
portion of the display on the Nexus 7
and swipe up from the bottom edge of the
display on the iPad Mini double click
the home button or perform a four finger
swipe up to access task switching on the
mini switch apps on the Nexus by
pressing the dedicated recent apps
button long press the home button on the
mini to access Siri or swipe up over the
virtual home button on the Nexus 7 for
Google now that said they sport their
fair share of differences as well the
iPad still uses a grid of icons and
folders for its home screen which grows
old quickly and can't become cumbersome
to navigate with too many apps on the
Nexus 7 you're given five home screens
out-of-the-box for organizing your
applications and widgets yet you can
always refer to the application drawer
for an alphabetical list of all apps not
only that you also have access to
glanceable information through home and
lock screen widgets you can also share
pictures and other data between various
applications and even between other NFC
enabled devices simply by tapping them
together both the iPad and Nexus come
with cloud backup services voice
controlled digital assistant services
expansive digital content libraries and
the most impressive application catalogs
in the mobile space most will argue
there's still more dedicated content or
tablet apps for the iPad Mini but in the
7 to 8 inch tablet space the lack of
tablet optimized applications is far
less serious than with full-sized
tablets at the end of the day what it
comes down to is personal preference
we have several iPad only applications
that were drawn to yet we prefer the
more optimized and advanced software on
the Nexus 7
performance is an area where both of
these tablets excel the dual-core CPU in
the a7 chip as we found in both the
iPhone 5s and iPad air reviews is great
it provided a fluid consistent
experience with the air and in a short
time with the iPad Mini with Retina
display things seem to be just as great
applications open without hesitation
task switching happens the instant you
four fingers swipe between apps etc the
tablet performs consistently through
lightweight everyday tasks as well as
heavy graphic intensive stuff such as
gaming and multimedia playback the same
goes for the Nexus 7 with the
performance improvements brought with
project butter and the latest Android
update our short time running KitKat on
the Nexus 7 has been impressive we've
had no notable trouble with any lag or
freezing and the tablet has been
incredibly quick to respond to user
input its performance in gaming has been
great as well though the two were much
more comparable in real-world
performance the iPad Mini ran circles
around the Nexus 7 in the SunSpider
JavaScript test and other benchmarks
speaker performance is a nearly even
trade-off between these two tablets the
iPad Mini offers a more full sound with
a more notable low-end but the location
of the speakers especially in landscape
creates a sound bias to one side the
Nexus 7 speakers are located at opposite
ends of the tablet and are quite
difficult to accidentally cover though
they don't sound as full they're louder
and provide a true stereo experience we
haven't quite had the iPad Mini long
enough to thoroughly comment on battery
life so stay tuned for the full review
for more info on that we can however
recall that the iPad minis battery is
rated at 23.8 watt hours to the Nexus
7's 15 watt hour battery the Nexus 7 is
a tablet you will likely have to charge
every day with heavy usage or maybe
every other day on light usage if the
new mini lives up to the iPad standard
it should muster around 10 hours of
usage and only need to be charged every
day and a half to three days depending
on your usage cameras on tablets
admittedly aren't the most important
feature of the five megapixel cameras on
the back side of these two tablets it's
pretty clear which is the winner while
the new Nexus 7 provides a wider field
of view it's quicker to overexpose and
provide significantly less detail in
certain scenarios
the iPad Mini provides more true to life
colors but our contrasts and airs on the
warm side whereas the Nexus tends to
provide cooler less welcoming images
neither tablet is great at image sensing
but
we were to pick a winner it would
definitely be the iPad Mini
if we take all of this information and
add it up we're still missing one key
factor which above all else rules this
comparison price the 16 gigabyte iPad
Mini starts at $399 plus tax
jumping $100 per storage option up to
$6.99 for LTE connectivity simply add
130 dollars to each model meaning it can
go as high as 829 dollars the Nexus 7
starts at just $229 for 16 gigabytes 32
gigabytes is only $40 more and the most
expensive Nexus 7 32 gigabytes with LTE
retails for 349 dollars that means the
most expensive Nexus 7 is cheaper than
the least expensive iPad Mini and
there's much to be said for that a soos
and Google have created a tablet which
is comparable in almost every way to
Apple's premium iPad Mini yet sell it
for a fraction of the price in the end
if you're an iOS fan or have a hankering
for the uttermost premium small tablet
money can buy the iPad Mini is a no
brainer there is a virtually endless
supply of content and optimized apps and
games if instead you're after the
absolute best bang for your buck there
is no better tablet value currently out
there than the 2013 Nexus 7
period
