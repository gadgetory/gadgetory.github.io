among the rumored features of the galaxy
note 7 the one plus three even with more
RAM can't keep up with the galaxy s7
edge and it seems that wearables are
finally starting to gain traction I'm hi
melody vana I have my temporary studio
all set it took me a while to fix the
lights but you know what I forgot the
t-shirt this is parking out daily the
official news today as always begin with
deals as a Bryson's got a very
interesting one if you've got the cash
to buy a four-hundred-dollar or above
smartphone you are getting three hundred
dollars off yeah pretty much three
hundred dollars off the problem is it
doesn't really include all smartphones
like for example devices like the iPhone
as e which scratch that service or
obviously not included on the list but
you can learn more about the D on the
link in the description came of the
wearables have taken the longest of time
to gain traction according to centrist
analytics that is going to change in
2016 apparently these are going to grow
twenty-nine percent which is a crazy
amount when you consider the fact that
Fitbit has a reign supreme and mainly
not necessarily with the expense of
wearables now apparently the Apple watch
is changing that and we're just hoping
that Android wear just picks up the pace
as we continue to discover more things
about iOS 10 we talked yesterday about
the fact that now you can delete stock
applications great but the problem is
that you aren't really deleting these
according to craig federighi you get the
option to remove them from your home
screen if you don't want to see them but
apparently the applications are still
going to be there apparently some course
services require these applications to
exist so no you're not necessarily
uninstalling things so don't celebrate
buying a 16 gig iphone that's not going
to help you at all now one of the
biggest selling points for the one plus
three yesterday and the announcement was
the six gigabytes of RAM right now the
only other device that can do that
whenever it retails is the axon 7 and
one of its variants not the case of the
one plus three but there were some
recent comparisons between this device
and the galaxy s7 edge that you can
watch the full video on the link of the
description and yeah the gap see s7 edge
just demolishes the one plus three and
the speed at which applications are
launching the way you move around
but then again we have to remember that
the Galaxy s7 edge has been in the
market for a longer time we do
understand that one plus probably needs
to figure some things out and finally
the very hot if they have to do with the
galaxy note 7 as we continue to see
rumors of what to expect apparently
there will be some design changes with
the smartphone mainly because it'll
bring some sort of a ring around the
camera that's going to be called smart
glow the whole idea is to provide you
with notifications if your phones on its
back and it reminds us of the old
motorola v600 that you're gonna have to
look for it a Wikipedia because it's an
extremely old phone from back in the day
that had rings that would provide you
with notifications and it all sounds
cool it's something different a breath
of fresh air these days but it does lead
me to the question of the day do you
think that these things would make a
difference with the galaxy note 7
because in my case I do believe they do
I believe that the note lineup needs to
differentiate from the galaxy s lineup
which was not something that happened
last year but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know European friends
you know the way it goes if you want to
get these news earlier before the video
