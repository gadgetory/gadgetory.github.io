was pocketnow.com Tony's behind the
camera we're here at mwc just ends it's
a huawei show and this is not a fit fit
it is not a galaxy gear but they kind of
figured out a way to merge these
products together in a way because this
is the new huawei talk band and it is a
talk man but it's a very unique way of
bringing you talk functionality into a
band so this is pretty much like a
Fitbit you turn it on from here and you
navigate into calorie burning mode how
many hours of sleep you had you can also
I don't know measure I think your steps
I believe so there you go and it's we
really don't have any details on what
operating system it has or anything all
we know is this is a 99 arrow gadget
that you can pull out of here with this
button and it becomes a bluetooth
headset so if you get a phone call
obviously all you have to do is put it
in your ear and do phone calls with it
and again this is all paired to your
phone through bluetooth 4.1 so it's a
very interesting gadget it's a very
interesting concept I'm not sure how
many of you actually use a bluetooth
headset anymore it's one of those
gadgets that's not really common anymore
but you get caller ID here you get all
the information of who's you're talking
to and apparently it'll give you a full
day of battery life we have to obviously
confirm that there aren't sadly not many
details on this this is being sold along
with this media paddocks one and
apparently this will cost you 3 99 this
will cost you 99 but if you buy them
together you pay 450 arrows for both
these products so it's a really cool
concept you really don't have to make
phone calls with this thing if you don't
want to just use your arm band and one
of the coolest features that I find
about this product is the fact that this
is the USB connector so you don't have
to have a separate accessory to connect
this or charge this in any way so it's a
really cool gadget sadly it doesn't seem
to have a standard size and we've got
thick arms like I do you are going to
have a little trouble putting this thing
on I wish I could show it to you putting
it on but
I don't my arms are to think so we'll
see a business good product obviously we
can't wait to give it a try in my
particular case I do a lot of fitness so
I am very interested in this product
will keep you posted i am hi Natalie win
of pocketnow.com Tony behind the camera
hope you enjoy this hands-on give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
