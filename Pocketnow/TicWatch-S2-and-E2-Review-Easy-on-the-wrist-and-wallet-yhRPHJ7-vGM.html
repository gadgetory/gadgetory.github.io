weird place between luxurious and
affordable while there are people out
there who can definitely benefit from
having a smart wearable the barrier of
entry has often been too high for many
users to try them for the first time
tick watches tried to bridge this gap
with their s and E smartwatches and now
we have where 2.0 updated versions of
them that you might finally want to put
on your wrist this is PocketNow and I'm
Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody
and this is the tick watch s2 and also
the tick watch e - at first glance these
are too simple
all black plastic everything
smartwatches they may not appeal to
everyone looking for a fashion-forward
wearable in different colors or even
different materials but at least the
watches can basically fit in with any
wardrobe because of their minimalism
there are a few differences between the
two though while both watches have v ATM
underwater ratings only the s2 is
military grade
it certainly is the sport year of the
two with a little bit of carbon fiber in
the outer ring there's only one button
on the side which blends in a little bit
better on the s2 by being flatter rather
than sticking out like the round one on
the e2 I don't think one actually looks
that much better than the other both are
really easy to wear however I have been
using the s2 more than the e2 now maybe
a little goes a long way in terms of
design and the s2 does just enough to
make it a bit more unique compared to
the e2 now that extra durability though
will cost you a little bit extra money
both watches sport a 1.3 inch AMOLED
display that is plenty bright from many
situations and is used well with
always-on capabilities some storage in
the watch can be used for local audio
files and you can connect bluetooth
headphones directly to the watch one
thing is missing however NFC for
payments you might be worried about
battery life with these watches and
honestly for a good reason
after all hardly any smartwatches get
more than a couple of days of battery
life and even that is stretching it by
keeping these Snapdragon wear 2100 mah
boi do stifle any potential battery life
the 3100 might have brought to the new
watches thankfully there are bigger
batteries and either of these so battery
life is certainly better than it was
before the batteries of the e2 and the
s2 are able to get through a full day of
usage without any problems especially
under my specific settings now if you're
curious and you want to know how I
tweaked my smart watches for the kind of
usage and battery life that I need you
can
she check out my video on my channel
where I answer the question of who these
particular smartwatches are for the link
is in the card that's appearing right
now and it's also in the description
down below
now obviously none of these details
would matter if the day-to-day
experience were sullied by bad software
if you have been skeptical of wearables
because of Android wear this might be
the best time for you to dive into what
is now called where OS 2.0 the update
has done a great job of streamlining the
interface so that everything is easier
on the user for example not every
notification is its own damn card thank
God where OS 2.0 even brings a Google
now like feet to the left of the watch
face that gives you some useful
information in a quick manner Google
assistant is of course available for the
same functions you would expect on other
Google products like a Google home and
it is definitely good for setting
reminders and controlling smart home
devices swiping to the right gets you to
the different health and fitness
tracking details of which the tick
watches perform to a decent extent the
s2 in particular is better geared for
the elements because of its more durable
build but hiking running and swimming
are all good activities to use the heart
rate monitor and GPS functions of either
watch some updates are coming to the
maguey fitness apps that help with
automatic activity tracking but for now
our watches were able to at least tell
when I slowed down and I took a short
break during any given cardio activity
the heart rate monitor is not the
fastest sensor for things like
high-intensity interval training or hit
exercises but it is great for tracking
steady-state activities people truly
serious about tracking their specific
exercises and fitness goals can probably
find some good apps in the Play Store to
suit their needs but in all other cases
the tick watches are best suited for the
general active user if you are new to
the SmartWatch world maybe you should
consider that smart wearables sometimes
work best when you dial back the smart
part of the experience the tick watches
are great filters for your smartphone
because you get every notification to
your wrist and then you can decide what
to do from there the built-in microphone
works for voice dictation if you choose
to reply but otherwise you can decide
when you actually take your phone out
and do some work or you could just leave
the where it is in carry on it just so
happens that the watch is like the s2
and the e to have more to offer with
highly customizable watch faces activity
tracking wear OS 2.0 is goggle apps and
abilities and any apps you might find in
Playstore and it's all in a watch that
is light as a feather despite being a
little chunky with its surface area it
pretty much comes down to this you get
out of a SmartWatch what you put into it
but here you don't have to put too much
in of your money to experience where os
for yourself at 159 dollars the tick
watch E 2 is one of the most affordable
smartwatches available right now for
just another 20 bucks you can get the
more rugged s2
lavoy have done a great job of making an
entry-level SmartWatch that just about
anyone can enjoy so let us know what you
think about the tick watch s2 and e2 in
the comment sections down below if you
are not into smartwatches at all also
have that discussion with us and let us
know why smart wearables are not really
your thing the tick watch us - an E -
are a great jumping-off point they are
great entry-level smartwatches
so if you have never used one in the
past this might be one of the best ways
to do it without breaking the bank
but as always thank you so much for
watching and look forward to more not
only from pocket now but also from
myself you could subscribe to my channel
