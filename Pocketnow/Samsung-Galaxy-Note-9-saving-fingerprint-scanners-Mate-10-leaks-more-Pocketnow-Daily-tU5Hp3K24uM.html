Note 9 will ensure the fingerprint
scanner lives on leak certification show
us the possible ZTE axon and design and
we get more leaked images of what to
expect for the huawei mate 10 I'm Jaime
Rivera and yes for those of you that
want awesome t-shirts like these ripped
apparel follow the first link in the
comments and there is also a coupon code
for 10% off this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for a very good
SmartWatch that's on a crazy budget it
just got crazier the ZTE quartz is
currently on t-mobile for just 96 bucks
I don't think you can buy a SmartWatch
that's that good for that price or even
the price whenever it's not on sale you
can learn more about it in the
description
and speaking of ZT guess what just
crossed through the FCC none other than
the axon M and we noticed two things
number one that it's an AT&amp;amp;T device
number two two screens and I'm hoping
that it's not a Kyocera echo I'm hoping
that technology has gotten better up to
the point where that doesn't fall like
the echo if that's the whole purpose of
this design which should learn more very
soon now how about if we move the
spotlight over to other leaks now we've
got more images of what to expect from
the huawei mate 10 we get an image of
its front again the bezels are black
this time we're not exactly sure what
the color variations are going to be
here what's most important both cameras
20 megapixels in 23 and you know we
don't really care much about megapixels
but if there's one company that's really
figured out cameras these past two years
is Huawei so yeah bring on more
megapixels if you're gonna continue with
the same quality we can't wait to see it
and now let's talk about Microsoft
obviously with all the negative fanfare
over windows 10 mobile dying over the
weekend the company had to come up with
a statement over its future for hardware
and the company has confirmed the
surface is going to continue it's going
to live on we don't know exactly when
we're getting more surface units and
they've recently got a revamp but it's
great to see that it's laptop lineup is
going to continue I wish that they
actually meant that you know the surface
will continue how about a surface phone
running Android that'd be awesome and
finally the very hot news they have to
do with KGI once again and now the
Galaxy Note 9 and I know we're early but
there's a purpose for this bear in mind
number one there are predictions from
KGI that face ID is not going to reach
competitors until two and a half years
from now number two the fact that
competitors want to mimic face ID but
therefore apparently Samsung's plan B
for now is going to be that under the
display fingerprint scanner apparently
there are up to three suppliers that are
going to be providing this but it seems
that we're gonna have to wait until the
Galaxy Note 9 apparently the technology
is not going to be ready for the Galaxy
S nine and well that's kind of expected
I mean we've noticed how much synaptics
has fumbled with this whole technology
the reason why I didn't make it to the
iPhone 10 and whatever the case may be
but anyways it leads me to the question
today do you think it would be smart for
Samsung to push for this technology and
wait until the note 9 or do you think
that it would be smart for us to get it
on the Galaxy S 9 like right now in my
case I feel that the Galaxy S 9 needs to
bring something more than just an
iterative design and this would be it in
my opinion leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know what you think
