calm we're gonna take a quick software
tour of the HTC 7 pro now this is the
unlocked no branding European version of
the--some Pro so there's nothing carry
specific here but here we have our
lockscreen and it was off it obviously
customized by HTC that's a nice scent
style background and here we have the
Start screen the first four are
Microsoft specific Windows Phone tiles
but you know the the OEM can customize
the next four so we've got the HTC hub
there the photo enhancer the Sox and
then we have four more Microsoft ones
and then pictures music videos and down
here we have convertor and connection
setup so if you look at that this will
detect your SIM card but I don't have
one in there and it'll set up the
connection settings here's the converter
it's just a nice little utility for
converting units and we have stocks this
is pretty cool
and this one will go to landscape pretty
nicely
you got your photo enhancer this is a
really cool filter plugin for the camera
so we can show you that you can choose a
bunch of different styles of altering
the photo there we go here's the HTC hub
with your live tile it shows the weather
would go to that launches with some
animation you've probably seen this
before got your big clock weather and
some featured apps here yeah we could
see some more apps this is just once the
HTC recommends some of them are free
most of the HTC ones are free for HTC
devices like there's a special YouTube
app and we can download those separately
the other part of the HTC hub that's
cool is the weather
you can flick through and get a lot of
animation so there you go
that's about it with the hub see what
else we have last thing the HDC included
is the sound enhancer so we can go to
SRS and that's about it for the options
there now let me show you some of the
things to happen when we do the
slide-out keyboard yep that's right
nothing happened
so if you used to do in landscape mode
with a really really nice keyboard like
what we've got here some of the things
you're gonna have to turn your head a
little bit for because we don't have
landscape support in a lot of these
programs however Internet Explorer we do
have an address bar so you can type a
URL other versions of Windows Phone 7 do
not have an address bar in landscape
mode which is interesting we can do our
search that'll work in landscape pretty
nice you gotta put your finger up there
to get your cursor in there it's like
email and text messaging will work
those are good
we'll go over more about how landscape
support in Windows Phone 7 compares to
you know older Windows Mobile versions
in another video but right now this is
what you get
with the HTC 7 pro if you enjoyed this
video give us a thumbs up and that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
