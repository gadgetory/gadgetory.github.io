pocketnow.com and today I'm going to
show you a new panel for the sony
ericsson xperia x1 and the program is
called Evernote and this is an online
service that you'll need to sign up for
and it's free and i'll post a link in
parking at commis to how to do this when
i'm done in this video so the first
thing you'll see is it gives us five
options allows us to upload a text note
and ink note a snapshot and audio note
in an up and to upload a file so first
we're going to text a note and upload
that okay so if we wanted to upload a
text note we just select here and then
we can just type this is just a t9
program that allows you to type pretty
easily on your screen so if wanted to
say hey what's up
and that's pretty easy and when you
click done it'll automatically upload
and as you can see here it says upload
finished and will automatically upload
to evernotes website so now we can go to
inc note and this is where it allows you
to actually write a note so if i wanted
to say hey how are you doing and of
course i don't have the best handwriting
but typing and doing it pretty fast so
cool thing about this program is allows
you to select whatever you've written so
it gives you a lasso tool kind of like
in Microsoft Paint so you can change the
color of your text so one change the
color and give a like red or something
like that lets us change we can also
change the size of the line so anywhere
from this huge one all the way down to
this very tiny fine one so this one's
pretty good it also gives you advanced
feature so you can cut and copy and
paste and you can paste other ones as
well so you can change those different
colors and when you click done it will
automatically upload and it says uh
protocol feature about this program is
snapshot which automatically launches
the camera so if you click on that it
will launch the camera but I'm not going
to do it right now because it's just
laying on the table so we can also send
an audio note so if we want to say hey
this is dan just wanted to let you know
that we need some milk okay and you can
add a title if you want so if I just
want to say a milk add that there and
then done and it will automatically
upload the audio file so that's another
cool feature about this program it also
upload files so if I want just to send
it to want it to post a picture online i
can click one here select it and add a
title so spring and then done again and
it'll automatically upload as well so
another cool feature out this program is
that allows us to scour recent notes so
we can go here and view all of our
recent notes so if we wanted to say go
on this one right here just double click
and before i've heard that people say
they couldn't edit at ever notes on
their windows mole device but you can on
this one so it's actually pretty neat so
if you wanted to actually edit something
you can so hey what's up and let's say I
wanted to add a question mark there so
there we go and then done and it will
edit it online as well so another cool
feature about this program is if you go
into settings you can actually get some
sort of like geocaching so it's just
loading stuff right now and I'll show
you your total monthly usage and you can
use up to forty megabytes on a free
account so we'll go down per month that
is and you can also use GPS if you
wanted to set up that so that gives you
some sort of like geocaching so you can
see where your pictures are taken or
where your note was taken from so as you
can see after logging into the evernotes
website we actually have all of the
notes that we posted from our xperia x1
goal we can go in and edit them as well
so if one to change some things we can
change the colors and pretty much do
exactly everything that we could do on
the phone and then more and we'll just
cancel this and go back and it allows
you to delete and email and you can
print them as well so that is the
evernote xperia x1 panel and i will post
a link on pacquiao com has how to get
this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
