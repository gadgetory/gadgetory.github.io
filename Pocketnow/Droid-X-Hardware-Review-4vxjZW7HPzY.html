pocket now calm and this is the hardware
review of the motorola droid x on
verizon wireless let's take a look so
before we get started something
interesting is that happening i'm
sitting at my computer the moto droid x
was on standby and suddenly I hear droid
you know from the droid commercials and
confused I turn on the phone I look to
see if there's any sort of pop-up
notification nothing is there although I
do have this eyes staring at me I turned
on the droid x live wallpaper three
hours later the exact same thing happens
I think it is something to do with this
live wallpaper if you happen to know why
this droid is saying droid every couple
of hours please leave a comment because
it's weird and really confusing anyway
let's talk about the motorola droid x
this device is absolutely large
unapologetically large it's got a 4.3
inch display although oddly it looks
slightly smaller than what you would
find on the HTC hd2 and that is because
droid x is slightly taller and less wide
because the resolution is actually 854
down by 480 across instead of 800 down
and for AV across as you find on a ton
of high-end devices these days so up
here we have an LED notification light
which is super handy to have a lot of
phones miss out on this up here we also
have the proximity sensor and the light
sensor there is the speaker so motorola
branding really thin bezel which is
quite nice and then we have hardware
buttons which is great because a lot of
phonies don't have hardware buttons but
I wish that Android manufacturers would
standardize the layout of the buttons I
mean you could go to 10 different
Android devices they would all have
different layouts so here on the google
nexus one the back button is on the left
whereas the home button is second from
the right just something to relearn if
you're used to android you're going to
have to relearn where the buttons are
not a big deal here is the microphone
microphone one of three and i'll talk
about why it has three microphones in
just a minute over on the side we get
this hump for the camera so it's kind of
a way that they were able to keep the
the rest of the body pretty thin at
about nine point nine millimeters they
extended this area over here is micro
USB for syncing and charging and HDMI
type D now this is important because you
don't have to go out and buy the cable
or the the the dock for the droid x or
even for the evo 4G these are the only
two devices that have hdmi out you can
actually just search ebay for a type D
connector that cost between five and ten
bucks you get it home and you can
connect your flat panel or projector
we're going to do a video about that
coming soon but very nice that the droid
x has the hdmi output here's for the
lanyard going around the side yes a
camera button a dedicated camera button
and it's really in a good place on the
droid x because you can hold that hold
the device like so and put your fingers
on this side of the the device and it's
a dual action camera button so press
wants to focus and all the way down to
take the picture this works for video as
well very nice addition and then the
volume rocker is on the right side kind
of unconventional most devices will have
it on the other side but not too big of
a deal on the back here we have a dual
LED flash with an eight megapixel camera
it takes 720p video where and talk more
about video quality in a future video
there's a microphone up here and a
microphone up down here again I'll talk
about that in a sec here is the speaker
grill to pop off the back battery cover
very easy just slides down get the soft
touch rubber on the back and the back
side of the bed of the battery cover is
metal nice material overall in hand the
device in my opinion feels a little bit
cheap because it just has a light weight
about it and it's so large and typically
when a device is lightweight and large
it feels a little bit cheap compared to
say the iphone which is small and heavy
it feels high quality so it's a matter
of personal preference I've heard other
people say that the droid x feels
extremely high quality so it may it may
feel differently too now let's talk
about why there are three microphones
well these to this end and this are
forward noise cancellation and we're
going to post a video or actually a
sound
track showing the droidx performing
canceling noise in various situations
then extra mic on the back is for the
video feature that lets you switch
between the scenes here I'll show you so
I'm gonna turn on the device let's give
you a preview of the software here and
if we go to camcorder go into landscape
we can go into what's called scenes and
there are four different scenes and they
use different microphones so this is
called everyday best for capturing video
with audio from all directions so this
will probably take an audio from all
three microphones to the right we have
outdoors bet best for capturing video
outside reduces wind noise so presumably
this will use the top and the back
microphone to do some noise cancellation
and also hone in on the audio behind the
camera swiping to the right we've
narrative best for capturing video while
commenting on the scene so obviously it
will use the microphone in the front and
finally subject bet for capturing video
with audio from the front of the camera
so this will probably utilize just one
microphone in the front it won't use the
noise cancellation the trouble with
scenes is that you can't flip between
them when you're filming so I'm going to
press this down and I'm filming right
now I can't do anything I can't change
the scene I can only stop and start the
recording so that's a little bit
annoying I wish they'd have made this
process automatic it's kind of cool that
there are three microphones but it's a
very manual process you have to stop and
say okay should I use the mic on the
back and the mic on the front but it's
unique no other device has three
microphones are pretty cool so overall
the droid x is an interesting offering
in terms of hardware I like the hardware
buttons the three microphones the camera
button and the large screen of course as
I mentioned I feel that the device is a
little bit low quality feeling but
that's a very subjective thing overall
the the build quality looks to be good
when you look around the edges of the
phone motorola makes a decent devices so
you really don't need to worry about the
phone falling apart on you so that was a
look at the hardware on the motorola
droid x will be back soon with many
other videos video tests of the photo
quality in the video quality noise
cancellation talk about the software and
more comparisons with other devices be
