and ever since last year it has become
an integral part of many of our lives
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and
this is how you make the most of Google
now Google announced its digital
assistant service Google now at its IO
conference last summer and it has been
upgrading and improving the capabilities
and reliability of the service ever
since many of us here PocketNow have
come to use and rely on Google now each
and every day but you may be wondering
what the hype is all about what makes
Google now so great and how can you make
the most of Google's automated assistant
service naturally Google now resides
beneath the home button and is easily
accessible from anywhere within the
system it's only one quick swipe away
that is if you use a nexus if you use
another device like the HTC One or
galaxy s4 now maybe access by holding
the home or menu button and if you use
an iOS device simply download the Google
Search app from the App Store and login
once you get inside you are met with a
search bar at the top followed by a
scrolling list of information cards that
are updated and changed based on your
preferences and needs to choose what
shows in cards and periodically in the
notification shade scroll to the bottom
press the action overflow button and
select settings you can toggle
individual cards or notifications and in
the my stuff sub menu you can set
important places like your home or
workplace your favorite sports teams or
the companies whose stocks you want to
follow
The Voice submenu in settings is an area
few seem to explore in here you can able
hot word detection which like now
available from Google calm and chrome
enables you to say Google from within
now to begin a voice search you can also
determine how Google now will react when
you have a Bluetooth device connected it
will record audio either through the
headset or through the phone's built-in
microphone
lastly the phone search submenu is where
you can include or exclude specific apps
from Google search results but enough
about settings how can you improve your
Google now experience how can it become
more useful for you first make sure
you're using the correct Google Account
for Google now synchronize the Google
account you use in Chrome either on your
computer or smartphone with the Google
account you use with now to see related
news stories and now or for more
information on products you may have
researched I did a lot of research
before buying my new car so now is
recommending reviews and other
information on the Scion fr-s without me
having to lift a finger
I also google searched Instagram a few
times earlier this week
now Instagram related articles are
intermittently appearing in Google now
this will happen for items or terms that
you frequently searched for and Google
will learn various things about you such
as the sports teams you like and
automatically provide game information
and live score updates in the form of
cards and notifications if you use the
same account for everything disabling
future cards about these items or topics
is as simple as pressing the information
button on the card and selecting No
another helpful tip is to make sure your
online shopping accounts are sending
emails to the correct gmail account I
purchased a lot of items from Amazon and
as soon as the shipping confirmation
email hits my inbox a card with the
tracking information will appear and now
where I can view a map of the packages
history and see the most recent update
and estimated delivery date Google now
isn't solely for consuming information
and performing searches though it also
works for creation open Google now and
say Google followed by create a calendar
entry or set a reminder you can also set
timers and alarms using the same method
or you can place a call send a text
message or even email straight from
Google now when you create a calendar
entry for an appointment be sure to
enter an address and Google will tell
you when you need to leave to make your
appointment on time based on travel time
and traffic and if you get bored there
are several Easter eggs that should keep
you occupied not every feature works in
all parts of the world then even we
haven't been able to get some cards to
work such as the card that displays how
far you've walked at the end of each
month but the best thing you can do to
improve your google now experience is to
open it up every so often and discover
what it's doing for you automatically it
will suggest TV shows movies and even
new albums based on your search queries
it will provide local events based on
your geographical location which
definitely comes in handy on those
weekends out of town that's going to do
it for this video so if you enjoyed it
or found it helpful be sure to click the
like button and subscribe so you can see
more videos like this in the future
until next time I'm Taylor Martin and
have a great weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
