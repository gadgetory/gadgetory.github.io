for a little while Apple has had what's
called Siri Siri is a really cool
personal assistant for your iphone 4s
that some people have hacked into other
versions of other phones well what do
you have on android luckily now we've
got clues e let's see if it stacks up to
siri apple recently introduced siri
which is kind of an intelligent
assistant you can use your voice to ask
questions well android hasn't had that
they've had iris which was kind of an
attempt to do what Siri does but didn't
do all that great now they have clues e
CL you Cee which is really kind of
interesting and very similar to what
Siri can do let's go ahead and try a few
things for example let's say I'm locked
out of my house find a locksmith using
plain language I can quickly and easily
talk to my phone it then uses my
internet connection so it uses my
location to find local locksmiths now
what's interesting is these locksmiths
are seemingly organized alphabetically
rather than according to distance or
possibly by hours we can tap on the nice
little push pin or place marker icon to
what to open up a nap so I can see where
they're rather open up a map to see
where they are go ahead and go back
that's one thing that I don't like when
you go back it really reads you the
screen that you were just on I kind of
know what I just read so maybe that's a
little redundant okay let's see what
else we can do like what's the weather
like again very plain language questions
snow in the morning then cloudy with
snow likely in the afternoon little or
no accumulation highs in the lower 40s
northwest winds 15 to 25 mph chance of
precipitation sixteen percent so other
than getting a couple words wrong like
the lower 40s rather than the lower 40s
and northwest winds instead of northwest
winds pretty good this is in fact very
representative of what my men are
supposed to be like today so i think i'm
going to bundle up and stay inside let's
go back another cool thing that clue z
has is your own personal lot diet diary
i guess is a good way to say it whether
you can track your caloric intake so
let's go ahead and tell clues you that i
just had lunch add food Big Mac so not
all foods are recognized in this case it
was a relatively large name brand but we
can come back and do other cool stuff so
from here we can set up custom food so
we can look up Big Mac and find out how
many calories are in it and add that to
our diary but we can do stuff like add
food pizza so here's my health planner I
can now choose what pizza I had and
let's say i had pizza with beans and
vegetables which honestly I don't know
why anyone would try that but hey it's
in there let's go ahead and choose that
I had one serving which is one small
8-inch diameter pizza serving size 337
grams so kind of cool 789 calories wow
those are really caloric beans we're
going to go ahead and add that and now
what you can see here is all of the
nutrient information of stuff that I
have eaten today I can keep track of my
exercise to find out how many calories
I've burned I can set up goals and I can
see what my net change was so if I'm
eating more than I'm exercising I'm
getting fatter and if I'm exercising
more than I'm eating i'm getting thinner
kind of cool and especially you can do
that right here from a voice recognition
type app to
it to make adding stuff a lot easier so
overall really kind of neat it can do
much of the same things that Siri can
although it is a little bit slower and
it is a little bit rough around the
edges the developer has been very very
quick to respond to issues and problems
there were initial reports of force
closes most of those have been fixed
there's still a little bit of bugs that
you're going to run into but overall a
very very good attempt at replicating
what Siri can do on Android I really dig
it I think you will to head out to the
Android Market and search for clues e
that spelled CLU zeee or go over to
pocketnow.com and we will have a link
directly to the android market so you
can download it directly to your
android-powered device if you like
seeing this kind of video where we're
showing off cool new voice recognition
technologies make sure you give the
video a big thumbs up and if you haven't
yet subscribed to our video channel
you're probably missing out on a lot of
other cool videos so make sure that you
do that and tell your friends about us
as well 4-pocket now showing off cool
