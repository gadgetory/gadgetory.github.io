sensor and launch dates the HTC m8 ace
images sleek and we try to figure out
what it is reports have the sony xperia
z2 giving customers problems already I'm
hi I'm every bit I and yes we are just
four days away from the weekend guys
right this is parking out daily let's
begin today with some official news if
we could call him that way because they
were kind of hidden as Apple is just
hired amazon a9 expert from search to
improve things on maps and this would
not be the first expert they hire this
would be the second one aside from other
hires from other services as we know
that Apple plans to improve maps on iOS
8 finally as it turns out this person
will apparently improve baptists ID from
also improving search on the app stores
and iTunes stores which would definitely
be great let's see how that goes now
let's talk about LG and its G watch as
this would be the first Android wear
device to reach the market and that's
actually both good and bad it's good
because first of all if you look at the
photos there are no buttons on this
watch so we really want to see how LG
plans to implement this watch most
likely they'll have some sort of like
knock knock feature that we currently
already see on the G lineup and is
actually terrible but aside from that
the sad part about this watch is the
fact that the band is really really
cheesy really bad I mean it's a simple
plain rubber band that's teenage focus I
mean it doesn't look anything like the
Moto 360 so too bad this would be the
first android wear SmartWatch now how
about sony is we've got some good and
bad news on the good side we've got more
reports than sony is working on a
Windows Phone 8.1 device that might
launch in July when the first GDR
updates reach which is really
interesting as we've been waiting for
this for the longest time I mean the
Sony Xperia line I've actually started
with Windows Mobile so this would be the
smart move but anyways on the bad side
people are already complaining of the
Sony Xperia z2 first of all overheating
when they're filming 4k video and
they're also complaining about apps
crashing and even some gaps in the
hardware which is really odd for Sony so
um hopefully they will address this will
keep you posted when I review
unit arrived let's talk about hccs we
got some league photographs celeb
leagues that show us an HTC am-8 or HTC
m8 a civ that can actually even be
pronounced and then it turns out when we
look at the renders this actually looks
a lot like the HTC One m8 and it's
really hard to know exactly how is this
phone going to differentiate from the
actual One m8 that we currently know
good apparently the phone will be the
same size as the one I made so this is
not the one m8 mini or the one m8 max
god I hate these names but let's see how
it goes with this ace device and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
we get more reports on what to expect
from the iWatch first of all a possible
launch between august-september and this
is really interesting as apparently iOS
8 will focus a lot on health but it
doesn't really make sense unless there's
a wearable product to take the health
data for you so the iWatch will most
probably be announced at WWDC and then
it will be launched within that
timeframe but apparently this SmartWatch
will include a UV sensor that will tell
you if you're being exposed to much to
sunlight which will probably go off like
crazy in my country you know how it is
in the tropics but anyways you know it's
really interesting to see how Apple
plans to make or differentiate the
SmartWatch from everything else that's
coming out there but at least we to the
question of the day um how else do you
think that UV sensor would help you in
any way because in my particular case I
mean seriously here the Sun is so hot
that it will probably just go off like
crazy I'm not sure exactly how that
plans to work or make a SmartWatch
better could probably just a gimmick but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
