come this is part three of the video
review of the
son I 760 today we're going to take a
look at the typing with the keyboard and
using the stylus now let's take a look
at the qwerty keyboard so we flip the
device over and bring the keyboard out I
don't know if how well you can see it
with this much light but there's
actually a backlight under the keys and
a very nice feature is that you can set
the backlight on off by schedule so if
you only want it at night it will only
turn on during the times the schedule is
set or in conjunction with the screen
timer the numeric keypad is very handy
when you want to type in numbers you
don't have to use the function key to
activate the numbers on the qwerty
keyboard there is also as you can see no
arrow keys on the qwerty keyboard you
actually use the d-pad for that which
actually I find works quite well there
are three dedicated keys on the keyboard
a key that brings up the messaging
application the start menu and the ok
there's also a symbol feature which
actually brings up a symbol chart on the
screen and then you select the symbol
you want with the numeric keypad so i'll
show you how that works if i bring up
the mail application and let's say i'm
going to create a new message and we'll
go down here to the text area of the
message and I'll hit function symbol you
can see there are grids that show up and
the grids associate the symbols to a
number on the numeric keypad they're
actually 22 grid so let's say I want a
forward slash it would be the number one
I press one and then hit spacebar and
that goes away this is a very nice
feature all in all I'm very impressed
with the key layout of this device
one of the strengths of the i760 is
really the one handed operation you can
dial easily with the numeric keys you've
got the access to the d-pad with your
thumb you also have the soft function
keys and you also have a clear here and
the Start menu can be accessed from the
side one key that I don't like the
placement of is the ok button which is
right next to the end call button I just
find that it's too low for my thumb to
reach down and I use the ok button next
quite a bit the camera button on the
bottom is sucked out of the way and I
like that so you don't accidentally turn
the camera on the stylus on the side is
actually a very nice location it's easy
to pull out you don't have to flip the
device to get the stylus out either at
the top or the bottom and it retracts
easily so it's a good fit I know that it
won't fall out and with your nails it's
actually quite easy to pull out it's a
it's a very sturdy design so that's it
for the use of the keyboard and the
stylus and I'll be back with part 4 in
the included software next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
