term for what we've seen so far from
most manufacturers but not so for HTC
i'm michael fisher from pocket now
reporting from london with a quick look
at the gold HTC one the gold HTC one
we've just been given a glimpse at here
at the HTC frequencies event it came in
a Pelican case with twin locks and if
that weren't enough it was also guarded
by a pretty burly dude so it probably
comes as no surprise that one these
devices won't see wide availability and
two yes they're made with real gold 18
karat gold plating to be specific glazed
with a special clear coat for scratch
protection the combined weight of the
gold and protective coating only adds an
additional four grams of mass to this
version of the one but it adds quite a
bit of value
HTC says the street value of this device
is in the neighborhood of two thousand
seven hundred fifty pounds or about four
thousand US dollars you won't find one
on retail shelves though only five of
these are being produced with two being
allocated to winners of the MOBO Awards
one going to marketing purposes another
being circulated for demos like this one
and the last assigned to a secret
mission will likely hear about soon
so if 18 karat gold plated phones are
the kind of things that razzle your
berries you might want to keep your ear
to the ground in the forthcoming days
for news out of HTC until then once
again i'm michael fisher with pocket now
at the HTC frequencies event in london
stay tuned for more in the days and
weeks ahead
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
