weekly hello and welcome to episode 006
of the pocket now weekly the once a week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss news and opinion from the world
of mobile technology from smart phones
to tablets two phablets everything in
between I'm your host Michael Fisher
contributing editor at pocket now as
always I'm joined or as usually I'm
joined by our managing editor and Tandy
Naja good afternoon to you sir good
morning to you guys good morning
everybody and back with us again this
week editor-in-chief Brandon minimun
good morning my Pennsylvania friend hey
guys we are we are back as a team we
have no guest this week Joe joined us
last week we're going to have some more
more guests in the future but first
things first I'm recording from a
special location this week listeners on
a different computer with a different
microphone so if I sound different
that's why I'm also in a different room
because I'm in long island new york
where i'm working from this week which
will become relevant again in a second
second things i'd like to announce very
excited to announce that we are on
stitcher the pocket now weekly podcast
is now available on stitcher if you have
not heard of that application it is
available on well webos but also Android
and I believe iOS I discovered it on on
webos in 2009 and it's a really great
podcasting app if you are a fan of
streaming instead of downloading files
directly so we are officially on
stitcher also just in a little bit of
site news the android guy weekly video
series Joe Levi's series has been sort
of promoted to version two point oh I
guess you'd call it this it's now called
Android power user it's still hosted by
joe but it's got a lot of new sort of
deluxe features and it's way more
awesome than it already was so it's it's
sort of changed its focus from a video
editorial column to a show that aims to
turn regular Android users into Android
power users am I getting that right
Brandon Tony yeah absolutely cool so you
should check it out listeners if you
have not already
it's awesome Joe is awesome and things
are awesome it's sunny here it's nice
i'm in a good mood and go ahead brennan
that how did you know i was about to say
something oh you heard your sharp intake
of breath no i think so i think the
purpose behind the show's power user
series is for someone to literally start
at the beginning and every video sort of
built upon the previous video so it can
be like a sort of guide to just learning
more about android so it's like a serial
like it's like a serialized television
show I was like yeah watch the beginning
episode and then watch it all the way
through we uh we also listeners have a
lot of listener mail today which is
awesome thank you so much for it we're
not going to get to all of it because
they're there actually is quite a bit
more than there was last week and we
really love these pieces of mail and
we'll find a way to answer the ones we
don't answer on the air but we kind of
have to be quick so before we get
started Brandon do you have anything
before we begin I do actually have
something rom so and it's actually a
it's more like a question for you
Michael and and I you know I don't think
Tony what would would actually uses this
app that I'm about to talk about so I I
look on facebook and I see often Michael
Fisher posting pictures and the pictures
are always you know that brownish color
which means it was taken with instagram
and i and i emailed him the other day
and I said Michael why not just post the
clean picture and Michael said well its
got a bunch of fun photo filters and I
said okay so I took out my one x and i
went into the camera app and it had a
bunch of fun filters i went into the
galaxy s3 into the camera app and it had
a bunch of fun filters then i thought
back to the HTC touch diamond of two
thousand five or six and that had a
bunch of interesting vote bunch of photo
feature so my question is what is it
what is it about Instagram number one
and number two why is it better to post
a brown picture then a clean picture i
don't i don't get instagram i will
answer myself after Michael just so you
know I do use but not Instagram I use
something else
oh well for me um I didn't know what
Instagram was until it was ported to
android and then I wrote an editorial
about it is probably one of my first
ones in my first month and I you know
Instagram at first glance is about the
filters and some people hate it because
it kind of makes people feel as though
they can compose artsy photographs when
they can't and you know I'm included in
that I'm an amateur completely and so
yeah that's what people first think
about when the thing of Instagram is
like oh that's how you make digital
photos look like they've been sitting
out in the Sun for 20 years which is
great and you know that's cool and
that's hipstery and whatever that's
that's not why I love Instagram though I
use Instagram because of the social
network that backs it up which I really
hope Facebook doesn't destroy because
I've learned that um you know when you
post photos on Instagram and you hashtag
them so they're indexable and searchable
you can do that I always attached like
20 hashtags to my photos and it's like
this was taken in Greenport Long
Islander this was taken and you know
Boston and you tap Boston is the hashtag
and every other photo that anyone has
taken on instagram with the hashtag
Boston shows up and it's like oh wow
yeah I've been there and what other
photos do you have random user oh
they're amazing too hey let's follow
each other and just see photos I did the
simplicity of that of that model is just
like you are posting photos other people
are posting photos photos are pretty to
look at lets everyone look at each
other's pretty photos that's what I love
Instagram so how often do you sit there
and click on the Boston hashtag or
category and and look through other
pictures people taken is this this has
happened once a week for you or is it is
it more often or less often um like it
you it used to be like a once a week
thing now it happens daily I mean now
I'm kind of more obsessed with Instagram
then then I have been with Facebook or
with not with twitter twitter i'm still
blows away so we've noticed ya know it's
true i mean but it's because it's fun
like it's simple there's nothing you
know its people aren't generally using
it to post apps or games or other all
the other crap you can run into on
facebook it's just photos and it sets
the scene it's the same kind of thing
like why one would look through their
twitter stream and see what other people
are doing it's the same kind of thing
it's the same kind of thing but you know
if you're lazy or if you need
stimulation I love listen I love reading
I love text I love writing but sometimes
you just want to look at a picture and
you don't want to read words and
Instagram is perfect for that and just
are you not on it Brandon I downloaded
the app and I signed up I think I don't
really know if actually signed up I
don't know if ective Lee or not you
rented a user I'm not sure I might I
might become one cuz you know you sound
pretty intrigued by it and and you use
it a good bit so I might take a look I
can get abusive about about about
Instagram what about you Tony what's
your response there I signed up and I
gave it a shot but at what I didn't like
about Instagram is that it only allows
you to apply filters while cropping the
picture to a square format and anyway
yeah that's really something i really
don't like so i'm using an application
which is in myself free applications for
iOS it's called camera plus it's an
application which not only allows you to
take great pictures because it has
options like separate metering for focus
and light but it also has some somehow
should i say hipster or aged picture
effects which occasionally i like to
apply of course not on all of my
pictures every tenth or fifteenth and I
love taking photographs and I have
something similar on the Nokia 808
PureView so yeah i'm using effects but
not for the social purpose but only for
my personal purpose of having a picture
look aged and composition and lighting
and the artistic stuff that actually
there is that that feature of instagram
that they call luna or whatever they
call it that I don't know you know I I
don't know what it's called but it just
applies this artificial HDR a kind of
effect to it and a lot of times it looks
crappy but sometimes it just makes an
okay photo into it that's from fatal
frame yeah it does so sorry Brandon were
you gonna say something uh well Tony was
talking about camera plus and I think
that was actually one of my first iphone
apps and it interestingly let you map
the volume plus button to take the pic
of course Apple integrated to iOS 5 big
leap is that the same app Tony then yeah
is
Lee and the the table and I'll switched
it back so it's a layout again Hassan oh
it's kind of nice icon yeah the only
problem is that it's not fully
integrated like when you go to the lock
screen on the iPhone and you have that
camera icon which you can slide up in a
windows phone 7 style it just doesn't
integrate with that but that aside it's
it's awesome it's not answering man yeah
it's not yeah definitely not I have a
small ramp myself at the beginning i'll
try to keep it short I'm not sure
whether to laugh this out or to be
pissed about it regardless of what sorry
what the phone or a tablet i'm using
regardless of make model platform
whether if its european / UK or a USA
version so i'm always two or three
updates behind of course this is
happening because probably i'm committed
to stock and this would be a textbook
example used by probably the entries
power user you mentioned of how to not
stick the stock or why not the sticks is
to stick the stock but i'm always behind
then hi my shot me an email the other
day and he asked me about hey Tony did
you get the update on your HTC One X and
I said guess what I'm still two updates
behind did you get this update for
Galaxy S free no I did I just got the
update which brings the light display
brightness slider to my notification
tray so no I'm always 23 updates behind
and rent uh why I mean these are OTA
updates there safe and official why
aren't you updating your own I'm not
getting notifications I'm always getting
no update available for your current
device is that because of your location
is that because you're in Romania I'm
not sure maybe it has something to do
with that but i'm using european UK
phones so it should maybe they're seeing
a sim card which is of course located in
Romania but the ROM itself is UK rom and
once UK gets the roll out i should get
it to guess what I'm not do you think
that the I mean I don't know much about
the OTA the back end OTA stuff guys like
is are the OTA pushes dictated by where
your device is actually located or I
think it depends on the
you are using and because there are
several grams for different regions I
think that the system looks at the
region you are in and the region which
is running the region code of the rom
you're running on your device that's
curious I mean I've been thinking about
that a little bit more recently because
I wrote that piece on emergency
broadcast text messages which aren't
text messages at all they are you know a
different format and their scent not to
not to you based on your phone number or
where your phone is expected to be but
what sell your phone is actually
connected to so I wonder if it's
something like that operate our messages
you say yes yeah well there'd be other
operator messages yeah i don't know i'm
not sure you guys have this in the
states here in Romania and I'm sure lots
of other regions too we had this thing
on a local carrier that depending on
which cell tower you are connected to
the phone displays not only the carrier
name but also the neighborhood you are
in and sometimes the street name so each
cell tower has a specific name to it and
it's usually carrier minus and the
neighborhood or carrier minus street
name no like there was a wholesome know
that there was a whole like underground
industry of forum members on message
boards here in the states who would like
go out and map their local cell sites
just so they would know when they had
coverage because we I would love to have
that but no we don't I did that once
actually it's fun you just go to the
base of a cell set and look at the signs
on it and you're like oh that's what
carriers on this thing if you're a real
pro you can look at the panel's but I
can't do that anyway so let's uh let's
move on I mentioned a little earlier
that I'm on Long Island part of the
reason for that has become that it was
it's much closer to New York City than
Boston and that came in handy yesterday
when I attended the galaxy note 10.1
launch event which i posted about today
and yesterday and it's just been kind of
the big news of the middle of the week
so this it a loan I've talked a little
bit to to Tony and Brandon about it and
you know I kind of
and I had a really great time and I met
some some cool people the device I just
don't know what to think about the
device yet I was waiting in line for a
review in it and there's one of the
Samsung guys was kind of talking to me
and he asked me well what did I think
and I was like you know this is one of
those things where I need I think I need
a solid week with it to even decide how
I initially feel about it so it's
lacking the wow factor yeah it doesn't
have a giant wow factor for me know but
you know there have been other devices
that have been like that like the Nexus
7 where I was like I do not care about
this and I don't want to write about it
and then it comes to my door and I'm
like oh this is great you know so I'm
hesitant to say that it's a
disappointment it's not a disappointing
device to me from it's just something
I'm not sure about yet I am glad in one
respect that it is not a galaxy tab with
a with a stylist I don like it was I
think when you saw tony in Barcelona was
that was at the case this initial pass
at it no the outer aspect of the tablet
does remained unchanged so it's
basically the same casing which I saw in
Barcelona with the front firing speakers
and all yeah and that's because of the
lawsuit which is between Samsung and
Apple and it came originated the idea
from Germany when they came up with the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 M which was the
first one if i recall well to have front
facing speakers and of course to to
avoid future litigation they probably
applied that as a standard to future
tablets oh that was the galaxy did that
was a galaxy tab 10.1 and that was the
first one with for the front firing
speakers that are if i recall well yes
yeah I think you're right see that is
something that I want to talk about um
in the future and not too far in the
future i love front firing speakers like
that alone that feature alone on a phone
or a tablet will instantly like boost it
a point just in my personal scaling
system you know for my personal use yeah
speakers around back are a necessity at
the moment and they're just one of the
worst things ever though like whenever
i'm watching netflix on a tablet or on
phone which is often you know having to
do that stupid thing where you cup your
palms on the factory
all the time but sometimes I go into the
kitchen and get like a bowl and try and
I can tap you and I'm just like this is
ridiculous i'm going to watch us on TV
no it's just nuts and unless you want to
put in headphones when i used to work at
nextel with the display is the display
tables for the phones had holes in them
and there were holes with like steel
pipes that we could put the phone mounts
into and at any given time there were
many empty pipes so we would take these
next cell phones with these giant aft
firing speaker phones which were just
absurdly loud and you put him over one
of these pipes in the table and it was
like it was like a poor man's subwoofer
it was ridiculous on that same note and
share many of our listeners who have the
LG optimus 7 first wave Windows Phone
know this but LG decided to go with a
joint speaker / headset so the same
speaker is used when you are talking to
somebody for listening to their voice
and the same is used when you are
listening to music by Xun or Spotify so
it's a front-facing speaker oh yeah
that's really cool I well yeah this is
all going to be a much more interesting
conversation when that bone conduction
stuff starts happening yeah in earnest
but that's that's for a future
discussion I think anyway we're gonna
have to see what we what we kind of
think about the galaxy note 10.1 who did
I don't know I don't know the details on
that it was a very fun event it was run
very well I got to see Baz Luhrmann
speak I love the sunscreen song yeah as
do I um and it Tony have you heard that
one is that a uniquely American or
Australian and American most most
probably i said oh just let me get me
through my childhood that song the
sunscreen song my bannermen music he's
an actor right baz lurman is a director
he is a that song i believe the lyrics
were written this is the sunscreen song
listeners if you want to look it up it's
a fun little novelty song yeah he's a
director he directed at Moulin Rouge and
Romeo and Juliet with leonardo dicaprio
and he's currently directing something
of prominence coming up so samsung had
him come out on stage and kind of talk
about how he uses how he ostensibly used
as the galaxy note 10.1 with stylus as
he kept referring what in his ear
process he's yeah you know I used the
galaxy note 10.1 with stylus you know
when I'm around the film set and it was
it was cool like his in-person
presentation was pretty awkward he even
said like to the president of samsung
electronics at USA he was like you're
gonna have to call cut on me because I
just ramble and I don't really say
anything worthwhile and but on the video
they shot with boz like he was scouting
locations for his latest project and you
know he's using the note 10.1 with
stylus and he's taking pictures of
locations and then like with sitting
with his wife the production designer
and like doodling on the photos with
sketches like heroin hang curtains here
and do all this stuff and he says it's I
wrote about it in today's piece where
he's like it's a creative toolbox for
creative professionals and you know I
think I think he'd be better off just
using an etch-a-sketch tab 10.1 I mean
it's it's far cheaper and it's got a
higher contrast display and what they
put on the 10.1 by the way oh god that
yeah the DPI is pretty rough go ahead
display Michael how is the display on
the 10.1 because the display on the
Galaxy Tab 10.1 which I had and I he'll
still have laying around here is is
terrible and in February when I met the
galaxy note 10.1 and it's then back then
iteration it wasn't that good it's not
it's not that good okay I'm yeah when
you're using it in the hand it you can't
really notice that if you're me and I
don't really care about resolution or
anything like that but even if you're me
you look at the thing just a little too
close or if it's on a giant projection
display at the announcement and they're
zooming in on icons it's like whoa and
the colors and contrast because my
problem was that there were absolutely
no blacks there were only great and
there were huge backlight bleeding
problems yeah I did well it is a
conventional LCD on there I think it's
not a you know a giant's AMOLED panel or
something so yeah so that it's it's not
an impressive display it'll it gets the
job done but not not well so can't wait
can't wait for the next way of tablets I
mean this is just a watching some videos
of it and watching your hands on Michael
edit it doesn't look fast and it's got
that quad core X and I was like what's
up with that
yeah it's it's still Ice Cream Sandwich
Brendan just wait for for it to get
jelly bean you'll get jelly yeah and
hopefully that they're sent whatever
Samsung does with TouchWiz on top of
jelly bean won't mess it up too much is
this TouchWiz UX nature the new one
which is on the s3 yeah like its it has
some of those same effects like on the
lock screen you know you draw the
unlocked race and it does the water
pattern and stuff and maybe it was just
me maybe it's just to my eyes where I
was looking at it and it didn't it
seemed like they just took elements from
nature UX and put it onto an existing
tablet TouchWiz build mm-hmm and at the
presentation they really didn't make a
big deal about they certainly never said
it was a nature UX or at least if they
said it I missed it and I think so did
everybody else so I don't think they're
calling at that but they did bring over
a lot of features from the galaxy s3 and
from the earlier note gotcha yes so they
mean smart stays on it which i think is
pretty cool I didn't get to test that
out but I know it's installed and I hate
smart state aside from the fact you
think it's creepy but yeah it's staring
at you the only time when I can think of
smart stay being useful for me is when I
lay in my bed and I'm reading either in
the morning or in the night and guess
what smart state is not working at night
because you can't see your face very
true I know I I guess it's more accurate
to say i love the idea of smart stay i
love its potential but i agree that is a
giant handicap just put them in for a
beam on it you can't see it you the
camera can see your face and boom
there's your solution for night
operation while speaking of infrared
there's that giant infrared port up top
which I did miss identify and my my
youtube video as a micro USB port
because I was in a rush but um so
they've Samsung has done this like a
very useful market research see how were
there like they found that most people
when they are sitting watching tvs and
if they're doing something else well
they're watching TV it's probably on a
tablet and I get that because what you
don't think I mean it's true for me I
was like I was it made sense to me
because I sit there and watch TV and I'm
like oh well I'm using my tablet while
I'm watching TV that you don't do that
time no no no I have no time for that
nonsense ya know today they're bringing
back the style
just you're bringing back infrared come
on what's next well I mean I agree the
infrared blaster in and of itself is
just like this like why did you put this
on there you're just being like Samsung
you're just throwing stuff on here but
no you know they custom wrote this like
remote control app or maybe they bought
a company that wrote a remote control
app and its installed on there and it's
like I don't have a samsung smart TV I
guess you know they said I thought so
too but the the president mr. Baxter was
like yeah of course we'd prefer that it
would be a samsung TV but no it works
with all of them so um anyway anyway um
so that was fun it was a fun event
adding stuff yeah yeah look for everyone
looked for more more on the 10.1 as we
get some more time with it but while
we're still on samsung i want to ask you
guys about this because i haven't played
with it this leaked there's been a
leaked official jelly bean ROM for the
samsung galaxy s3 what's what's the
story on this is this still out there
and available yeah that happened that
happened today and so it's uh it's the
TouchWiz oh i had a android 4.1
update and you know what I haven't tried
it yet um I actually might load it on
today make a video about it um but it
seems to be a pretty big improvement
it's it's it's amazing Samsung kept the
two second home screen delay thing they
didn't fix that that's that's for s
voice yes um but it looks like an
improvement which is very encouraging
because we were speculating in previous
podcasts when jellybean comes around on
these devices is it going to maintain
the fluidity and the answer is yes uh
you I guess it's just so deep that you
know ye it's not going to be impacted
but it's still it's still TouchWiz and
you know that my personal preference
would be to run stock Android via you
know a third-party rom button that's
just me sure yeah you know i'm looking
forward to because i like I'm like Tony
I like running my stuff pretty stock or
pretty close to stock and and I like the
improvements that have been built into
the new TouchWiz so I'm very excited to
see how how that works on top of jelly
bean especially on my galaxy s3 which
by the way has become a killer driver
yeah yeah listeners I go boating
sometimes on account of having grown up
in Long Island and so I broke my galaxy
nexus LTE which I know yeah yeah you
didn't know I didn't yeah I didn't know
that I'm sure how the funeral man so it
doesn't really count I broke my fate
Galaxy Nexus right exactly yes if I'd
broken a real one I'd be really pissed
but knows my if you guys can access LTE
and I sat on it wrong and shed at the
display so it works but it's I'm not
gonna be one of those people who walks
around with a shedder display him and
it's true you guys remember those
stickers on the screens back to your
three years ago which said do not put it
in your back pocket do not sit on it oh
yeah no we never got I never got a phone
with that kind of user warning but I
should have apparently I think HTC touch
HD and the hd2 had that oh yeah but yeah
I didn't have either one of those so
that's yeah well I should have you
should yet I know I know that's before
Gorilla Glass yeah and now even with
grilled West I just break it and scratch
it all the time so whatever real glass
you know it's it's it's got so much hype
behind it but it it still does crack and
then Gorilla Glass 2 on the galaxy s3
did you guys see that video where
someone took a iphone 4s and a galaxy s3
and dragged it behind a car had those
videos on lame I heard I've never
watched those know they they make me
hurt in my heart like I don't like
watching those those videos where they
beat up electronics it makes me feel
very sad need you I'm with you yeah well
well anyways happened what happened a
girl goes to yeah well what happened is
that they picked up the iphone which was
destroyed and then they picked up the
galaxy s3 which seemed unharmed which I
find hard to believe my galaxy s3
already has a couple of surface
scratches and I I'm pretty careful with
my phones so you know I think gorilla
glass can be hit or miss I think its
impact resistant it's supposed to be
scratch resistant i did a video one time
where took a razor sharp kitchen knife
and applied it to one of the first
gorilla glass screens i think it was
what was that i think it was the iphone
four men oh geez maybe or ghosts I don't
know it's like nails on a chalkboard it
just feels been so what what happened
you you managed to scratch it pretty
well I
it didn't scratch I actually think I
gotta find that video I think I
successfully scratched a non Gorilla
Glass old you know a device with an old
older uh you know that I didn't care
about that much focus you know what the
gorilla glass object didn't scratch with
a really sharp knife and I got I got
pretty uh pretty aggressive with the
screen like we went we went crazy
together in screen you know this this
entire gorilla glass thing is just like
titanium my watch is made of titanium
and titanium is one of the strongest
materials out there and you just really
can't break it but you can scratch it
with your fingernail yeah so I think
that the glass is Gorilla Glass is the
same it's it's strong but it has that
internal tension which is released once
you get it hit in a certain angle with a
certain velocity and then it's just
physics right and and you know I've
noticed the same amount of scratching on
my galaxy s3 in particular on the
display I feel like you know you can do
these things where you do these tests
for you scratch it with it the screen
with a knife for your try and do that
and you know girl that's maybe or other
hardened glasses actually handle that a
little better then actual just real
world use like taking it in and out of a
pocket with say a rivet you know like a
like a riveted seam on jeans or
something or you know just keeping it in
your pocket with other stuff which I try
not to do so that's why I tend to like
those pocket tests where they throw in a
phone into a bag with a lot of like
pocket change and stuff like that but
anyway that's good test yeah yeah well
you know you can you can fight that with
things like building your phone casing
out of Kevlar and stuff which leads us a
little bit little ways into this story
very briefly this droid razr HD which we
keep hearing the muskets phone the
biscuit and there's there's the latest
rumor here that it's going to arrive
without an accompanying max version for
those of you not familiar with the razr
maxx it is the motorola droid razr just
with a giant giant battery slapped on
and it's one of my favorite innovations
in android to be honest I guys I'm
infuriated if this is true I am just
going to blow my
top because I the max version of the
razor is the only other Android phone
from verizon i would consider buying
because it has that incredibly long
battery endurance without the need for
an extra battery or a battery case or
whatever what do you guys think are you
super disappointed or do you not care
that there's not going to be a maxim
brandon loves the device i don't i don't
like Motorola phones that much I still
haven't found one that when that has won
me over so I you know I don't really
care cuz you wouldn't buy it anyway mmm
I I wouldn't buy it anyway it's it
doesn't look nice to me and it's got an
interface that I don't like and so on
gotcha what about you Tony I don't think
that the rumors are our true but even if
they are true then i think motorola wool
at one point release a max version
because the market really wants it it's
bread and had a video on it then when i
said brandon loved the phone i actually
said that or i meant to say that he
loved the battery life on that that was
actually the first time i heard brandon
praised a phone for its better life and
its really true i mean close to 3,000
milliamp hours gives you one and a half
two days of juice which which in today's
world is it's an excellent third
absurdly excellent yes yeah yeah it's
absurdly excellent but you know i think
most people care that the phone will
last through the day and of course there
there are those extended days that we've
all had where you wake up early in the
morning and you're going out late at
night and by the time you're ready to
leave to go out at night your phone's
like thirteen percent you're like ah I
got it I got a plug in yeah um but but
you know you can kind of anticipate that
right and charge it up in the middle of
the day I rather have a thinner phone
that has one day battery life than a
thicker phone or a heavier phone or
wider phone that has two or three day
battery life it's just like it's not
worth it to me you were an L to the HTC
focus groups weren't you you know one
thing which which right now is fitting
the image perfectly I'm preparing to
drive to Berlin it's gonna be a 14 15
hour drive and I hate charging my phones
with any charger I'm used to only using
their own particular charger because of
the currents stopping and go into detail
with
podcast but just to get to the point
when you are driving and navigating it
just eats battery insanely I mean two
hours is max which you can get so I'm
gonna be going with four devices and my
laptop just so that I can reach Berlin
in time so yeah I would need a max can't
you just plug in you know while your
dragon with a car charger yeah I don't
want to use a car charger because it
charges whatever current that wants to
charge that stabilized current is
charges only with 100 million powers and
if my battery is 2500 milliamp hours
that's not good and stuff like that I
mean yeah yeah they were talking about
yeah cuz you need to charge your phones
with approximately ten percent of
current of your current battery so if
you have a 2500 milliamp hour battery
the optimum charging the optimal charger
would be to 250 million power battery
charger for around eight or nine hours
of course I've gotta go into much detail
one probably able to write the technical
editorial about this we have you it ok
you can't do that no no I want out I'll
tell my dancers I don't want to do any
of the research you do the work I just
want to read it ok so weak we are using
fast chargers nowadays which are okay
but think of Brandon any four of your
current phones they have different
battery types right 2500 2713 hundred
stuff like that charging all of your
phones with one charger will probably on
the long term kill your battery well I
mean I I'd love to see some data to that
effect because when I go into the car
and my phone needs juice and it's at
fifty percent i plug it in by the time I
park at my destination I'm at sixty-five
percent I just increased my battery and
my add the amount of juice I have that's
all I see that's all I care about okay
so show this out when I had the Dutch no
I had the hd2 and I used that to
navigate I had the charger and the with
that charger being plugged in and
navigation started the phone still
depleted and the battery was super hot I
could fry eggs on it yeah but the seat
charger worked with other phones we
assign is right we use when we sold car
chargers we used to sell them with the
yeah with the you know sales point that
this will charge your phone faster
because they they generally do because
of that give the voltage or what it's
differential whatever it isn't compared
to a wall outlet because it's nothing
it's DC and there's no I don't know what
the technical reason is go ahead run um
i was gonna say yeah sorry I it like
there is I read about this in depth back
in the day at our site called battery
University dot-com which I will should
sort of shamelessly pimp because it's an
awesome awesome site to like get to know
a little bit about lithium ion battery
chemistry and stuff which sounds really
dull but what it really comes down to is
the site is like listen this is what
happens when you charge your battery
this is what happens when you charge
your battery well and what you know when
you don't charge your battery well and
how these things prefer to be stored and
why and you know this is it helped me
understand a lot of things like why
phones often come out of the boxes with
half charge because that's where
lithium-ion prepared you know prefers
not be for long term term storage has
forty percent yep is exactly forty
percent as opposed to fully charged or
fully depleted and anyway so that's
that's a cool site and i agree Tony I
think you should write a I just missed
my nickel-cadmium batteries with
memories like it better tell the ones
that leaked battery acid all of ya yeah
the good old Tony Tony I I'm gonna bet
that you're the kind of guy that will
get a new electronic and will cycle the
battery up to a hundred you'll go down
to zero even if that means you're
playing a YouTube video at full
brightness why you know while you go
take a shower some actually I do that I
do that two three I do that once a month
because no theam ion and lithium polymer
batteries don't have that memory effect
but it is good to keep the the current
flowing every now and then to keep the
better get your calibrated as well yeah
once a month absolutely you must also
use disk defragmenter on a regular basis
don't you not anymore I've evolved I'm
running SSDs now all right
hi well yes I do have I do have five or
six different different wall chargers
laying around depending on what type of
phone i'm using and i'm blogging always
the phone in its respective charger yeah
imagine I Berlin bag it's it's so funny
because I i love the devote the
diversity we have you you guys seem to
care tremendously about battery bad
handling and I don't really care about
that as long as it works and yet I care
about having like a really good software
experience that's not stock and you guys
prefer to have stock because you don't
care that it's so it's it's interesting
that we have all these different
perspectives and we're uh you know it is
nice that our triumph imagine how boring
would it do if we all agreed all the
time I know ya know uh I i forgot i was
gonna say something that effect two well
you know it's interesting because
Brandon like I feel like maybe and this
will be the last thing I say about it
this battery life thing I care about as
a regular user and when I put myself in
the shoes of a normal user that's i do
care about it because you have to make
sure you take steps to make your to
share your battery lasts for the year
two year contract or whatever right but
as me who even before I worked for
pocket now was was swapping out phones
every six months you know at great
expense to myself you know it doesn't
really matter i can abuse the hell out
of my batteries because i'm not going to
be with whatever phone i'm carrying for
more than six months or up to you know a
year if i'm really really in love with
it and that's only happened like twice
so think of the next owner man the next
oh yeah well you know I actually think
what's so nice is on ebay you know you
can just put that disclaimer it's like
listen buy this phone from me it's gonna
work it just fine but it's been it's
been well used it's been well loved so
don't buy it as a gift for anyone so
anyway Before we jump into Windows Phone
just really quick thing samsung says
Apple ripped off pinch-to-zoom so so
there's that I don't really want to talk
about this but I think it's interesting
that I think it's interesting to think
where pinch-to-zoom came from because i
know i saw it before the iphone came out
and i don't know how or where maybe it
was in the one of those early microsoft
surface videos
did you guys see pinch-to-zoom outside
of minority report before before apple
launched the original iphone mm-hmm nope
Wow well maybe I'm either making that up
or I am or I or I do remember it and I
just can't cite it I was expecting you
guys and say yeah now I know what you're
talking about but since you didn't do
that citation needed I have only a
couple of sentences to say about this
topic and I'll keep it short one is
related to patents and I always try to
come in on patterns because mm-hmm I
like to believe that I know a little bit
about them not too much the fact that
somebody invents something whether it's
multi-touch like in this case doesn't
necessarily equal to the fact that there
is a patent if the person the group of
persons the company the entity who
invented that thing didn't go with the
process of patenting it then the next
person who either invented it on their
own or let them be stole the technology
patents it if they don't attack that
patent it's a valid patent that's what
scent is number one it was a phrase
actually and number two I can accept
Samsung fighting back at apple and I'm
also supporting them but if they want to
attack this bed and why are they
attacking it now they should have
attacked it at the very beginning go
with a different lawsuit and attack the
very validity the core of the
multi-touch button instead of bringing
it up just as a new novelty in an
existing lawsuit I think it's a
strategic thing I mean these cases take
years to put together and I think it's
sometimes advantageous for them to wait
because then they have even more
evidence because Hey look they continue
to infringe upon our patents yeah yeah
it's okay thanks hey you know that's I'm
Tony I'm glad and I didn't want to
interrupt you but I'm really glad that
you know something about patents I I do
not and and it's there so so terribly
important to the industry and I just
don't don't follow them so yeah I don't
know I i know i saw it somewhere
and when the iphone came out with it i
was like wow that's really cool that
they integrated something as cool as
pinch-to-zoom at this small scale
because I've seen this on like a wall or
something like that I'll have to look it
up and see if it was on the original
surface but hey before we move on to our
windows phone um I'd like to share
something that I that I came across
yesterday and oh yeah I it's kind of a
programming note because I found the
video about it this morning there will
be a video about it today or tomorrow at
the latest I came across a new rom that
does something so interesting and unique
although it's it's it's the way that it
doesn't because it's possible in Android
right now if you know your way around
it's called paranoid android and it's a
rom series kind of like cyanogenmod or a
okay p that is available for a multiple
multitude of devices and it's especially
good for devices that have high
resolution big screens so we're talking
Galaxy Note Galaxy Nexus galaxy s3 in
this case the HTC One X and what it
allows you to do is select which apps
run in tablet mode and which apps are
run in phone mode or or and or you can
have the whole UI run in tablet mode so
this is this is what I have on my one x
I've got the notification bar at the
bottom of the screen like an ice cream
sandwich or honeycomb tablet so now I
access my notifications by swiping up
from the bottom in which is great which
is great because on a big screen phone
it's such a tremendous reach to the top
of the phone not only that but I have my
email app set up in a high DPI mode so
now I have a two column you like you
would get on an android tablet I've got
my inbox on the left the message
displays on the right I've got YouTube
running in tablet mode so if you've seen
the YouTube tablet app it's got this
like wall of like tiltable scrollable
sort of 3d looking videos yeah who and
what paranoid android let you do is go
into every app and tweak to a very fine
degree how big the text is and how big
the controls are and whether you want it
in tablet mode or phone mode and on a
display that's
120 x 1280 resolution like on the phones
i just mentioned you can really make
things very small and they're still very
crisp so like this is just freaking me
out because i feel like my phone has
become a tablet in some cases and it's
it's kind of a know in a weird way
change the way i'm using this phone and
further this is a paranoid android is
actually based off of cyanogenmod so
it's kind of like cyanogenmod 10 jelly
bean with this ability on top so it's
like it is so so cool she's it sounds
just like the awesome i mean it's called
paranoid question paranoid android okay
go ahead one question you said that
you're running the email application in
tablet mode does it also affect the
keyboard the size of the keys are they
smaller or are they normal sized because
if they are normal says that's awesome
they are normal sized and the paranoid
android is set up to leave some things
alone like I seaboard um so but you if
you want and it's actually kind of cool
like on the Galaxy Note where you know
normal sized keyboard is actually very
wide it's kind of difficult to use you
can actually shrink it to go in and kind
of go in on itself to be able to use
should be default yeah it should be and
another place that I've got it in tablet
mode is the setting so if you've ever
used the settings on android tablet
you've got two frames on the left kind
of the scrollable thing that shows you
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and on the right is is
what you know what that item points to
so instead of this commit yeah so
instead of the single column view that
every Android phone has I have this
gorgeous to screen view and everything
is super crisp and clear it's not like
I'm squinting at it because the screen
so bein high res so I've having a super
time with that can't wait to see it that
sounds awesome I can't wait to see these
are you had me at notification area to
be honest with you win it you move the
notification area to the bottom of the
screen I will be your friend no matter
what what will who you are yeah and and
it creates an interesting effect because
um there's no notification bar at the
top so apps now stretch all the way
have a tough of the screen and it just
it it feels nice it feels nice and also
the notification shade on the bottom
which operates in a very similar fashion
to the when it's at the top but now like
on a tablet you get all these quick
toggles in a secondary screen and you
know some third or some stock roms have
have toggles at the top but they're like
they take up a lot of space there in
your face but in an Android tablet mode
they're hidden behind a little click and
so you'll see it on the video it's just
it's beautiful and it works very very
well i gotta stay tuned for that that's
uh thank you for the for the for the
warning this is that may go at the same
day the podcast us we've got we kind of
slide on over to windows phone while
we're talking about not that nokia and
microsoft have I think finally confirmed
that on September fifth we're going to
see some windows phone 8 running Lumias
is that correct am I reading that right
are we finally there is this is this
true at least there will be a nokia and
microsoft joint press conference on
September 5 and it's just normal that
everybody thinks that there will be
something regarding Windows Phone 8 and
nakia devices now whether it will be
Microsoft showing off consumer-oriented
features on nokia hardware or Stephen
Elop goes on stage and shows off the
first Windows Phone 8 it's it's still
unknown well I'm very much looking
forward to seeing that we've speculated
on I think every single podcast episode
so far about what Nokia is going to be
doing with Windows Phone 8 on the
hardware side so we don't need to do it
again just because it's just going to
reignite my curiosity and passion and
anticipation so I I look at the the
Lumia 900 kind of his practice for what
we're gonna see the ball from from Nokia
yeah that's that's a good call and I I
would like to see just as an aside at
something like the Lumia 900 with a the
same blended display and casing hardware
as the Lumia 800 which I found beautiful
and I think they kind of missed the boat
a little bit with it that display
configuration on the loom
900 so senator no we keep seeing those
bezel images pop up and those kind of
blurry cam things and it's it'll be
interesting to see how different or
similar the new hardware is I'd like to
talk to the guys at nokia marketing and
ask them why they they're already at 900
because unless they're gonna start going
to like 1100 and 1200 the names just get
really weird from here on out I mean and
you know they kind of start at two
hundred what did they go with high no
ones yeah they could do that yeah they
could give themselves space like we do
i'm not on the episode listings for
three digit episode names but I feel
like blackberry did that as well where
blackberry was like you know it always
on the upper end of whatever series of
numbers they were at you know the pearls
started at like 70 100 or whatever and
you know that all the poles are in the
9000 device family and then they have to
like like divide them further and parcel
them out and then you get this
ridiculous situation where it's like
here's the 9810 and the 8080 940 and
it's like this is this is just stupid
and then you know you get that
complicated than you have to go back
down to a more streamlined naming scheme
but remember when when phones were
referred to only by extremely long model
names and then and then they went in the
complete opposite direction then we got
like samsung fascinate samsung
exhilarated awesome super extendo blast
hybrid lay yeah i was gonna do i wanted
to talk about a renaming of some
motorola handsets on the podcast today
was it tell me those um does the
motorola or the galaxy blazer is now the
galaxy exciter don't know Samsung
gathered see the upcoming t-mobile
samsung will no longer be the galaxy s
blaze q but it will be the galaxy s
relay 4g so they replaced an excellent
moniker with an even better one I've I
find your I cannot read your tone Tony
cuz for me that's like it's like going
from like a really horrible name to the
one that's exactly okay I was like are
you being serious cuz I don't want to
insult your taste in the phone names
anyway yeah well alright so blah blah
that's yeah um speaking of weird names
and also in the world Windows Phone chef
Chevron windows phone seven phone
unlocks has expired I never got into
modding windows phone seven but I know
that the chevron kind of project was
critical to to unlocking Windows Phone
to unlock the potential of Windows
Phones if you didn't want to run them
stock what does this mean that is yeah
what's these beds my girl is locking
them back like what's what's actually
going on here I'll be honest with you I
haven't read this story i just skimmed
it so i knew what was going on I sort of
followed this from from from a while ago
because you know it just a few years ago
are a little bit more than that windows
mobile was the original sort of hackable
mobile operating system and you know I
would make it was so funny I would make
videos about like point zero dot 0 dot
one updates we're like Microsoft would
slightly move the start button to the
right a little bit and I barely change
anything anyway so windows phone 7 came
around um Android was already out and so
the question was is Windows Phone 7
hackable can you do anything with this
and then the chevron wp7 tool came out
which allowed you to as far as i
remember sideload apps and that's pretty
much it I mean I think you could do some
stuff like like change the background of
your Start screen but Windows Phone has
never been hackable and I I wish we
could get a developer on here to explain
why like it would be cool to any why
couldn't you resize live tiles two years
ago with windows phone seven or 7.5 I
mean it can't be that programmatically
difficult to do but it's just there's
there's no development community better
Windows Phone you right and isn't that
strange because I mean the webos user
base has the the like epitome of a
homebrew community that really really
deeply tweaks the OS and the Windows
Phone community is no less passionate as
we all know from from firsthand
experience so why is that I mean it I
figured that it must be a technical
limitation there must be something that
that makes it more difficult because I
don't think it's for a lack of passion
to be honest with
alright I think what happened is that
windows mobile users there was a there
was a lapse between when windows mobile
stopped and when Android or when when
Android started and when Windows Phone
came out and I think everyone that was
on Windows Mobile that had were involved
in the hacking scene went to Android
very quickly and so and and it's a
little bit different I think with webos
because I think people that went on
webos were sort of first-time users
people that really wanted to take
advantage of the foot of their phone
they were like the anti iphone crowd but
all of these power users were sucked
into Android very early and there's
really I mean that's one theory maybe
that's yeah this is a possibility just a
circle back a little bit to this Chevron
thing I think that the sole purpose of
Microsoft locking down devices is for
security reasons unlocking phones was is
and will be possible officially via the
app hub and this basically allows
developers to test their applications
there early codes deployed to the phone
itself and see how they behave now of
course people like you and me or those
good folks at the XDA developers wanted
to have their own applications without
being an official developer registered
with the epub and that was the necessity
for a phone to be unlocked I can totally
get it what I don't get it is that
Microsoft I think they have no clue of
what they want they went on with this
project they supported it I remember the
chevron team going to redmond and they
had the huge discussion and then
Microsoft officially supported the
chevron team and now Chevron is killing
unlocks Microsoft is locking them back
the chevron unlocking was a budget
solution instead of paying I don't know
I think it's a hundred dollars to be a
member for one year to the app hub you'd
basically pay a couple of dollars nine
or ten or something like that for a
token which would basically unlock your
phone and if you're a developer would
allow you to run your own applications
or just distribute them and throughout
the community so I think Microsoft
didn't know what they want or just now
they realize that they don't want this
and the in terms of locking and
unlocking phones it was a measure of
security
users from running code which is not
officially supported in the zune
marketplace yep yeah well well said i
would i would think that that is a
perfectly reasonable explanation for
their motivations on that it's just you
know I I think it's a shame from a just
from a subjective standpoint but i don't
i never saw a modded windows phone 7
device in the wild I've never maybe
watched one or two videos where I've
seen modded windows phone 7 devices and
like Brandon said earlier like you've
really can't couldn't do that much with
it or not a lot of people did that much
with it so you don't have the
flexibility exactly so you know I I
don't know this doesn't really make me
it won't keep me up at night but it is
it is a shame finally rounding up in the
windows phone news here the this is
fascinating somebody was asking me about
this yesterday who I met at the Samsung
event there's this rumor that the
surface the Microsoft Surface for at
least the one running RT could be
released at a price point that puts it
as cheap as the nexus 7 yes I predicted
this oh ok I don't understand how this
could possibly be so episode three or
four it was right after the surface
announcement and we were talking about
possible price tags because Microsoft
didn't say anything they just said that
they will be in line with other tablets
from other competitors and back then I
said that okay the cheapest RT surface
will probably be at the same price with
a mid-range android tablet and the bro
will be around the same price as the top
model ipad and then you guys just said
no that's not possible but just think
about it for a second microsoft wants
should be on the tablet market
regardless if it's with their own
product or with their hardware partners
so if you come up with a Windows RT
which is the lower end tablet and you
price it 599 nobody's gonna buy that
people will go either ipad or will go
galaxy note 10.1 so the best thing
Microsoft can do at least with their own
hardware is push the price
went down this way forcing their
partners to push the price point down
this way the entire ecosystem and the
entire hardware partnership and stuff
like that gadgets will have low prices
recipe for success that I first excited
I'm excited i pondered and fees why I
can hear the excitement yes yes I I
think yeah I mean Microsoft is um
Microsoft is sitting there and they're
there we've seen that they're perfectly
willing to lose money they're just going
to lose as much money as they want on
Windows Phone you know in in this kind
of quest to to get market share and it
looks like they're just gonna bring that
same attitude to tablets and they're
gonna you know they're just gonna keep
throwing money at the problem until they
until they solve it so they did it with
Xbox and look at them wrong yeah now how
long did they do it with that xbox I
mean how long was xbox like a loss
leader for them Oh nobody knows I think
when did that xbox what I mean it was a
lot it was many years and um like the
original the first gen xbox right you're
talking about right yeah I think I think
even you know when they launched the
second xbox how many of their been three
yesterday no to the X by the original
xbox and the xbox 360 and then oh I
guess there were multiple capacities of
the 360 is what I'm thinking about
underground until we're not gamers could
it listeners I mean when the night comes
we're gamers but um just kidding i'm a
i-i-i am NOT your your lady you're not
you're not multiplayer your
single-player that's going on we are
multiplayer in networking and now we're
all yeah that with one joke we all we
all get a little less attractive
whatever if surface ends up to be as
cheap as the nexus 7 or even in that
neighborhood i will be not only very
pleased i will be stunned i don't think
this is going to happen
I think I was loose so as high as 2 99
you'd go as high as 299 for what like a
16 gig surface yeah yeah um i would i
would too I would go as high as 3 99 to
be honest with you I'd go I'd go higher
yeah don't give them ideas I know right
well we were all talking about this in
HP is not Microsoft we were all talking
with us with HP in the touchpad last
summer whatever it was it was like yeah
they're going to release it and you know
I'm sure they're going to price it down
around to 99 and then they came out and
they're like no we're gonna make this
the same price as the iPad because we're
well maybe maybe maybe maybe a couple of
us are not making the best decisions
anyway um blah blah blah blah I want to
talk about iOS we're coming up on time
here but there's thankfully there's not
much iOS news just because we're toward
the end of the podcast we've had some
new iPad Mini shots pop up and some
renders they're not terribly interesting
what I find more interesting is that we
have a report stating that the iphone 5
pre-orders are set to begin on sep
tember 12th was that your that was your
story Tony yes indeed it was and it's
basically the same day when the keynote
the alleged keynote is going to happen
now i'm not sure if it will be September
to help or not but there are many rumors
talking about this and it's just normal
for pre-orders to start the same day
because that's what Apple does either
available today or say pre-orders start
today and they ship it or yeah ship at
10 days later so but I want to circle
back to the ipad mini render just for a
second there were a lot of conversations
regarding the lack of the bezel on the
ipad mini and i don't think that's
that's the case I mean you guys have a
7-inch tablet I've seen 7-inch tablets
you don't really need to have a bezel
the sole purpose of the bezel on the
iPad is for you to rest your thumbs on
the side without covering the screen
itself now for a 7-inch tablet you can
easily hold it one hand like a phone
from its back because it fits between
the two of your fingers the two extreme
fingers think about that you can do that
when you're standing up but if you're
like reading in bed or something like
that and gravity's not on your side you
just rest it on your chest uh
yeah but I don't do that like you can
rest on your chest but he's too close to
your face because you can't read you
know so like I have to hold it up above
me when I'm when I'm reading in bed and
for that I use my thumb's on the on the
bezel so for me that the bezel is still
helpful in that regard but I understand
that there's a less of a case for it is
a less compelling case than it is on a
larger tablet yes yeah yeah yeah the
other day i was using my iPad and I'm
like you know I would love if I could
have like a glove in the back that I
could you know so my hand is doing and
hold it kind of like a canvas and then I
thought you know you know this could be
the next big thing so I do some internet
research and then I find on amazon there
are like 400 straps for the back of the
ipad and actually bought one and i got
it like two days ago um it's a simple
case it snaps onto the back of the ipad
it's got this leather strap that
actually pivots so you can hold it
portrait or landscape and you just slip
your hand in there and I I'm gonna do a
video on it once I figure out if I if
I'd like it let me cuz utilize this is
it the same way you're holding the ipad
right now as those I think it's the
pitchers of baseball who are grabbing
the ball with a huge thing on their
hands no no it's a lot more because
literally it's literally a leather strap
and you just slide your hand in it like
a mitten kind of yeah like a mitten I I
am very much looking forward to this
video Brandi you should have like a
corner you should just have like a like
a video corner all to yourself where
it's like Brandon minimun tries out some
weird stuff like that reminds me of the
the video the M what was it the
bluetooth the bluetooth handset that
that old style one yeah that wasn't glue
this was the audio audio jack yeah right
Ruth yeah I love that now it's hearsay
I'm looking forward to seeing that video
that's awesome alright well it's that's
a that closes out for news and we do
have to stop on time so we have nothing
in miscellaneous guys we have a lot of
listener mail the problem is we have a
lot of it and that's a great problem to
have and we really thank you for
listeners it's awesome
we just can't get to it on this one we
have kind of a very busy day here and we
have to stop on time so I'm very sorry
we're going to get to those pieces of
mail some of them are a little bit
longer then if we can read on the air so
we do want to encourage anybody who
writes in to do so with a little bit of
brevity we love hearing from you the
ones that we can't get to on air I will
respond to personally or if somebody
else can handle it better we'll just
right maybe it may be a shout out
Michael to the guys absolutely yeah yeah
we have listener mail today from from
Remington Jackson from a young flux is
that hyper Nansen a TV from Thomas and
from Stefan pronounced how you like get
it as wrong as Steve and I won't care so
okay Michael no no I'm sorry that's what
he said that's not what I'm so I do care
but I mispronounced everything I love
that people have to say like
mispronounce it Michael because you will
do it anyway so anyway guys really we do
appreciate the listener mail we're going
to get to those on some of them on the
next episode but please just keep them
very brief will respond to you in person
via email so before we wrap up here
though we do have a two-minute debate
session here uh I want to ask you Tony
sent me a link to a very very
interesting tweet from from chris webber
at nokia and the tweet reads samsung
take note next generation Lumia coming
soon this was at 11pm on 15 august
samsung take note is a very very
interesting way of phrasing this tweet
from this thus nokia person so who is
chris webber by the way I didn't I with
a ton of time to resident sake I USA
president ok USA things listeners that
we will file that under things you
should know if you're Michael Fisher
sorry so so the president of Nokia USA
says Samsung take note next generation
Lumia coming soon the question for the
two-minute debate corner is do you think
windows phone do you think Nokia will
introduce a galaxy note like a windows
phone phablet or just a windows phone
phablet and will it be successful
Brandon so that's a question will they
really say well they have the
opportunity to do so now that windows
phone supports higher resolution screens
I mean you're not going to take wvga 800
x 480 and put it on a 5.5 inch screen
that would look atrocious uh I I think
it's very conceivable no one's done it
yet there's a Titan which has what a 4.5
inch screen or 4.3 screen and I think it
would be successful I think Samsung has
proven that people want phablets and um
and you know I I think a lot of people
think would it be cool to have this
Metro interface on sort of like a tablet
like interface well there's windows 8
for that but there's there there could
be this awesome in between this 5.3 inch
or whatever Lumia that has just this
gorgeous thin polycarbonate backing with
a high res screen and it's like those
live tiles suddenly become infinitely
more beautiful cuz there's they're huge
kind of like Windows 8 so yeah I think I
think it would be good I would probably
be very interested to use one myself if
it fit in the pocket nicely right and
Tony well because of the exact phrasing
and the time when they tweeted this we
can think about three things when you
say note you can think of a a large
screen you can think of be a stylist or
you can think of see a tablet now nokia
definitely has the power and has what it
takes to cover all three of these but we
know that so far regardless of the nokia
tablet rumors they were brushed off so i
say a nokia tablet running Windows 8 is
not feasible but as Brandon implied we
might see a 5 point something inch
Windows Phone running Windows Phone 8
from Nokia and you know what there's a
slight chance we might see the stylist
because Microsoft if anybody has what it
takes to bring back the stylus so
basically they're all their operating
systems on mobile devices from the very
beginnings until windows mobile 6.5 were
basically based on the stylist so they
know how to do it question is do they
want to do it did they identify a niche
in the market or is it just a huge
device nakia phablet 6 inches and here
we go and whether it will be yeah
whether it will be successful I don't
think so you don't think so I don't
think so because Windows Phone 8 and
Windows Phone 7 don't have that certain
genetic wha which would make a large
screen successful they are basically
tiles and text and everything windows
phone is just colors and text there are
no graphics I mean there are graphics of
course but not just like an Android and
the fact that Windows Phone 8 allows you
to make these quarter sized tiles on a
you know on a you know four-point-oh
inch screen those little tiles are gonna
be difficult click targets but on a 5.3
inch screen those little tiles will make
a lot of sense so maybe you'll have all
little tiles as in and maximize the you
know screen space there yeah but imagine
the text once you go into the settings
text would be huge of course with the
proper resolution text will be smaller
but yeah right if it's right if it's
custom-built for it yeah which I don't
know I think that it stands a really
good chance of of coming out first of
all I think that that's a very very
loaded statement for the president of
Nokia USA to say especially in the date
and time when the galaxy note 10.1 from
Samsung was being released like at that
moment so yeah which is a tablet it's
not a phone it is yeah but I feel like
it's related enough to the to the phone
you know to the phone world because it
runs essentially this mobile OS that
that Nokia could have used it to like
try and steal a little bit of thunder
and Twitter there and try and build a
little bit of buzz Tony I agree with you
completely and breaking it down into
these three possibilities really could
be a stylist could be fab Lika be a
tablet except tablet just probably a
write-off whatever I think they'll do a
large screen windows phone and I think
that would not be at all successful
windows phone 7 as we saw like you
mentioned brandon with the titan it's
just it doesn't translate well to a big
screen but with Windows Phone 8 boy that
would be something else cuz
sizable tiles like you can make it you
can make it an information-rich
interface you know you even more so than
seven does and with all that real estate
and a much higher resolution you can
really make that into a landscape of
information so one more thing this
coming soon I'm betting a buffalo nickel
that Stephen Elop will show this device
off on September 5 this this this device
that has hinted at in this tweet yes
this one there may be so I hope so and
we'll see we will uh we are at time
gentlemen before I get to the wrap-up
