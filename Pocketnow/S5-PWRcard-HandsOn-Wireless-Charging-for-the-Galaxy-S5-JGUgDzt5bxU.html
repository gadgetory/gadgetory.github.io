now and it has pretty much everything
built-in except wireless charging so how
do you get wireless charging on your
Galaxy s5 I'm Taylor Marcum this is
PocketNow
and this is the s5 power card so as
we've seen twice now the Samsung Galaxy
s5 comes with practically everything
onboard you have an infrared blaster you
have bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi b/g/n a see we
have IP 67 ingress protection against
water and dust you have a little bit of
everything in this phone but the one
thing it's missing the one thing it's
missing is wireless charging and
probably enough that's not impossible to
achieve unlike with some other phones we
have this right here which is called the
s5 power card we want to thank our
friends at clove before we get too far
into this for providing us with a power
card and testing it out and seeing how
it works so if you want a power card of
your own for your s5 or something else
maybe a device or accessories for your
phone check out clove that code at UK
for all of your smartphone accessories
but without any more delay let's get
into this power card and see what it's
about and see how it works with the
galaxy s5 so the packaging as you can
see is very very simple it's just a
little envelope really a little tape
here luckily I remember my knife so we
can get into this just cut the tape open
pop this tab open and inside you have
just this there's nothing else just this
little key card or Qi compatible
component that sticks to your Galaxy s5
so we pop the battery door off very
simple and basically you're just going
to connect these two connectors with the
pins underneath the battery door so the
two connectors on the keypad to the
connectors to the left of the battery
and that's it alright so it took us a
couple tries to get it to actually
fit but once you do the battery door
just pops on as usual it's got a little
bit of a bulge to it it feels just a
hair thicker than it normally does it's
not noticeable to the eye that you can
feel it maybe it's just me maybe I don't
know but it's there and let's see if
this thing can charge wirelessly now
so this is the Nexus charging orb the
one that came out shortly after the
Nexus 4 and it is Qi enabled so we
should theoretically just be able to
drop the galaxy s5 on the orb and it
should charge start charging immediately
or close to immediately gives us a
little chime it says we're wirelessly
charging and that's pretty much it it's
a pretty good alternative to not having
wireless charging built in and we have
to say that foam salesman has a pretty
good alternative here for your Galaxy s5
so thanks for watching and stay tuned
