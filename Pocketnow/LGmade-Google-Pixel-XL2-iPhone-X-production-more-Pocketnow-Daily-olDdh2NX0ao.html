pixel - might be made by LG and not HTC
analyst claimed that Apple has solved
most of its issues for the iPhone 8 and
it seems that Samsung has just lost a
bid for the snapdragon 845 I'm Jaime
Mayer Iveta forgive the overexposure
lighting is funky and nobody came to
make the bet again this is out
daily you know what for Tuesday there
are no official news or at least none
that matter let's focus on the Samsung
Galaxy Note II which is the fan edition
for those of you waiting for that it's
apparently going to happen on July 7th
which is fairly close but the most
interesting part is that apparently it
brings Bixby the question is will we get
an extra button that will just figure
out a way to deactivate or will it have
functionality stay tuned and since we
start with Samsung let's continue
apparently the company has just lost the
bid for the snapdragon 845 the TSMC call
comes apparently going to use TSMC
mainly because the company is jumping
from the 14 nanometer chip to the seven
nanometer technologies meaning I think
that 845 is going to happen this year
what's most important is that well
TSM c1 the Apple 8 chips so samsung has
pretty much lost two huge customers if
this ends up being true we'll keep you
posted as well
believe it or not we're going to
continue talking about Samsung we've got
some leaked benchmarks of the Samsung
Galaxy active that I am personally
waiting for snapdragon 835 four gigs of
ram apparently it'll start at 64 gigs of
storage as well the only question is
exactly when are we getting this phone I
mean by now it should have already
launched and let's just hope it's not an
AT&amp;amp;T exclusive as well now it's all
about Samsung's worst competitor Apple
the company has apparently figured out
everything it needs to make its iPhone X
or iPhone 8 rock that's at the point
where analysts claim that the company
will actually produce 55% of its iPhones
this year being the higher tier $1000
iPhone X iPhone 8 or wherever that
thing's going to be called so yeah it
seems the supply chain problems are
fixed let's see if it really happens in
the end and finally the hot
used to they have to do with the Google
pixel Excel - a couple of days ago we
reported that apparently this display
was going to be 17.5 by 9 which is great
it follows the current trend of
smartphones but thing about it is that
apparently HCC is not going to be
building this thing it seems that it's
going to be built by LG and you know
what I'm not going to complain about
that one they figured it out really well
with that 18 by 9 on the g6 and the
hardware is just beautiful it does an
amazing job with things like fingerprint
in addition to the addition of water
resistance
I mean LG figured out a ton of things I
really wouldn't mind for this to happen
but it leads me to the question of the
day are you disappointed or happy that
this would happen that the Google pixel
xl2 would be made by LG in my case
things have changed those times in the
past where LG would build a cheaper
model I don't think you're going to
continue leaving the comment down below
