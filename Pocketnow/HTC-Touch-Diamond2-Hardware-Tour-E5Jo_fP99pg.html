pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of the much-anticipated
HTC touch diamond2 now this particular
unit is the European version there will
be a US release of this device on AT&amp;amp;T
and maybe t-mobile coming up later this
year but right now it's gonna start in
Europe you can use this on t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T now but you won't get 3G data only
edge but there's always Wi-Fi so let's
take a look at this device let's start
in the upper left corner here so up here
we have the HTC logo right next to the
status indicator light to the right of
that is the light sensor to regulate
screen brightness and to the right of
that is the front-facing video camera
now in the u.s. we can't use the
front-facing video camera because no
network supports video cause the screen
is a 3.2 inch diagonal screen and to
give you a basis of comparison the
iPhone is a 3.5 inch screen the touch HD
has a 3.8 inch screen which is quite
large and then the old touch pro and the
touch diamond have a 2.8 inch screen so
it's kind of in the middle the
resolution is 800 down and 480 across so
that is WVGA that's the largest
resolution supported by Windows Mobile
so it has a really really crisp picture
moving down we have this capacitive zoom
slider and the zoom slider will allow
you to zoom in and out whether you're in
Google Maps or you're in a picture or on
the in the in the web browser and it
works quite well and we'll talk about
that later in the review and in the next
video now a little bit little note on
the screen sensitivity the touch
diamond2 has increased screen
sensitivity probably as close to
capacitive as you could possibly get
with this type of touchscreen this is a
resistive touchscreen all windows mobile
devices have a resistive touchscreen so
huge huge amount of points for the
screen on the touch HD it's a joy to
type on it's super sensitive and it's a
really fantastic screen going down we
have the call start button next to that
windows flag and this is a required
button to have on windows mobile 6.5
devices and this will be upgradeable to
6.5
what's that comes out but it ships with
six point one we have a backer okay
button and to the right of that is a
call end button and they also have the
little Home icon to tell you that when
you hit this it will go back to the home
screen now let's go over to the side
here we have a very predominant volume
rocker it's actually the same volume
rocker that you find on the touch HD to
the right of that it says HTC innovation
on the bottom we have the ext USB port
which will accept a mini USB we have the
volume RCA or the microphone over here
we have the stylus and it's actually not
the magnetic stylus that's found on the
touch HD but it does trigger the screen
to turn on when you go when you pull off
the stylus if you remember the touch HD
and the touch pro and the touch of
diamond you would bring it in close and
it would suck it all the way in not the
case with the the touch diamond2
unfortunately so you have to manually
put it in on the other side of the
device we have a speaker so that when
you are listening to music you don't
have to have the phone face down or face
over it will play out the side so the
speaker doesn't get cut up cut off on
the top we have a standby button and
that's it flipping over to the back they
did away with the diamond faceting and
replaced it with a fingerprint magnet
black shiny coating which I'm not too
big of a fan of and it also shows dirt
very well but anyhow up here we have a
five megapixel camera the same five
megapixel camera that comes with the
touch HD surrounded by a nice piece of
brushed metal and we take off the back
we expose the 1,100 milliamp hour
battery and unfortunately they put the
microSD slot behind the battery cover
and we really don't like to see that
it's better when it's out in the front
of the device so you can easily swap in
and swap out your memory cards
so overall the hardware on the HTC touch
diamond2 is quite fantastic
it has great build quality as we've come
to expect from HTC devices although this
device misses a few things such as a
flash on the camera I know the original
diamond didn't have a flash but this is
the next version and you'd think it
would have that improvement also we're
not really liking this black shiny
coating on the back it makes it scratch
very easily and prone to fingerprints
also a d-pad would have been nice
although the trend now for windows
mobile devices is to have no d-pad to
kind of clean up the front which is okay
and also an external micro SD slot would
have been preferred instead of having to
fish under the battery to put that in
but we're really excited about the
improved screen sensitivity a lot of
people complain that it's an on windows
mobile devices you have to press really
hard to activate things on the screen
but on this particular device I think
HTC has done some work with the screen
to make it more finger friendly and
require a lighter touch so coming up
soon we'll have the software tour
followed by the full review on
pocketnow.com we'll be back soon with
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
