invest heavily on improving audio for
the galaxy s eight Apple seems to be
dealing with other types of battery
issues in offering solutions NZT has
just delivered it's more powerful exon 7
I'm hi meri behna and I'm literally
tropical izing myself back at the old
studio this next few weeks this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals even though the
LG g5 was not our favorite smartphone it
continues to find some very significant
deals bear in mind the next G smartphone
should be announced somewhere around
februari March of next year so there's
still a good deal of time and for four
hundred dollars on both amazon and
newegg it might be a compelling deal for
at least some of you and for those of
you that thought that moto was dead
because the Z's weren't great bones but
interesting ideas the company continues
to prove that it really gets along with
Google and things like software updates
we now have Android 70 nougat launching
on the Moto Z you should be getting it
at your device is very soon and this
just proves that the company and its
sleeker approach to the operating system
is the best way to go hopefully other
manufacturers follow for those of you
the thought that that touch disease from
the iphone 6s was BS well it's actually
not the case up to the point where Apple
has finally acknowledged that it will be
doing something now the most interesting
part is that Apple really hasn't figured
out what is causing the problem and all
the company is doing is offering free
battery placements so if you're having
problems with your phone the smartest
thing go to a genius bar and they will
swap your battery for free november when
ZT announced the first android
smartphone with six gigs of ram and then
pretty much every other company launched
at first well that ZTE exon 7 it's just
the limited edition variant is now
official in the United States for five
hundred dollars the changes are the six
gigs of RAM in 128 gigs of storage you
get everything else that we actually
love about the axon 7 which is great
news and finally the very hot news they
have to do with sam singh in its
acquisition of harmon cartons expertise
most people were speculating that
samsung wanted to get into the car and
vehicle audio system technology business
apparently some trusted sources claim
that that's
really the case surely Samsung will be
receiving some benefits from that but
actually the ideal is to improve audio
on the galaxy s 80 have to remember the
Galaxy s7 is the worse in audio quality
according to wants testings that proves
that the company really needs to do
something and judging from my experience
with the huawei mediapad m3 and hardened
carbon technology that was amazing so it
leads me to the question of the day do
you think that is the way to go with the
galaxy s 28 that samsung needs to invest
in something like this in my case I do
believe it is in order but leave us a
comment down below we look to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
