of the Samsung Galaxy s8 in addition to
warranty services and the Rubin creative
Android has recently teased something
new and since the dawn of the red iPhone
it's been the challenge to get rid of
that white display I'm Jaime Rivera and
can somebody please take care of the
Thundercats movie already like seriously
this is parking out daily the official
loose today begin with product launches
those of you that are enticed by that
new midnight black one plus three t it
starts sales today obviously the price
tag is not as affordable as the other
versions of the oneplus 3 mainly because
you're starting at 128 gigs of storage
after remember that this phone is going
to be launched in limited quantities and
yeah you can bet that our unit is
already here so if you want to watch the
full video of it let us know in the
comments down below now as well as fall
out over to the red iphone because ever
since the product got launched
everybody's crazy over getting a black
display and actually doing that is not
that easy mainly because touch ID is
pretty much locked to the logic board
you have to pretty much swap everything
up to the point where I think they're
the only person that's managed to be
able to do it at least on YouTube is my
buddy Danny widget you can see more
about what he did in the link in the
description so far yeah you can't do it
it's just not easy and you kind of need
another iPhone how about if we move the
spotlight over to motorola we've got the
first weeks of the Moto X 2017 yes the
Moto X is coming back but there is a
problem that phone is really ugly it
looks like an uglier version of the Moto
G that we already consider extremely
ugly for 2017 which is not what has
characterized the Moto X at any point so
it seems that the flagship the
good-looking one is going to continue
being the Moto Z sadly we will keep you
posted as we learn more and how about if
we talk about Andy Rubin creator of
Android of he's been out of the Android
space for a while he was working
directly with Google and other projects
and this is rather interesting recently
he has teased the photo that I presumed
to be a Xiaomi me mix
but then he's teasing the fact that he
is really liking how this is shaping up
and he can't wait to get it in people's
hands so exactly what is it is it a new
operating system is it a new smartphone
that will run the operating system it
could be so many things that we would
love to know what you think it is in the
comments down below and finally a very
hotness to have to do the Samsung Galaxy
s8 we have two things that are extremely
important number one a full list of
specifications from a very trusted
source and given how close we are to the
launch it makes all the sense in the
world for this to be pretty much what
we're getting interesting specifications
but even more interesting is this new
Samsung guard s8 service that apparently
Samson will be launching what you're
getting here is pretty much an Apple
Care Plus on steroids it's so much
better because you can pretty much get
replacements or repairs two hours from
within when you may be appointment
whereas an apple that's a nightmare
another thing is that apparently you
will get better on-call services and
even more it seems that you will even be
getting a free screen replacement if you
break it that is awesome that is great
we just wonder if it's going to be free
or not and that leads me to the question
of the day with this Samsung guard s8
entice you to buy a galaxy Si and if so
how much would you be willing to pay in
my case I think Samsung's
track record with the note 7 would
really make it convenient for the
company to make it free this time that's
just me leave us a comment down below
with Oakland on your opinion friends you
know the way it goes if you want to get
the news earlier before the video was
filmed follow us on target now calm and
hit that subscribe button down below for
more videos like this one can also
follow me on twitter hi members quarters
that aren't into the Gravatt hi never
better just give this video thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I am hi Natalie
but I think so much for watching
we'll see it tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
