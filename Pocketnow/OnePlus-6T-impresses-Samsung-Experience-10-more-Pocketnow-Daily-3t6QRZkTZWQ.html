lot of the stuff that we've been
covering is pretty much confirmed a new
icon for the new iPad pro has been found
on iOS and it pretty much confirms every
rumor we've seen and some new
screenshots of the Samsung experience 10
have just the mirage showing us some new
changes I'm Jaime Rivera and yes this
face is because I'm pre recording
because I'm rushing to the oneplus event
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with a B and H and the
company's deals that will last pretty
much up until November 17 and these are
rather substantial depending on the
products that you're looking for you
could even get up to $900 in discounts
for products like MacBooks which is
really hard to find for mac books in
general like period up to the point
where there are some cases where MacBook
Pros would be like 1,300 bucks you can
learn more about the deals in the
description now let's talk about the
Xiaomi me mix 3 as well I am definitely
looking forward to having a look at this
phone josh is having all the fun right
now but if you're in Europe and you want
to get yourself a phone I would rather
recommend that you wait instead of
buying it somewhere else because
apparently it's gonna be launching in
the UK at least on November 8th so stay
tuned for that there seems to also be
some sort of like this treasure hunt
program that's kind of weird again you
can also learn about that in the
description now let's talk about Samsung
as the company's new experience 10 has
just been leaked in photos most people
complain about the company's user
interface and it seems that the company
has been listening up to the point where
we see some major changes number one it
looks a lot like stock Android up to the
point where it even adopts the pixel
font which I actually do hope it stays
because that pixel font is really cool
that seems to be one of the things
that's coming in addition to again just
the user interface seems simpler more
practical up let's just hope that it
doesn't change from here to there and
let's move the spotlight over to iPad
pros for those of you that are wondering
what the design changes are going to be
in the event that's happening on Tuesday
well I mean we've got icons we've got
new things that have just emerged on iOS
12 that just pretty much confirmed that
there will be very little bezel
no home button probably face ID and we
also heard rumors that during the event
we will see a new Apple pencil new ear
pods etc so stay tuned for the event I
presume that it's gonna be really cool
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the oneplus 60 the device has
been announced we were part of the event
at the pre-record this video to be able
to leave there but yeah I had some time
with the oneplus 60 over the weekend my
experience has been rather positive
obviously I know that it's polarizing to
loose things like the headphone jack in
addition to the fact that the Vice is a
little bit thicker now but it has to do
because you get a much larger battery
and sure there is a minor price bump but
that price bump if you consider gets
compensated by the fact that you started
128 gigs of storage so let us know in
the comments what do you think about the
oneplus 16 do you like it or not because
I'm really liking it so far
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
us I'm talking out on comment subscribe
to both of our channels English and
Spanish for more videos like this one

quarterly that are on Instagram at high

high in that a bit I think so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
