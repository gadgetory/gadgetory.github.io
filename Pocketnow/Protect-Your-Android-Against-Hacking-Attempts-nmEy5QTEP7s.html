is because it can do so many things
especially when rooted unfortunately
with that comes the ability for bad guys
to do many things especially when looted
I'm Joe Levi this is PocketNow today
we're going to talk about how to harden
your android against hacking attacks
this is my nexus 4 and the app I want to
show you today is called a sec droid sec
dro ID it's available both from
xda-developers in the thread it's also
available from the Play Store which is
where I got this one from it's available
in both free and donate versions the
donate version costs about $1 u.s. this
is an alpha its version 0.3 it is under
current development and there's a lot of
stuff going on with it so things can
change as more stuff is hardened and and
made secure for you so what exactly does
this do well very simply this app
execute a script that hardens your
Android for more information you can
visit the thread essentially you've got
a computer in your hand it's running a
variant of Linux and that variant of
Linux has all kinds of tools on it some
of those tools are SSH SSH detail net
netcat ping p.m. that's package manager
and ADB all of those are potential
attack vectors you don't need to be
running them all the time so with the
simple push of a button you can then
take care of it that's that's it that's
all it takes you're done your device is
now secured against attacks through
those vectors with a little bit of a
caveat ADB is only disabled until next
boot so if you need to use ADB you have
to reboot your device if you want to
secure against potential adb attacks you
want to go ahead and run this again so
that's the app there's not an awful lot
to show what it does it does in the
background and it does it oh pretty
simply now here's the catch it only
works on rooted devices kind of ironic
because rooted devices are usually the
devices that we don't need this kind of
protection what do I mean by that
well if I'm running on a rooted device
I've got an app called super user or
super su which is super
superuser it essentially is an app that
lets me decide which apps get super user
permissions you know the ones that get
to do bad stuff like steal my identity
and inject all kinds of code and stuff
where I don't want it unrooted devices
don't have that protection those are the
devices that really need the protection
here's another irony when you have a
device that you want to root you can
either route it the Nexxus way which is
officially sanctioned by Google kind of
or you can exploit a security hole to
get route to one of those very security
holes that this app intends to patch so
I know it sounds terribly terribly
ironic but if you want to secure your
Android and harden it from hacking
attacks you need to route it you need to
be running a super user app like super
user or super su and you probably want
to run a script just like the one I just
showed you once you've done that your
Android is going to be significantly
more secure than the one that you got
from your OEM or from your carrier if
you like what you saw here today and
maybe you learned a little bit of
something please give the video a thumbs
up why not share it with your friends on
Facebook Twitter or Google+ pocket now
is on all of those for pocket now
showing off ways that you can harden
your android against potential hacking
attempts I'm Joe Levi thanks for
