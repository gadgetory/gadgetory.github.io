leaks the iphone 6 and 2 models Windows
Phone 8.1 GDR one is reportedly close
leaving the oven as Android wear devices
begin to ship so half the complaints I'm
high metairie bet I and what exactly
just happened to Brazil in the world cup
I'm not gonna give out any numbers this
is parking out daily official news today
are kind of boring as Sony tease the
ultimate selfie phone and what we got is
uh well another Xperia this area is III
it's got a 5 megapixel front-facing
camera with a wide-angle lens just like
every HTC device right now so it's
really hard to consider this hot it's
actually a mid-range phone but these and
specifications like sensor triple
details on what you get now how many of
you are already rocking Windows Phone
8.1 on your device I know not very many
of you as the update hasn't really
reached everyone yet and still Microsoft
is apparently already working on
finalizing gtr1 for Windows Phone 8.1
does reportedly leaving the oven in two
weeks for Microsoft for carriers to
approve again the biggest question is
when are we getting windows phone 8.1
for the rest of the people that are
already supporting it advice we'll see
now one cool feature that dust get
updated all the time is Google now
Google is apparently working on giving
you music control functionality through
commands you can say ok Google next
track and it'll work there's a leaked
video makes the scrivener full details
on that it is a little awkward as they
have to say ok Google now and the next
track but it's better than not having
the option at all pacemakers have
single-handedly leaked the iphone 6 in
every way starting from cases to
mock-ups of the device and spitting has
this amazon listing that is still alive
right now again mix disruptions to see
that of their cases for the iphone 6 and
they're leaking two things here number
one we've got two devices a 4.7 inch and
a 5.5 inch model with pretty much the
same design and then what we have as
well as a launch date for these cases on
September 30th so that's pretty much the
probable launch date of the iphone 6
senses a Apple has a really interesting
relationship with case makers this is
probably true
and finally for the very hot and as will
disappointing news of the day these are
actually separate uh Android wear
devices are already shipping to everyone
everybody's unboxing their devices right
now our whole links in the description
have our unboxing video and set up tour
for everything you'd expect from both
the G watch and a samsung gear live now
speaking of that gear live here's where
the negative news come as customers
already reporting that the class that
allows you to charge this device is a
really bad up to the point that it
actually breaks after a couple of uses
and for people that have pretty much
unboxed their product right now that is
actually terrible but that leads you to
the question of the day what Android
wear device that you pick LG G watch
your Samsung gear live or are you
waiting for the Moto 360 in my
particular case I am waiting for the
Moto 360 but leave us a comment down
below what you pick friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
