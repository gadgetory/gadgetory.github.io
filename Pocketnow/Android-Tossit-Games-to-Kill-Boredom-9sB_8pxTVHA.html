now most of my videos and articles are
all about how to be more productive and
do more while out on the road or mobile
with your android-powered phone today
we're going to do something different
i'm going to show you two games whose
goal is only to waste time I know it's a
stretch but let's go take a look ok so I
have two games for you today they're
both basically the same thing they are
both wadded up paper shooters I'm gonna
invent an entirely new category of games
for this video but that's basically what
they do first I've got paper toss second
I've got toss it let's go into each one
paper toss is the first one that I tried
and have spent the most time with it's
also got the most annoying sound effects
you've got a couple different areas that
you can go to an airport a basement a
restroom and three levels to play I'm
going to choose easy for you because
flicking this on on a phone with a
camera in the way is not as easy as it
looks but the game is really pretty easy
to pick up when you're holding it flat
in your hand so what you've got is your
waste paper basket that's your target
your scoreboard your wadded up paper
that you just flick with your finger to
make go into the basket and then some
wind in this case it's an office fan
with a little indicator to show you what
direction and what speed it's coming at
so based on that speed and direction
you'll need to adjust how you flick this
to get it into the basket first and
foremost this game is free in the market
it is sponsored by ads which you see
running up at the top I think they're
pretty unobtrusive so it's really not a
bad deal but let's get right into the
game wind wasn't going strong enough
that time like I said this is a lot
easier to play when you're looking right
at it and it's right in front of you
it's a little bit more difficult here on
camera
now I'm going to stop playing there
because really that takes the point out
of the game you can go and get this app
and waste all the time yourself so I'm
going to let you do that but before that
we're going to exit and I'm going to
come over here and show you toss it now
toss it like I said is what I think is
the better of the two games and you'll
see why in just a minute this is also
free also sponsored by ads but it does
have a pro version that you can get if
you want to pay a little bit of money
for it there are lots of levels to
choose from so I'm just going to choose
the office environment like we did
before again we've got a fan a speed
indicator I like this speed indicator a
little bit better than I do in the last
game and then the same basic concept you
flick it to get it in there and I hit
somebody off-screen there apparently the
game really isn't any more difficult
than the last version again it's just a
little bit more difficult to gauge the
angles you need when you're shooting on
camera so that's basically it but I'd
like to show you the other levels here
because they really are kind of
interesting you've got a boat with no
fan in this case you've just got wind
coming across the boat same idea though
this one is the one I really want to
show you all these boxes are target
points and that fan over there is
stationary so in addition to having your
basket way out over there the target
stay still but you're watching off point
moves so you see here I'm on this next
box up so I can't use the same angle
that I just used with my previous throw
because it's not going to go in so I
have all these different variations in
this one level which makes it very very
complicated and makes this less of a
brain boring brain waster and more of a
strategy type game but show you a couple
other levels here because these are
really pretty levels here you've got
like a kitchen environment same thing
watching it from a frying pan this time
don't burn yourself you got something
classic this one your target is moving
so in addition to the wind you've got to
wait for this to get right where you
want it to be before you make your toss
so here we go the pressures on wish me
luck guys and I just missed it but you
can see it's really kind of a cool game
all the different levels and what not
and even got some preview levels this
one's really really nice it's got some
other phone I don't know what it is
maybe it's a nokia who knows but you're
doing basically the same thing you're
just tossing in the trash I mean maybe
it's not a very good phone who knows you
can throw them all over the park too i
love it it's great it's a little simple
i think that's an orange on the back of
the phone but whatever moving on to the
next one another office environment this
time you're shooting from the floor a
little bit more complexity there you've
got some pre preview levels this one's
kind of fun because it's really easy so
if you've got kids that you just want to
occupy their time yeah just shoot and
you get feedback almost every shot so
that's nice for the younger crowd I
showed you that one already let's go on
to the next and the last one and this
one is kind of like an art gallery or
studio or something and I can't even see
it my arrow on that but we'll make a
toss it's a bit further out so anyway
that's uh that's what I wanted to show
you it's just a couple simple simple
games that aren't really complicated
anybody can play them yes you can turn
the sound off if you're in a where sound
would be frowned upon but it's something
you can do to occupy the time of course
you go always crack out your kindle app
and read that book that you've been
longing to but if you just want
something to kill some idle time waiting
for a train or a bus there you go it's
it's really nice really simple and
honestly has entertained me for hours
which I'm kind of embarrassed to admit
but with some time wasting games that
are kind of fun and really really
repetitive I'm Joe for pocketnow.com hey
it's Joe again look normally I don't do
it
railer to my videos but this time I
thought one was warranted I don't
usually do games on my phone I don't
usually do reviews of games but let me
know how did I do did you like the games
that I showed you would you like more
information about it is there something
I didn't cover what games do you want to
see reviewed I've got a couple others in
mind that I'd like you to see subscribe
to our channel so that you make sure
that you don't miss those and of course
if you like this video give me a thumbs
up now of course if you've got something
you'd like me to cover leave me comments
