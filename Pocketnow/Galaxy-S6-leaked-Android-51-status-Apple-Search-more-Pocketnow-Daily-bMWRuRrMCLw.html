chassis and man it looks like an iPhone
Apple is rumored to work on some new
competing services to buy google and can
you believe that android 5.1 is already
in the market I'm hi Mary vera and this
is parking out daily brought to you by
Linda calm the official news today are
kind of weird as believe it or not
android 5.1 is already in the market but
not for everyone it's actually Android
one they're calling it android 5.1
because apparently there is this update
for asia and it brings a couple of
features there and it seems that google
is already testing android 5.1 for the
current nexus products in addition to
every single other android smartphone in
the world so stay tuned as we will learn
more very soon now in some very expected
and logical news for today we learn
about Windows RT Microsoft has just made
it official that Windows RT is that the
company has put the Lumia 2520 two
breasts we've been hearing about a
successor a little bit 2530 but yeah now
Microsoft has confirmed there is no more
windows RT and whatever products
currently running Windows RT are doomed
yes because there will be updates to
windows 10 but not necessarily the ones
we expect so uh buyers beware and
speaking of windows we learned that HTC
is also working on HTC one and nine for
Windows just like we see the Android
bearing apparently the company is also
working on its windows variant this is
really interesting as it could be that
the company is planning to announce both
devices at the same time at mwc or
whatever they will announce it and we
will be standing by as that would be a
very smart move from the company
especially they figure out a dual boot
now let's move the spotlight over to
Apple as the company is trying to do two
things that Google already does first of
all KPIX this a radio station in San
Francisco recently reported that there
is this odd minivan with cameras at the
top and leased by Apple running around
the Bay Area it turns out yes it seems
that Apple is working on its own Street
View service but even more interesting
is a recent job posting as Apple is
looking for experts to build its own
search engine it seems and yeah that
would definitely
had Google's turf let's see if they pull
another Apple maps or not and finally
for the very interesting rumors of the
day we get the first leak shot of the
galaxy s6 chassis reports claim and if
you look at it it's fully aluminum as
the rumors claim but even more
interesting it looks like the iphone 6
and the sony xperia z3 had a baby it
looks pretty much like the same phone
and everything except the fact that the
speakers are at the bottom and non front
firing which looks like an iPhone 6 in
addition to all the different cuttings
for you know the antenna etc etc and it
just seems that Sam Singh is clearly
planning to revamp the whole deal or it
could be that this is not the galaxy s6
will learn more than WC but it leads me
to the question of the day would you
prefer for Sampson to continue its
current design language or to build
something that looks like an iphone with
the galaxy s6 because in my case I
actually liked Sam sings design believe
