situation waiting for the xperia x
performance expecting more of a change
from the Xperia X we've already reviewed
if you watched that video we'd maybe
recommend just skipping to the
conclusion here as quite a bit of that
review will be echoed in this device
before us now for those of you who
haven't watched the xperia x review
let's dig in Sony's mission this year
streamline focus on the features which
really matter no more fun experiments
like 4k displays however this
streamlining approach for the hardware
has not trimmed the price tag Sony is
still very much positioning this as a
premium offering even though it's now
two letters lower in the alphabet
getting the tech specs out of the way
there aren't any surprises here our
review unit packs a 5-inch 1080p LCD
that resolution is fine for daily use
but most flagships have moved up to quad
HD and this LCD is not one of the easier
screens to read outdoors from the
regular Xperia X we move from a
mid-range welcome 650 to the top-tier
welcome 820 chipset but then pretty much
everything else remains the same three
gigabytes ram 32 gigabytes of storage 13
megapixel selfie camera and a 23
megapixel rear camera oh and the battery
capacity creeps up from two thousand six
hundred and twenty milliamp hour to two
thousand seven hundred milliamp hour and
for people dropping an Xperia outside of
the United States you'll get this handy
power button fingerprint sensor which is
much improved over last year's z5 but
sadly buying one here in the United
States means this feature will be
removed this is all fine Hardware
perfectly usable it does the gig well
but we can't shake the feeling that
we're getting a nice Toyota at a loaded
Lexus price at least in terms of style
the X performance mostly looks the part
this year's Xperia will look familiar to
Sony aficionados it's a hard rectangular
look which more than once I've compared
to the monolith from 2001 and I'm
recycling the shot here because my
photoshop skills are terrible and it
makes me laugh
it is a sexy-looking device with its
brushed metal back but there were some
slight QA issues with our review
these seams on the bottom edge slightly
distract from an otherwise clean look
and the side panels separating from the
foam body after pulling out the SIM card
tray the xperia is rated ip68
water-resistant but with this bowing on
the pieces here
we couldn't confidently test that water
resistance one reason why we might spend
more on a phone is to better guarantee
that potential manufacturing issues are
sorted out before they reach consumers
now Sony software offerings are also a
bit conservative subtle tweaks
throughout the user interface like more
colorful icons are eye-pleasing but the
actual function well resembles a stock
Android layout the app drawer has an
extra page for recommending apps but
otherwise it's easy to scroll through to
get to what you want there is a little
uninstall able bloat like AVG but
additional services like these are kept
to a minimum sony includes a few branded
apps like a widget to walk you through
setting the device up any PlayStation 4
companion app sadly I still Rock a ps3
so I was unable to test this feature all
of the software is well powered by the
Qualcomm chip set and you'll rarely
encounter lag or jank when tackling the
basics the 820 is plenty powerful though
we do have some concerns over thermal
throttling when taxing this hardware we
see some framerate drops in games like
implosion after only a single mission
and checking out benchmarking scores it
doesn't take much to get this phone to
slow down this is readily noticeable
when using the camera like the Xperia X
the X performance just runs warm the X
will shut off the camera after around 9
minutes of video while the X performance
extended that runtime to 13 minutes of
video mind you this was 1080p video
under air-conditioning with the screen
about half bright out in California
summer heat we would start getting
thermal warnings after as little as 20
seconds of video recording but actually
using the camera will be an exercise in
frustration for many folks in our
audience Sony's disorganized collection
of auto modes and hidden settings makes
this one of the more unfamiliar
photography solutions we've yet tested
extremely unreliable autofocus twitchy
software stabilization a fringe and
flare prone lens and a
of seen modes when really we could just
use with a true full-featured manual
mode and maybe an easier way to force an
HDR shot oh and for folks who like to
edit raw support would definitely be
nice the situation gets worse looking at
video where this phone delivers somewhat
mediocre 1080p footage with no options
to move up to quad HD or UHD video not
that you'd be able to use those modes
for long giving the phone's thermal
issues it's really a shame as this is a
fantastic image sensor and you can coax
some great shots out of it but the
entire rest of the phone lets it down as
a photography solution the worst sin of
all it's just not much fun to use audio
playback is also something of a
disappointment the front-facing speakers
are respectable though outclassed by HTC
in this price range headphone audio
however is particularly sad we're a long
way removed from the classic days of
Sony standing as a multimedia juggernaut
the Xperia X has a fairly weak amp
paired up with a DAC that sports numbers
almost as bad as the built-in DAC on the
LG g5 for a flagship it has some of the
poorest signal to noise and distortion
performance we've yet tested lastly
looking at battery life we just
shouldn't expect much from a powerful
phone which runs warm and has a smaller
than average battery this 2700 milliamp
hour cell struggles to keep up with
other phones in this tier using our
media test streaming 30 minutes of HD
video over Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the X
performance drained almost 12% of its
battery showing us even worse
performance than the regular Xperia X
this just might be the worst performing
phone we've tested this year and those
numbers were mirrored during our camera
review shoots a galaxy s7 could easily
make it to mid-afternoon shooting you HD
video while connected to LTE the X
performance was dead after lunchtime
shooting photos and HD video while in
airplane mode in recharging the phone
the recharge speeds are respectable but
again far from impressive 30 minutes on
a quick charger delivered a 28% recharge
so let's wrap this up where does that
leave us with the sony xperia x / 4
yeah this one was tough folks reviews
are largely subjective accounts of a
person's experience with a gadget though
we do try not to let our personal
preferences overly color how we use in
test Afon and i have to admit to not
being able to fully partake of the sony
eco system lacking a current playstation
but i can't believe that's a significant
omission as it pertains to daily
smartphone use every brand carries fans
and critics and sony is no different
continuing a long reputation for
building stylish consumer electronics
Tony for example will likely go on to
use this phone as either his daily
driver or his backup once I send it back
to him but I personally can't shake the
feeling that this device asks a lot of
Sony fans to keep using this brand
none of these compromises our absolute
deal-breakers but we also can't find any
areas where this phone scores
significant victories when stepping
outside of the Sony fan base I find
little compelling reason for someone to
switch to a Sony at this time unless
someone loves the look and form factor
of this phone the premium price tag
doesn't seem to deliver any benefits
over similarly priced flagships and this
handset struggles to compete against
this year's crop of mid rangers after
retiring the Xperia Z the entire ex
lineup represents a drastic shift in
philosophy for Sony and many transition
devices were a bit rough around the
edges we can only hope that future
xperia x phones are better refined and
well rounded products as always thanks
