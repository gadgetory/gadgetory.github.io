cause of the Galaxy Note seven fires go
beyond the battery cyanogen Jacobs are
now official and we get to see some
high-level people leaving and expect a
ton of Nokia offerings for the
smartphone market very soon I'm hi Mary
vera and this is the fifth time that I
record this video Thank You power
outages this is fog on a daily the
official news today begin with deals and
these are really good best buy is now
offering either the lgb 20 or the LG g5
depending if you get either verizon or
sprint on installments you can actually
leave with a 32 inch smart TV and if you
actually consider going for the g5 you
even get ton of accessories in addition
to that you can learn more about the
deals and the link of the description I
do love the b20 as well the spotlight
over to Google as the company has just
launched its new or update Android 711
nougat this is pretty much the first
should we say major update coming to the
pixel the update should reach pixels and
in addition some Nexus devices very soon
and what what you're getting is mostly
you I aesthetics changes more of a way
to standardise things you can learn more
about all the change long in the link in
the description as well now as well the
spotlight over to nokia we were
expecting either one or two smartphones
but then we've got hmd CEO Shiming that
there are a ton of offerings coming
apparently nokia wants to make a big
splash we're expecting this to happen at
mwc whether it's smartphones or tablets
doesn't really matter apparently even
carriers are really pumped with the
whole negotiations that Nokia's
providing to the table we can't wait to
see what they're coming up with and
another company that we're waiting to
see what they come up with this cyanogen
the incorporation of rom apparently is
not going to well up to the point where
the whole shake-up is now official of
Steve Kondik is out of the company of
its really dramatic apparently there's
back and forth on Google+ over Steve
Kondik complaining about the company and
the administration and the reason why
everything's failing and I don't know
why that even matter
now because he's no longer there so
apparently the whole change is to
streamline the future of cyanogenmod
let's hope it actually happens we'll see
and finally the very hot and to a
certain degree explosive new step
through with the Samsung Galaxy Note
seven why we've got this new firm
conducting studies over the smartphones
engineering and design and apparently
this was not just the battery problem
sure the battery was exploding and there
were internal process battery but
apparently the tolerances in the design
of the galaxy note 7 were just so
compact that regardless it would have
still costs trouble this is rather
interesting as we know that Samsung
changed this battery vendor it didn't
change the design and we know that the
design had major things to do with it
but apparently this was going to
continue happening anyways and it leads
me to the question of today what do you
think Samson should do with the future
of the new lineup we've heard that the
company is stitching it you know
honestly I wish that the company just
came back to its roots with the Galaxy
Note lineup came up with a no holds bar
bang guard phone that we've always loved
