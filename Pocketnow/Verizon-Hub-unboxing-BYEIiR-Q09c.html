pocketnow.com and today we're going to
unbox a very interesting product from
Verizon Wireless it's called the verizon
hub and it's basically a voice over IP
desk phone that integrates with the
verizon wireless products and services
it's not something you would expect from
a cellular carrier and I'm very
interested to try out the concept open
up the box here it's a nice solid box
and on the top here you've essentially
got the phone with the 7-inch screen and
I guess this holds the wireless handset
we've got a packet of instructions and
looks like we've got to style us so the
screen is a touchscreen like we have a
battery I presume for the handset that's
what that looks like an Ethernet cable
here's the handset so the handset fits
into here and we've got a mount that
fits somewhere want to figure out how
that goes so that it acts so I guess it
stands on the desk and then of course
the power supply now from what I
understand this unit works via Wi-Fi or
can be connected directly to that
via cable so the back of the unit we've
got us be here we've got the ethernet
connection obviously the power
connection and it says it's powered by
open peak to interesting I've got a
headset connection another USB
connection here so that's interesting I
guess this is where you put the stylus i
also received a router for the verizon
hub and this looks to be a four port
router it's got USB connection it's a
westell unit which verizon use is quite
a bit for their dsl connection this is
modelled 7501 i'm not sure whether you
need this or not or this is a supports
the qos required by voice over IP i have
fios here which is a verizon product so
we'll see how well it integrates with
the internet connection since the
quality of service or qos is critical to
making voice over IP work well so i'm
going to connect up and charge up this
unit then i'll be back with the hardware
tour in my next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
