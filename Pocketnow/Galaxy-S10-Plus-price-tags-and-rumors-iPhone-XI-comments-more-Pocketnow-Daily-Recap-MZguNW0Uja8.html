to say about that
I believe the iPhone iPhone 10 Sampson
hold my beer Galaxy 10x because of
course you don't have enough numbers for
that why don't just call yourself jet
lag leave it I instead
dude that is a good idea that's right
it's that time of the week I am he met
Aviva now this is PocketNow and this is
the bargain a daily recap your comments
for last week so the news on Monday were
about the 1 + 7 leaks we had heard some
than we found others this time to
different units I asked you what you
thought 331 comments hopefully the 1 + 7
will have a slide mechanism like the
Xiaomi me mix 3 no I don't want that but
hey if you want it it's cool I get it
Josh loves it I don't because you don't
get water resistance I think a company
should test the water and see how a
phone does without the front-facing
camera there was a time when we didn't
need these things actually didn't become
popular until the iPhone 4 back then
there were front-facing cameras but only
for video calls over GSM for those of
you that remember that so I would prefer
some sort of way for me to be able to
see myself in a selfie camera and just
take the shot if that display on the 1
plus 7 is real it may make some $1000
smartphones look ugly dude that is so
true and that's what I love about
oneplus they do an amazing job at
teaching other companies
what phone should be priced at but on
Tuesday the topic was the Nokia 9
PureView the multiple camera thingy that
we've been talking about price tags were
rumoured between 800 and 900 dollars I
asked you what you thought we had 350
comments the Nokia 9 5g is going to be
an interesting phone especially if it
has Android 1 oh my god
so here's the thing I've been playing
with the Nokia 7.1 watch my video I
liked when I got the phone I was like
yeah alright until I try to Android 1
yes definitely I can't wait to see more
of that probably I mean ready for
whatever Nokia is giving out after this
true that if they could pull that off I
am looking forward to whatever 5g or
whatever they're gonna do I'd be willing
to buy it if one camera can see through
clothes
yeah Superman that on Wednesday the
topic was the galaxy s 10 plus whatever
name it's gonna have and the rumors that
one of these variants is gonna be priced
above 1,400 bucks I asked you if you'd
be willing to pay for that we had 490
comments Samsung is following Apple's
fate of Destruction with these crazy
price tags they've already been there
like there was a time when galaxies were
tad more expensive than iPhones and
Samsung felt that guys remember the
galaxy s5 compared to the iPhone 4s for
example so why are we going back to that
truth honestly the s10 5g I don't see
people paying up that cash unless you
add something else
5g alone just isn't worth it even more
show with it not being really out there
exactly what's the point of paying so
much money for a phone you won't be able
to use to its max potential $1,500 for a
galaxy s 10 X nope
I'd rather get that new Motorola RAZR
dude I wouldn't pay that amount of money
for any phone but I would prefer to go
for that razor as well so long as they
get the camera right but on Thursday
galaxy s 10 was once again oh my god
it's gonna be the topic going forward it
was spotted in the wild I asked you what
you thought about the photos we had 390
comments I feel like the punch hole
isn't much better than a teardrop notch
but ultimately I like this whole
teardrop versus knotch
I honestly I prefer the punch hole any
day over a notch especially with how
large it's getting on certain phones aka
pixel so sure why not
bigger is better can't wait to see the
finished product galaxy s 10 plus that's
what she said yeah I don't know man
bigger what bigger not ripping her phone
the phone looks fine it's another step
towards a bezel a screen exactly I feel
that it's a step in the right direction
it's getting smaller it's a-you know the
technology's just not there so let's
just walk this path instead of getting
large bezels again and then finally
Friday believe it or not there was no
talk about galaxies we were talking
about the iPhone 11 because we heard
triple cameras ugly designs I asked you
what you thought about the possibility
of these three cameras we had 357
comments Abilene's to work on pricing
battery headphone jack and fingerprint
scanner rest are all
you mean they need to work on another
phone right Apple is walking on Nokia's
path one day they will start to listen
to their consumers and it's too late yes
and no there's one company that gets
consumers right is Apple and things like
photography
this is something that consumers want
but I do get your comparison with Nokia
they set on their laurels forever
battery price tag and that bloody notch
are things athletes to work on indeed
but then again you know it's not that
I'm defending the notch it's just
there's no chin and there's
functionality for that notch that's the
reason why I don't complain about it
that's it for the bargain hounds daily
