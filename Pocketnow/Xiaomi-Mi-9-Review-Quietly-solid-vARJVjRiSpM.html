smartphones right now inundated by
motorized cameras crazy new features and
sometimes features we don't quite
understand while it is an exciting time
there's still room for phones that are
simply just getting things done right
and this is one that gives you plenty of
the trends of the current generation
without overdoing on where it matters
most the price that is if you're lucky
to be in a market that sells this solid
yet somewhat quiet flagship smartphone
this is PocketNow and I'm Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody this is our
review of the Xiaomi me 9 I have to
chalk this up to the color that I got of
this phone but there's a quiet dignity
to the Xiaomi me 9 this gray color
shines to the eye and fits comfortably
in the hand Xiaomi manages to make a
phone that is thin easy to handle yet
isn't lacking in many of the aspects
that count for average users there's a
nice curve to the body that helps the
phone sit comfortably in the hand and
the footprint is not too hard to
maneuver for smaller hands the display
is an AMOLED screen over 6 inches and
there is just a teardrop match up top
that provides some good southies and
pulls double time for face unlocking
that's not to say that the phone is
lacking an eye-catching aesthetic that
triple camera on the back is meant to
impress and one of the sensors even has
the shiny multicolored circle that
reminds users hey where's Xiaomi we like
to party and the features that are
introduced here are now proven trends
included to ensure everyone knows that
Xiaomi is not behind the times
after all the me 9 was one of the first
phones to come with the snapdragon 855
which is now pretty common in the
flagship space they take full advantage
of this processor for the updated me UI
which hull admit is not everyone's cup
of tea but manages to have fast and
smooth daily performance even for power
users new UI provides some features in a
gaming mode that is weirdly tucked away
in the security app that helps to boost
performance and puts notifications aside
so you don't get distracted during
gameplay versions of this phone can get
up to 12 gigabytes of RAM but that is
obviously overkill and the version I'm
using with 6 gigabytes of RAM and 128
gigabytes of on-board storage is plenty
for everyday use what if I'm funny about
the hardware is how mixed the bag can be
there's no headphone jack but Xiaomi
adds plenty of control over wired audio
when using an adapter or even better
some of the company's own audio products
the in display a fingerprint reader is a
good performer and I've had no issues
getting in to meet you I quickly
speaking of quickly there is a dedicated
button for Google assistance or
whatever assistant is relevant for your
market the battery is also not going to
impress anyone
on paper as this is a flagship phone but
it was only given a 3300 milliamp hour
unit that all said new UI is aggressive
with its background app management and
battery life is still pretty decent
Xiaomi does a great job of supporting
the small battery with fast charging
both wired and wireless when using a
compatible charger the phone kicks into
what is called charge turbo and then
there is a software I've already alluded
to this a little the expected mixbag
me--why has come a long way but I still
see some people getting frustrated with
the different features and design
aspects personally I like it and I find
myself enjoying its usage on the daily
no there's no app drawer but that isn't
a big deal when you get used to where
your icons are or do you do some
diligent organization some props I do
have to give me UI this time around is
the way it handles an always-on display
I mean look at it this looks really cool
it's got this planet with this moon here
and then under is the fingerprint reader
which I already said is a good performer
this was a bit of a surprise for me
because the phone just did a software
update one day and then this great
standby screen appeared and then finally
we'll talk about the cameras there are
three of them on the back and one of
them is a wide-angle lens which is
awesome to use for both photo and video
you might have seen a real world camera
test that I use this phone in at the
Great Wall of China and I've vlogged it
the entire experience using just this
phone alongside that wide-angle lens is
a zoom lens a 2 X optical zoom telephoto
lens that helps with portrait modes
however there is actually a mode inside
of this camera that allows for a
full-body portraits which is pretty
interesting but all of this is just
secondary or rather it bolsters an
experience already backed by a great
sony IMX 48 megapixel sensor that's
right this is the sensor that you might
be hearing a lot about in a lot of
different phones and I've been impressed
by all of them so far the Xiaomi me 9 is
no exception you can get some really
great 12 megapixel shots by the
oversampling that the 48 megapixel
sensor does or you can actually use it
plainly as a forty eight megapixel
shooter now obviously because there's
way more data in the 48 megapixel shots
zooming in at the same area means that
you get a little bit more detail in the
48 megapixel picture the only misstep I
see here is that the forty eight
megapixel mode is a single shot other
companies are using the 48 megapixels
with something like hdr+ in order to get
a bunch of different photos and put
together the best final result overall
the picture quality no matter what
camera you're using on the Xiaomi
is exactly what you would want it to be
for a flagship device but the best part
about Xiaomi phones is that you're
getting those flagship features at a
lower price than most others the me 9
undercuts a lot of phones that come in
close to that $1,000 price point but of
course the big issue here is that you
don't really have this one available in
more markets
ultimately what Xiaomi proves what the
me 9 is that they can still create a
flagship experience without having to
try too hard they have plenty of other
phones that add in some new features or
some different design elements that are
exciting yet incredibly different but
this is just a good daily driver that
you can get for a fairly affordable
price and you can rely on it for your
daily usage it might get lost in the mix
but when you need something that just
works the Xiaomi me 9 is definitely part
of that list but we want to know what
you all think are you actually using the
Xiaomi me9 it has been out for a little
while now so some of you might actually
have it and we want to know what your
daily experience has been thus far in
general though let us know what you
think about this phone and then drop
some lights on these videos so we know
that you love what we're doing here at
pocket now if you haven't subscribed to
the channel already you should do so and
then look forward to our next video we
will see you in our next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
