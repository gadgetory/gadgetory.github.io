and I'm here with Martian watches for a
new SmartWatch so here you've got the
Martian notifier new SmartWatch so the
notifier allows you to not just get a
notification but to actually filter
which ones you want to get we pre
populate with about 20 of the most
popular social media apps but it's not
just social media and personal messages
that come in through his notifications
its news weather sports scores Fitness
data etc right here on any app that
creates a notification anything that
creates a push notification can be
pushed to the to the watch and with
control okay thank you at my cartoon you
I think on iOS 7 and Android which
version 3.3 and above so here you can
see I popular with run meter and
SportsCenter so I could get scores when
I go to SportsCenter I go to the actual
SportsCenter app from ESPN I set up push
notifications it's quite easy to do and
I'll even show you here we'll just do
this and we'll see what's going on
SportsCenter right now so bye goodbye
boner
let's work
scores okay we've got a major league
baseball let's look is there a game
going on tonight 705 Philadelphia eight
o'clock but what I would do if I went
through Red Sox Yankees I turned that
button and I say okay I want a
notification game start third innings
every time there's a score close game
plan they done so now I've got the red
sox-yankees game for the rest of the
night I will beginner one whose
manifestations on what's it gonna say
only when it comes through will say Red
Sox by Yankee spies whatever nice nice
so what you see now on the screen is the
standard menu the menu tells me any
world clock time I want whether it's
right now it's set on New York time but
I could have said it on LA where were
Pacific times so that's the time then is
the connectivity battery level and
wireless leash then the date then the
local weather we're picking 9 degrees
here comes my wren meter app telling me
I've just finished another minute of my
rent I'll buy regarding haha but I can
set that up so that every minute it
gives me a notification line out for
around so you see notifications are not
just social they're news weather sports
travel updates anything you have and
we're actually going to be announcing on
our box and even on a website the topics
like 2030 apps that send notifications
to the watch with quick explanations of
how to use them about the battery life
of the watch five or six days nice and
how do you recharge it microUSB my
Korea's flash resistant that's the only
port and it's plugs pretty nicely
excellent and that's a pretty small
screen so it's probably less expensive
than other smartwatches well it's not
because the screen frankly the other
SmartWatch screens would have been a lot
less expensive than going with an
analogue movement in what we've been
it's actually the easiest thing to do
it's very difficult to integrate the
analogs with all these things we chose
the small screen because we we wanted it
to be non intrusion it also has better
battery life I'm sure I've been well
well yeah the other ones can't be on all
the time that's what they say battery
ARDS always looks like a watch yep so
you can almost see the time and it's
pretty long battery life so anyway you
saw that you saw these submenus that run
a light we can turn on the old LED light
so I could light up the fancy hotel room
we've got there not disturbed so I can
leave only silent alarms on I've got the
camera mode I can do a flying phone mode
if the phone app was under a newspaper I
could find it by pressing this and
that'll make the phone move over and
chime yes or I could just press the top
then to get Siri like cheery charms
so there's a microphone on the watch no
this one is the original Wow that one
over there and speaker you can actually
speak into the watch it was the original
voice command watch first in the market
this one we've taken the Michael and
speaker off that's how we've made a
less-expensive $129 but you still if
your phone is in a cup holder in your
car you can still press this on your
wrist yes the save the phone right phone
no read text do whatever all right what
else can we do you showed me the remote
camera we've also got we did the camera
the light we also had replaceable watch
bands so these three models represent
the core three models of the so you can
use black wire red light a red will be a
Best Buy in June $129 and will be
separately selling I'm not sure Best Buy
is going to pick up the band's yet well
on our website but I think they'll soon
have them will be separately selling
these wristbands and they're a
quick-connect quick-release bands yet
with a knob on it so you're in one
minute you can change out bands they'll
sell for $19
okay did we miss anything I don't think
so I think you got the here's another
run meter coming through if I had missed
that message when it came through I can
if I saw it I can tap the screen I can
bring it back with a tap and bring it
back to the screen key and you can
scroll through your old note official
pushing both buttons simultaneously runs
through the last ten notifications turns
out I've been using you know we just
been letting good okay we're here say
there already but it would show emails
text messages calendar events all those
things all right thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
