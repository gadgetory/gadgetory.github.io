pocketnow.com and this is the software
review of the htc inspire 4G on AT&amp;amp;T
let's get to it so again as we've been
talking about the big story with the
inspire 4G on AT&amp;amp;T is the HSPA+ data
speeds that it can achieve we're going
to film another video talking more in
depth about this showing you benchmarks
we've run talking about whether this
really improves the experience so look
out for that but in this video we're
gonna dive into the Sense 2.0 interface
we're gonna benchmark this and we're
gonna show you how it performs on the
web and lots of other stuff that you
want to see so without further ado let's
get to it so turn it on here and what
we've got of course we'll zoom in on the
screen is HTC Sense some people love
this some people hate this the people
that love it like the eye candy the
visual appeal they like how sense shows
up in your email your call log your
photo gallery it's everywhere and the
people that don't like it think it's a
little bit too heavy a little bit too
intrusive and you really can't turn it
off sure you could install launcher pro
or ADW launcher and get a new home
screen interface but the Sense interface
goes into many many programs as I just
mentioned so for better or for worse
sense has been updated for this new
version 2.0 even a little bit above and
beyond what we saw on the Desire HD so
of course we've got seven home screens
to choose from I've got it kind of very
minimally populated with just three
widgets but we're going to go through a
lot more than that we've got the leap
features so we can zoom out to see all
of our home screens you still can't
subtract home screens which is very
silly because I'm gonna guess that a lot
of people aren't using seven home
screens they're using maybe three or
maybe four or five but not seven so
let's talk about what we have here of
course we have the new way to arrange
the widgets and that is by pressing the
button down here and we have this new
customization menu it's a really cool
feature that they've brought forward
here in the new version of sense we can
change the scene which of course is
pre-configured widgets so you can have a
scene for the weekend
shows you your Twitter feed and some
other apps maybe your gallery and then
you have a scene just for the weekday
maybe your schedule maybe if the UPS
application who knows what what you want
to keep an eye on we've got wallpaper
and also skins so let's go through some
of these if we go to wallpaper we can
choose HTC wallpaper and we get this
cool looking gallery that lets you flip
through kind of in this cover flow like
design the various different things the
various different wallpapers that come
on the HTC Inspire now as is the case of
a lot of these enhancements you can
press get more and you could link up to
the HTC hub to get more stuff from HTC
Sense comm we'll talk about that soon we
dive into scene you can kind of see
these different scenes HTC scene social
scene brings Twitter right up front
things like that and lastly if we go to
skin I've actually added this one on the
left it's called memories it's pretty
cool it comes from the HTC hub but
beyond that we've got the regular HTC
skin we've got the metal skin so if you
don't like the way that HTC Sense looks
you can at least change it out a little
bit so let me show you what this looks
like this one's kind of cool it really
changes a lot about what you're dealing
with here so you get a new background
you get a new buttons and you're gonna
see in a second if we go into a stock
application like the photo gallery
you're gonna see that even that has been
sort of redesigned with this new skin in
place so over here in gallery so look
down here you've got kind of an orange
strip instead of the black strip that
you got with the HTC skin so let's go
back to this menu here and we're just
gonna change it back cause it's a little
bit too busy for the sake of a
demonstration video here so we're gonna
jump back into the stock HTC skin and
here it is so let's go back into the
personalization menu and of course we
went through these three things and now
we have widgets up here that we can go
through here's a cool new feature and
this was seen in the desire hd you can
browse through all of the HTC widgets
with this one screen this is a little
bit cumbersome you've got 71 widgets to
scroll through they should have a
thumbnail view of this and hopefully in
the next version of sense they do that
and we can go back to the previous
screen of course we can add a wide
variety of widgets a lot of which you've
seen before
now if you go to get more HTC widgets
will see some widgets that you may have
not have seen before and this is coming
from HTC hub and the first time you use
HTC hub you have to sign up it's free
and it should be loading let's see what
we get here and what we get here is for
extra widgets that you don't get stock
on the device dice which really is just
a simple pair of dice that can animate
fortune cookie shows you your fortune
translator and word of the day so kind
of cool that HTC gives you some extra
widgets would be nice to see even more
so let's go back again we can add an app
shortcut we could add a shortcut to a
specific feature like a direct dial or
bookmark we can add a link to a folder
then we can personalize all this stuff
down here all from within this screen
let's actually add the word of the day
widget because you might not have seen
that before we can scroll all the way
down and here it is word of the day and
there's only one design here so we press
select and it loads and pretty cool so
every day you can check out the word of
the day now something that is kind of
annoying about HTC Sense is he still
can't resize widgets you know if you go
to launcher pro and you pay for the
premium version which is three bucks you
can resize widgets so for example I
could go to my favorites widget here and
resize it to only take up this much
space or this much space but with the
HTC Sense widgets you really don't get
that much flexibility what you see is
what you get
fortunately they do provide different
versions of the widgets so of course if
we go into widgets here and go to
bookmarks you have you know two options
but what do you do both of them take up
the entire screen how about something in
between that takes up a smaller size
anyhow so you get a choice of lots and
lots of beautiful HTC widgets as you
would expect with HTC Sense now let's
jump right into benchmarks we want to
benchmark this device and kind of give
you some context here about the speed
that we're talking about so we're gonna
run a quadrant standard here and we're
gonna run the full benchmark and I'll be
back in a sec with the score and we're
done let's see what we get Wow um let me
show you a little bit closer here we've
got about 1700 on quadrant which is
pretty remarkable even the Nexus S
running Android
point-three does around 1600 which is of
course faster snow than the nexus one
running fro you but this is a fast
device according to quadrant and then
real-world testing we've got to say that
this is a snappy device which is strange
because it's running you know a Qualcomm
1 gigahertz Snapdragon processor it's
not dual-core it's not even Android 2.3
it's 2.2 but hey it's pretty darn fast
speaking of which let's dump into web
browsing and talk about sort of the
browsing speed you can get a sense for
the performance of this device will it
pocket now here of course we're over
Wi-Fi I'm going to scroll down for the
desktop version so the mode all the
graphics and all the other stuff that
tend to make the device slow down a
little bit while that's loading I can
show you something else here if we go to
Windows we have the sort of 3d tab
viewer sort of tabs really windows so
then if we go back to windows we can
flip through between the two a little
bit heavy there you know HD so you could
have gone with something more simple
than that maybe some tabs along the top
but they kind of like to do things
fancily so let's go into landscape and
we can see what it's like to browse
around on the page
I've got plugins required to ask to work
so that's why you see those little icons
there but of course you will be able to
see Flash content scrolling and panning
is very smooth with the 4.3 inch Super
LCD display browsing the web is a joy so
if we zoom in we've got actually a flash
video within this link so we'll be able
to demonstrate that very fast
performance as you can see it's loading
the page quite rapidly and scroll down a
little bit and we're gonna see this
element so I'm gonna tap on it so that
it will load and let's see what happens
there it is a video we can press play
it'll play here or we can have it open
in the YouTube application for a little
bit more control over it and here we go
it's loading and we should be able to
tap and vote on this and go fullscreen
so there we go
YouTube player let's stop it so very
good performance on the web as you can
see let's test screen rotation speed
pretty fast and we've got a lot of Flash
elements on the page so we can't expect
it to be perfect but it's going pretty
quickly there
so quite capable web browsing here on
the inspire 4G let's go back to the home
screen and go into the applications to
see what apps we have here we do have
some unique entries we've got the AT&amp;amp;T
stuff of course family maps so you can
locate where family members are on a map
if they're using a similar program we've
got AT&amp;amp;T code scanner it's a lot of AT&amp;amp;T
stuff here as well I agree to the terms
and conditions and what this will let
you do is presumably scan barcodes and
get pricing information on certain
objects of course they've Google Goggles
and Amazon barcode scanner to do the
same thing got AT&amp;amp;T Navigator if you
want to get around there's a monthly fee
associated with that blockbuster comes
on the device of course you can also get
that in the Android Market connected
media is for the DLNA support now of
course with Dion and it's hard to say
DLNA you can be looking at multimedia on
your phone and sort of flick it off to
your TV so you can have you know a big
TV to share multimedia now your TV has
to support DLNA or you can get the
little HTC media extender which is
relatively inexpensive but as far as we
can tell a lot of people aren't using
DLNA right now and tell us in the
comments if we're wrong but it requires
you to have a supported television or
other device and a lot of people just
don't have a TV that has DLNA yet
because you know most people buy TV
every 10 years and not every two or
three years so let's move along here so
we've got other stuff that I want to
talk about HTC hub is very interesting
and it's kind of a way to extend your
HTC experience should mention that you
can hook up with HTC Sense comm to be
able to remotely wipe your phone track
it on a map ring it if you get lost in a
couch cushion and do a lot of other cool
stuff with it
oddly htcsense.com has lost a lot of
functionality since it came to USA
customers very strange don't really
understand why that is what we can do
here is see apps and plugins which are
applications that HTC particularly likes
and here we go it finally loaded so here
are the apps that HTC recommends this is
called media link which will work with
their little media
Hubb like a device that I mentioned
earlier which you can buy to make your
TV or any TV DLNA compatible over to the
right we have because of web album which
I installed because I use Picasa Web
album I wanted to sync up that photos I
had in the cloud over here on the right
we have a plugin that adds LinkedIn to
another panel of your people program
here that has lots of HTC Sense features
so you can add those off for free which
is quite nice so let's go back to a
previous screen
it says new category available that was
weird let's see what the new category is
see if you can recognize a new category
I really can't see the new category but
uh real quick we'll just show you what
this is downloads and you can see I've
downloaded the memories skin 4 megabytes
Picasa Web Albums and of course the word
of the day widget so back over here in
HTC hub got another thing called HTC
likes and we saw this on the desire hd
this is really cool this is basically an
application recommendation tool that
links into the Android Market so you're
probably wondering if you're new to
Android there's a hundred thousand apps
out there which one do i download well
this helps you a little bit by showing
you some of the really cool popular HTC
this one's cool call mom remind yourself
to call someone from your contact
it shows you what HTC recommends and you
can go through the categories two most
popular apps Angry Birds is right at the
top we've got friends comments so you
can link up how kind of have a social
feature there my downloads and over to
the right is marked items so just
quickly showing you what happens when
you actually tap on one of these things
let's go to Angry Birds I haven't yet
downloaded Angry Birds on here and of
course that's a necessity for every
device so if we click install we are
going to be dumped into the Android
Market and boom boom it's gonna be
installed just like that
so let's bounce back into the
application list again you can see what
else we have here
so a lot of the built-in Google stuff
like Google Maps we've got live TV which
is just another service AT&amp;amp;T that you
can pay for its using mobi TV so you can
actually watch live TV and here it's
going to show you the application in the
marketplace and you can use a trial and
then after that you can
hey if you like it so let's go back to
the program list once again we've got
HTC news HTC news and weather there's
the people I guess hub you could call it
and from here you've got the HTC Sense
interface you can swipe to the right you
can see call history you can see online
directories and all of your contacts
right within the screen which is quite
nice scroll down a little bit more we've
got a reader application so if you want
to download books ebooks of course you
can also load the Barnes on open look
application you can load the Kindle
application and Android there's a lot of
ways to get ebooks Google is HTC is
giving you another so a really cool 3d
looking way to browse their books and no
landscape interface unfortunately if we
click the little shopping cart
we're taken into the Kobo book store so
HTC is hooking up here with Kobo so you
can download books right onto your
device and utilize this pretty cool
eReader hub which there's also a widget
for by the way which is quite nice
scrolling down a little bit more let's
see what else we get on here that I
didn't add transfer data allows you to
bring forth data from your SIM card and
Wi-Fi hotspot is something else really
cool use for this phone because it can
do these fast data speeds is to use it
as a portable hotspot so if you're
traveling in a car you need some Wi-Fi
somewhere at a coffee shop you can use
this to beam your HSPA+ connection to
multiple devices we've got the same
portable hotspot application that you've
seen on multiple HTC devices something
else I want to talk about is on-screen
keyboards we've got some uniqueness here
so I'm gonna go into a new message I'm
going to actually just go into the text
messaging application here I'm gonna go
and compose message now we've got three
keyboard choices here which is great
because HTC for awhile phased out two of
their keyboards in favour for just this
one you see here and then they brought
back the the QWERTY keyboard the kind of
shirt type or T keyboard and also the t9
style keyboard so here we have the
regular QWERTY keyboard screen
sensitivity on here is fantastic so this
is a test of the keyboard and I'm not
even really looking but the
t9 is fantastic I want to go into
settings real quick and you're gonna see
what I mean by the different keyboard
choices so language and keyboard we'll
go over here keyboard types let's go to
phone keypad and we'll go back into that
draft tap and hold by the way another
way to multitask here on the inspire
each or inspire 40 is to swipe down from
the top and you get into the
multitasking list up here kind of cool
okay and now we have the t9 style pad
which is kind of cool if you're used to
using a t9 pad so let's do hey this is a
test I'm not as practiced with this as I
am with the other ones hey this is a
test so a lot less finger travel with
this one then with the full QWERTY
keyboard finally let me show you the
other keyboard the final one and then
we're going to end up the video by going
into more detail in the settings touch
input and let's change it to compact
working you know also known as sure type
or what have you and this one just
groups together the letters sort of in
two keys which is nice because you again
less fare travel but sometimes annoying
because you have to if you're trying to
spell a unique word that's not the
dictionary you got to take your time so
I'm gonna say this is a test
so very good prediction as you can see
there this is a test works very well or
of course you can just speak to the
device and say this is a test of the
keyboard BAM
it's amazing how how far voice
recognition has come so finally to
conclude this video I know it's getting
along there's just so much to show you I
want to jump into the settings and take
a look at what we have there because of
course HTC kind of does their own thing
in settings so we have a new entry here
personalized which you've seen before
you can access this from the home screen
will go back nothing new and wireless
network or some of this stuff here in
display I've turned off all the window
animations something that HTC has done
is made the system font smaller which is
nice because you fit more on the screen
at one time if you go into email you get
lots of the emails it's really taking
advantage of the resolution here I've
got here's the settings for the LED
notification that we
two in the hardware review so you can
specify when this little green light
blinks a great feature to have on a
smartphone because you don't always have
to turn on your phone and check if
you've got a new SMS or if you're
waiting for a clock so here are the
different things that you can check off
scrolling down a little bit let's see
what else we can take a look at here
that is unique that's not really unique
we've got power saver which is unique
unique to HTC devices what it does is
smartly it manages your power very
conservatively when your battery gets
below a certain point so turn battery
saver on and you set the percentage at
which it kicks in so say I gets a 10%
battery power I get a notification kind
of like telling a story here and then
from there it's gonna do all these
things it's going to disable background
data disable Wi-Fi disable Bluetooth
turn down screen brightness to a certain
setting turn off the screen after a
certain amount of things disable screen
animation disable vibration feedback
really smart feature because when you're
down to like 15 percent battery life
you're probably worrying that in a
minute you're not gonna be able to make
a phone call or at least on your htc
inspire 4G your phone is gonna be
managing the power and turning off
everything that's not necessary except
of course the phone and scrolling down a
little bit more nothing much different
down here AT&amp;amp;T software update is a new
entry kind of they rolled the HTC
software update and the AT&amp;amp;T update into
the same screen and about phone we went
through this previously so if we go to
network we said we see it says HSDPA not
HSPA although we have the HSPA+
indicator it sort of strange that it's
showing that and of course if we go to
software information we can see that we
are running Android 2.2 point 1 this
phone if we were betting people we'd say
is likely to get an upgrade to
Gingerbread eventually and of course if
you don't want to wait there will be
plenty of gingerbread builds available
on XDA developers once they root this
phone and one more thing to talk about
the camera application look how fast it
opens 1 to 2 seconds on a lot of other
Android phones you're talking about 3 or
4 seconds which may not be that long in
terms of shear seconds but when you're
trying to take a picture every second
counts so here we've got the camera
application which has been redesigned by
HTC now and what we can do here is a
variety of things we can switch to video
mode or to camera mode and of course in
video mode we can change the resolution
to full 720p or we can go all the way
down to you know MMS video which is very
low resolution and very low quality and
there's other settings here too it can
change the white balance record with
audio shutter sound that are those are
the settings for video but for the
camera we've got image adjustment white
balance resolution we can go all the way
up to 8 megapixels really curious to see
how pictures turn out here be sure to
check the four of you on pocket now
review duration widescreen whether you
want it to be widescreen or five by
three aspect ratio face detection I mean
they've got a lot of features here then
after you take the picture they've got
some cool stuff let me take a picture
okay here's a picture of the htc inspire
4G manual maybe not the most amazing
thing in the world so we can pull that
up we should get some some options here
so this is the new sort of gallery
settings so from here we can share to a
variety of services we can press the
little magic wand and we can do a lot of
editing so we can go to effects and this
is kind of cool it shows you a little
preview of what you can make it look
like sepia high contrast so you get some
you know photo editing tools above and
beyond what you typically get on your
usual Android phone which is quite nice
so let's say we like antique that's sort
of cool let's press save saving photo
now it's ready for your consumption you
can email it or whatnot so pretty cool
enhancement to the the camera
application here and it opens up quite
fast so that's it for the software
review of the htc inspire 4G this turned
out to be a long video because there's
just so much to talk about HTC has
impacted nearly every program that comes
on this phone again for better or for
worse depending on whether you like what
HTC does when you got ahead it to them
that they spent a long
time customizing this phone and really
making the experience consistent
pleasing there's a lot of eye candy a
lot of added functionality then once you
get on a stock Android phone so in terms
of software we're going to give the HTC
Inspire
a thumbs up because it packs a lot of
good stuff that a lot of people are
going to find useful we're going to dive
into software even more in the upcoming
review on pocketnow.com
be sure to check that out and please
give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it thanks for watching and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
