pocketnow.com you've been following our
series on the sprint samsung transform
you've seen this unboxed the device
you've seen us go over the hardware of
the device and finally you've also seen
us look at these software of the device
well now it's time to give you our final
thoughts as well as what we like and
don't like about the samsung transform
in this final review let's go ahead and
get started alright and we're back and
the first thing we're to talk about some
of the pros of the samsung transform
what we actually liked about the device
and the very first of which is going to
be the slide-out qwerty keyboards you
can see here this actually makes typing
on a device if you don't like a
touchscreen keyboard for texting typing
emails browsing the web whatever it may
be much easier especially if you're
coming from a future phone now we're
used to having a hard keyboard this will
help make that transition for you on top
of that staying on the subject of
transitioning is the Sprint ID interface
that many may consider this bloatware
however if you're coming from either a
dumb phone or a feature phone to a
smartphone like the transform Sprint ID
will actually act as a skin more or less
for you and actually bring in widgets
application shortcuts that sort of thing
that sprint has actually pre-installed
and pre-made for you this will make that
transition much easier and much more
enjoyable next up are some of the
features that are included with the
samsung transform despite the fact that
it is a lower end if you will android
from it still includes a lot of features
that today's current higher-end android
phones have the first of which being the
front facing camera so you can actually
do video calls through quick or fring
using that front facing camera also take
pictures of yourself video of yourself
that way which is very cool next up is
going to be the actual version of
Android that is pre-loaded on this
device now it's going to come with
Android 2.1 however it's not 2.2 froyo
but it's also now going to be 1.6 the
older versions now once again that's a
plus an e- we're going to factor it into
the into the plus or the pro category
because you're not too far behind the
actual newest version so there is room
to possibly upgrade to froyo we'll have
to see what happens unfortunately the
processor isn't the fastest so that may
get left behind in that category but for
now 2.1 is considered a pro on the
samsung transform one great plus with
this device is that it actually has a
dedicated camera button as well as the
dedicated voice activation button so if
you're driving you want make
a phone call you can actually press the
voice button and say you want to call
now that's convenient lastly is going to
be the screen it's a 3.5 inch capacitive
screen it may not be a super amoled
however the colors are surprisingly
decent for this type of screen so once
again this is a lower to mid range end
android smartphone so you're not going
to get the Super AMOLED however you're
not going to be slacking too bad in
terms of the responsiveness as you can
see here it is quite responsive with
only a few pickups every now and then
next up we're going to be some of the
cons of the device or what we feel needs
improvement or could be improved and the
very first one is going to be battery
life Samsung rates this device at around
six hours talktime however we were
getting nowhere near that unfortunate
we're actually getting about half that
so we feel that it could possibly be
improved with a future software update
we'll have to see what happens but for
now you're going to want to carry a car
charger or a secondary home charger with
you unfortunately if you can be making
many phone calls as far as just texting
you're going to be fine but once you
factor an email and web browsing you're
going to be draining your battery pretty
intensively now we're also going to
factor the 256 megabytes of RAM as well
as the 800 megahertz processor into the
cons category because that may lead to
future loss of the ability to update
simply because of the resources not
being there in terms of the specs in the
last call i'm going to have about the
samsung transform is actually its price
point it's priced at one hundred and
fifty dollars rounding up from 149 for a
two-year contract we feel this device
should actually be around 100 it would
be a very sweet spot for this device
here I think it would sell a lot better
than if it was priced at 150 no overall
we thoroughly enjoyed our time with the
samsung transform we feel that this
phone is the actual future of feature
phones someday there will be no longer
any feature phones they will be dumb
phones low-end smartphones and high-end
smartphones and this will be one of
those lower to mid and smartphones we
just wish sprint would price it
accordingly however if you are looking
to pick up a transform we have two
highly recommend it we give it a 4 out
of 5 be sure to read the full written
review to get all the juicy in-depth
details aside from that as always thank
you very much for watching everyone and
please give this video a thumbs up if
you've enjoyed our coverage of the
samsung transform thanks everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
