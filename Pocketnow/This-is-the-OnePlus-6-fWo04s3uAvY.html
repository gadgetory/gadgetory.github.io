teased over at the pocket now Instagram
and remember the low-light photos that
I've posted on my personal Instagram
tagged mystery phone yeah here it is I'm
gonna leave it with pocket now and I've
spent the last week with the 1 plus 6
let's go hands on I agree it's weird to
cover rumors on the pocket out daily of
a product that I've been using for a bit
but maybe that means we actually know
what rumors to cover and which ones not
to the care package of the company
centas includes a very fancy box
I love the attention to detail with the
pull tabs for example inside we have the
retail box you'll get in addition to a
batch of one-plus covers that I'm a
really big fan of particularly the
sandstone one the device packaging
includes a new phone a case tucked in
around the literature and the company's
famous that's charging wall plug in USB
C cable probably one of my favorite
aspects of the 1 plus 6 is that it makes
a return to the company's originality
those of you that complain about
previous variants retaining Sun
aesthetics from partners or competitors
yeah that's all gone we now have Corning
Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and the
back following a 40 step process that
allows these curves around it our unit
is of the mirror black finish that
follows on its name wish they would have
sent me the midnight black which is
actually a matte finish over glass I
mean it looks pretty much like aluminum
at a distance and the same happens with
the silk white variant we have a six
point two eight inch full HD optic
AMOLED screen at 19 by 9 aspect ratio
meaning a crazy 84% screen to body ratio
yes there is a notch but there's one of
the fastest face to unlock services in
the market and a significant 24
megapixels on the selfie camera with f/2
aperture for photos and the portrait
mode which will be introduced shortly
after launch internally everything is as
expected we have a beast right here
we have the new Qualcomm Snapdragon in
forty-five eight gigs of ram with
storage options in this Ram tier the
dual from 128 to 256 gigabytes though
there's also a six Iike byte and 64 gigs
of storage option there are dual sim
capabilities both being LTE this time a
3300 milliamp hour battery and desk
charging capabilities
no there is no wireless charging and
there's no IP rating but oneplus
disconfirm that just like in the case of
the 5 t this phone is splash resistant
for the basic stuff oxygen OS five point
one point two runs on top of Android 8.1
I love that it continues to be more
stock than even what you get on the
pixel now we have options for gestures
instead of buttons though you have the
flexibility of choosing whichever you
want and oneplus also bundles features
like gaming mode reading mode etc the
cameras are an interesting upgrade I do
love the basics like the vertical
aesthetic in the center we have a Sony
IMX 5/19 sensor and the primary shooter
at 16 megapixels of 1.7 aperture 1.2 2
microns both with E is and oh is there
is a secondary 20 megapixel camera at F
1.7 aperture and single micron pixels
but this one is only to assist for
portrait mode our upcoming videos will
reveal photo samples so far I will say I
am very impressed particularly with
low-light performance we also have new
capabilities like 4k video at 60 frames
per second 1080p video at 240 frames per
second and even 720p slow-mo at 480
frames per second one plus is also
announcing a new pair of bullet wireless
headphones that are weather resistant
capable provide five hours of playback
and just after 10 minutes of charge and
our Google assistant capable all costing
a crazy 80 bucks
sadly the package didn't arrive in time
for me to give you some initial
impressions so yes this is the one plus
6 what do you think do you like the new
glass approach and the features let us
know in the comments I will have to
admit that I certainly do while you're
at it make sure you follow us on social
media subscribe to our channel for more
videos like this one you can follow me
on Twitter Jaime underscore D that
Instagram at Haman leave it up please
give this video a thumbs up if you like
what you saw
I'm hey Metairie but I thank so much for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
