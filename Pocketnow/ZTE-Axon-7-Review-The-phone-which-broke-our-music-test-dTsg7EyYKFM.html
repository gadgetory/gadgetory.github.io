bloggers a little inside baseball while
I was wrapping up our Sony Xperia
coverage we sent this beauty over to hi
Mei to tackle the full review of course
he got the note 7 and seeing is how we
can't pry that phone out of his hands
this poor little bugger slipped through
our review schedule let's fix that now
cutting to the chase
this phone rocks are you sad that HTC no
longer sells the One m8 want a phone
that resembles those sleek lines and
features a killer set of front-facing
speakers ZTE has a solution which might
interest you
graceful tapers familiar antenna bands
high quality build materials a premium
look and feel this phone punches well
above its $400 price tag that style is
also backed up by killer hardware on
board this 5.5 inch pax a quad HD
resolution besting the 1+3 and honor 8
for pixel density we're not lacking for
horsepower with a welcome 820 and 4
gigabytes of RAM on tap this phone
matches the 1 plus 3 for storage 64
gigabytes built in but media junkies can
also add more via microSD there's an 8
megapixel selfie shooter above the
screen
joining a 20 megapixel rear shooter and
the ZTE strayed from the mid-price pack
with a 3,250 milliamp hour battery and
quick charge 3.0 looking at this display
it's a solid screen ready to handle
current services and this generation of
VR applications and it delivers great
brightness outpacing the honor rate and
just nipping at the heels of the galaxy
s7 ultimately losing to the galaxy once
we see that excellent high contrast mode
but for those of you who read on your
phones at night you'll be very happy
with how dim the screen can get I'm also
happy to see this placement for the rear
mounted fingerprint sensor great
location for my little Hobbit hands on a
5.5 inch screen size in operation
however this is proven to be one of the
finicky er sensors I've recently used
after training the phone it's a little
less forgiving of finger placement than
say a Huawei might be and on an odd
angle it regularly takes a second try to
unlock the phone when you nail that
placement though this is a
lightning-fast
there are precious few criticisms we can
throw at this hardware but I do wish we
had backlit navigation buttons the
capacitive home back and multitasking
keys are rather close together and it
takes a while to muscle memorize where
you need to press to land the commands
you want
thankfully these keys are swappable and
folks who like a right-side back button
will enjoy this option all of this
Hardware powers a software skin I rather
enjoyed my favored UI
delivers a flat simple look to an
Android layout we'd normally associate
with an LG but with a more cohesive
design the notification shade delivers
five quick actions from a single swipe
your home screens come native in a five
by four grid giving you a bit more space
to play with widgets and the app drawer
shows off large bold icons for your
installed programs
lastly the settings menu is cleanly laid
out with simple icons for each option
we're always happy to report that
there's little pre-installed bloat
outside of a few ZTE provided services
like this nifty toolkit app for your
nifty geometry projects that skins are
often derided in our comments but this
one I kinda liked I didn't feel any
urgent need to swap it out for Nova
Launcher
and performance is about what you would
expect from this collection of specs the
axon handles the daily driver stuff with
style and grace no issues at all with
messaging in social media with a
Snapdragon 820 on tap we shouldn't be
surprised that this thing can chew
through games like implosion with a
stable and fluid framerate it even
managed to perform well in Marvel future
fight there are still dips in the
framerate but we don't see it slow to a
slideshow like we witnessed on the
galaxy s7 alongside the Moto Z newer
phones with this chipset seem to
slightly outperform the first devices
launched with this Qualcomm hardware if
there's a weak link it's in radio
management our review unit performed
rather poorly on AT&amp;amp;T LTE falling about
2 to 3 decimals behind the 1 + 3 + 5 - 7
decibels behind the honor eight when
trying to stay on big blue's network
these numbers were even worse on Wi-Fi
where the glass backed honor absolutely
trounced the axon when connected to my
router this disparity was so wide we are
asking ZTE
it's on this and we'll follow up later
on pocketnow.com if and when we receive
word on this Wi-Fi deficit moving over
to the camera
we've already produced the most in-depth
look at this camera which you can see in
our full real camera review but it's a
quick overview this is a solid performer
which absolutely lives up to this price
tag Photography is all about light so
it's always silly to say you get good
photos when you have good light though
the axon delivers pleasant exposures
with eye-pleasing saturation when
shooting in daylight this camera does
struggle a bit with low-light situations
optical image stabilization helps but we
did have issues delivering crisp shots
here where other phones might have been
more successful also this phone very
much resembles the fringing and flaring
we also see from current held genes
moving to video we get an extremely
ambitious option to deliver h.265 video
compression and this does deliver a very
high quality UHD video but we still had
some issues with twitch East able
ization while this camera might not
quite reach the performance of the 1+3
or the consistency of the iPhone se
we're still very happy with the bang for
buck here this is very good to excellent
camera performance for $400 and many of
our gripes could be lessened with some
software tweaks and future updates but
when we talk about the axon audio is the
name of the game
everything about this sound setup is
loud and aggressive these speakers are
some of the punch ear ones we've tested
recently though they can sometimes be a
bit shrill
especially when listening to jazz and
classical music to my ears we lose a
little in the mids and the high EQ
becomes a bit brittle but this is a
terrific setup for games and films it's
moving over to headphone audio which
totally messed us up this phone is loud
stonking loud like off-the-charts
freaking loud I recently replaced my
audio interface used for testing
headphone audio and was in the process
of retesting all of the phones we've
reviewed so we could have relative
numbers between different devices the
axon 7 blew past the threshold I was
using and is forcing me to completely
retest everything again for accurate
comparisons this amp beats the v10 HTC
10
and iPhone 6s and below that tear it
absolutely murders every other phone
we've reviewed here's a playback
comparison at max volume between the
axon the v10 and the galaxy s7
Yonex and while loud it has a
fantastically low noise floor which
means this phone delivers the best
signal-to-noise ratio we've ever tested
you people will be able to tolerate
audio at max volume from this device and
we're pretty sure trying for any length
of time will damage your hearing but
turning the volume down means benefiting
from almost zero discernible noise
coming from this phone no hiss no wine
no air no nada
the only compromise here seems to be
down sampled playback of high res audio
files only outputting 16-bit audio and
we also see a little funkiness with our
dynamic range test numbers but it's
difficult for us to be overly upset
about that if you listen to high quality
mp3 this phone will do an excellent job
driving nice headphones lastly we have a
battery with slightly more juice in the
competition which results in very good
runtime on our media test streaming 30
minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 190
Lux the axon drained 5% of its battery
and those numbers match our daily usage
it's really easy making it into the late
evening with the little battery to spare
ZTE claims the axon can recharge 80% in
30 minutes and we're not exactly sure
how they arrived at that number to be
sure this is a fast charger and we
landed a 61% recharge over a half hour
this is great performance for those
times you need to top off during the day
so let's wrap this up where does that
leave us with the ZTE axon 7
I'm totally sounding like a broken
record here but 2016 has been an amazing
year for mid-range err phones ZTE has
delivered something really special this
phone is a monster with few faults to
find the main concern and the only
potential deal-breaker might be the
radio performance which we can't
positively conclude isn't an issue
unique to our review unit and we will
follow up on any responses we received
from the manufacturer otherwise we're
looking at a compelling option for folks
shopping a $400 phone joining the ranks
of Alcatel One Plus and honor these men
factures are hungry for some competition
and are rapidly eating away at the line
which divides mid-priced phones from far
more expensive flagship options what a
time to be alive as always thanks so
