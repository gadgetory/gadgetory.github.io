you need me to flex every time I watch
parking out daily I count your
apparently hahahaha you really need to
get a life if I had a dollar for every
time he claimed to have jet lag dude
you'd be broke why just the dollar you
could bet a lot more money I meant
uninstall any usual apps that have a lot
of ads me uninstalling you to fine
you deserve those 331 Lakes that's right
it's that time of the week I am high
metal beep it up this is PocketNow and
this is the bargain out daily recap your
comments for this week
so when one day the topic was rather
interesting because we've been covering
all the drama of everything that's been
happening with Huawei and we were
expecting to see a new Hong manga less
Arco s whatever the name would be and we
were hoping that this would be the plan
B which would also be a really good
answer an alternative but then we've got
one of the companies s VP is pretty much
saying that they're wanting to stick
with Android and so we understand why I
mean it's already an infrastructure
that's built that doesn't require any
drama but then again you think about the
risk of everything that's been happening
to Huawei we believe that it was a
better idea to jump on a plan B I asked
you what you guys thought should while
we continue with hyung mang or not we
have 382 comments the failure of Windows
Phone proved there's no room for a third
operating system so why are we is smart
in keeping their operating system only
as a lifeboat ship their Android ship
sink this is a very different scenario
back in the days of Windows Phone
Windows Phone had no install base no
platform
they killed Windows Mobile and Windows
Phone 7 did not work with those existing
phones right now Huawei has 350 million
phones in the market it's a very
different ballgame and so long as Hong
Mango s works on any phone that
currently has Android then they've got a
market and they've already got the App
Store so yeah a lot of people were
making reference to the Windows Phone
case or to the webOS case it's a very
different story obviously if Huawei is
smart enough to be able to launch this
platform on in 60 on existing phones
then it would make total sense
if not then yes you're right there's no
purpose in doing this I don't worry the
operating system is as good as people
think it is what new OS is let's be
realistic but competition is always good
for the consumer and another player in
the mobile market will not hurt that is
a very good point
it took Android what like four versions
and I don't know how many revisions to
actually be something that I was willing
to use I think it was an until jelly
bean that I started liking Android the
same thing with iOS iPhone OS 1 and 2
were
Mack like people didn't care about them
actually didn't move to an iPhone until
the iphone 3gs because my experience
originally was bad I stick to Windows
Mobile back in those days you have the
total point there it could be that if
they launched the experience won't be
the same but at the same time there's a
positive limps to the fact that if they
launched now and they continue with
Android this would give them at least a
good three years for them to test it out
before they make the jump
I think Huawei is distracting everybody
and we'll launch hongmen OS in China
first here's the thing and I've been
saying it if Huawei is also smart enough
to make this open source and make it
available to every other Chinese company
out there and have existing smartphones
with existing Qualcomm chips and
everything be able to use this operating
system man that's gonna be a big deal
even if they launch exclusively in China
I mean in China there is no Facebook
there is no YouTube there's no Google
services and trust me well China's God
China's such a large market on its own
they don't need anything they're fine
it's a strategy as he said they still
need developers and support for
consumers don't forget what happened to
Samsung when they tried to replace
Android with Tizen now that is another
very good example true we had the case
of Tizen but I think that the biggest
failure would Tizen was that they
launched it on entry-level phones in
Southeast Asia and they didn't make it
available to existing one so they really
create Tizen to compete with existing
Android phones and I think that that's
the biggest problem if you are not going
to make it available to existing devices
I don't think it will float I just don't
think it'll survive that's another good
point that on Tuesday the topic was
Apple's discounts overnight the changes
that they made to the MacBook lineup the
fact that the new 2019 13-inch MacBook
Pros crazy when it comes to its specs
there were so many things and in
addition to them there were discounts on
MacBook Airs
the death of the new MacBook I asked you
I mean what do you think do you think
that Apple did enough or should they do
more we had 380 comments do more they've
taken more than enough money from their
customers they should discount their
iPhones a little my god I don't know if
you
notice but we've spent the last like
three or four months covering deals from
Amazon on Apple products pretty much
everything with the exception of iPhones
buy any iPhone they're still 750 999
1100 bucks I really don't understand
that mentality I agree with you
good job honestly didn't expect this but
drop the iPhone price that damn thousand
dollar trend started with Apple and they
should end it actually it started with a
couple of Galaxy phones but yeah I I do
agree I mean Apple should totally
dropped the price because in the case of
those Galaxy phones they started at
literally almost $1000 and then they got
immediate discounts like probably like
three weeks later so yeah I doubt Apple
will discount that $9.99 stand oh man
god I thought that there should be more
memes than the current ones because true
I don't understand why they're selling
that thing separately this is not enough
people should wait for the next
generation MacBook Pro with new keyboard
it's sheer stupidity to buy a MacBook
Pro with such a defective keyboard I
feel this is nothing but a strategy to
sell their existing inventory to avere
for the next generation I had not seen
it that way you are totally right I have
the 2018 variant of the MacBook Pro
haven't had issues with the keyboard yet
but then the aygos 2017 model we've
already had to replace the top case it
is the worst so you know there are so
many benefits to having a MacBook Pro of
you're within the Apple ecosystem if
you're using Final Cut Pro but then
again for the $3,300 that we paid for
each laptop there is no excuse and the
only reason that the eggless computer
got a top case replacement is because we
paid for Apple care so imagine that it
was thirty six hundred with Apple care
that's insane it shouldn't be that way
totally agree with you as well and then
on Wednesday the topic was the Nintendo
switch light I guess we were expecting
more than just the light but that's what
God announced I asked you what were your
thoughts about this product I actually
discussed that extense extensively on
the weekly I highly recommend you watch
that video ask you what you thought we
have 350 comments
hey people will be hating now
the switched light is gonna sell like
fire and thews es equal a verge consumer
think about it is think about it man
$100 more and you get a full-blown
switch that is my biggest problem it's
not that I don't like the light it's not
that I don't like the concept of a fully
portable switch and particularly because
it's smaller that's all cool it's just
for a hundred dollars more if the price
difference were 200 bucks I'd be like oh
yeah go for it but just 100 bucks and
you get the hub you get the swaps for
the controllers you know you get joy
kansai I don't know portability is the
reason why people like me bought the
switch not to connect to a TV where it
offer a much worse than PS or the Xbox
we get what you mean so the switch light
makes all the sense think about it is
the switch the reason why people went
crazy for it I get it you know your user
scenarios different you know I bought it
because of the portability too but I
ended up using it more on the TV because
I like the experience with the pro
controller and well I feel that a lot of
people just like the switch because in
addition to that portability you have
the versatility of being able to use it
with your TV and so you get the best of
both worlds you want the console
experience you get it you don't want the
console experience you just unsnap it
and take it I don't know no it's a
switch that can't switch this is
basically a game or super-advanced
exactly it's like the Nintendo DS Pro
that plays switch games which is how I
feel that they should have called it
just the revamp of the DS that switch
compatible I don't know well that's
probably a bad name
$150 should be the price of the switch
light
I'm salty about the $200 price tag
exactly if they would have sold this for
149 I would not debate anything I would
be like you have to jump on it and if
they gave you the option because that's
another one of my questions like what
happens if you've already got your games
you bought them digitally but you signed
them on your current switch can you play
those digital games on your switch light
that's a huge question that they have an
answer but on Thursday the topic was you
know men'she coast predictions Apple to
be ditching face ID we had the full
Rome map of how they're gonna do it
we're gonna have a new version of touch
ID that's gonna take over the whole
display I asked you what you thought
about these possible changes and the
road map we had 665 comments seems like
an engineer from Apple tried searching
smartphone world outside of Apple first
time after 2018 god seriously but the
thing about it is don't get me wrong I
like face ID I find it to be crazy
convenient I you know I I love it on my
iPad pro I love it on the iPhone mainly
in the winter whenever I can't be using
my fingerprint for gloves so don't get
me wrong I like face ideas it is I just
wish that Apple wouldn't have just gone
the whole way I wish they would have
given us both options because there are
cases where it can be rather cumbersome
so yeah Apple should just kill their
prices in my opinion god I think that
Apple is gonna be forced to do it at
some point if you think about it one of
the main reasons why iPad started
selling like hotcakes is because nobody
was expecting Apple to sell this thing
for $4.99 what it launched and right now
the prices are so crazy that you see
them discounted all the time but anyways
we were talking about face I did not
about prices I don't think they should
remove it having both options such ID
and face ID should be a good idea
consumers can't decide I prefer face ID
it's very fast it simply works and here
in Canada we have winter face ID is a
lot easier than touch exactly anybody
that's had to deal with a subzero
temperatures knows your cat you're
already carrying two pairs of gloves one
for the wind and the other one to keep
you warm and so to be able to have to be
taking that off just to be able to want
to lock your phone that's the worst
and then finally Friday the topic was
the Galaxy Note tendon or the price we
had the price tags of $9.99 up to 1150
I asked you what you thought about these
we had 700 comments what other
intestines shall i donate to afford one
of these bad boys do you only have one
it's a very long one but you only have
one a $1,000 phone needs to earn it I'm
not sure the note 10 will but we shall
see
maybe Samsung has a nice gimmick up
their sleeve who knows tell you what I
don't think that any phone should cost
$1000 not the price of a computer I
think the computers are well priced you
know the higher-end models but God it's
just $1,000 for phone and so here's a
thing in the case of Samsung because of
the added functionality of the s-pen
because I know that that extra layer for
the Wacom digitizer is more expensive
because I know how much the software
requires a lot more engineering I'm like
if I'm gonna have to pay a thousand
bucks I'd rather pay for this phone than
an iPhone tennis max for example but it
doesn't change the fact that I wish it
cost 750 800 bucks
Samsung is moving on Apple's price path
we have seen what happened to Apple now
let's see it's the other way around
actually if you remember the price of
the Galaxy Note I think it was the
Galaxy Note 7 which then exploded was it
the 5 to the 7 one of these costs a
thousand bucks are very close to it but
again it got discounted really close to
no it's actually Samsung who started
with the crazier price tags but they
were offering added functionality and so
that's the main reason why we were like
fine let's just put up with it but yeah
I get your point as well let's wait and
see what happens because if you notice
the galaxy s 10 plus the plus variance
is the price of the standard iPhone 10 s
meaning you can get an iPhone the galaxy
s 10 s re for 750 which is a
significantly better phone than the
iPhones in our watch our comparison so
yeah they can't charge less for the
Galaxy Note then for the SN plus it
doesn't make any financial sense if they
want to adjust price it will have to
start at the S line true and because
we've got the rumors of the phone are
coming with a headphone jack I think
that would be smart for Samsung to
bundle the Galaxy buds which I love in
the box if you get a Galaxy Note 10 with
the Galaxy buds in the box I'll be like
alright fine I'll pay the thousand bucks
for that I would because how much would
like a really good pair of true wireless
earbuds if you go for like Joe Broz I'm
so I said really good notice
the wording a pair of job rest' the
elite 65 teased those are 250 bucks
I think the galaxy buds would be a
really good bundle in the box but this
is me that's it for the parka now it's a
leery cap thank you so much for watching
