over at TCL looking at some new Alcatel
phones a great new paint job for the
BlackBerry q2 and their attempt at the
foldable concept that honestly is really
exciting you're gonna want to stick
around to see what they call the Dragon
hinge this is PocketNow and I'm Joshua
Vergara what's going on everybody let's
talk TCO as is usually the case for
Alcatel every year they have a bunch of
different devices being announced all at
once over the years I could tell has
done a great job of bringing their
higher-end experiences to the lower tier
price points starting off with the most
affordable is the Alcatel 1s an Android
pipes holding dual and shooting full
view HD Plus display smartphone that
screen comes in at 5.5 inches with 2.5 D
glass and has a nice textured metal
backing those lenses on the rear include
a 2 megapixel depth sensor that helps
with good bouquet in portrait shots the
1s also sports an octa-core processor
that is being developed by a company
called spread shrimp and features 3
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
storage expandable with SD cards
what raised my eyebrows about this phone
is the price a hundred and ninety euros
even though availability outside of this
region has yet to be determined then we
move to the higher end with the 3-series
the Alcatel 3 uses Snapdragon processors
in this case the octa-core Snapdragon
439 wild a slightly lower SPECT Alcatel
3 L sports the quad-core 429 with the
tear drop notch the 3 manages to pack an
80% screens body ratio and what they
called a super full view display at 1560
by 720 resolution the higher-end Alcatel
3 will have 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64
gigabytes of on-board storage also bear
in mind that some versions do have a
fingerprint reader while others omitted
from that textured backing and finally
the rear cameras are 13 and 5 megapixels
respectively with the 5 megapixel sensor
helping with depth in those bouquet
shots all of these Alcatel phones will
be upgradeable to PI shortly after the
launch and from there we move to a
simple but significant shift for the
BlackBerry key to this limited edition
red version adds a splash of really
vivid red on the metal chassis giving it
a really eye-catching flair now while I
would have preferred blackberry go all
in on the red coloring I do understand
that the black
like backing is their signature aside
from the splash of color the phone also
bolsters the storage of the phone with
all the other specifications remaining
the same the red Edition has six
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
on-board storage as you know I'm a big
fan of that keyboard experience and now
this phone is not afraid to show off
some of its colors and finally let's get
to the dragon hamish the foldable
concept by TCL that was under glass at
our presentation dragon hinge is named
so because it slightly resembles scales
and there is a bunch of bits and pieces
working on the inside to make that fault
work but what makes this concept so
exciting is how TCL has applied it to so
many potential use cases there are sites
aside folds like we've seen in a couple
of other concepts already along with a
vertical fold that could bring back the
clamshells of old and then a large
concept drawing showed more applications
of the same design in products that we
definitely want to see in the future one
in particular that I personally have
always said when it comes to
smartwatches is that they should be slab
bands you know those wrist bands that
just slap on like this well this is
something that dragon hinge could
actually provide in the smart wearable
category obviously there would be a
flexible screen on them and that would
just make wearables that much easier to
use and honestly more fun
TCO does say not to expect the dragon
hinge to hit markets until 2020 in an
effort to see how certain aspects of
current releases fare in the real world
perhaps they'll find a way to create the
affordable foldable category when the
time comes
stay tuned for the rest of our MWC
coverage as we jump around Barcelona
Spain for the next week and you're going
to want to subscribe to the channel and
hit that Bell over on the side so you
can keep up with all of the
announcements that are just about to
happen with all that said I'm gonna call
it on this one thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you in our next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
