to be one of the only ways that you
could make it do some relatively common
stuff like take a screenshot or control
the LED on your camera luckily today
those are all built into the stock
Android experience but root still has
its place I'm Joe Levi for PocketNow and
here are a few of my favorite root
applications I'd like to share with you
first up is super su or super super user
I guess it doesn't make much sense but
that's what it's called this is my
favorite super user manager it lets you
go in and make changes and updates the
the super user binaries and all that fun
stuff a lot of people would overlook
that there are some other apps that you
can use super su seems to be the best
these days if you've got a different
opinion of course let us know down in
the comments make sure you include your
reasons why next up is an app called
soft key Z or soft key Zed for our
friends down under essentially what that
does is it lets you change your soft
keys to pretty much whatever you want
mine you can see I'll have a nice subtle
drop shadow underneath them it adds just
an extra level of well refinement I
think it might not be your thing
you might like yellow you might like
blue words you might like circles you
might like blue circles you might like
big words you might like on PlayStation
you know whatever you like pretty much
you can set those as your buttons you
can back them up just right there with
the save it's really easy to make
changes you just come through select
whatever you want of course I'm just
selecting these at random to show you
what you can do not necessarily that you
would do just like that and then you can
apply them it does require a reboot for
those changes to take effect but once
you've done that you're good to go
next up is sequel Lite editor now we
talked about this in a recent article
that told you how to re-enable tethering
on certain T mobile devices in certain
t-mobile plans specifically that are
running Android KitKat which for some
reason turned it off this
essentially just a sequel editor you can
go in here and add keys add values see
what they are change the values what we
did is we went in and we just added a
simple tethering key and value saved it
rebooted and we were good to go I've
only used this half a dozen or so times
to change settings but these are
settings that generally can't be changed
anywhere else
there is no settings control panel to
get to them and you just might want to
go in and make some changes some of
these values you can set through through
various control panels and settings
screens a lot of them however you can't
so to do that you're going to need a
sequel editor and sequel Lite editor
works great gotta mention busybox free
now a lot of your routing setups whatnot
the the tools that you use to route are
going to include this mine did
essentially this is all of the libraries
and all the programs that you need to be
able to run all of your rooted and super
user stuff you're not going to do a lot
with this on the surface but all of your
route applications they're going to be
happy that you have it most cell phones
get their time and date settings from
the network that you're connected to so
in my case t-mobile you'll notice I've
got that turned off and there's a very
good reason for that
there is an app I want to show you next
it's called clock sync this will work
both with and without root but it'll do
a lot better with roots so as you can
notice the atomic time it says we're 17
minutes past the hour and my system time
says that we're 16 minutes past the hour
so we're off by a minute in several
seconds here now this isn't really a big
problem to be several seconds off or
even a minute or two off not a big deal
however if I've got lots of these so
I've got two or three cellphones in my
family I've got two or three tablets in
my family now I've got two or three
computers in my family all of them have
a different time and of course if you've
got teenage kids you know that saying
one time and being one minute off means
for some reason that your opinion isn't
valid anymore
so what we do is we go through and we
synchronize all of these our Android
powered devices we use this app called
clock sync
our desktop computers and laptops and
whatnot we have another app but
essentially what it does it goes out to
the atomic clock grabs the current time
looks at your system time and then you
can synchronize the two few settings in
here if you take a look you can change
your NTP server that's your network time
protocol I believe is what that stands
for
you can enable automatic synchronization
I've got that set for every three hours
but it's not strict so it's not like
every three hours on the hour it's not a
high precision mode because I'm not
really that worried about down to the
second if I had that on we'd go out and
look at the atomic clock five times and
kind of take the take the average of
those and that just helps resolve some
Network latency issues and you might get
if one takes longer than another you can
set it to only do it over Wi-Fi so
doesn't use up any of your data and I've
got mine so that it only does this when
the device is awake so that it doesn't
chew up any more of my battery other
than a ping back and forth to a server
so this does work both in routed mode
which is what we're seeing right here it
also works in a more restricted limited
way in unrooted so even if you don't
have a rooted device this app will still
will still be beneficial to you next app
on my list of favorite route apps is
root explorer now this is my file
explorer it's the only one that I've got
on my device and that to tell you the
truth I really like it there are others
that look a little bit nicer this one
does have some stuff that you can change
and whatnot I kind of like it the way it
is but what you can see here is it's
just like a normal file explorer just
very simple very basic but unlike those
this does let you get into some of your
other folders that you can't normally
get into because this lets you use your
root access and you can go in and make
changes inside your system and data
folders as well very useful very handy
especially if you're applying any
patches or updates that well you didn't
get through official methods or if
you're making customizations to apps
last but not least I am running a stock
of Android it's rooted however and I am
running a custom kernel in this case
it's the Fokker kn'l so I've got an app
called folk lock on here now this lets
me come through and set any of these
settings at boot or not I can turn them
off or turn them back on lets me set my
minimum and maximum clock so you can see
here I am under clocking my device got
my governor set to a new one called
Intel Atom and which is kind of a cross
between intelligent and on-demand I've
turned off my imprecision and I'm using
the Intel plug hot plug driver which is
supposed to be recommended
so hey great I've got some other stuff
turned on as well all of these are
features of the kernel can do voltage
adjustment which I have not done if you
think I should be go ahead and head over
to pocket now leave a comment down in
the comment section of the article let
me know what what voltages you would
recommend for me to adjust and why that
would be helpful for me and for
everybody else is what CPU governor and
come in here and turn on this is
specific to the Intel Atom and CPU
governor turn that on and off we can
look at the updates down in the bottom
that takes a minute to populate very
cool stuff we can look at statistics for
for a CPU idle and other stats thermal
management I'm using the Intel a thermal
which is supposed to be better than the
thermal D which is stock I can set my
frequency throttles and whatnot and of
course look at down here on the bottom
when I have been throttled because of
high temperature in this case I haven't
been at all probably because I am under
clocking I can also come in and mess
around with the GPU change the governor
change the frequency all that fun stuff
io scheduler as well sleep to wake or
sweep to wake rather I don't have this
enabled for the sweep to wake we've
showed you that in a previous video
however notice I just turned it off I do
have tap to wake so that feature is
right there and it mimics what you can
do on the the Moto X and whatnot so
really kind of cool
does supposedly take up a little bit
more battery power because it's it's
still got that digitizer on even when
it's in your pocket so you know whatever
vibration adjustment you can change the
intensity of that vibration I've got
mine set at 70 percent memory management
it just lots and lots of stuff I'm not
going to go through everything here
because I mean honestly there's a lot
you can even come in and download the
the newest kernel straight from here you
do have to reboot into recovery to apply
those so make sure you know what there
are this one that I'm using is the zero
zero eight ultimate so just in case you
were wondering about that you're going
to need to have a custom recovery image
which is going to wrap up our favorite
root apps this one not really an app but
we may as well include it it's twr pea
recovery it's finger friendly it's nice
it does an awful lot of stuff and I
would highly recommend it for everything
other than setting up a custom ROM on
your device the first time for that I
still recommend clockworkmod recovery
just because that's kind of weird the
way that TW RP does it so from here you
can make backups so you can make
restores mounts wipes it pretty much all
you want including reboot and you know
like I said it is finger friendly so we
will go ahead and reboot into system
just like that so there was a quick look
at some of the route apps that I'm
running on my device right now and seem
to stay on my devices regardless of
which device I'm running or how many
times I've wiped it and reloaded a stock
or a custom ROM but now it's your turn I
want to know what apps you use and I
want to hear about that over in the
comments at pocketnow.com hey thanks for
