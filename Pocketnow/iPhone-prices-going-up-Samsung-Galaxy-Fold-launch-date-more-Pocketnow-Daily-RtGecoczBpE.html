leaving a horrible uncertainty in the
pricing of products in the US Samsung's
mobile CEO has come on record to tell us
more about what to expect for the Galaxy
fold and it might be time for you to
update your old iPhones as iOS 13 gears
up to roll out I'm Jaime Rivera
reporting from one of the noisiest hotel
rooms in San Francisco this is our last
day here
this is parking out daily brought to you
by the one plus seven Pro that's
launching on may 14 the official news
today begin with updates on the 1 plus 7
Pro from t-mobile
last year the one plus 60 was exclusive
to t-mobile this year the company has
pretty much confirmed that for the
launch of the 1 plus 7 Pro they are the
official partner and last year it was
pandemonium for the launch of the 60 and
the flagship store in Times Square I'm
hopefully expecting that to happen this
year's game now let's talk about Huawei
and design changes as we've got some new
patents from the company where they're
working on this very interesting hump at
the top of a smart phone in order to get
rid of bezels which I find to be rather
interesting I mean at the top it doesn't
really bother anybody I actually wonder
why companies hadn't worked on this
before where you get a full bezel as
display and then a hunt for the camera
at the top I find that to be better let
us know in the comments what you think
now for those of you that are currently
still holding on to the vices like the
iPhone 5s iPhone 6 iPhone se we've got
some trusted sources claiming that iOS
13 will not support these smartphones
anymore if you know one of the major
reasons why I was 12 was so popular is
because you could keep pretty much every
one of your old phones and iOS would
support them the whole idea was to make
the operating system leaner so
apparently that is going to end with
this update so I would rather look into
that now for those of you that are
waiting on the Samsung Galaxy fold
obviously there was the whole email that
customers received this created
uncertainty we've received an official
statement from Samsung stating that the
company is still full steam ahead with
the galaxy fold after that the post of
the pocket out daily now we've got the
company's mobile CEO stating that there
is full commitment on the phone
obviously they're taking all the
precautions they need I actually like
the fact that the company is doing this
I feel that this is the smart thing
do avoid consumer drama which is
probably the best thing to do for such a
you know emerging form factor that we
all of us want to succeed so stay tuned
we'll get you a day as soon as we get
some official information and finally
the hottest news today are actually the
most underwhelming ones as well on
Monday President Trump pretty much
confirmed that he was gonna apply
tariffs to Chinese of manufacturing and
imports as of today that begins we have
not heard from companies over their
official stand over the tariffs meaning
what they're going to do obviously if
they're gonna raise taxes from 10 to 25%
on products you think companies are
going to absorb that text but we know
that's not the way it works we know that
consumers and the paying it so right now
we don't have official information as to
if iPhones you're getting more expensive
or what other imports are going to be
affected let us know in the comments
down below what do you think do you
think that company should absorb this
tax I mean nobody has none of us have
told companies to manufacture their
phones in China they were the ones that
chose this so I feel it is completely
unfair for consumers to pay for it
but we would love to know your opinion
in the comments down below folks this
episode of the PocketNow daily is
brought to you by one plus you can tune
