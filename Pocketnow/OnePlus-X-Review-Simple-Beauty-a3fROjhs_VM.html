smartphones under 300 bucks and you're
bound to find a lot of compromise
particularly in industrial design with
its newest smartphone oneplus looks to
change the game the oneplus x is the
company's most affordable handheld ever
but you wouldn't know it by looking at
it out of the smarts hold up to the
looks I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
and let's find out in our 1 plus X video
review more than anything the oneplus X
is about style while our initial
hands-on featured the more expensive
ceramic Edition even the standard onyx
build is exquisite
a pane of Gorilla Glass 3 up front and
one a fire baked scratch resistant glass
on the backside come together in an
aluminum alloy mid plate complete with
Art Deco style striping and subtle
chamfers that twinkle in the light the
volume and power buttons are easy to
find with a thumb easy to tell apart
thanks to their texture and their
mechanical feedback is almost perfect on
the opposite side the three way
notification slider is back allowing
ringer settings to be changed with the
flick of a switch in the hand the feel
is nothing short of sublime by making
use of a modest 5 inch display with
fairly minimal bezels oneplus has
produced an android rarity a smallish
phone with top-shelf design that can be
comfortably used with one hand it's
vaguely reminiscent of Sony's compact
series but at alyssum 6.9 millimeters
the oneplus X is quite a bit thinner
than those devices and the use of a full
HD AMOLED panel means that blacks blend
right in with the bezel while colors
seem to leap right off the screen in
this way the oneplus X outshines its
higher-end sibling the oneplus 2 whose
colors seem quite faded by comparison
not all the hardware is so winning for
one thing this is one of the most
slippery phones we've ever used
tabletops pant legs arm rests you name
it our review device has slithered off
all of them to fall on the floor and
while it's glass is unscathed its soft
aluminum bares the scratches to prove it
also the oneplus X is an absolute magnet
for finger
and sadly they can't be put to any
practical use there's no fingerprint
scanner in sight that's not the only
missing feature spec hunters will lament
the phone uses an older Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 for its processor backed
up by just 16 gigs of storage only 11
and a half of which are user accessible
there's no NFC so Android pay is out and
while there's LTE baked in Ben 12 and 17
are not supported and more on this in
our test notes in just a minute but
oneplus has built in some surprising
pluses to three gigs of ram for one
thing which helps a bit with app
shuffling and a microSD expansion slot
good for another 128 gigs of storage if
you don't need that extra stockpile you
can double up on Sims instead use the
phone on more than one wireless carrier
as we discovered with the oneplus 2 this
can come in quite handy speaking of the
oneplus 2 the oneplus x software is
almost identical it runs oxygen OS a
custom fork of Android lollipop with a
few added features most of which are
very useful probably our favorite one is
one we've seen before the oneplus X
offers an enhanced version of the
ambient display that Google's Nexus
family has when the phone detects that
you've picked it up it projects the time
and you're waiting notifications onto
the screen and a power saving monochrome
if you've enabled proximity wake it'll
also do this when you wave a hand over
the front-facing camera many parts of
the software experience offers small but
convenient upgrades over stock Android
swipe anywhere on the home screen to
deploy the notification shape decide
which shortcut toggles you want
displayed within that notification
drawer choose what accent and LED colors
suits you best or skin the entire OS and
a dark or light theme and individually
dictate app permissions like you can do
in Android marshmallow as you can see
we're using unscreened soft keys instead
of the hardware buttons mainly because
there are no back lights on the latter
if you do decide to use the capacitive
buttons you can assign shortcuts to
double taps or long presses and speaking
of shortcuts you've still got the option
to draw a circle on the lock screen to
launch the camera or draw a V to turn on
the flashlight they're a little awkward
but once you get used to them they can
come in handy it's sort of like the
Shelf that oneplus has included on the
most homescreen a vertically scrolling
array of widgets if you don't like it
you can remove it on the hole oxygen OS
remains one of our favorite Android
flavors it's added features are
convenient at best and inoffensive at
worst and it's cosmetic customizations
do a nice job of complementing the
beautiful hardware here oneplus tells us
a marshmallow update is coming sometime
next year but the company has yet to
commit to a firm date oneplus is opted
for a 13 megapixel Samsung ISO cell
camera for this phone with an F 2.2
aperture and no optical image
stabilization the result is adequate
results in bright light and that's about
as good as it gets if you're planning on
showing most of your photos on the phone
itself the AMOLED display helps a lot by
artificially boosting contrast and
saturation take them off the device
though and the colors wither zoom in and
the detail falls apart edges corrupted
by digital grain brightly lit areas are
often overexposed colourful rows of pink
flower petals become a washed out
expanse of salmon colored feathers the
lower the light gets the tougher it
becomes to gain and keep focus setting
the phone to HDR mode helps it brighten
very dim nighttime scenes and using the
resolution enhancing clear image mode
does add needed sharpness but these are
inconsistent workarounds there's nothing
special about the phone's video
performance which maxes out at 1080p and
exhibits many of the same handicaps as
the stills do with the added shakes and
shimmies that come from a lack of
stabilization selfie quality on the
front facing eight megapixel camera
varies significantly depending on
lighting but who's going to use this for
professional glamour shots as with most
selfie shooters it's good enough given
plenty of light with a skin smoothing
Beauty mode that does a good job of
evening out your complexion without
getting ridiculous about things the
camera suite is probably the weakest
aspect of the oneplus X if you can find
your photo sharing too casual stints on
Facebook and Twitter yeah it'll get the
job done
but if you take even a small measure of
pride in your smartphone photography
even say to an Instagram degree you may
want to look elsewhere
we tested the oneplus X over six days on
the eastern Long Island New York and as
expected 4G network performance was
inconsistent the lack of band 12 and 17
makes this phone incapable of using 700
megahertz spectrum on either AT&amp;amp;T or
t-mobile meaning we couldn't get LTE in
many places and AT&amp;amp;T even thought our
phone was a 2g device at one point the
oneplus X will not perform as well as
phones custom-made for those networks on
the bright side
none of this effects voice quality the
oneplus X brings a clearer earpiece and
it's 138 gram mass is no burden to hold
up for a long call the user experience
and other fundamentals ranges from
average to slightly below the bottom
firing speaker is easy to accidentally
block with a finger and while it's
usually loud enough it's prone to raspy
playback playing high demand games like
asphalt 8 requires you to step down the
graphics to medium at most anything
higher results in so much choppiness has
to render it mostly unplayable battery
life is better than we expected given
the smallish power pack but it's nothing
special four hours of screen on time
over a 13 hour day was the most we were
able to manage three hours screen on
time is more typical and finally there's
no quick charging here no matter what
kind of adapter we used the oneplus X
charged at applauding 1% per hour or
less through its USB 2.0 port the Onyx
Edition oneplus X will go on sale in the
US on November 19th through 1 pluses
invite system at a price of $249 if
you're the type of buyer who prizes
performance over physical allure there
are better options out there including
the oneplus 2 for just $80 more the
oneplus X was built for those who care
more about beautiful presentation than
raw capability for 249 you can certainly
find a smarter sidekick but you're not
likely to find a prettier one
we've got a lot more to say on the
oneplus X folks and it's all in our full
