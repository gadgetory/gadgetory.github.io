what's up guys it's CJ from Pocket now
calm and yes an auto-tune app has
finally arrived for Android I'm sure you
guys have heard of the I am t-pain
iPhone app by now well mic droid is the
closest equivalent for Android at the
moment it's still early in development
so the features are pretty basic but it
does work so let's check it out alright
so here we are at the main screen and as
you can see it's really simple we just
have a record button in the middle and
we'll go ahead and press this and what
it does is record whatever you sing or
say into the microphone of the device so
we'll go ahead and stop the recording
and it takes that clip applies a
timestamp to it we can label it whatever
we want to go to save and what is doing
now is actually applying the auto-tune
effect to the final recording so we can
access that by going to menu and going
to recording library I'm actually going
to go to pitch correction settings so we
can check out some of these settings
that we can change so here are some
recording settings you can change the
sample rate we can change the key some
pitch settings pull the fixed pitch
pitch shift
and some correction settings correction
strength and correction smoothness and
finally we have mix so a number of
settings here that really allows us to
adjust and tweak the final sound output
to make it sound a lot like what we
would hear from a t-pain or maybe a con
artists like that who use the auto-tune
functionality so we'll go back and go to
menu and recording library and here we
have our stored recorded clips so I'll
go ahead and clip click on one that I
set up earlier and here we have some
playback options so we have play stop
delete and closed I'm gonna go ahead and
play one please subscribe to our YouTube
channel and follow us on twitter at
twitter.com/zeromd so we'll go to close
and we can actually tap and hold on an
item and we get an option to set as
ringtone or send as email so some cool
features there
and finally after I was done messing
with traditional Auto Tunes sounds that
I decided to see what else I could up
get out of this app so I actually
recorded myself and set it to sound like
sort of like an informant with a
distorted voice so we'll go ahead and
play that alright so you can have a lot
of fun with the app it has a lot of
entertainment value this was Mike Droid
we'll go ahead and go back and go to the
market here we have two versions of Mike
Droid the free version and the donation'
version for $2.99 there's actually no
difference between the two it's just one
is to show support to the developer so
that about does it for Mike Droid
the auto-tune app for Android that's it
for now thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
