anticipated smartphones of the year but
Samson can invent the wheel all the time
so I'm hi Matt leave it up this is
pocket now and these are a top 5
predictions of what will get on the
samsung galaxy s4 number 5 a similar
design to the galaxy s3 and this is
actually not a bad thing a lot of people
are already complaining about the leaked
photos out there of the galaxy s4 in
stating that Samsung is not changing
much but again some people have just
bought their galaxy s3 the design was
actually quite cool quite different to
any other smartphone in the market so I
don't consider it a bad thing for
samsung to retain the same design but
obviously that same design does involve
the fact that Samsung has to raise the
bar somewhere else so let's talk about
our next prediction number 4 is improved
specs and just think about it if Sampson
keeps the same design as the galaxy s3
they need to make that thing fly when it
comes to speed and the galaxy s3 was no
slouch but we already have the HTC One
rocking the Snapdragon 600 and we do
have rumors that the galaxy s4 will
retain that same processor in certain
areas like the United States and then in
Europe will have the X and O's 5
octa-core processor though we still have
not seen just how fast that octa-core
processor is compared to the Snapdragon
600 so again improve specifications when
it comes to the chipset more RAM and
probably definitely a better camera we
also know that the galaxy s4 could bring
that 13.1 megapixel camera that's
already been seeing on the Sony Xperia Z
we do know that Samsung and Apple use
the same sensors that are made by sony
and with the HTC One dropping that
camera to only 4 megapixels this is
really where Samsung and pull the edge
if it's not what the plastic it could be
with the camera so stay tuned number 3 a
smarter operating system Samsung has
done a great job with TouchWiz and
making it the most fluid and most
reliable up the launchers out there for
any smartphone manufacturer but still it
looks very gimmicky and at the same time
it does bring a lot of smart features
that have also been gimmicky it would be
great to see Samson pull off again the
same design beefier specs and also a
smarter operating system a device that
actually brings features that are
completely different to anything else in
the mark
in order for it to stand out from the
crowd because we have seen HTC Sense 5
and iOS 7 is actually being rumored to
be something cool so Samsung does need
to raise the bar right now whether they
like it or not number two and believe it
or not we do believe that samsung will
bring S Pen functionality to the galaxy
s4 now we don't see that samsung will
bundle this is something you can pull in
and out of the phone most likely the
s-pen will be retailed out there for you
to buy on the galaxy s4 but it will not
fit on the device most likely Samsung
will make this phone much thinner or
they can probably bring a thinner s-pen
but we do know that Samsung bought Wacom
or Wacom is they're actually called and
we do know that they want to bring this
technology to as many smartphones as
they can not necessarily the galaxy note
2 and seriously the Galaxy Note 2 as big
as it is all the S Pen actually makes
that phone stand out so the galaxy s4
will most likely also bring that
functionality again the sea pen was a
big big disappointment and we do hope to
see this technology make it to the
galaxy s4 as well and finally our top
number one prediction for the samsung
galaxy s4 is one more thing and I mean
one more thing that we still don't know
about and the reason why is because well
the Sony Xperia Z is a beautiful
smartphone with all the specs and then
we've got the HTC One which is another
beautiful smartphone with all the specs
and then we'll have the iphone 5s which
will be a beautiful smartphone with
hopefully iOS 7 so Samson really needs
to pull some guns here if they plan to
keep the same design as the galaxy s3
they really need to bring something to
the market that's completely unique
something that's completely different
that's not marketing on billboards and
on bathrooms they need to figure
something out that's not necessarily
just putting the smartphone on style but
something that makes you want to have a
galaxy s4 so that leaves you to the
question of this top five what would be
that top 5 that top number one killer
feature that one more thing that you
would love on the galaxy s4 just use
your imagination what would you want on
the galaxy s4 I would want something
better than s-voice something that's
better than Cirie I would really love
some artificial intelligence on this
phone and obviously yes I would want an
S Pen so leave us a comment down below

that you would love that's it for
