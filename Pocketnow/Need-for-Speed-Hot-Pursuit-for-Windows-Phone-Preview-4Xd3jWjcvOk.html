and we're gonna do a quick preview of a
new xbox live game for this phone let's
check it out alright this week's Xbox
Live game is Need for Speed hot pursuit
it's a really good really good-looking
game and it starts off with a video so
it shows off some nice graphics and some
cool music if you want to give it you
can just press the back button and we'll
get a message about doing this in for
entertainment purposes only do not do
this with a real car and so we can
choose different options here by a
sliding that little corner thing let's
go to play career and from here you can
choose cop or street racer let's try a
street racer and you can choose a
location all right now plays pretty much
exactly the same as the previous Need
for Speed game I'll just try that okay
you tilt it to turn and sliding up on
the right side will give you nitrous
boost like so and make this go faster
and tapping here will brake to slow down
and swiping down like that will give you
a handbrake to make you you know help
you drift around of course
and of course we'll have different
missions as a racer and as a cop you're
going to be usually trying to catch up
the racers so let's check that out so as
a cop I can choose our location again
and there's an important note we have
some extra features as a cop we'll check
it out
so let's see the two buttons the bottom
one of those is an EMP which will target
the racer and try to kill their
electronics the other one is a oh jeez I
just hit a station wagon the other one
is a road block then we'll set up some
other cop cars to try to stop the die
let's try that
there we go
it's alright
this we've gotta catch them and bump
them until he moves or pulls over and
this is very difficult to play well fill
me okay almost got alright you get that
here there's also a quick race option
where of course you can just choose
whatever options you want and play it
really quickly and we also have this
little car button down here which is fun
too well there's your little note to
change the color
that looks good and we can view in 360
so that's pretty cool a little effect
there check out what the car looks like
of course you can choose different cars
there as well and of course we have
achievements let's see all those
leaderboard and options nothing special
in the options now this is kind of an
example of bad user interface design we
have a floppy diskette icon down there
and a check mark and a graduation hat
that is actually a tutorial and the Save
icon doesn't really say if it actually
deletes everything so be careful about
that
so there's Need for Speed hot pursuit
coming the February 1st be sure to check
it out Corsa free trial will be
available give us a thumbs up if you
like this video and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
