is brought to you by XCOM global fitness
tracking is still far and away the
clearest consumer success for wearable
technology still as we look at cool tech
the industry is also addressing concerns
over style and fashion the intersection
between form and function misfit is
looking to expand on that conversation
with their step and sleep trackers that
provide consumers a more discreet
aesthetic for accomplishing the
lifestyle basics shine to is a smart
tracker which can be worn as a watch or
a pendant and uses a simple collection
of LEDs to display workout progress ray
on the other hand is a slim tracker
which looks like a bracelet or charm
that also counts steps and monitors
sleep and both China and Ray will run
for six months using replaceable
batteries misfit has aggressively pushed
the number of color style and band
options here making it far more likely
someone will be able to adopt a design
which matches their personal style while
also maintaining a discreet profile
subtlety is cool especially for folks
who might not enjoy the techy look of
competing trackers I'm just now breaking
in a misfit ray and we'll have more to
report after taking it for a test drive

when traveling abroad or the hassle of
buying another SIM card why not try a
smarter solution XCOM global gives you
