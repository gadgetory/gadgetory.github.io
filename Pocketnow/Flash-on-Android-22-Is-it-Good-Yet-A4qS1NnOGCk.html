now calm a big deal has been made out of
adobe flash on mobile devices Apple has
been extremely resistant to it because
they think that flash isn't optimized
for mobile devices it can slow down the
phone or the iPad in the case of the
other iOS device and it's just not a
good experience for the customer but
adobe disagrees and they think that the
smartphone platform should support flash
because it's so pervasive it's used on a
lot of Internet video a lot of internet
games and it just makes sense if you
want to have the full web experience you
should have flash on a mobile device
well guess what the motorola droid 2 is
among the first devices to come with
adobe flash player final meaning this is
10.1 not beta it's the final version
from adobe and it's also running android
2.2 so it has the optimized the best
possible flash experience in this video
we're going to test that out and compare
for websites the desktop experience with
how it appears on an android device that
has the final flash player built in
should be interesting let's get to it oh
okay so we're going to go through for
websites and the first website here is
called monoface the web address is mono
hyphen 1.com / monoface quite simply
it's a mini flash application that lets
you change the face of somebody by
clicking on their mouth and their nose
it's a lot of fun kind of a time waster
but it's a good implementation of flash
that allows you to have some fun wow
that's a scary one so let's turn on the
the droid 2 here and we're going to go
to this website and see how it looks on
on the phone so let's see we're going to
go to mono face and wear for Wi-Fi right
now let me go into landscape so it says
tap to interact ok well it looks like
it's already loading ok and here we are
the same site on desktop on phone and we
can interact with this or at least we
should be able to tap on various aspects
the mouth is changing as you can see the
the hair is changing the nose is
changing this is a really good
implementation of flash it works
perfectly on the mobile device just like
you would expect on the desktop so
definitely a big win here that is also a
very ugly face formato face now let's go
to a different website we're going to
pull up another favorite here on the
desktop or on the laptop we're going to
go to a site called to advance calm it's
just a really flash heavy website with
menu navigations with sound in fact if I
turn on the sound over here you'll be
able to hear ok and so it's got sound
it's got drop-down menus it's a really
advanced flash website let's see how
Android does with that so we're going to
go back into the favorites and here it
is too advanced and let's let that load
sound is turned on
okay so you should be on the sound let
me turn it up tight a pinhole what I
should get the full screen option so far
so good go fullscreen and let's see the
extent to which we can manipulate things
on the screen that's not working out to
LSC now we can zoom in a little bit okay
the drop-down menu navigation is working
let's go to portfolio or company about
us executive team so presumably things
are changing on the screen that's tough
to tell Leslie zoom out okay so we just
did something so in this case if you
have a little bit of patience you get
the same experience or a very similar
experience on them on mobile than you do
on the web so this is another good
implementation of flash and it works
quite nicely on a mobile device so let's
go to the next website number three out
of four we're going to go to a website
called section 7 calm again a very flash
intense website with graphics that
definitely told the CPU we're to see how
the droid two handles this website so
quite simply what we do is go down here
to open and we get this big animation
with these different books that go by
and what you do is you tap on one of
these and you get a portfolio of
projects very very intense let's see how
the droid two handles this so we're
going to go to section 7 calm go into
landscape sorry for getting some
reflection there okay so we're getting
the similar sort of animation already
let's see if we can get this full screen
before it even starts here we go
okay we should see the fanning out of
the pages if this is going to be true to
the desktop form so something's
happening up there goes very good very
good so we should be able to scroll to
the right it's a little bit slow and I
should tap on a book it should open it's
not working this is one of the websites
that doesn't actually work as intended
because it's just not optimized properly
for a mobile device and so if we go back
and try to interact with the site it
just it's just not working too well and
don't even try to open up another tab
while you're on something this flash
intense because it's really tolling the
ram in the CPU of the device so here's
an example where flash it doesn't work I
just I can't interact with the elements
it's just not made for the mobile device
so let's try one more thing here we're
going to try something that's more
interactive we're going to go to mini
clips calm which is an online gaming
site which is all free flash games so
for example we click on any of these and
we're brought to a flash page and it
says miniclip and we can just
demonstrate real quickly how this works
on the laptop okay so let's play and
I'll just click on anything how to play
go by the way there is sound anyway so I
can click on stuff and interact although
I have no idea what I'm doing so let's
get a game up on the droid two from mini
clips so again we're going to go into
the favorites and pull that up here it
is and let's go into landscape and let's
see how flash games work on the droid
two with Chaz again off the final adobe
flash player so here we go we have the
desktop view loading right now I'm going
to scroll in a little bit and click on
save mmm this game here okay
okay something's happening okay here we
go let's go full screen on this you can
see that this is a flash element hmm
something happened there let's go back
let it load into in this frame okay play
that will select so far so good right so
we'd love to get this full screen it's
not working full screen if we can zoom
out hmm here we go full screen so right
now it's not being very responsive
because it's probably using a lot of the
CPU and the ram so here we go full
screen there we go here we go okay so
love the one is cleared I didn't even do
anything yet so let's see how we proceed
next level there we go so you adjust the
you just the same here tip press
spacebar to immediately wonderful space
bar works let's see spacebar I don't
know what that does I don't really know
what I'm doing but as you can see you
can interact with the flash games it
takes a little bit of knowing how to
actually play the game to get it to work
but you can see that it is responsive
it's a little bit slow and laggy at
times but the functionality is
absolutely there so let's get out of
this so overall as you've seen flesh on
the motorola droid 2 really the best
implementation of splash that adobe can
muster although you can argue that the
google nexus one may be able to do
better is quite good at this point when
we saw it when it was in beta it was
horrible it was slow it was laggy just
didn't work right in fact we went to
pocket now and because pocket now has
some flash advertisements it slowed down
the site tremendously to the point where
we couldn't scroll down the page but in
this case probably thanks to a lot of
software optimization and thanks to a a
fast cpu and enough ram flash works
quite well
finally on a mobile device it's not
perfect and so here we have
pocketnow.com there are some flash ads
at the top I don't let it finish loading
and I'll scroll down the page and give
you a sense of how fast scrolling is
with flash elements okay so here we go
these are some flash ads you'll see an
animation over there and up there let's
check out scrolling it's a lot smoother
than it was it's not perfect you can
turn off flash of course by going into
the settings and disabling plugins but
you probably know how to do that if you
have an Android is a device but in the
end / on Android has gotten good enough
to where you can leave plugins enabled
and actually use flash almost like
you're using a regular desktop computer
it's not quite as good and when we start
to get faster processors dual-core
processors and smartphones and even more
RAM it'll become even better so so far
so good if you like this video please
