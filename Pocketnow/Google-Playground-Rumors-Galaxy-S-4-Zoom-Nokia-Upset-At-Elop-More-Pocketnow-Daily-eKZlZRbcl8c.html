rumored for google i/o rumors of a
samsung galaxy s4 zoom emerged and nokia
shareholders vent on their
disappointments over stephen elop I'm hi
meri behna and I'm wondering is this
going to be a Google playground where
you'll go to the Google park with your
Google sunglasses this is parking out
daily we've got a lot of Microsoft news
today and let's start it off with the
fact that they finally publish their own
YouTube application for windows phone 8
that's actually good and bad I'm a good
side anything is better than having to
go to mobile Internet Explorer to watch
a YouTube video for those of you that
have used Windows Phone 8 you'll know
how frustrating it can be but then again
the problem is this application is made
by microsoft not google so for those of
you that know how frustrating the
facebook application can be for Windows
Phone and how they're trying a new beta
it looks a lot like the iOS and Android
version of Facebook we'll see how it
goes with this YouTube app and let's
continue on with Nokia for two things
number one the Nokia Lumia 928 landing
page is already live on the Nokia
website and we can't expect to have a
great camera experience with this phone
that's just wait for it to be announced
very soon but on the negative side savvy
shareholders are questioning Stephen
Elop over his administration according
to them and I'm not really quoting but
it's more or less what they said you
know he's a great guy and he really is
but the problem is bottom line results
have not shown that the combo with
Microsoft has really proven to be
successful and I just wish they adopted
Android I mean what's so complicated of
having the Nokia Lumia lineup and
something else think about it and
speaking of Microsoft products that have
not taken off the president of acer has
just confirmed that they will not be
adopting Windows RT according to him it
is too confusing for users and we
already gave you a heads up for our
surface RT review links down below for
that but other than that he did say that
they are considering the future of
Windows RT whatever is coming and we do
know that when those blue will probably
be available for preview by probably end
of summer so stay tuned according to him
it'll be a lot better hopefully and then
moving over to Samsung and confusions
well we've got some new leaks of samsung
galaxy s4 zoom
and the reason why this is confusing is
because according to the reports this is
Samsung's first camera phone which is
kind of weird since camera phones have
existed for the longest time but
apparently this is really a camera
that's also a phone like the 808
PureView and when you think about the
fact that the galaxy camera already
exists but it is not a phone apparently
we will be getting the next version of
the galaxy camera being the s4 phone or
whatever they're going to call this
thing so stay tuned for the rumors
because it will bring the same 16
megapixel camera sensor which is
actually both good and bad since the
galaxy camera does take terrible photos
and finally for the interesting news of
the day by the time you watch this video
this all either be confirmed or be
dismissed but there are some leaked
pressing bites of a Google playground
event to happen in Google i/o and the
reason why this is weird is because
presentations are never a secret we
always know that there's a presentation
even though you not always know what the
event is going to be about and this time
it is being dubbed the google play
ground there a change in the playground
so whatever happens this could either be
you know confirmed eventually or it
could either be confirmed that it's just
a fake so stay tuned for the rumors but
that leads me to the question of the day
let's assume that this hope Google
playground thing is true what do you
think it is do you think it is really a
google play console gaming console do
you believe that it is a social game
center like what we have on iOS or do
you believe that Google is just getting
into games as a business in my
particular case we believe that this is
most likely just the social gaming
platform you know places work people can
play together but not necessarily a game
console but leave us a comment down
below what are your predictions if
Google playground this true what do you
think it is if it is true and of course
for another scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone in Savile
Row but she follow us on konga.com
subscribe to our YouTube channel you can
also follow me on twitter at hind it
underscored iveta let's give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
