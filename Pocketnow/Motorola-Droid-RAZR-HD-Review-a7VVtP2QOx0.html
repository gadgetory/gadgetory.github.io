droids being offered on the Verizon
network by Motorola we recently had a
chance to take it for a spin we had a
couple questions we asked how does it
stack up against the original Droid Razr
do you need to fork out the extra money
and get the Droid RAZR MAXX HD or is the
Droid Razr HD enough for you to have as
your regular daily driver I'm Joe Levi
this is PocketNow and this is the full
review of Verizon's Motorola Droid Razr
HD it wasn't that long ago that we were
wowed by the original Droid Razr it's
thin bezel was amazing now the new Droid
Razr HD isn't quite as thin but it's got
something the original razor didn't
incredible battery life one that in just
a minute the razor HD is still very thin
fairly light and its construction feels
impressive on the front of the phone is
a beautiful slab of Gorilla Glass with
moderate Motorola and verizon branding
gone are the capacitive buttons of
previous generations they've been
replaced with on-screen buttons that
we've become accustomed to an Android
Ice Cream Sandwich and jelly bean
motorola took the opportunity to rework
the layout of the stuff on the front of
the device as well they moved the
front-facing camera and sensors
positioning them higher up on the device
which freed up a lot of room for the new
HD screen they also included the largest
multicolored notification LED that we've
ever seen the HD screen looks quite good
it's got vibrant colors the text is
crisp and clear and it's readable in
virtually all lighting conditions the
back of the phone is covered in a soft
touch Kevlar that's durable doesn't show
fingerprints and is very grippy the
camera LED flash and speaker grille
occupy a very slight hump on the top of
the backplate the headphone jack is up
on the top a very nicely textured
our button volume rocker are over here
on the right and the micro USB and HDMI
ports are on the left just below the sim
and SD card slot to get to either of
those you'll need to use the included
pokey thing or a very slender paper clip
during the course of this review I
wasn't able to get the door open despite
my best efforts the battery inside the
razor HD is significantly larger than
the underperforming battery that came in
the original Droid Razr now if you
remember the original Droid Razr was
followed up by the original Droid RAZR
MAXX with a much larger battery well
like that the razor HD has a counterpart
the razor max HD and it too has a much
larger battery however we don't think
you're really going to need it the 2530
milliamp hour battery unfortunately
isn't user removable in our tests the
battery lasted well over 20 hours with
regular use including plenty of YouTube
and web surfing the razor HD is powered
by a dual-core MSM 8960 Snapdragon s4
plus processor running at 1.5 gigahertz
and an Adreno 225 GPU it's got 1 gig of
ram under the hood to help keep
everything running smoothly 16 gig of
internal storage space and an SD card
slot for additional storage if you can
get that little door open motorola still
isn't running stock android but it seems
like they're starting to get the message
we want simple elegant stuff so they're
scaling back quite a bit without losing
too many of the niceties that we're used
to in motoblur the launcher is still
very much Motorola the circles widget is
front and center but the other widgets
seem to be getting dumbed down one of
the more notable inclusions in this
iteration of Motorola's launcher is the
unique Settings panel to the far left on
the home screen that gives you access to
all your comment agha land even direct
access to your full settings
disappointingly there is some lag in
you eye whether this is due to their
decision to use an S 4 plus processor
rather than an S for pro or the fact
that the razor HD is running Ice Cream
Sandwich and not jellybean the lag
wasn't around all the time but when it
was it slowed down the whole experience
sometimes for three or four seconds at a
time
benchmarks however we're all-around
impressive quadrant smart bench Linpack
and antutu all scored very well if you
want to get the exact numbers make sure
you head over to the full review at
pocketnow.com LTE speeds are going to
vary by your location
we usually have between three and four
bars and usually got around 13 megabit
per second down and 10 megabit per
second up the phone itself does support
HD calling but we weren't able to tell
the difference between HD calls and
normal calls that's not necessarily a
bad thing because calls were always
crisp and clear and we never once
dropped a call or ventured into an area
that didn't have voice coverage the
still camera does what you'd expect but
colors aren't great and the shutter
speed seems a little slower than some of
the other phones that we've tested
recently indoor shots were dark and
noisy outdoor shots were always too
bright or too dark
HDR seems to help a little bit and
pulled some details out of the shadows
but overall eight and megapixel we
expected more so what does all this boil
down to let's talk some pros and some
cons pros the razor HD has a terrific
display extraordinary battery life is
built very very well and we love the
fact that it's got this grippy Kevlar
back how about the cons unfortunately
with this iteration there is no more
webtop if you want to use your phone and
plug it into a laptop or plug it into
one of the webtop accessories you're not
going to have that experience I'm sorry
you're out of luck there's no jellybeans
out of the box it's running an Ice Cream
Sandwich normally that wouldn't be a
problem they've said that they're going
to release an update but motorola has a
bad reputation for not keeping their OS
upgrade promises
and last there's also a slight lag in
the UI at times animations can slow down
to a ridiculous crawl
so in conclusion should you get this
phone if you're a Verizon customer and
you're looking for a new phone you don't
need to look any further the Droid Razr
HD or the the RAZR MAXX HD should
probably be your next phone it's very
well built it's got a beautiful screen
and the battery even in the non max
version will last literally all day long
and then some we give the Droid Razr an
eight point three out of ten that'll
wrap up our full video review for the
Motorola Droid Razr HD for the Verizon
network if you'd like to get even more
details specific benchmark scores and
all kinds of stuff that we had to leave
out of this video for brevity make sure
you head over to pocketnow.com if you
liked the video make sure you give it a
thumbs up and of course if you'd like to
follow us so you don't miss out on any
new phones or any new news about this
phone you'll want to follow at PocketNow
