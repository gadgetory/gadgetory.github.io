pocket now calm and we are at the
verizon wireless national test lab in
bedminster New Jersey pocketnow was
invited to an exclusive tour of the
facilities here so I'm very curious to
see what we have inside here and
hopefully learned some interesting
things too so we'll see you soon so here
we are in the verizon building on our
way to the phone lab see in a second so
here we are about to enter a shielded
room where a lot of testing is done
there are Moulton side of this facility
here to test various things we're going
to go inside and take a look at it okay
we're not inside of a bomb shelter right
now this is actually a shielded room
meaning that I do not have any cell
phone reception of course the purpose of
this is so that Verizon can isolate all
the or kind of cut out all the signals
from various radio frequencies and be
able to test devices a very isolated
environment so the floor
or advantage that Nancy static floor so
they've got everything covered here
pretty much it's just a variety of
testing equipment each one of these
towers kind of represents a network so
that they can get into a particular
Network get a GPS feed if necessary
things like that and then they have
these boxes which are also shielded
boxes and the purpose for this is so
that they can do tests inside of a box
somebody opens one of the exterior doors
then some signal may get in but if the
device is being tested inside one of
these are enclosures then there will be
no signal leak in there
and if you've ever wondered why your
device has a port for the antenna on the
back or for the GPS that's we're testing
so the verizon or the carrier can plug
into your device in the lab and get
readings off of it and that sort of
thing when it's kind of in this isolated
environment so here we are in the audio
room this is where verizon has their
their manufacturers make sure that they
adhere to certain audio requirements so
that the earpiece isn't too loud or so
The Vow the microphone is sensitive
enough so they have these chambers
they're completely soundproof they have
a dummy inside of it with a fake silicon
ear that allows you to kind of replicate
the human ear and this is where they
make sure that everything sounds okay
when you get the phone at the store so
this apparatus is actually supposed to
model the density of a human head so
inside there's a kind of watery saline
solution and this this test is used so
that they put a cell phone on one side
of the head and they make sure that you
know if you're traveling down the
highway for example and you're getting a
signal from this side of your body that
the there's no interference from your
head that will block the cell phone
signal and this is supposed to be an
average human sized head with a
replicated density we have kind of a
Museum of old verizon phones and I think
some of these will look familiar to you
so you've got the old ESN reader you've
got a lot of kind of car phones that
your mom and dad may have had or even
your grandparents and then we have the
zack morris phone right here or a
variation of it it is extremely heavy
and it has a screen that can only
display a few numbers of course with a
massive battery it's basically just a
battery a few buttons and a large
antenna
alright and then we start to get into
the smaller form factors like the
StarTAC or kind of the predecessor to
the star tech and then we have some
other candy bar devices and then they
make a dramatic leap from these kind of
thick form factors to the smaller ones
down here and there's the kind of the
end the last startech here the silver
one which a lot of people had and then
we get to into some smartphones so we
have some palm based smartphones down
here kyocera model and of course the
Samsung I 300 but you may remember and
then we continue we get smaller and
smaller and then we get to some
modern-day phones but the timeline kind
of stops here at around two thousand two
so we have you know the samsung 830 up
here behind the side then we also see
some pagers this is one of the original
pagers but of course I didn't have a
screen so you got a page from someone
you didn't know who was coming from
unless well if one person at your pager
number then you know who was paging you
then you have the old-style motorola
pagers doctors lawyers some of them
still actually use pager today so that
is the verizon museum a lot of
interesting devices that i think a lot
of us remember from the best alright
guys that pretty much concludes the tour
of the verizon national test lab be sure
you check out the right up on
pocketnow.com where i'll tell you all
the details that you didn't see on
camera you know the stuff that i can
talk about course that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
