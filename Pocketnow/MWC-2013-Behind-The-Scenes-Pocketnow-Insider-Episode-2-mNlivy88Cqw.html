they're not dead yet shows like Mobile
World Congress are still some of the
best places to go if you want to get
your hands on smartphones and tablets
before they hit store shelves but
watching from home you don't get the
full experience you get a few hands on
videos maybe a podcast a hangout or two
but you never get a glimpse behind the
scenes to see what covering a trade show
like mwc is really about so what is it
all about I'm Michael Fisher this is
pocket now and this is pocket now
insider episode to trade shows are held
all over the world but the one constant
always seems to be that they're held
thousands of miles from your home so
covering a show always starts with a
long airplane or train ride more often
than not accompanied by a big helping of
jet lag as you get acclimated to your
new environment you need to get the
essentials that includes the usual stuff
like food water and coffee seriously a
lot of coffee but if the show is outside
your home country it also means getting
a new local SIM card so you still have
data and voice hopefully you've picked
out the smartphone you most prefer to
cover the show before hand at mwc 2013
both Anton and I predominantly used the
Samsung Galaxy Note 2 who's sharing
functionality and long battery life
helped us out quite a bit no Samsung
didn't pay is to say that it was just
Tony and me for this one by the way so
we were stretched a little thin this
time around covering a show often means
the opportunity to see a lot of awesome
sights and take in a lot of foreign
culture but when the time comes for the
show itself its work solid hard work we
rise early often before the Sun because
there are lines everywhere more than
72,000 people were in attendance at
Mobile World Congress this year and
getting up late means waiting behind all
of them for hands-on opportunities we
always want to be the first so we're
often up with the Sun or slightly before
it after an event there's more pushing
and shoving as demo units are uncovered
and it's a constant struggle to get
enough space to shoot a hands-on video
surround it as we are by hundreds of
other people most of them carrying heavy
backpacks and video equipment just like
us we shot most of mwc on a sony HDR XR
550 ve
camera by the way with additional video
and stills coming from a Sony NEX f3 and
even our smartphone cameras in a pinch
the next step is editing and uploading
all that footage which we do on Final
Cut Pro on a pair of macbooks from the
press room because Wi-Fi or cellular on
the show floor is always completely
unreliable there are several press rooms
available at mwc but they fill up
quickly and sometimes even their
internet connection is too slow so we're
occasionally forced to upload videos
from unconventional locations like hotel
lobbies coffee shops and so on meanwhile
back in the States the rest of the
pocket now team is writing our shell
posts and annotating the videos doing
housekeeping and allowing us to focus on
shooting editing and uploading until all
videos are up as you can imagine the
miles and miles of walking works up
quite an appetite but the food at trade
shows is notoriously overpriced and much
of it is just plain bad so the big meals
wait until evening when we leave the
convention center via a packed train and
grab dinner while uploading one or two
stragglers sometimes there's an evening
gathering a kind of post show hosted by
an outside company if that's the case
there's usually excellent food but more
important there's still more devices so
we attend these events as well at this
year's MWC our hands-on videos of the
kyocera torque and HP slate7 came from
just such an after party after all this
we take our swollen feet home to the
hotel room usually a tiny one to save
costs and we sit down but not to go to
sleep in Spain ten in the evening is
four in the afternoon in the state's
perfect timing for recording episodes of
the pocket now live and the pocket now
weekly so if you listened to the podcast
or if you joined us in a hangout from
Barcelona you were probably seeing and
hearing Tony and me at the very end of a
long tiring but fulfilling day and yes
we were probably having some p√°linka or
some Jack because we're old enough and
because we think we earned it that's a
good way to encapsulate the trade show
experience overall it's exhausting it
can be stressful and it's not always
easy but the opportunity to be among the
first people to put hands on a new
smartphone or tab
and to communicate that experience to
you is tremendously rewarding that's why
we cover trade shows and it's why we
thank you sincerely for watching hope
we've given you some insight into what
it was like to cover mwc 2013 if you
haven't seen them yet we have some other
videos up including a wrap up our
initial introduction and even some
bloopers in addition to the 30 or so
hands-on videos podcasts hangouts that
we were able to do from Barcelona so
check those out the meantime follow us
on social media in the links below thank
you for watching stay tuned for more
michael fisher with pocket now we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
