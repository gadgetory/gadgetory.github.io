seconds each so let's get to it Cut the
Rope is a paper game the cost 99 cents

game is to cut various strings and pour
des ropes in order for a piece of candy
to fall into this little monsters mouth
so we'll start this level and here we
want to have these automatic ropes
appear and we want you to make a chain
reaction all the way down to this little
guy and given the piece of candy so here
we'll cut this rope cut this rope and
we'll it looks as though we've succeeded
on this level and we can move on to the
next so this levels a little more
challenging let's just do it really
quickly here hulu plus is a free
application that does require a
subscription service that costs around
seven dollars and ninety-nine cents a
month but if you have a student you can
get a one month free and anyone else can
get a seven day trial free so here we

episode with minimal interruptions from
commercials live share is a free
application allows you to share your
photos with groups of friends and it's
very easy to set up you can either set
up using facebook or you can set it
through a live share free account so how
this works is we can begin by a viewing
one of our photos here so let's say we
wanted to view this photo and all of our
friends that we've assigned can also
view those photos whether we have am on
Facebook or whatever so here we can just
go to a choose a source I let's just
choose something from Hawaii here we go
so we'll just load this picture and now
we can share it with our friends or our
groups Magic Hour is a light and paid
for application that costs 12 or 99
cents on the android market what this
allows you to do is tell the countless
amounts the photo filters available for
your photos so once they want to choose
a photo in my album and will just choose
this photo here and now i can either let
us click done and now all i have to do
is to add various filters i can even
create my own filter sweat see here i
think i wanted to have a sepia filter i
can go there and i can share it i can
also recreate
go back and now I can make my own filter
and just under here with all these
settings shaky tower is a free game bill
in android market the arbiters of the
games to build various towers or
structures and also to achieve goals by
using these little blocks so what I want
to do is to create a tower and I want to
go past this line and I was able to
succeed in that level so now I can go to
another one so let's go to the next
level and here I want to get my little
boxes into these squares it looks as
though there's two squares that will go
up and we'll just build boxes and it's a
much more challenging you're trying not
to shake your phone too much I'm not
going to do anymore so this has been
