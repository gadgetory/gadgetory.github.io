ever and most definitely its most
ambitious I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and we'll have a full review
in the coming weeks but for now join us
for our first impressions look at the
Samsung gear s dainty wrists need not
apply the gear s is more cuff or
bracelet than SmartWatch thanks to its
oversized casing and that's thanks to
its large display the gear s brings a
360 by 480 curved Super AMOLED display
measuring a full 2 inches on the
diagonal with a single button below that
functions as both home key and power
standby toggle the speakerphone sits on
the edge alongside the flexible rubber
band which is changeable but just matte
black on our sprint review device that
speaker is counterbalanced by a
microphone on the units opposite side
which is flanked by charging points for
the included charging cradle and the by
now expected heart rate sensor the whole
casing is ip67 dust and water resistant
and it weighs in at 66 grams the
software running the gear s is Samsung's
Tizen OS which is quite a culture shock
when you're coming from Google's Android
wear platform that's not to say it's bad
it's just different swiping in from the
bezels gets you access to things like
the application tray system controls and
best of all a devoted notification area
where all your alerts are aggregated the
main screen is devoted to customizable
widgets and of course the watch face
that's also customizable but we really
like the stock one which shows battery
life notifications and step count as sub
dials of a nicely designed analog clock
while the gear s is fairly responsive on
the whole animations have a lower frame
rate than we're used to seeing from
Android wear so the whole thing feels
just a little bit sluggish if you're
thinking this all sounds like a typical
SmartWatch you're right
but while the gear s does need to be
tethered to a Samsung smart phone for
initial setup it's also capable of
functioning in standalone mode that
means it's got its own 3G cellular
connection to Sprint's Network and its
own phone number even its own rate plant
so you can use it out in the real world
all by itself so far in our testing
we've used it for several phone calls
and many text messages and we've even
read a news story or two sprints Network
performance in rural Long Island has
surprised us even on so-called 3G
throughput is quick enough for light
reading and callers say we sound quite
clear even in areas with heavy
background noise we'll be installing
more apps and pushing the gear s to the
limits in the following days as we
prepare our full review and we'll be
looking closely at areas of concern like
battery life and the interface design
we've already got quite a few qualms in
each of those departments while it's
true that the gear s is the most feature
packed SmartWatch we've ever reviewed
and a lot of fun to test drive it's also
an almost $400 SmartWatch so we'll be
testing it thoroughly in the days ahead
thanks to Sprint for our review device

coverage on the gear s leave us a

thumbs up if you did enjoy this video

call from Admiral Kirk Inspector Gadget
Dick Tracy or one of my other wrist
phone buddies thanks for watching we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
