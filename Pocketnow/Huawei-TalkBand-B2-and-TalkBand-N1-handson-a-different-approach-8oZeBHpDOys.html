become the new thing lately Huawei has
surprised this at MWC 2015 with three
units and here we're gonna talk about
two I'm Jaime to be better with pocket
now here at MWC 2015 and Barcelona and
let's have a quick look at the Huawei
talk then v2 and talk then and one
Huawei launched its first wearable last
year the talk can be one that we covered
at this very show as a matter of fact
today the company has returned with not
one but three wearables and make sure
you watch our separate video on the
Huawei watch based on Android wear as
well on one hand we have the talk than
v2 which follows the same principle of
providing users with a fitness tracker
that's worn on the wrist but with the
added functionality of being able to be
used as a Bluetooth headset for phone
calls as well Huawei has evolved the old
silicon design of the old talk van be
one with a more premium material with
the talk van b2 there's a leather option
that looks extremely premium though it's
hard to tell if this is real leather or
faux leather but there are also other
plastic options as well and we've got
various color options indeed that said
slash tracker unit has also grown in
size includes a very intuitive
touchscreen and supports a more premium
look even though it's kind of difficult
to read at times with how prone it is to
smudges additional benefits of the talk
van be to include dual microphones for
noise suppression activity Auto
recognition which allows it to know if
you're sleeping running walking cycling
and even mountain hiking it's also ip57
dustin waterproof resistant offer six
hours of talktime and 12 days of standby
time even cooler is that Wally's health
tracking application compatible with the
talk that v2 is available for both iOS
and Android so you're not limited to
Android here this application also
intends the functionality of voice
tiling and even voice reminders as well
the Huawei talk van and one on the other
hand could visually pass for a regular
Bluetooth stereo headset oriented to
those in need of a fitness accessory but
it's actually more than that it sports
the usual bells and whistles of a
regularly
that Seth likes special codecs for CD
quality audio but it's added value is
that it's one of the first in the world
that can actually track your fitness
information just like the talk ban b1
stats on your steps distance traveled
calories burned or synced by the tarp
and then one two huawei's health
application and you even get four gigs
of built-in storage in case you want to
listen to music or use the headset
without a smartphone
other benefits include 4.5 hours of
talktime 7 hours of music playback and 9
days of standby time there's also a very
cool magnetic clasp on the tip that help
you not lose the headset while you're
using it and it's also ip54 dust and
water resistant as well Huawei is
clearly taking wearable seriously for
its 2015 lineup and we can't wait to
review these products very soon for now
