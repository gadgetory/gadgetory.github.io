mini-tablet out-of-the-box Lenovo is
outfitting the fab 2 pro with a charger
which looks suspiciously like the one
you might get with the yoga book the
papers will never ever read and some
earpods style but I know this thing is
huge but I kinda wish you got some kind
of protective case for it why the extra
protection because of all these sensors
on the back the fab 2 pro is being
released here to show off the first
generation of consumer augmented reality
which means you're going to want to
fling this thing around more than some
of the other phones we might be
currently reviewing a quick look at the
specs this beast is packin a qualcomm 6
v to chipset with a 6 point 4 inch
display rocking a quad HD resolution of
2560 by 1440 4 gigabytes of RAM on tap
and the phone comes with 64 gigabytes of
built-in storage you can add more via
microSD if you give up the second SIM
card slot considering the size and shape
the 4050 milliamp hour battery doesn't
really seem that big anymore especially
after using a couple other phones
recently which have hit that 4,000
milliamp power capacity it's a sharp
cornered aluminum monster and I'm having
a few Lumia 1520 flashbacks just holding
it how we could go through the normal
phone first impression stuff but really
the main showcase here is Google's tango
sensors and cameras on the back of the
phone do an incredible job of
recognizing objects and tracking the
phone's location in space without the
need for additional location sensors
movement tracking and virtual reality is
all the rage but you need to set up
beacons to achieve that Google's tango
on the fab 2 does all of that inside the
phone as this is bleeding edge tech
there aren't a lot of apps to show off
yet but the games and programs we do
have are very promising look here's a
little velociraptor in my office
watching efflux how adorable but what if
we want to see what this animal might
have looked like life-size ah there we
go a gaming will certainly be a driving
force in augmented reality and some of
these early apps are already pretty
engaging like how well the phone does it
fluidly tracking objects in space around
my table while I'm also recording screen
capture not bad for a mid to your
processor
moving up to more demanding action I
think virtual reality is a pretty poor
solution for laser tag style community
play and the fab is already showing us
an AR gaming future which will be easily
reached by people looking to make game
console level investments and we can't
overlook the practicality of the system
either even with the rough edges around
my patio it's not difficult getting some
measurements for where we might put in
some shelves Lowe's expands on this with
an app that allows you to preview
furniture or paint and molding they'll
be promoting the fab 2 in stores and
this is an excellent showcase of ARS
potential the app needs a little polish
as it gets confused in dim lighting but
this is a great starting point to
explain augmented reality to general
consumers we bandy about phrases like it
just works but the fab 2 starts us off
on a much more advanced track for
augmented reality what's great is you
don't need to explain a whole lot you
hand the phone off to someone with an
app loaded and the experience mostly
speaks for itself there are some early
concerns for people who might be looking
at this as an actual phone the fab
doesn't have NFC and the fingerprint
sensor location is low enough that I
keep smudging this camera sensor and
really digging into AR applications can
drain this battery pretty quick but
ultimately the fun of a gadget like this
is living on the bleeding edge virtual
reality is very cool but augmented
reality has the potential to impact
nearly every single app and service we
use and we're just getting started folks
as always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
our full fab 2 coverage this will be a
fun review to produce and help us out
with some sharing on your favorite
social networks for PocketNow i'm juan
carlos bag now some gadget guy on
twitter and instagram and i will catch
you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
