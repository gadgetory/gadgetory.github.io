comparable to other Android smartphones
that are budget-friendly I tailor Martin
this is PocketNow and here are our
impressions of the xiaomi redmi 1s the
very first thing we noticed about the
xiaomi redmi 1s wasn't the bright red
capacitive buttons on the face even if
they're awesome and reminded us of the
One x+ it was the phone's heft it being
a low-end budget-friendly phone we
didn't expect it to weigh almost as much
as the One m8 a metal clad phone that
its unapologetic about its weight the
redmi 1s is a hundred and fifty-eight
grams which isn't necessarily a bad
thing but instead lends credence to the
underappreciated quality xiaomi is
capable of even in phones under $200 the
redmi 1s cost approximately the same as
the Moto G but it's build quality and
fit and finish our dare I say better
although the phone is a little on the
chunky side it vaguely reminds us of the
Oppo find 7 a not for its looks but in
the finish it's removable rear casing is
similar in texture and appearance which
means it may also soon fall victim to
the same deep gashes and dings the find
7a accumulated other than the very
subtle red capacitive buttons the phone
is very stark and bear the front is a
little heavy on the bezels for our
tastes but that's to be expected in the
phone of this caliber we won't dwell too
much on specs other than to say with the
exception of a secondary SIM slot the 8
megapixel camera and a marginally faster
clock speed on a Snapdragon 400 SOC it's
a lot like the Moto G it has 1 gigabyte
of RAM 8 gigabytes of storage and a
2,000 milliamp hour battery though this
one is removable and it has a micro SD
card slot which supports up to 32
gigabytes
however in day-to-day performance we've
noticed some quirks which were annoying
and frustrating for instance every time
we clicked on an app in Google Play
there was a two to four second
hesitation before the application page
would load and the phone wasn't
difficult to overload with tasks either
sometimes even folders on the home
screen would be slow to open and
framerate Jobson scrolling was very
common for the basic end-user just
looking for a smartphone on the cheap
these are things they'll have to deal
with no matter what though we feel these
sort of performance issues were not as
prevalent on other snapdragon 400
powered devices a lot of that likely has
to do with Xiaomi software
which is honestly a hit-or-miss with
most me UI is a widely used rom which
you can download and flash unofficially
of course on a host of different devices
it's unlike most other strains of
Android in that it doesn't have an
application drawer so sort of like on
iOS you're forced to keep every last
application icon on a swath of home
screens even with a little rearranging
ourselves we felt a little overwhelmed
and disorganized but me UI is powered by
deep levels of customization you can
download thousands of customized themes
from the themes app as well as
wallpapers which is great if you're
heavily into tweaking your phones you
why however while some are free many of
these themes are paid since Xiaomi sells
its phones at or near cost this is how
it makes its money through paid themes
apps and services the unfortunate part
is that despite having set the default
language to English much of the UI is
still in Chinese there are still many
Chinese applications on the phone most
of which would send random Chinese
notifications that we couldn't
understand the upshot is that you can
still remove all these Chinese icons if
you want by uninstalling them not simply
hiding or disabling them there are also
some nice touches built into the
software like Do Not Disturb and even a
feature that prevents pocket dialing the
Quick Settings panel is customizable and
so are the capacitive navigation buttons
finally par for the course is the camera
at 8 megapixels most pictures aired on
the cool side and came out bland and
dull and even well lit shots some level
of noise was still visible that said
we've seen flagships that consistently
take worse pictures than this phone so
it could always be worse folks thanks
