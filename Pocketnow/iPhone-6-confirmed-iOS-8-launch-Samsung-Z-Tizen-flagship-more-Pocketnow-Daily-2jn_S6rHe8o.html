surprises even with no hardware Foxconn
has just spilled the beans on the future
of the iphone 6 and Sansa announces its
first tizen phone and it's actually not
that bad I'm hi Mary that I and even
though today is Monday and I can
complain about anything probably the
worst thing today is the fact that I'm
still stuck with a 4-inch display which
I should swap this is parking out daily
today is the official day day and it's
the official day day because everything
is official today Samsung has just
announced the new Z the Samsung Z that's
actually the name it's their first tizen
phone and surprising we thought that
Tizen was going to be more focused on
entry-level markets and cheekbones but
this is actually a four point eight inch
display phone 720p and all the bells and
whistles of a black ship and the design
that actually doesn't look that bad
reminds me of the old blackjack which
was really cool but even cooler is the
fact that you get a fingerprint scanner
you get just about everything you'd get
on a galaxy s5 though this Samsung Z is
focused for Russia and other markets in
Asia for now we'll see how it goes now
if you pop at sams and had a complete
disregard for what people are looking
for in phones and think again the
company has just launched the galaxy w
it is a 7 inch phablet not a tablet a
phablet it is a thing to make phone
calls and it is insanely big and it
follows the same FCC leaks that we saw
recently of the future galaxy mega too
so yes this will be called a galaxy mega
two in the United States because some
occasions aren't that bad the only thing
is that this thing is far beyond big and
that's what she said now for those of
you that are interested in the ax sous
backbone x outside the united states or
in any other carrier that's not a TNT
even though the AT&amp;amp;T customers are still
waiting for the PadFone next to launch
of the united states next four days the
company has just launched the asus
padfone s and it's pretty much the same
tablet the same phone the same
combination of transformation the same
thing you're getting on one product and
the other the only difference is that
you get the bands for a year or as you
don't get the LTE bands for the United
States at least for AT&amp;amp;T though
padfone s is definitely not a bad tablet
it's actually a good product though we
still don't have pricing or availability
stay tuned for that now even though WWDC
2014 happened today there was no
hardware announced though they still
kind of spilled the beans interesting
it's item that Apple was trying to
prevent people from being disappointed
the event for not seeing new hardware
that Foxconn is just published a
statement confirming that it is working
on two new iPhone 6 models a 4.7 inch
model and a 5.5 inch model so for those
of you that are wondering if these
products are real but barks come pretty
much just confirmed then it's something
that Foxconn has never really done so
they are spilling things and we are
having to expect this most likely for
the September launch that we heard
earlier and finally for the very hot
news of the day Apple has just announced
iOS 8 and you would think that even
though this event was only software
related where we saw OS 10 Yosemite plus
iOS 8 you know the changes are quite
significant there are a lot of features
here like for example continuity where
you can start things on your phone and
finish them on your iPad or on your
iPhone and it's just this whole
integration between iOS devices and OS
10 devices that actually makes iOS 8
quite compelling we didn't get health
kit and other different features which
are interesting the list is extremely
long lenses friction for full details on
everything that got launched but that
leaves you to the question of the day
what are your impressions of iOS 8
especially compared to other platforms
like Android or Windows Phone because in
my particular case honestly I feel that
it didn't only you know catch up to
Android is actually leapfrogged and some
things like for example this whole
desktop integration but then again you
know not everything is perfect but sadly
for windows phone is kind of complicated
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think we will have some video
hands on coverage very soon and friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the little earlier before this video is
film achit follow us on talking out
comment subscribe to the channel as well
you'd also follow me on twitter high
mound or shorter iveta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hanging every better thank you
very much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
