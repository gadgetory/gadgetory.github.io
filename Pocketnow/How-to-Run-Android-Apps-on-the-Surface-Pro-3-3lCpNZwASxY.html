the biggest problems I've run into is
application support how do you overcome
that I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is how to run Android apps on
your surface pro 3
Microsoft calls the surface pro 3 the
tablet that can replace your laptop well
that's a pretty broad and lofty
statement it's difficult to deny the
surface pro 3 is one of the most
impressive pieces of hardware to date
the review unit we've been testing holds
roughly the same horsepower as our 2013
MacBook Pro with Retina display yet it's
all crammed into a package not much
larger than an iPad air the problem is
the application support for Windows is
still rather paltry when compared to
other tablet operating systems for
instance both Android and iOS surpassed
1.2 million apps in June roughly half of
those iOS apps are optimized it's not
dedicated to iPad while it's not clear
exactly how many Android apps are tablet
optimized they all run on tablets as of
May there were just over 160,000
applications in the Windows Store for
what it's worth many of those
applications are major titles Evernote
Twitter Facebook Netflix Kindle you know
the essentials but when it comes to
other applications or services you're
left to deal with web clients or legacy
desktop applications fortunately if your
Windows 8.1 and missing some of your
Android apps you're not entirely out of
luck there's a decent solution which
allows you to run Android applications
quite well and I add right on your
surface pro best of all it's entirely
free and it uses your Google account so
all of your previously purchased apps
are available BlueStacks has been around
for some time and the set up is a breeze
from your browser go to BlueStacks comm
and click download app player for
windows click run and allow the program
to download click through the install
menus and wait for the install to finish
this will take around a minute or so to
complete once it does BlueStacks will
run and begin downloaded game data and
initializing when this finishes you will
be taken to the game pop launcher click
on any application icon to begin the
Android setup process you must log into
your Google account to access the Google
Play Store log in again to enable app
sync once you're in Google Play you can
begin to install applications just as
you would on any typical Android device
a word to the wise the game pop launcher
is extremely basic and cumbersome I
would recommend downloading a
third-party launcher like Nova Launcher
or action launcher to get a more
tradition
Android experience also note BlueStacks
uses an older version of Android
it looks like honeycomb or Ice Cream
Sandwich prepare for some stutters and
lag keep in mind though you're not
installing BlueStacks for performance
but for functionality once you download
some truly useful applications like
Google+ Hangouts or if this the net
exactly why BlueStacks is useful becomes
much clearer you can also tap into the
hundreds of thousands of games for
Android best of all you can run the
Android applications in either
fullscreen or floating windows which is
particularly helpful with something like
hangouts Chrome on Windows 8.1 is
admittedly awful using BlueStacks you
can keep your hangouts conversations
open in the background in the desktop
view and quickly jump to them without
having to fool with Chrome or hangouts
