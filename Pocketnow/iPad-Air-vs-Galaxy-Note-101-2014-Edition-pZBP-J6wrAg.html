flagship tablets compare I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
Apple iPad air vs. a samsung galaxy note
10.1 2014 edition the two current tablet
kings Samsung and Apple recently
released their most impressive tablets
yet the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition
and the iPad air we've now reviewed both
tablets and they each received
respectable scores but which is the
better buy is Samsung's productivity and
multitasking focused tablet were capable
or it's Apple's famed content selections
still give the iPad a slight advantage
that's what we're here to find out both
Samsung and Apple took the last year to
redesign their flagship models the
Galaxy Note 10.1 bears a strong
resemblance to its much smaller sibling
the Galaxy Note 3 it features sharp
edges more squared corners and aligned
faux metal trim instead of the faux
brushed metal trim the back side is also
made of a faux leather plastic the iPad
air now supports the same exact design
as the iPad Mini the tapered edges have
been traded for rounded edges for the
chamfered trim along the front it's
prettier slimmer and lighter than all
full-sized iPads before it
speaking of size and weight the physical
footprints of the iPad air and the new
Note 10.1 are remarkably similar the
Galaxy Note 10.1 measures 243
millimeters wide 170 1.4 millimeters
tall and 7.9 millimeters thick the iPad
air is 3.1 millimetres narrower
1.9 millimeters shorter and only 0.4
millimeters thinner the biggest
difference is weight the iPad air and
only one pound is unbelievably
lightweight that's 478 grams to the Note
10.1 is 540 grams the more interesting
part while producing a marginally
smaller and notably more lightweight
device Apple was still able to capture
an in hand feel like no other the Galaxy
Note 10.1 feels nice but not incredible
it still has that hint of a toy-like
field for far less so than previous
models the iPad air is undeniably
Apple's most premium tablet yet looking
inside these tablets the contrasts are
far more obvious the Galaxy Note 10.1
2014 edition
with some monster specifications at
least comparatively the iPad air for
example has 1 gigabyte of RAM the note
10.1 has tripled that both come in
either 16 32 or 64 gigabyte capacities
though the iPad also comes in 128
gigabyte option while the note 10.1 has
a microSD expansion slot for an
additional 64 gigabytes the iPad air has
a 5 megapixel camera while the note 10.1
has an 8 megapixel shooter they also
come with comparable batteries inside
the note 10.1 with a 31 watt hour
battery and the air with a 32 point for
one hour cell and the iPad air comes
with an a7 chipset which is composed of
a quad-core GPU and a dual-core CPU
clocked at 1.4 gigahertz the Exynos 5
octa inside the note 10.1 is composed of
two quad-core CPUs one clocked at 1.9
gigahertz and the other at one point
three and a hexa core GPU finally the
displays at nine point seven inches the
iPad Air's Retina display comes with a
resolution of 2048 by 1536 pixels for a
total density of 264 pixels per inch the
10.1 inch Super Clear LCD on the Note
10.1 bears an even higher resolution
2560 1600 pixels with a density of 299
pixels per inch suffice it to say if
you're having to choose between these
two no matter which you choose you're
gonna walk away
with a beautiful display the Galaxy Note
10.1 spano is a higher resolution and
therefore more crisp and sharp the iPads
smaller and slightly lower res panel is
more true to life and accurate yet both
are comparable in brightness contrast
and viewing angle you can't really go
wrong with either display though we
favor the Note 10.1 to display for one
main reason aspect ratio at 4:3 the
iPads display still isn't perfect for
video playback but that's truly a minor
issue
lest we forget the Note 10.1 comes with
an integrated stylus tucked away in its
upper right corner paired with the Wacom
digitizer is far more accurate and
useful than the run-of-the-mill
capacitive stylus one might use with the
iPad not to mention it comes with its
own software suite frankly both of these
tablets work great hardware and
specifications however we have to give
the hardware and design edge to the iPad
for the far superior build quality and
appearance but know that it's only a
slight edge
we like the note 10.1 display more and
the fact that it comes with an inductive
stylus
software between these two tablets in
particular is a tough subject to tackle
we could talk for days about how poorly
optimized and over encumbered the touch
with software is we can also praise the
amount of content games apps movies and
television music books magazines etc
available to the iPad for hours on end
and to be fair those are very valid
points not to be overlooked the iPad has
a virtually endless supply of content
beautiful content and access to one of
the most expansive digital catalogues
period the tablet app situation on
Android is maturing quite rapidly but
they're still admittedly room for
further growth and improvement but these
are tablets and unlike their smaller
smartphone relatives they have a whole
lot of display real estate to work with
to be blunt the Galaxy Note 10.1 makes
better use of the additional pixels by
allowing multiple applications to run
side-by-side with the multi window
software feature further using the s-pen
and its software suite you can open
multiple floating applications atop the
current running application meaning you
can have a total upwards of 6
applications running at once
theoretically with the iPad sadly you
could not only one application can run
at a time however the iPad uses
multitasking gestures to make switching
between applications quicker and rather
intuitive a four finger swipe upwards
reveals the tasks which are menu four
finger swipes left and right will switch
between recent apps and chronological
order of being opened and a five finger
pinch will bring you back home
sadly while Samsung has gone the extra
mile to make better use of the display
it somehow failed to optimize the
notification shade for additional real
estate both TouchWiz and the iPad
version of iOS 7 are nothing more than
scaled up versions of the software found
on the note 10.1 s and iPad Air's
smaller counterparts the note 3 and the
iPhone yet it's impossible to overlook
the amount of innovation Samsung has
done like it or not things like smart
say smart Paul's smart rotate and smart
scroll allow you to control the tablet
to some extent without ever touching it
and that's really only the beginning of
the Note 10.1 software features for a
more in-depth look at these be sure to
check out our for review of the Galaxy
Note 3 and Note 10.1 on the PocketNow
site it's difficult to call either
tablet a winner here the Note 10.1 is
undeniably more advanced and optimized
for tablet use but it also comes with a
ton of bloat that
many may never take advantage of the
iPad on the other hand is little more
than a scaled-up iPhone yet it comes
with a bevy of applications games and
other content which is beautifully
optimized for the tablet form factor the
ironic part and all this while Samsung
spent its time building tablet software
it clearly through performance to the
wind the Exynos 5 octa chipset is a
powerful combination of CPUs and GPU it
posts numbers and synthetic benchmarks
with some of the best but in real world
performance things aren't so cheery
there are intensive multitasking the
tablet stutters and lags even completely
freezing from time to time and sometimes
something as simple as opening a pin
window and flipping between home screens
is enough to make it drop frame rates
dramatically we've installed the latest
firmware which brought multi-user
support but no notable improvements in
performance the iPad with its seemingly
meager dual-core CPU is a complete
opposite it's always snappy applications
open quickly switching between
applications happens the instant use the
forefinger gesture and it's virtually
impossible to bog this tablet down in
benchmarks both perform well though
we're not typically inclined to believe
the story benchmarks tell since we don't
live in a vacuum
fortunately the note 10.1 is performance
close don't carry over into gaming or
multimedia playback in fact it's
fantastic in that regard as is the iPad
air speaker performance is sort of the
same story the Galaxy Note 10.1 speakers
have a slight advantage in two areas
location and volume they're noticeably
louder than the speakers on the air and
being positioned on opposite ends of the
tablet they provide true stereo sound
the iPad air speakers both found along
the bottom edge only separated by the
Lightning port are not quite as loud yet
provide a more full sound with more
emphasis on the low-end battery life
however is far more comparable between
these tablets at least while in use
during our time with the tablets we were
typically able to last about two days to
a single charge and we were unable to
kill either tablet in a single day no
complaints there that said the iPad air
was particularly great at standby only
dropping 1 to 2% charge over an
eight-hour span over the same length of
time the Note 10.1 typically dropped
anywhere from 10 to 20%
lastly the cameras the note 10.1 may
come with an 8 megapixel camera but out
of the box is set to capture images at 6
megapixels for the 16:9 aspect ratio the
iPad shooter is only 5 megapixels the
note stock camera app comes with quite a
few more software options out of the box
particularly an image stabilization
software for low-light shots and real
time filters frankly none of this
matters 1 these are tablets and they're
not optimal for taking pictures in the
first place
2 the iPads camera is simply put better
in general it provides images with more
contrast better more accurate colors and
more detail the Note 10.1 just as we
found in our review was susceptible to
blurry images thanks to a slight shutter
lag if you need a better camera in your
tablet for whatever reason the iPad is
the winner here but not by a lot a
smartphone will ultimately take better
pictures and just about any scenario
what it boils down to is the iPad is a
far more well-rounded tablet Samsung has
come a very very long way in the past
year and the Note 10.1 2014 edition is
evidence of just that it's an impressive
leap for Samsung and has us hopeful for
the future of Galaxy Note tablets but
the Note 10.1 is unmistakably poorly
optimized the Exynos 5 octa chip is
problematic and we can't help but feel
it would be a different story if Samsung
opted for Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 chip
in this Wi-Fi model over its in-house
brand but that's not the case and once
again Apple walks away the victor in the
tablet space at least in terms of the
final product it's lighter thinner
faster more reliable and performs
incredibly that said we'd like to see
Apple adopt some more tablet friendly
software maybe true multitasking in a
not too distant future that's gonna wrap
