the crazy to bring you some of the best
coverage on the internet after filling
over 30 videos we wanted to give you an
inside look at what really happened this
year at CES to make all of this possible
for you this is pocketnow insider the
biggest consumer electronic show happens
in Las Vegas every year and is attended
by thousands of exhibitors and literally
hundreds of thousands of pressed
analysts and other attendees the show is
spread out not only across the massive
multi-building Las Vegas Convention
Center but also throughout various
hotels and casinos in Las Vegas getting
a round requires a tremendous amount of
walking and waiting in taxi and shuttle
lines in fact on the peak day Tuesday we
probably walked about 20 miles each
that's right this year we rented a car
which gave us back many hours that would
be typically spent waiting in long lines
for CES 2013 we have three people from
the pocket now staff a tent it was me
Michael Fisher and Jaime Rivera three is
the perfect number because while to like
me and Michael could be a filming video
the other hi mate could be back at the
press room rendering and uploading video
speaking of rendering and uploading
video the right tools do the job right
this year we were equipped with a
15-inch macbook pro with retina display
an elgato hardware accelerator and
internet tethering on all four carriers
but unfortunately the tethering didn't
work because all carriers throttle
bandwidth our only option was to rely on
the ethernet connection found in the
press rooms which are found in each
Convention Center building and are often
packed with literally hundreds of
members of the press for us CBS took
place over three days we all arrived in
vegas on sunday we stayed at the logs or
which is relatively close to the
convention center nothing much happened
on sunday but it was a good time for me
and jaime and michael to hang out a
little bit before the wave of work hit
us then monday was Preston the day we're
all companies made their big
announcements
we had to be choosy about which events
we wanted to attend since there were
only three of us we started off with the
AT&amp;amp;T developer event in the morning then
we went to Samsung in Halawa in the
afternoon the Samsung event had a
massive attendance with a line forming
outside of the door for hours before the
event in fact I waited in line to keep
our place while Jaime and Michael went
to hawawa but all samsung had to
announce were some televisions and a
washer dryer that lets you look at your
twitter feed seriously later that day we
went to the Sony event where we finally
got to see some new hardware with the
Xperia Z and the Xperia ZL then Tuesday
was the real day of work we set a goal
of recording 30 to 40 videos and Tuesday
was the day to do it we started off the
day by going to proofs of major
companies like Samsung verizon an Intel
to see what they had the show then we
hit the second-tier companies like ZTE
and Huawei finally we hit third tier
players of which there were tons that
had a product to show but a smaller
stand to show it in we found some really
cool diamonds in the rough like a
company called noite working on some
truly innovative Android hardware and a
company called Open Mobile which is
working on getting android apps to run
on non Android platforms pretty cool for
all these new platforms that are coming
around we also had a meeting at the Chi
booth where we got a look at the future
of wireless charging cool stuff and of
course interspersed with several
meetings with various hardware companies
a handful of booths tours and even some
time to do an on-location podcast from
the hotel room which was a lot of fun so
CES is fun it's interesting but it's a
hell of a lot of work but we enjoy it
and most of all we love bringing it to
you so we really hope you enjoyed our
coverage if you want to see all of our
CVS videos

the stuff we recorded be sure to
