talking about the iPhone 10's just yet
in fact there are a few more things that
we can learn from Apple and that we need
to think about today before you your
friends or your family go out buying
stuff this holiday season and we've got
the best effing team in mobile tech to
basically think about it we're gonna
talk to I think that's a pretty call for
thing here hello and welcome to episode
three to two of the weekly brought to
you by pocket now and xda-developers on
Wednesday the 12th of September 2018
from iPhones to Apple watches and not
iPads or Macs or other things that got
the shaft from all the rumors this week
let's get talking em news editor Jules
Wong substituting for Joshua of regard
today howdy to y'all
joining in today is a veritable team of
excellence in mobile tech bored at work
it's the lightning in our coffee breaks
it's thunder II and among air today I'm
gonna steal trope for a second here from
NPR and Sam Sanders what are the three
words that you you're feeling after this
event same expensive and ripoff really
oh that is a very sharp take right at
the top and hot flying in and I feel
like we're gonna have a fun time talking
about this we welcome a new guest also
to our show a mobile tech sojourner
across the youtubes but these days he's
working with unique digital assets to
make a card game he is mark burst diner
hello to you and what are your three
words greening screenings I think I
think I saw the entire thing I think the
three words are big iterative health big
iterative help I health is a very
iterative thing for all of us here but
especially for Apple when it talks about
its electrocardiograms and whatnot I
guess well I'm gonna tell you my three
words after I should note that both
Jaime and Brandon are also out of the
office today but if you want to see
Jaime and Joshua Joshua and around there
to be on a special episode of the weekly
coming up this Friday will tell you more
about that at the end of the show in the
meantime I feel like my three words are
tik-tok yeah that's it like this is the
S alright I only needed two but hey like
that is this I mean we're talking about
s here we're talking about and are here
which I like it's the letter before s
and I'm not sure how much of that
relates to what the whole scheme of the
release cycle is for these three iPhones
here but um I guess we should start off
with the thing that came in
chronological order for this keynote and
that would be the Apple watch series for
obviously as you have a alluded to mark
big upgrades in terms of health I want
to get the visual up though on our
YouTube page here and that is with them
well you see here this watch face on the
new watch OS 5 that they're teasing is a
it's a little much don't you think
I'm into it I I mean anybody who's seen
anything I've ever said about
information and the density of which its
presented knows I love me some very high
density stuff high density high part
year just yeah I want to see a
helicopter I'm a helicopter thinker it's
hard for me to think about my sneakers
man what shirt I'm wearing for the day
you know so looking looking at my watch
seen quite this much data that like
that's exactly what I wanted so for me
aside from the the health stuff I really
think that the Apple watch is finally
something that I want and that watch
face is not nothing to do with it so
technically I believe we have 11 pieces
of information here so inside so we have
this analog clock dealing with that and
then we have in the four cardinal
quadrants within the clock for
complications in the corners four of
them we have four extra complications
and then you have calendar reminders and
just
general notifications that pier in the
rims of the clock when they are needed
what do you think of this Anna bond is
this a little too much or is this just
right having complications on a
SmartWatch is or a watch isn't to me
it's fine I mean you've got some really
good timepieces to have so many
complications on there so that is all
great and dandy I don't like the design
of Apple watch and never have I'm gonna
come from the negative aspect of this
because I am tired of seeing the
rectangular watch that to me is too
small for me I have a big wrist so I
need lanista 46 or 44 for me just
doesn't fit and also again I think
design wise I always sees the same I see
more complications I'm happy with that I
do agree the more information needs to
know at the glance the better what it's
the same watch in my mind I thought we
were gonna have a harder time with
software on this but yeah like you have
a follow-up on that Marc I just say I
think it's the really great example of
that second word iterative it this is an
iteration and Apple for a long long time
since the iPad came out in 2009 has been
the name of the game it iterative work
evolution not revolution has been the
name of the game since about 2009 and
this is this is that to a tee you know
this is a huge opportunity Capital
capitalize on the market that Google has
been losing over the last two years with
with such a stagnant set of releases on
where OS we only just got a reasonable
update and it was a little more than a
facelift so this this for me I'm an
Android user through and through but
it's the first time I actually find
myself wanting an Apple watch it's a
little bit bigger better under the hood
and it's it's a lot of the things that
I've been looking for from a wearable
bigger and better interesting especially
as the harwood slims down we just
mentioned that 42 millimeter and 46
millimeter sizes they've actually
shrunken down by two millimeters apiece
so yeah and not great for the heftier of
us I shall say me included but also just
expanding on that screen with closer to
edge to edge kind of meeting up and I
know that they make it seem a little bit
more immersive than it might or might
not be but we all have not had that
to go hands-on with this thing yet what
they have done though in this iteration
is kind of shaking some waves up in the
health side of things
they have a new electrode I believe or
array of electrodes within either I
think it's both the backside where the
optical heart rate monitor is as well as
the digital crown that you use to scroll
through whatever interface that you're
dealing with and together that makes an
electrocardiogram which is both endorsed
by the American Heart Association and
approved by the FDA so um I know well
perhaps you might be the best one to
talk about this mark but um what do you
think about just being active in how the
Apple watch is able to perhaps better
accompany or associate that with its
mission well Apple has been for last
five six years or so really pushing
health when health kick came out I did
not expect that to be quite such a long
tail for them and it really has been the
the EKG that they've gotten this device
is also like you said approved by by the
FDA and I believe it was something like
six years ago or so that Samsung first
showed off technology capable of
something like this for the gear series
but they haven't taken it to market yet
apples being here it has been surprising
to talk about I mean we've heard rumors
of diabetic tracking in wearables and
just Apple getting into more of the
health devices industries these days
what do you think of this next step
forward and a bomb I mean I do like it I
do like the fact that uh
beedo that supports it I still have to
test it and see we have to see if it
works because just because it's endorsed
by the FDA doesn't mean it's actually
good really doesn't mean that it just
means that at least to what they test it
is but the thing I don't like and I
actually teach this in the tweet I said
it's all great and Andy to have an EKG
on there
my biggest problem again I'm gonna sound
negative is the battery life 20 full day
app battery life is terror
as far as I'm concerned because if I
forget to charge it if I trip and fall
and I have a heart attack it will not
detect my fall and I would be broke
because that is when one of the features
is that new fall detection thanks to new
iris coups and accelerometers but I mean
again you make that point it matters if
the battery is actually you know active
and actually somewhat fall exactly
because because my thing is how much
battery life am I going to lose running
that EKG we all we do know right now
that's you know on an Apple watch if you
go for a run you might as well just
charge that thing right after because
yeah you're pretty much done with it so
if you go for a run and you use any of
the other health features your watch is
pretty much done for the day
that means it's off your wrist which
means you can't do the things you want
to do so as as great as it is it to me
doesn't do anything if I cannot extend
that battery life long enough for me to
use the features more than once per day
it is undeniable that Apple has a hold
of the not just the watch in a
SmartWatch industry but the watch
industry in general they are
best-selling in all of those categories
so but I mean series four we I mean
we've introduced cellular connectivity
in Series three and it's been carried
over here swen proof is here but we seem
to still have this trouble of dealing of
smartwatches either as an accessory or
as a fitness partner Fitbit is trying to
grow into its rules here in a somewhat
awkward way although they do have them
as according to the latest market share
reports have had some progress lately so
um where do you think this move takes
Apple or it takes the SmartWater takes
anything in that general realm I think
it's really fascinating right I think
one of the one of the things that Apple
has shown that they're pretty
consistently good at is connecting with
that human side of their their their
audience their cost
your base and you can see a lot in the
design direction they've been moving
towards since iOS flattened out that
they're they're trying to set up it I
think T up to become the the ubiquitous
user interface the the thing that might
run under the hood of the OS is in her
right there they're building and
designing these platforms to seamlessly
integrate into your life and that's why
I think health is such a huge portion of
this for them that's their foot in the
door they're doing it better than
anybody else's right now except from
maybe Samsung but the people who trust
Apple with that data are gonna trust
that trust that data with their doctor
and I think this is the first step
towards this like really unified look
and feel in terms of the UI across
multiple devices that Google's been
trying for for a very long time for
years we said can Apple get better at
design faster than excuse me can a Polly
at systems faster than Google can get
better at service at design and now
we're sort of we sort of made it see I
disagree I think that Apple has I mean
to be honest and fair this will sell to
every single Apple customer right and
nice that's that's the market but that's
it that's why it stops and that is still
let's call it Nestle to be fair let's
call it 50 percent of the market even if
right the problem I see here is that
granted the I love the innovation they
pushed I love the fact that they
throwing all these things in you see
you've got EKGs you've got just trip
detection and falling let me joke about
it but that's still a nice feature
especially for someone who's older we've
got all these features built in but when
you add in the other compliment of fact
that it will not last longer than a day
it's stuck in an ecosystem that is not
your big tour so across the board it is
a closed wall garden
it doesn't reinvest I see Fitbit as the
company who can now granted they still
have things that they because of that
new acquisition they have to merge to
get properly but you know one of the
things that
one of my buddies who I usually talk
about this with a mount show is like
smartwatches are dead they truly are
fitness lifestyle is where it is which
is why I a policeman you so much time on
health than the SmartWatch itself and
that's what Fitbit does better than both
of them as much as Apple watch can give
you those if you use a Fitbit you're
getting days you'll get team all the
things you need just not a lot of these
Smart Watch complications in there now
can they get that better than Android
now Android now has new life with the
Snapdragon wear 3100 which brings in
some specific features like for instance
the you know the sports mode which
allows you to workout for 15 hours and I
think it dents like 10 percent of your
battery so that again adds to what can
you know Google or an adidas or
something I got doing that ecosystem but
I think Fitbit is but I like what at
least Apple is pushing the industry to
say you have to show up you have to
actually do something to compete with us
here because they will always own their
own wall garden no matter what yeah yeah
indeed as far as I can contribute to you
with a conversation about that
electrocardiogram data they're gonna say
that customers are able to stream their
data to the cloud I'm not sure whether
it's just going to be iCloud or if third
party solution in any case yeah it's
it's kind of weird to think about that
and but and it's sort of lessons the
will over your will over what you can do
with that data so it's kind of
interesting to see how that gets handled
and also if it does if Apple really
decides to be severing which I don't
think they'll do necessarily and just
limit it to iCloud that's trying that's
that's an ecosystem that you have to get
into if you're not part of it already so
they're trying to expand the base appeal
with these features like trip protection
for perhaps the elderly or just
electrocardiograms in general but again
if you're coming from Android it's gotta
be a little bit harder I thanks but I'll
have to see some comments from YouTube
going up just now
Alexander Briggs says
assure that the Apple watch for is the
only worthwhile product from this event
and many others a rust Fortin all
smartwatches battery life is a joke
that's why I got a versa Fitbit so I
will shout out to them over there it's
coming yeah got galaxy watch four days I
have done four days oxley watch four
days huh three times working out three
days in those four days Wow whoo so
there's a smokin right there and there
that Samsung and I did I did my stress
this also as well as external space
knows the new specialized Exodus ship
special okay
okay I see well yeah lots to test and
and we're gonna have a lot more
SmartWatch talk on that Friday show
because we actually recorded that over
in San Francisco at the event were you
part of that because I have not I was
not there and I have no idea what Joshua
recorded
oh and no I wasn't I had to catch a
flight back darkness unfortunately but
hey we'll get to see it on Friday so
let's stick around for that and stick
around for more talk about the iPhone
10s we have a whole bunch of specs
though we're gonna dig through I mean
it's not as if there's too much of a
difference between the iPhone 10 or the
iPhone X and the iPhone XS I think if
there's if there's anything that we have
in excess of is talk about speed I mean
we're talking about faster selfie
cameras are faster true depth the face
ID authentication with and these new
fast sensors faster these cores that are
in the Apple a 12 Bionic processor with
18 cores for general computing graphics
and neuro processing and all these
numbers and it's also the first seven
nanometer
commercial product to go out to users
we're talking about wider color gamut
for
the display and the camera so I think
that is something that maybe should be
appreciated in terms of the anyone who
uses Instagram I would assume but then
again it's only he goes only so far as
safe its REC 2020 or no because I don't
believe they mentioned any standards or
Gavin yes their dependents I mean it's
kind of weird
yeah the LG in the galaxy were twenty
twenty last year so which is industry
standard for HDR if you want to call it
that so I was I was listening out for
any I'm like you know DCI p3 or anything
like that
none yeah yeah this is definitely it's I
mean it's a it's an S year right so the
main thing the main takeaways for me are
a water resistance that's pretty big and
B this is the the waving goodbye to the
old iPhone model iPhone 8 bye bye bye
iPhone e by traditional you know this is
like goodbye to the headphone jack the
iPhones Fitness this is a sad day for me
as you can see a headphone wall behind
me so I'm I'm crying inside just I I
hear you man I think this is this is a
pretty big move you know they put out
the 10 they said hey can you handle this
notch and people said yes we'd love it
we'll take as many notches as you got
and this is where all that phones look
like now see ya
go ahead it's gonna be interesting to
see how the have those people who love
the knotch see the s10 next year which
is rumored to have no notch yeah oh and
then granted opposed the first company
but gowing the Samsung will be the one
to bring the mainstream and then you
know I wonder what the kind of ads would
be like that for next year from Samsung
just just a thought yeah especially it
was of the same components except for
that optical camera that is really going
to just drive everything here
and one of the things that you mentioned
about everything like you know you know
asking the users if they accepted the
knotch
I could say the same thing about pricing
here because yeah good points like they
made the comparison instead of just the
iPhone 8 it was the iPhone 8 plus which
started at 7:49 well they decided to
start the iPhone 10 our which we'll get
to in just a few minutes at some point 9
and then starts this the iPhone 10s and
999 and 1099 for this new Big Macs I'm
still not comfortable if max I'm sorry
III don't get the name I'm just I mean
it's sort of been just nice I understand
what the max is in terms of pricing i I
mean I dare not say it's not worth it
because I haven't actually touched the
device so I wouldn't go there but I
would say this it makes anyone who
complained about the Galaxy Note 9 you
have to rethink that because on paper
just on paper alone the note 9 gives you
more just on paper then what your hands
on the max is it the 512
I think that's 1250 and with this
starting at 64 gigs for $9.99 and then
you have to have that 256 intermediate
step I'm wondering where these steps are
going because I haven't seen a step
pricing for bigger memory sizes I can go
into pricing right now just say if you
feel yeah sure so select the max 6.5
inches i will go it's t-mobile just for
the heck of it just for the world cool
so we're looking at a thousand 99 for 64
gigabytes 256 gigabytes is a thousand
two hundred forty nine which is the same
price as the 512 Galaxy Note 9 and for
that lovely 512 you're looking at a
thousand four hundred and forty nine
dollars delicious Wow delicious today
they just went all they went they went
for it they made it gold this year
they had to gild the experience like
these these prices are
Wacka doodle but this is the
top-of-the-line flagship product the
only thing that gives me a little bit I
don't want to say hope but a lot of the
the sustainability initiatives do sound
really cool and I don't know if that's
maybe a nod to planned obsolescence
maybe becoming something they're gonna
try and take a look at in saying that
they want to make these devices last as
long as possible because that is the
only thing that I can see making a
difference in terms of pricing as we
move into this like the decade of the
thousand dollar smartphone is if
smartphones stop being something that we
buy every single year I mean oh you know
that's not true it's ok you can dream
but it's like yeah I'm look I'm a
dreamer I'm a dreamer it's okay I got
you gotta own it but if if that's the
only thing that I can I can see is
justifying a price tag like that if I'm
paying a grand plus for a mobile device
two year minimum three four years should
be like the the standard oh no I I do
agree I mean I would have been fine if
he said because of the recycling and
some of the costs for that that's why
this device is priced that way and
you're looking to keep it that way again
as you add it with sustainability that's
true but they didn't mention that and
again even if they were to use that
excuse that's me is impossible because
they have enough market power to tell
their recyclers that we're paying this
amount for it because the you know
trillion dollar company so they can I
just look at any being that they they
look they started the the pricing war
and a thousand they wanted to keep that
premium Samsung went to a thousand and
Samsung at least in my mind justified
some of its pricing for a thousand
because they wanted to separate that
from the S line and then now they have
to separate that with the max and say
well for the max you have to do this so
it's this escalating price wars that
keep going up and down that I think it's
not necessary but you know it's
something that you know has to happen if
you're going to be this market so it
looks like we lost Jules there yeah it
looks like we did it looks like the
pricing pricing is just gonna keep
creeping up creepin creepin creepin
creepin as long as we start to see some
stuff fall in line with that I'm
okay with it the the X are on the other
hand I'm not sure where this lands who's
who was this phone for she has at 750
bucks like is that is that really gonna
be my choice well especially considering
that well how much of a watering down do
you think it is compared to the iPhone
ex-tennis not other than wireless
charging which I don't think is included
it's one on dust resistance right and it
doesn't have an OLED display that's it I
don't have to go back into the other
camera module on the back yes miss the
second camera module yeah but that
that's so you missing three things one
of them is wireless charging one of them
is an OLED display and one of them is
the second camera module that's pretty
much where it is but to me this is where
I think Apple miss this the somebody
stated one of my chats the Apple misstep
in the pricing I think that's very true
because I would have loved to see this
at even a 700 which is still too high
but if it was a 650 700 that I think
would be more palpable to a lot of
people it's not gonna be found on our
device because I know it won't go there
but a 650 700 s 700 even would put
Samsung in the range of like whoo the S
line feels danger at this point right we
know right now Samsung can tomorrow drop
the S to 600 and say here's a you know a
BOGO sale and you can get it does
everything this phone does and wait you
know in spades
with an AMOLED display mind you like
absolutely I completely agree I think if
this were 50 bucks cheaper we'd have a
really grand a grand slam on our hands
because the truth is this is our this is
our base iPhone model next year is the
the iPhone 10 our that's what we're
gonna see next year we won't see another
another base you know iPhone 8 aluminum
chassis model yeah yeah this is kind of
like last hurrah for this aluminum kind
of yeah well I think I think it's got to
be it's gotta be just 50 bucks cheaper
would really set it apart from the 5c
for example
I made a mistake being corrected here in
the chat yeah people thank you the XR
does have wireless charging thank you
very much as there is just a few simmers
Wells blue 25.0 Jason so then it's just
a display and the second camera module
yeah yeah
IP 67 so an hour in that meter water
immersion thing as if there's a whole
bunch of things but overall you're
getting I mean you mentioned the
disparities between LCD and OLED I mean
how far does the quote-unquote best LCD
compared to maybe perhaps the worst oh
well you can't compare the best display
is the Galaxy Note night I mean although
they say the so many display is is
slightly better but at least we can take
the note 9 as a devices and that's what
the iPhone 10s is going against so yeah
that's that's the fact of things oh well
I mean I mean it's gonna be interesting
to see how everything gets pitted up
against each other we're gonna get to
some more comments in just a few minutes
but we will be taking a break here and
we'll be right back so hang on this

reading I need a break so um let's let's
figure out how we want to frame this
conversation moving forward here because
heaven knows that everyone's going to be
waiting for those couple of days
pre-order starts for the iPhone 10s and
the Apple watches on Friday and then
later on in a month later it's gonna be
those iPhone 10 are fans which by the
way analysts a lot of analyst may cheek
whoa beloved Apple analyst at TF
International Securities these days has
said that I found 10 are at least you
know back when it was called you know
all these various things the LCD iPhone
10 see other things but that is gonna be
the breadwinner for
with about a two-to-one share in terms
of sales for the 10r compared to you
both the tennis and tennis max combined
how do you see things playing out in the
real world given that we've already had
a year for iPhone 10 and even though Tim
Cook has said time and time again that
it's the best-selling iPhone that there
is how do you see things going out let's
start with you out of all this time the
10 hour will be the breadwinner it makes
the most amount of sense you're spending
less to buy either last year's phone or
this year's phone if you think about it
right
at 7:49 getting an iPhone 8 + doesn't
make sense
getting knife on 7 doesn't make sense if
you're gonna get a brand new iPhone that
is the iPhones again and since there is
no success to me I I believe the 6s is
the highest selling iPhone by quantity
they don't tell us quantity doesn't
matter but profitability because that's
the Indian market and also the sigh
phone the had the headphone jack but I
think the 10 are fitting well because of
its price point because I mean even when
I do my comparison I most likely will
pick the 10 hour now I haven't touched
both devices but just mathematically
looking at it they both they have
wireless charging it's got water
resistance it will have a decent camera
probably not as good as the 10 Mac's or
the 10s Mac's or 10s but I think it has
all the things that most users on the
iPhone side will need to actually get
through the day the only thing is of
course how the battery life compares to
either the 10s or the 10s max but then
again I from agrilife has not been a
good thing so a lot of that will have to
be tested through editorial processes
from many many sites so we'll have to
see about that but what do you think
then what's a 10,000 foot view mark the
ten thousands of you is amusingly in the
context of you know a conversation at
lunch I like to I like to take the
approach of like you know I went to
lunch with a buddy in New York
and they're like hey what phone should I
get should I get this one hey the new
from new iPhone came out should I get it
and the answer this time is I don't
think so
there have been one or two s years that
I said okay yeah pick up pick up the S
line this year it's worth the pick up I
think the success with the first 3d
touch screen on it I said the same thing
that year but this year I think it's a
more of a wait-and-see wait for the cost
to come down it's it's an iterative year
for Apple you know big iterative and
health a bigger display I think is
really really cool
edge to edge makes the thing feel a lot
smaller in your hand even though it's
about the same size as the A+ that edge
really does make a difference but I
don't think we're seeing a lot of and
any paradigm shift here at all there's
no the only needle I see moving is is in
the health arena and that's been a long
tail thing for Apple for the past few
years so hold off on it is my takeaway
for for today one of the negative
paradigm shifts that some people might
be clawing at here
Siddharth SID in the youtube comment
what's the need for the iPhone 10 are I
still prefer a favorite scanner over
face ID and with this latest generation
that's all gone no fingers left
apparently and with recent quo analyst
quo has also said that he doesn't see
Apple adopting anything from in-display
fingerprint sensors or the like anytime
soon so why and also you know this at
all going to is Apple going to be able
to wield its weight on this well I think
if I do answer that it's very simple
right now the rumors are pointing that
the best in display fingerprint scanners
which will be coming on the S 10 are
coming from Apple's hated friend
Qualcomm so you can count that out at
least for now until this that that whole
beef gets squashed but the other aspect
to is that Apple has really pushed the
face ID and I think it all depends on
what the realization come next year if
is where you know Samsung can say hey
why do you have to do this when you
don't have to look here for and then
just do
this you know you can just press and
you're good but Apple can build this
wait I think they can build a way to say
this is what works because it's actually
face ideas worked pretty well I think
across the board where in terms of
people cracking it we haven't really
heard much of people cheating the system
you know in many ways I think they've
been a few but it's taking a lot to
actually do that so I think they can
hold their weight till that until maybe
the market looks at again says in
display fingerprint sensors are just
much better because I don't have to look
at my phone that's just a difference I
guess where the argument that I'm
surprised has not been brought up is a
screen crackage and how that affects
like the usage experience for
fingerprint sensors in the display that
might be a thing it depends on if the
display glass itself is actually chipped
or if there's a risk of an injury injury
at all to that but I think maybe the
risk of injury might be one but I think
because the glass itself the surface
glass has nothing to do with the tech
because it's mostly I think it's
ultrasonic so basically right now it's a
lot of them or optical sensors yeah I
mean the the Qualcomm one is ultrasonic
so yeah it just basically is passing
through the glass and even if there's a
crack it wouldn't matter for that so I
think that's why but again again you
know we we may have issues but I think
it's just the way general public accepts
all of these technology if it works once
and if we crack a screen usually just go
replace it anyway hmm hmm interesting a
lot of talk also in the chat just
general Samsung war going on in there
but a lot of other people are looking
forward to the pixel 3 and the mate 20
from Huawei and Google inversely
respectively I guess you could say in
that sense structure what do you see in
the iPhone 10s in particular that might
be able to hold up or surpass or do
worse against the future competition
mark
I think apples I mean it's it's the
Apple mo right apples good at a lot of
things one of those things is shipping
really killer hardware that's never been
for discussion I think that the pixel
three is gonna be some okay hardware
with a really stellar software
experience and another stellar camera I
I struggle with a lot of Huawei stuff
especially these days especially how the
after markets been treated in the last
month or so but the the the comparison
between iPhone and Android doesn't go
away and I don't think that a big
beautiful AMOLED display and the handful
of new things that we're getting in an
iPhone this year are gonna be enough to
pull someone who maybe is on the fence
on Android maybe they've been on and
over the last four years five years of
looking for something new maybe they had
an iPhone back in the day and they're
looking to try it on again this isn't
gonna be the generation that's gonna
pull you back a lot of the things that
that we're getting in this device we've
had across the Android spectrum for the
last few years anyway so I think if
you're someone who's on a fence I think
you're far more likely to fall on the
Android side after this announcement
than you were two weeks ago interesting
interesting and you know not all you
know not the bulk of sales for iPhones
does happen in the first quarter that it
is available so the holiday season but
it's not you know and it none not all
those sales are coming from you know the
pre-orders most of them are coming in
the months of October late October or
November so you have time to consider
your options in the market and you know
mid perhaps get one that may be right
for you
and I'm trying to hold out as long as
possible because I really want to see
what a dabangg has in terms of
deliveries he just got doorbells so I'm
hoping that perhaps he got an iPhone
maybe an iPhone 10s that would be
exciting that would be very exciting
he gave me broke a few embargoes to get
huh oh geez don't worry I mean we
shouldn't say that out loud it shouldn't
blow up his spot but yeah I I don't see
I don't see why as an Android user if
I'm really considering a switch there's
there's anything here that really
pulling me forward I think one of the
things that really sort of did not sit
well with me was you know a lot of the
games showcase in AR showcases like
they've been advertising and showing off
the the same exact AR features for the
last three years now
like we've we've seen the shared AR
experience like okay cool like it was
cool the first time but now we're just
watching a bunch of people playing on
stage and it's not really providing any
new experiences then that we hadn't seen
from three years ago
AR it's just one of those things that I
don't think is ever gonna really finally
make it until it becomes a reduction of
VR when VR finally takes off well I mean
in terms of gaming I think Apple might
be right in terms of treating it as part
of a console I mean iOS home to a lot of
many polish games out there but you know
for them it's also it also kind of acts
as a new season of games and you know
and being able to announce new titles
taking advantage of new technologies
such as the power reduction require
power requirements reduction and
coromandel and all that going on so I
mean what do you think about that as
kind of a platform against the likes of
Nintendo or Xbox or Sony oh I love that
conversation III think that's I mean I'm
an old-school game video game magazine
reader like I go to the grocery store
with my mom and like go and read egm and
GamePro and all that stuff and I
remember the ads or the the articles the
op-eds about out you know apples gonna
make a gaming console they're gonna make
a portable console and this was in like
2002 or something like that 2003 and lo
and behold we got one it's just called
an iPhone it's a lot of different things
in the mine you know I think that the
the iPhone has been a in general a force
for good for gaming it's really
democratized the platform more than it
was before but I think it was also the
the foot-in-the-door that enabled the
free-to-play plague that we've seen only
get exacerbated overhead net purchases
the the scourge of the devil and all
that exactly like I'm all about
supporting a developer but predatory and
psychological practices that make you
feel addicted are you know there
wouldn't be possible were it not for
this magic spacefaring computer in our
pockets any final thoughts on all this
as we head into another review session
another sales season another just
amazing kind of road ahead start with
you mark okay sure sure I was about to
get well if he was feeling that strongly
I was gonna finish with that you know
storm of no I was gonna I was going to
just say that it's interesting to see
what apples line up because we have a
very heavy October coming up we've got
announcements from Google we've got
Huawei we've got no care coming up we've
got LG still and then we even
Microsoft's announcement might be a head
turner nothing's gonna be a phone but
it's good to you it might disrupt the
market and is this enough because
because one of my problems with Apple is
not the fact that they're not profitable
or you know the the can't sell iPhones
they don't make devices or it's not nice
is that can they move away from just its
ecosystem because right now every time I
see an iPhone I go if you're an iOS user
sure it doesn't tell the Android user oh
I like that I'm all saying you have to
buy but does it really even attract the
Android user to say wow that is really
cool and that's my biggest problem with
them and I think they will continually
do well within the ecosystem and the
last thing I'll mention is Apple says no
more free dongles with the iPhone for
your headphone jack so just
well I mean I what I see looking ahead
is I tend to agree with that a lot more
status quo but I think I think apples
been head down I think they're gonna be
head down for a little while they had
about five years of Steve Jobs ideas in
the hopper after he passed away and
they're they're scraping the bottom of
that barrel and I think that they've got
their eyes on the puck about eight to
ten years from now again in terms of
health as some of those big three words
they see where the puck is going I think
that they're trying to distill the
digital experience down to the single
most important thing that a human will
need to trust technology with and I
think that a lot of the moves that
they're making today seeing tone-deaf
and seem like they're not really
reacting to what the market is telling
them I think that's because they have
zoomed out so far so as to ensure that
they've got a lot more in the hopper
from this generation of Apple so that
when there's another you know succession
another passing of the baton they've got
a really good solid backlog of stuff to
work from yeah I definitely agree that
they're doing what they need to do in
order to keep that self-sustaining
machine sustained so that's going to be
interesting to see how far they develop
because again we haven't heard of all
the other developments which you know we
might hope for an October event this
which we're gonna have to cover two
hours the keynotes for Macs and Mac
minis them and the air powered wireless
charging pad which yeah it's not coming
let's move on I mean got it on well what
is what is so special about this I mean
it's it's just a multiple device
wireless charging pad which there you
can buy this right now ight yeah I think
I think what would what would be special
about it is if they develop some sort of
technology that actually had them both
charging the same loop as opposed to
separate coils if they were able to get
closer to something like Tesla s
technology that allows you know for a
field of charging around a particular
device that's the only thing that would
get me stoked about it that's the only
real good reason I can think they delay
it
I think the newer Apple that's more
willing to look at the data instead of
years it's not even the fast wireless
charger anyway so it really doesn't
matter it's slow one I'm ok with slow if
if we're getting if we're going wider
rather than deeper as long as there's
the field I mean I mean if they if Apple
decides to acquire energies which is
working on that technology and then
perhaps they may be in the ball game but
they don't and the device would be
cancelled or they would just keep quiet
until the iPhone 11 next year I found 13
or whatever number they will call it but
I think I think you know the pad is I
think is maybe I guess it's just a lot
of us have just hooked on the fact that
Apple is finally jumped a wireless
charging and they're making this but
again as someone who's been a wireless
tracking since the The New Yorker 9:20 I
don't care like that's just how I look
at it because it's not new it's old tech
as far as I see so unless there's
something really brand new I'm sorry I
know I am any of this I started with a
downer I think I think you know I wish
we were able to provide a little bit
more balance in terms of how you know
Apple might have been able to succeed or
at least they might be able to you know
carve a victory already in this panel
like it feels to feel so it's like we're
a bunch of Android ki so like I really
but I really do want to be able to
provide some alternative to that because
the fact of the matter is is that
Apple's the omnipresent presence it is
that you and in our tech industry their
trillion dollar company and they have
been able to make their earnings from
producing a product that millions and
millions and millions have wanted
desired aspire to and have owned so yeah
this year might not be it's also
important to know that especially as we
we move with the national conversation
global conversation really about privacy
and data data rights
I think the will see Arab
largest change in the next two to three
years in the way that people perceive
the way that their data is being used
and Apple is sitting real pretty on that
front Apple might you know for the
clothes garden call it whatever you will
it is that's exactly what it is but they
don't sell your data I would I would
disagree my iCloud was hacked two months
ago so as far as sell your data it just
means they have terrible security and
security if your if your icon got hacked
or fished I'm sorry that's user error
selling data and when folks when folks
talk about putting important things like
health data online that's that is one of
the most important things to our
livelihoods and Apple is one of the few
major the tech titans that does not sell
your data I don't know I I agree they
don't sell my data but then again I
don't put any of my opponent data online
that's just we have always what it's
fine and dandy but I am still surprised
that the me icon I mean I got a call
from Apple saying please change your
iCloud and I know like some of people
who did who are like because we've got a
breach of some sort and I was like again
I mean iPod is just terrible so it
doesn't give me confidence that you're
stating that I should put anything up
there on iCloud because right that I
will get that call again if I know like
I mean right now I'm actually more
confident as much as bad as it may sound
I'm more confident that Google is going
to sell the data because I know they
will sell the data I actually you know
that I I know they will sell I know
Facebook will sell that data and that's
fine because I've I've decided that
we'll be sold but when I know that Apple
is not selling it and then they lose it
to me that's the problem and they have
not addressed iCloud which is the
biggest thing in my mind I mean with all
this health stuff we're talking about
Apple has no sat down and said this is
how we improve security on our devices I
disagree I think they've talked a lot
about how and and encryption works and
and helped in helping the user educate
themselves and the the I have two factor
authentication on my stuff and I still
go I'm just saying that it's just
terrible
I mean they can talk about it it just
doesn't work well and what really
matters in the end is the results that
happened and you know every single
system on earth is susceptible to any
DDoS attacks or anything like that it's
just you know the you know the scale or
the ability to respond to that it's
gonna be important if Apple continues
the way if it treats it as you know the
situation that and among has experienced
and maybe that's not a bad sign that's a
bad sign but again we're gonna have to
take a long look at ourselves and at the
companies that we deal with in order to
figure out what the hell we're doing on
earth here and on that note that's very
very still not dystopian note that's our
show for now I'd like to thank Mark for
