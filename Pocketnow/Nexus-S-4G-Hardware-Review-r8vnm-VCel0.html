pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look at the hardware of the nexus
s 4g from sprint so sit back relax and
enjoy the show as you mentioned in the
unboxing video that google nexus s 4g
from sprint is a google specific phone
it is running a 1 gigahertz hummingbird
processor it has 16 gigs of internal
memory there is no microSD slot size and
weight is pretty light it does have a
curved screen and again it's really hard
to see here but it curves on either end
here and when you lay it flat on a table
it lifts the edge up just a little bit
across here keeping the screen from
actually touching the ground on the back
it's got another little bump here purely
for aesthetic purposes although it does
provide a little bit of a gripping point
the back piece here this back plate is
very fingerprint prone as you can see
already I just clean this and it's
already picking up in your pants and
it's very very slippery I hope that they
get some options to replace this with a
matte back I'm not a big fan of this
particular back here on the sides we've
got a power button and I really like the
power on and then power off little fade
effect that's really kind of fun not
terribly useful volume rocker on this
side other than that no other buttons on
the bottom it's got the microUSB slot
the microphone hole and the headphone
jack headphone volume is outstanding as
expected I appreciate that they moved
the these two ports to the bottom of the
device because on my sprint epic 4g
there on the top which makes cabling a
little bit funky to manage also on the
front is the 3 megapixel or point 3d
pardon me megapixel vga camera for
facing camera capabilities the speaker
for the headset itself not the
speakerphone they're these the light
sensor and the proximity sensor as well
here no leds on the front of this as far
as indication lights for charging or for
messaging or anything like that a bit of
a disappointment they're down here at
the bottom the touch-sensitive standard
android buttons here are bright in this
particular view but when compared
against the sprint epic 4g they are
really really dark i'll show you that
here brightness comparison there it's
pretty obvious that the nexus s 4g is
considerably darker in that case volume
from here is plenty loud no complaints
there no complaints about the audio
quality when I've been in calls which I
appreciate on the back the speakerphone
is seems to be quieter than my sprint
epic 4g but other than that it does a
decent job of volumes they're back
camera and the flash back camera does a
pretty good job and what a lot of people
reporting and what i'll be testing as
well is that even the back camera has
720p recording capabilities the google
software does not have that
functionality i'll be testing that and
we'll be posting that in the full review
let you know how that really works
popping off the back cover here i get
from the right side you'll notice inside
here is a couple of little contacts and
then the near-field chip is hiding
inside of here i haven't had a chance to
find anything yet that uses near-field
hopefully something soon before i finish
the review we'll see about that when we
get there other than that it's just
standard black plastic speakerphone your
contacts for the near-field chip the
battery as we mentioned in the unboxing
is a 1500
milliamp hour battery and the battery
life has actually been pretty decent
getting in with an hour of hour and a
half of phone calls and some navigation
and web browsing and display on a little
Google Music app ranking in there about
12 hours more if I'm using more of the
display but so far I've been pretty
pleased with the results there otherwise
interior not a whole lot to see there
are a couple of extra data ports here
that are unused from a day to day point
of view it's pretty standard and
straightforward this is essentially when
it comes down to it the same google
nexus s but with a wimax antenna and
looking at the WiMAX functionality and
the data capabilities it's been so so
and I've unfortunately I haven't found
really good zones with 4G for sprint
anyway which is really a pain when they
charge you an extra ten dollars a month
we'll come back to that once this be
finished booting up as we talked about
before the screen is brilliant although
it is a little hard to see from here and
once this finishes booting up we'll take
a closer look at this but as you tilt
the phone away from you there is a
little bit of color change here not too
terribly much it's definitely bright and
brilliant and in sunlight it looks
fantastic on auto display which I
appreciate very much let's go take a
look at those speed tests before it gets
a chance to try again so as far as
results go I've been getting anywhere
from like 1700 down I had a 2300 down at
one point using the 4g service the 3g
service is the 400s you see here
the this 71 and 76 was actually with the
4g on but i wasn't getting good service
so you can see we did plenty of speed
tests here and it's just been average
results but it's pretty typical compared
side by side with the epic it's been
about the same speeds running the speed
test exactly the same time comparing the
screen brightness side by side between
the two with my epic 4g and the nexus s
4g you can see that the epic over here
has a slightly more blue screen it is a
little less bright this is on full
brightness on both devices and the black
contrast on the nexus s 4g is much much
better the nexus 4g though does have a
it's hard to see in this video a yellow
color cast to it
side by side as you can see here the
epic 4g and the nexus s 4g both from
sprint there is a considerable size
difference and as we mentioned in the
unboxing video the nexus s 4g is about
the same size as the keyboard here you
can actually stack two of them on top of
each other and end up with one epic 4g
device so that the form factor is really
nice in the pocket but I looked from the
bottom it's about the same there and
then also from the top lengthwise it's
about the same as well
one thing the sprint marketing talks
about on its site is the anti
fingerprint coating on the front of the
display and I have to tell you that this
device picks up fingerprints just about
as easily as every other device that I
have owned including the iPad it does
make you know wiping off the screen is
really easy but you know as soon as you
touch it it's going to get another
fingerprint on it so i'm not sure where
they were going with that and i
mentioned on the back it just as
fingerprint pone as as the front that
wraps up the hardware portion of our
video review if you have any comments or
questions leave them below and we'll get
back to you as soon as possible thanks
for watching
