well let's just say they aren't that
small iPhone X rumors point to the
possibility of a curved display not
making a cut and we get some interesting
stats on the huawei p10 camera I'm
hiding little Iveta and in addition to
the fact that it's snowing outside and
then I've got a ton more videos to do
I will party this Friday this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
start with unlimited plans following
ship of everything the t-mobile did with
free paid plans AT&amp;amp;T has just announced
its prepaid unlimited plans and well
they sound good in paper $60 and you get
unlimited everything obviously there is
a cap of I believe 22 gigabytes of data
consume where you will start getting
throttled but there are some other
limitations starting with data speeds
and other things that I would highly
suggest you learn more in the link in
the description now let's move the
spotlight over to the huawei p10 and
it's the X o mark and this is really
interesting we've been hearing the XO
gaining popularity at mobile ever since
the HTC 10 it got the highest score even
though it wasn't our favorite camera and
well right now the highest DSO mark is
currently for the Google pixel at 89
points which makes you wonder why with
all the lens flare issues on the Google
pixel and still the Huawei p10 which
brings pretty much one of our favorite
cameras and this is not me talking it's
one one's an expert at this he confirms
that this is probably one of the best
cameras of the year and still it's got
two points below the Google pixel one
point below the HTC ten
do you agree leave us a comment down
below now how about if we talk about the
next generation iPhone which might be
called iPhone addition we're dubbing it
iPhone X and a lot of people have found
publications that say that it might also
be called the iPhone X for 10 years of
iPhone we've got some trusted sources
claiming that that 5.8 inch display
variant is apparently not going to have
a curved OLED display it's going to be
OLED but apparently Apple is going to
stay away from curbs and after testing
the LG G 6 at a 5.7 inch display that's
not
curved and it's quite organic I don't
think that's a loss at all but we would
love to know your opinion as well as
will the spotlight over to the Samsung
Galaxy S paid for those of you wondering
how far away are we from getting the s8
in the market it turns out it's actually
not that far up to the point where we
already have it at the FCC in its
unlocked variant and just to give you an
idea the galaxy s7 was at the FCC late
in February so obviously we do have a
little delay with the s8 but it doesn't
mean that it's going to be significant
if the phone is already getting tested
and finally the very hot news is they
have to do again with the Samsung Galaxy
s8 because we've got some interesting
comparisons in dimensions being
published and here this one out the
regular sized Galaxy s8 is a whopping 10
millimeters taller than the iPhone 7
that is a lot for a small phone in
theory and it's one millimeter wider
about the only thing that changes is in
the plus variant because apparently we
are getting a larger display and still
this phone is almost the same size as
the iPhone 7 plus and it's actually
three millimeters narrower than the
iPhone 7 plus that's great that's a
welcome thing but Wow
for the small variant to be so tall it
could point to so many things especially
after we've been playing with the LG G 6
so much it leads me to the question of
the day do you think you'd be bothered
for a phone that that's that's that tall
in the case of a small variant or would
you be okay with that in my case I can't
wait to see what we get first leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
