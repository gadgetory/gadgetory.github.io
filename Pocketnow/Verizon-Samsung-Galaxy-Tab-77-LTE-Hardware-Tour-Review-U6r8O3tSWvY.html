pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a look at the hardware on the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 from Verizon so
sit back relax enjoy the show so first
off this 7.7 inch display this Super
AMOLED display is absolutely brilliant
colors look really good on it and the
color accuracy is really strong compared
to a lot of the other devices that I've
used out there especially for tablets
it's going to be hit and miss for that
sort of content and using some of the
relative pictures that I use in other
reviews comparing them to this
particular tablet with its color
capabilities I have to say that the
results have been very pleasing with
color actors it's hard to see here in
this in this lighting and with this
camera because we're getting some white
adjust as well from it but really the
color accuracy is pretty decent it still
has some suffers from a little more blue
tint than expected just like the samsung
galaxy s2 but overall I like the screen
brightness and the blacks and the
density of the colors and the pixels it
just looks really good on this 7.7 inch
screen and it's really easy to read text
you do have a blue a little bit of
zooming in because the screen isn't as
large but in the hand I do really like a
7-inch form factor one thing I found
though is that it's got a tiny tiny
bezel now in the past I've always said
that a bezel is it can be problematic
but in this case or rather the large
bezel being problematic in this case the
bezel being too small is actually makes
a little difficult for my largish hands
when holding on to it to try to read a
book and with the back being a little
slick without much grip here it actually
makes it a little hard to hold on to and
there's no place to really rest your
finger without at least with my large
fingers rest them on the without resting
them on the screen which then will cause
problems if you're reading a book or
that sorting going this way holding it
with two hands no problem it's really
comes down to holding it in the portrait
mode rather than landscape now turning
it to between here and there between
portrait landscape you can see how
slowly this display turns and it's
really surprising because with this dual
core processor 1 point 4 gigahertz
Exynos processor it should be a lot
faster than that and i tried voting up a
different launcher to see if it was the
the skin that Samsung and put on this
that's causing the problem and it's it's
really just the same even the widget
without any widgets on their finding
like the road screen rotation and just
the way that sometimes things pop up
that it's just really sluggish now that
could be due to Honeycomb but I've used
other honeycomb devices that don't seem
to perform so sluggishly now once you're
in a nap and you're actually like
scrolling around through things I found
that it's prettiest pretty snappy device
opening up Netflix watching content
playing games it really is a snappy
device and the quadrant and linpack and
then to two scores are really very high
for this device so it's it's it's a
powerhouse of a machine it just doesn't
feel like a powerhouse machine
especially when you compare it to your
phone or an iPad or other devices will
get back to more comparisons later
volume rocker on the side is is easy
enough to find it was a lad I found a
little trouble finding the power button
I tend to slide my finger up the side of
the do the side of the case looking for
the the button there and then looking at
the the bottom of the connector the
speakers are plenty loud enough even by
themselves playing Netflix movies it's
been very nice and well I don't like
proprietary connectors it is seems to be
the way that most folks are going
especially with Samsung and Apple so no
complaints there other than you know you
have to spec hair on a special cable and
you don't get to use a standard microUSB
as expected on the side here one of the
things that Apple does not
have that this device does is easily
accessible microSD card slot and then it
does have the LTE device Fred because
it's verizon LTE in this sim card slot
here we mentioned in the unboxing that
this device had a small dent in it and
we'll try to get that and focus there
this is the way this device came unboxed
you know it is review unit so I'm I
imagine it's been used before but as you
can see there it did take a ding pretty
well and not something I would have
expected from this casing but it is a
rather thin metal I've also talked about
the fact that on the back here there
isn't much pop and movement although
right here is a little bit of squish I
noticed on the front of the screen that
however there is a little more flex now
if you can hear that clicking there and
when you twist the vice it's got some
noticeable click and pop as well
otherwise it's put together very well I
do like the you know slightly beveled
edges back on the front of the device
we've got the 2 megapixel front-facing
camera it takes 2 megapixel style
pictures and on the back we've got the
pre megapixel rear facing camera with a
flash unfortunately this camera is
pretty miserable log even especially the
white balance is really off especially
to use the flash I took a couple
pictures just before starting this this
particular review and the colors were
really really yellow when the flash was
used and if I set the white balance to
fluorescent then the colors came out
correctly and those pictures will be in
the final review the Samsung Galaxy Tab
7.7 from Verizon habits of a 5100
milliamp hour battery found that the
battery life has been very good mazai
would expect it to for this salad advice
it doesn't seem to last as long as say
the the ipad but that's unsurprising
especially with the LTE radio in it got
1 gig of ram and a 16 gigs of storage
the usable space on this device we
scroll there
so we've got a total space of 12 point
six seven gigs and maybe a little
difficult to see that in this picture
and you can see what we've got loaded up
here and then we've got an insert SD
card option down at the bottom as
mentioned in the unboxing it's got
bluetooth Wi-Fi in the standard set of
sensors and calibration capabilities
that the gyroscope and compass and GPS
etc it also has ways we talked about on
the review this this IR port I can find
it that will talk about a little more in
the software review but it does work
really well with the devices that I
tested with it kind of a surprising
addition for this style of device while
I've only been able to test the standard
speeds not the LTE speeds the 3g speeds
from verizon are right on par with what
expected i'm hoping to be able to get to
the LTE area and i'll post some reviews
on that speed after the fact if it
doesn't go up before the time of the
review really i'm excited to see more
devices like this the seven point seven
inch size if they work very well i'm
really hoping that ice cream sandwich
comes out for this soon hopefully that
will resolve some of the the stability
issues i had the camera crashing just a
few minutes ago we'll talk more about
that in the software review but really
this device just needs something to make
it a little more appealing a little more
snappy because compared to a lot of the
other devices that are on the market
today it just doesn't fit the price
point that's coming in for a seven point
seven inch device and being so sluggish
will get more to thing to that with the
comparisons as well that wraps up our
hardware tour for the Samsung Galaxy Tab
7.7 from Verizon if you have any
comments please leave them alone if you
like the video please give us a thumbs
up thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
