is brought to you by XCOM global well
hey little buddy when Sony introduced
the Xperia X line maybe the gadget most
missed was some form of compact phone
we're happy to see that this oversight
has been addressed with Sony's
announcement of the xperia x compact in
keeping with the theme of previous
compacts this phone represents a high
quality option for folks who like
smaller form factors and it represents
almost zero compromise moving smaller
from the xperia x mind you not the X
performance but the regular xperia x on
tap is a four point six inch 720p LCD
which is powered by a Qualcomm 650 CPU
with three gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of storage
the compact also gets a slightly larger
battery a 2,700 milliamp hour capacity
so weighing the smaller lower resolution
screen we expect noticeably better
battery life than on the regular Xperia
X in considering the mission of a small
form-factor phone the X compact gives
off a great first impression this form
factor is eminently usable with one of
my stumpy thumbs there's almost zero
repositioning of the phone when in hand
to navigate the entire UI one-handed as
women never really seem to get real
pockets in their clothes this phone
might be a nice companion to address
that portability issue sony includes the
newly refreshed camera sensor package
from the XE with laser autofocus and a
color accuracy sensor object tracking
has improved following subjects around
small obstacles and the refined image
stabilization seems to do a respectable
job of taking some shakiness out of your
videos going hands-on with a demo rig on
the show floor I still see some
twitchiness but aggressive movements are
somewhat reined in this phone might
represent the most successful experiment
sony has shown off this year as it's one
of the more targeted handsets looking at
folks who prefer smaller phones if you
want a premium name-brand Android device
in a tiny shell this might be the only
game in town now we just have to see how
much this premium option is going to
cost instead of paying terrible roaming
fees when travelling abroad or the
hassle of buying another SIM card why
not try a smarter solution
