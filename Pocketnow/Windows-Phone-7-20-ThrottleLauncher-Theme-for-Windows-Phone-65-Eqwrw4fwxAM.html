now calm and today we're looking at the
newest version of fire slaves Windows
Phone 7 theme for the throttle launcher
user interface on windows phone 6.5 we
actually took a look at this theme way
back in its infancy but now the
developer has reworked it with new
features and better optimizations so
let's check it out all right before I
begin I just want to mention that I'm
running this on an HTC touch pro2 so it
may not function as smoothly as it would
on a more powerful device like the hd2
but that being said it still works
fairly well so this theme aims to
emulate the look of Windows Phone 7 and
as you can see it does a remarkable job
as far as the appearance goes we have
the familiar Start screen with the blue
tiles let's go ahead and scroll down you
can see that some of the tiles actually
animate which is a nice touch we go down
you can see that there is some bounce
back action which lets us know that we
came to the end of the grid if you look
over here we have these three dots lets
us know that there's a hidden menu here
unlike on the actual Windows Phone 7 OS
where we have this integrated in many
areas of the operating system and this
theme it's only available in a couple
pages so on the Start screen we can
access the Start menu this little
magnifying glass takes us to a simple
Bing search page the little wrench icon
will take you to the throttle launcher
interface settings and the plus icon
will allow you to add remove or
configure your tiles so will minimize
that and just to let you know you can
add specific contacts or programs to
your start page let's go back up here
and if you swipe to the side you can
actually access all of your programs
which is very reminiscent of the windows
phone 7 OS we can also press this arrow
to go back now let's take a closer look
at some of these start screen tile
the phone tile just launches your
default windows mobile dialer the
messaging and email tiles will do the
same with your standard messaging
applications if we go to the people tile
up here it's actually sort of mini
people hub you can see that the tiles
animated with some of my contacts if we
tap on them it'll take us to this page
which lists all of my favorites I can
add and remove contacts with these
buttons down here not too much
functionality beyond that but it's nice
that we can drill down a little deeper
into the theme let's go back and move on
to the pictures hub and it looks like it
just shows us a grid of some of our
pictures on the device now you can set
the directory for the images that you
want to be displayed also notice that it
use one of my pictures as the background
which is a nice touch let's go over here
and pull up this hidden menu we press
this button on the very right it'll
refresh all of our pictures to make sure
the recent images are displayed not sure
with these two buttons in the middle do
and the very left button has a camera
icon because it launches your camera
application so that you can take
pictures which is good as well let's go
ahead and go back and move on here the
xbox live tile now obviously it's not
going to have any Xbox Live integration
but it will let you store all of your
shortcuts two games in one place so it's
sort of like an organizing hub so to
speak you can add or remove them
pressing this button I didn't have too
many games on my device so i just added
some random shortcuts you can also
change the avatar the background it's
not animated or anything like that but
it is a static customizable avatar so
let's go back this tile over here is
just to launch your owner's information
below that we have a Music Hub so here
we can add different items I have TCP MP
and go windows media player we swipe
over to the side we actually get this
nice little interface for
media controls so i have this connected
to windows media player it's also
compatible with nitrogen and I believe
slide to play so we have volume up and
down and we can switch tracks and press
play let's get out of here and go to the
calendar so a simple calendar it allows
us to jump through the years by swiping
up or down and we can jump through
months by swiping left or right let's go
out of here and down here I just have a
contact shortcut that I set for
demonstration purposes so let's swipe
back and go to the settings and you can
see it has this nice windows phone 7
style settings menu we go and start at
the beginning so under general these are
a bunch of windows mobile standard
settings that you might want to access
let's go over to the theme settings now
this is where it gets sort of
interesting we can actually change to a
light theme just like on the actual
windows phone 7 so now everything has a
white background and we can change the
accent color looks like we have a nice
assortment of colors I'm going to go
with red that seems to be pretty popular
with the white background and here we
have some animation settings for the
people tile and then we can set our
music player so let's jump back to the
start screen so you can see what the
change in theme looks like and there is
one last feature that I forgot to
mention earlier in the video you can
actually tap and hold on any of these
tiles to move them around and then place
them wherever you'd like let's go ahead
and try that again with this games tile
and we'll drop it down over here like so
very cool so that about does it for this
video but i'll post instructions on
pacquiao calm as to how you can get this
theme up and running on the previous
generation of Windows Phones so be sure
to hit the link in the description for
that as always you can follow us on
