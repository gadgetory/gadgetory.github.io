one of the things we've been waiting for
for a long time over here in the states
is video calling now we got some of that
on the iPhone 4 and we've had some
previous versions of stuff like fring
but there haven't been too many phones
that have a front-facing camera well
even when the Epic 4G came out the
front-facing camera didn't do much
because fring didn't know how to talk to
it well with an update that just came
out in the market
now you can fring with video on your
Samsung Epic 4G let's go take a look so
this is spring let's go ahead and fire
it up
frame is available free in the market
first thing it does when it starts up
which usually happens when you start
your phone is that it checks your
network connection and then logs you in
you do need to have a free account which
is also free at that point it brings you
to this screen and I don't want to
choose a frame test call so you're here
you can either make a voice call or a
video call or even chat in this case
it's a test so there's not a test chat
let's go ahead and move the camera
around so you can see how this works
using the front-facing camera so let's
give it a shot first we get a message
from fraying over here on the left and
we get a preview of ourself over here in
the right and you can kind of see me
with the camera in there now at this
point I'm supposed to record a 10-second
clip which is basically going to take my
video and send it to fring and play it
back to me to make sure that my side of
the video is complete
so there you go video calling over fring
with the Samsung Epic 4G finally we can
put all of that 4G goodness to good use
now I did make this call over my Wi-Fi
rather than 4G because I'm not under a
4G umbrella where I live so this is a
pretty good example of what you should
expect the video is not stellar but it's
decent
you know it's nowhere near what we see
in I face but I can only hope that we'll
make some improvements so if you'd like
to continue seeing videos like this of
course give this video a thumbs up
subscribe to our YouTube channel so
you're not missing out on any more of
the Epic 4G videos if you haven't
stopped by our website now is the time
to do that
that's pocketnow.com and again for
pocketnow.com i'm jolie bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
