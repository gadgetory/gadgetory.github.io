the equation manufacturers are fighting
for a much smaller chunk of the
smartphone sales by for consumers
wanting an alternative to galaxies and
iPhones who offers the more complete
solution i'm juan carlos back now for
pocket now and here's our showdown
between the HTC 10 and LG g5 the fight
between these two companies is
fascinating LG's products in 2015 were
very well received critically though the
G flex 2 suffered early teething pains
because of the Qualcomm 810 our comments
are full of folks who are fans of phones
like the g4 and v10 HTC on the other
hand struggled to find their footing
after releasing the one m9 and the
iPhone clone one a9 however the
beginning of 2016 is an almost complete
role reversal the g5 represents a more
dramatic departure from previous LG
phones a metal shell covered in a
premium paint replaces plastic and
leather this shell is a unibody frame
with a detachable chin to swap the
battery and we add a whole second camera
to the experience to capture a super
wide field of view but there are a few
missteps here seams or rough edges feel
unfinished a buttons feel a little bit
tacky and the chin doesn't seal the
bottom as well as we'd hoped
during our comparison our silver g5 also
started randomly rebooting and was sent
back to 18 T where it was replaced with
a gray g5 and happily the chin seems to
fit better on this phone than on our
previous the silver g5 will still show
up in some of the shots for this video
though HTC on the other hand hasn't
taken as grand a departure with the 10
in many ways this phone gets HTC back to
basics and from a distance might still
be confused for a One m8 but in the hand
this phone reminds us what an
engineering force HTC can be this is
wonderfully completed hardware with
exacting attention to detail
buttons are clicky the flat sides give
you something to hold on to but tapers
to the rear casing help the phone feel
thinner in the hand these large chamfers
really do play with light in a unique
way it's subtle but distinctly different
than previous HTC s both phones feature
quad HD LCD displays though the HTC uses
a slightly smaller 5.2 inch
Green over the LG's 5.3 inch screen
overall dimensions favor the HTC though
it is about a millimeter thicker and the
10 does have a slightly better screen to
bezel ratio on that front face to my eye
the HTC has the brighter LCD when using
the screen in direct Sun but neither
phone will unseat the high brightness
mode found on samsung amoled displays
both phones also have faster always-on
fingerprint sensors economically the
rear mounted scanner on the g5 will
likely be easier to reach for all people
regardless of hand size and the HTC
requires more repositioning to reach
under the display but in anecdotal
testing over the last couple days
the HTC seems to have fewer misfires
though that could simply be behavioral
as the home button requires a more
deliberate action to put a thumb on that
sensor the 10 brings us back to hardware
capacitive navigation controls software
proves to be more flexible as LG allows
users to customize the order and the
features at the bottom of the screen and
while some might not enjoy losing a
little strip of that screen many apps
and games now hide this strip which
actually works well to prevent
accidental button activation during
heavy boss fights LG also took a bigger
risk with the g5 s UI getting rid of the
app drawer for more iPhone like
experience carrier branded models don't
include a replacement for the app door
out of the box but it can be replaced by
downloading LG Smart World app store
then installing the LG home user
experience if you want an app drawer
it's honestly just faster to use now
launcher or my personal favorite nova
launcher on the whole I find mixing app
shortcuts and widgets to be a fairly
cluttered experience and I greatly
prefer separating out the apps I use
most while organizing the rest in a
drawer alphabetically but of course your
mileage will vary again HTC looks to
refine more than push new boundaries
with this version of sense their skin
which runs on top of Android marshmallow
it's still a significant departure from
stock Android but it's well familiar
terra-tory at this point navigating this
UI should be fairly easy for consumers
coming from any other Android and there
are some nice customizations to the app
drawer though I do wish there was a
native way to change the grid size on
the home screens seems kind of silly not
to offer a five-by-five option with this
quad HD screen also of note how little
duplicate software there is on the HTC
10 it's a genuine pleasure just be
able to fire up the Google Calendar as
the stock solution and not have to
manually disable notifications from a
pre-installed calendar app I'm not as
likely to use performance between these
two phones is nearly identical as we're
utilizing the same Qualcomm 820 chipset
with four gigabytes of RAM a people
engaging in heavy multitasking
situations will be happier with both of
these phones over last year's offerings
gaming performance is very similar as
well we still see some dropped frames on
Marvel future fight on high settings
implosion occasionally stutters when
lots of enemies are on screen though it
is impressive to see how we're pushing
the boundaries on mobile devices that
there are developers taking advantage of
the horsepower on these newer phones the
camera battle this year is a hard-fought
fight over three fronts HTC's camera is
much improved over the m9 but LG offers
one of the most formidable software and
hardware combinations for capturing
still photos available on the market
LG's more refined camera app is pretty
handily able to outperform HTC in most
shooting situations in bright light both
phones produce colorful images with nice
bokeh LG does have a closer minimum
focusing distance for macro shooters and
LG's autofocus system seems to be more
accurate throughout most of our setups
when shooting warmer colors the g5 tends
to exaggerate those colors a bit more
than previous LG's but it's still quite
a bit closer than HTC's color processing
however both phones produce somewhat
ridiculous HDR photos shadows are
boosted fine but highlights aren't
reined in at all and you're going to
clip a lot of details in bright sections
of your photos in low light situations
HTC's image stabilization is
terrifically improved over the a nine
but even on our best of five handheld
shots here can't quite match the image
clarity of the g5 in general night shots
from the g5 seem to retain better
contrast juicier saturation and less
destructive noise reduction over similar
HTC ten shots in extreme low-light the
10 is happily able to focus on objects
in full auto but is easily confused when
tapping on the screen to focus on
specific objects a situation where the
g5 excels and when throwing the flash
exposure is generally more accurate from
the dual color tone LED solution on the
10 but LG is extremely
closed with only one LED on the g5
however this comparison flips when we
talk about video both phones produce
extremely high quality UHD files though
the g5 shoots full auto there are no
controls over anything other than
focusing the HTC 10 doesn't have much on
tap to play with but at least you can
adjust exposure which is fantastically
helpful for reining in situations where
you're seeing might be too dark or too
bright one small note on the files the
10 produces you will have to sort out
MKV video containers which is a little
less common a file than the MOV or mp4
files our phones normally produce also a
handy win for the HTC is the selfie
camera adding image stabilization to the
front shooter marks a significant
improvement in video quality and now
makes the HTC 10 a killer option for
folks interested in doing a little
vlogging we were honestly hoping for a
more engaged audio fight between these
two phones and we've previously
mentioned the issues relating to LG
cancelling the high-five friend in North
America
this leaves HTC with little competition
when comparing headphone output the 10
continues a stellar reputation for
punchy loud amps and high quality Dax
against the built-in jack on the g5 the
HTC 10 is louder has a wider dynamic
range lower noise and less distortion
anecdotally it's just clearer brighter
it's a better representation of
instruments across the whole EQ range
and does a better job driving my more
expensive headphones the speaker fight
is at least a little closer the g5
actually might ring in a touch louder
but the 10 points the main speaker in
the right direction for when you're
interacting with your phone and the
split boom sound speakers which fire
low-frequency sound out the bottom make
for a slightly more nuanced sound
for having many similar internals the g5
does come with a smaller battery 2800
milliamp power compared to three
thousand on the HTC 10 run time actually
seems to improve slightly beyond just
the difference in capacity running our
playback test streaming 30 minutes of HD
video over Wi-Fi at 50 percent
brightness the g5 drained 7 percent and
the HTC 10 drained 6 percent what's
interesting about this test is seeing
the HTC 10 pull ahead when we can
clearly see a brighter screen on the 10
over the g5 when both sliders are set to
50% while the hardware is very similar
LG does seem to manage a slightly faster
recharge rate a half hour on a quick
charger the HTC recharged 44% of its
battery the g5 hit 55 percent a larger
difference in performance than the 7
percent difference in battery capacity
between the two so let's wrap this up
where's that leave us between the HTC 10
and the LG g5 the title of this video
likely already gave away our feelings on
this comparison we're not really in the
business of picking winners and losers
and individuals purchasing phones should
always focus on their own unique needs
but this battle pits a well refined line
of phones against a more daring leap in
phone iteration both of these phones
contain killer features which will sway
individual consumers and that's always
going to be a headline worthy story for
folks looking outside the Samsung Apple
duopoly as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full coverage of the HTC
10 and LG g5 and hit that thumbs up
button for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now i'm juan
carlos bag now you can chat me up on
twitter and instagram as some gadget guy
and i will catch you all on the next
comparison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
