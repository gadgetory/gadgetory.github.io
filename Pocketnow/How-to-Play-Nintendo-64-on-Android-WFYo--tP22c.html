pocketnow.com
have you ever wanted to play Nintendo 64
on your Android well in this video we're
going to show you how so what you have
to do is first download a market
application called n64
it does cost money it's six bucks but it
works very well and it's very versatile
it will work with a lot of different
kind of roms and of course the thing
with roms is that make sure you've
bought the game in the past if you're
going to load any ROM onto your phone
and play it so let's talk about how it
works so we are going to go over here
to n64 I've already got something loaded
but I'll show you something from the
beginning here so we are going to go to
close and I've got a couple of roms
loaded on here what got to get the
orientation right we'll go down to Mario
Kart 64 who doesn't love Mario Kart so
we'll go through it it works pretty well
on some games the sound is a little bit
weird as you can hear but a lot of
things do work you get these virtual
on-screen controllers which make it
pretty easy to operate so let's do that
50cc a lot of nostalgia going on here
let's be Luigi he's the man okay here we
go
we'll choose mushroom Cup keep it easy
for now we've got the
top buttons up on the top so again
performance isn't perfect but as you're
going to see in a second it works so
here we go Mario Kart 3d or Mario Kart
64 as it was called and of course this
one's fun because you get these little
these different little choices and now
I've got that and how do I activate it I
think it's right trigger or known that
right trigger I'm trying to activate the
star left trigger there goes and now
I've got the star zooming through it
takes a little bit of getting used to as
you can see but it's a whole lot of fun
and it truly is n64 on your Android
that's it for now if you like this video
please give it a thumbs up if you like
n64 or sort of the vintage gaming
systems of the past off so give the
video a thumbs up
and tell us what your favorite game is
thanks for watching what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
