limits and even pre-order benefits the
next one plus product doesn't seem to be
a new smartphone and t-mobile is serious
about getting you on their network as
soon as possible I'm high memory that I
am then clearly trying to remember what
it was like to dress up in white at some
point this is parking out daily brought
to you by Squarespace in its new
seven-point oh you I let's begin today
with the official news starting with
tmobile as we are on uncarrier
nine-point-oh now remember when we move
from fire poi no but the company is up
to some more bold moves in the past if
you had a contract on any other carrier
they would pay to leave that contracted
but now hey if you're on AT&amp;amp;T mex or any
other of these services where you pay
installments for the phone they'll even
give you credit for that for you to
leave that carrier as well company is a
trying everything on the book but make
sure you read Michael Fisher's reason
experience with tmobile as a there are
benefits but not all of them now let's
hold the spotlight over 21 + even though
we're not going to talk about the
oneplus 2 or at least we don't know
exactly what that's going to be like
nobody is teasing a game changer and it
seems like if they're trying to hold a
controller for gaming meaning we're not
sure if we're going to get something
that's close to the Nvidia shield or
some other game changing product and
even though the Nvidia shield wasn't any
of that it's really interesting to see
what the company plans to branch out
into as a yeah we're still waiting for
smartphones and they're not delivering
now let's talk about pebble we are
waiting for the pebble time and pebble
time steal at least some of us are but
the company is up to some new antics
into how to make these products popular
they're willing to invest millions of
dollars and the whoever is willing to
build a new type of watch bands that
bring innovative features like for
example putting a GPS antenna on that or
extra battery life or whatever thing
they could come up with whatever
compelling ideas that are shown they
will select and they will invest in
these really good to see pebble trying
to do new things though adding these
things to a watch strap is not
necessarily popular as we've seen with
gear the vices
samsung or other products as well now
song about Google and LG as Google
engineers have secretly been visiting
LG's headquarters in Korea for the last
couple of weeks and a lot of the
internal sources claim that apparently
they're working on a new product
probably a nexus product the question is
exactly what are we getting here as a
we've got the nexus 6 or motorola could
it be that we're getting another nexus
fiber could it be that we're getting a
rebound to the nexus 7 or any other
product right now ism yes LG has a lot
more brand power than motorola currently
now let's see what we get eventually and
finally for the very interesting rumors
of the day we hear of apple's whole
action plan with the Apple watch as of
April 10th the company is not only going
to allow they just walk in and give an
Apple watch a try but there will be
specific tables where they'll have as
many as ten different try out areas with
different variants of the Apple watch
and geniuses from Apple will be going
through a walkthrough that'll last 15
minutes to tell you everything that the
Apple watch can do and then they will
allow other users to give it a try but
the most interesting part here is that
during those 15 minutes you can make up
your mind and say yes I want an apple
watch and if you didn't pre-order or
lose the pre-order batch apparently
you'll be able to reserve a watch there
and still get one by launch date on
april twenty fourth which is really
interesting but it leads me to the
question of the day are you on the list
of people that want to go to an apple
store and give an apple watch a try
before you buy because in my case if i
had an apple store in the area then yes
that would be one of the requirements
for me to be willing to buy an Apple
watch but leave us a comment down below
