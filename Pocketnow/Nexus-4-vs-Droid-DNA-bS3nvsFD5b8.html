pocketnow.com if you're looking for a
new Android phone you're undoubtedly
looking at the Nexus 4 and the Droid DNA
and in this video we're going to compare
them both let's get to it okay so we're
gonna talk about the hardware on both of
these devices and then compare them but
first let's take the DNA now the DNA is
on Verizon right now over LTE although
you can put an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card in it and
get HSPA+ data speeds in fact that's
what I've been running on and it works
just fine over 80 which is really
interesting actually this phone is going
to be released within the next six
months on every major carrier and in
Europe because this is HTC's Fang for
the next six months this is their
high-end phone and the DNA the deluxe
whatever you want to call it is
deserving of that title this thing is a
beast
and it's it's truly unique in that in
the fact that it has a 1080p screen it's
the first smartphone with a 1080p it's
got the s4 pro quad core so it's fast if
we're gonna get to that intimate but
let's take a look at this design what
Verizon and HTC has done here we've got
these red elements all throughout we've
got the speaker grille up here which has
this interesting interesting perforated
look to it behind the grille we've got a
massive front facing camera it's not
super high resolution or anything it's
got a wide angle but it just looks huge
compared to other front-facing cameras
we've got this tapered edge look kind of
a common design language that a lot of
manufacturers are using we've got
capacitive buttons on the bottom and
Gorilla Glass too so it's a little bit
more slippery than the last generation
Gorilla Glass around the edges we've got
these really awesome details the Verizon
red and it looks like there's a speaker
behind there because they're perforated
metal panels but actually it's just for
design on the top of the power button is
interestingly placed in the top centre
which is definitely annoying they should
have placed on the side HDC usually
places it right here but that's where
the sim and the power button has this
awesome design to it if you move it in a
light it's gotta this radio cutout
design which is carried over to the
volume rocker here not just the standard
piece of plastic for the volume rocker
you get this nice little itched look to
it the red accent continues on the sides
on the
back to the camera now the bank has soft
touch plastic which is really important
for this phone because it's tall it's
not a phablet because it's not intended
to take the place of a tablet like the
note 2 mic for example it's very much a
phone it's a long bar phone and so
having soft touch on the back makes it
feel really nice and hand it really
feels secure and the fact that these
tapered edges come to the end here makes
the phone feel a lot thinner than it is
it's actually thicker than the nexus 4
but it feels thinner because of this
nice sharp edge here which is probably
about 6 millimeters thick
but then the entire phone if you look at
it from the side is nine point seven
millimeters thick so that is the Troi
DNA really nice design something new and
fresh which is nice to see here on the
Nexus 4 designed by LG it shares design
language with the Optimus G of course we
have a buttonless design here and we've
got a nice bezel on the bottom which you
can use to hold the phone from we've got
an LED notification light and should
mention that the droid DNA here as a
notification light here on the front and
also here on the back the Nexus 4
actually is a multicolor
notification LED which can show a ton of
different colors if you use light flow
so far it looks like the DNA only has
green and yellow and and red really and
not like blue and amber and all those
other colors that you can do on the
Nexus 4 the Nexus 4 is a little bit
thinner than the Droid DNA but it feels
a little bit thicker because the edge is
the same thickness as the entire phone
so it kind of goes all the way back
we've got a really cool design that
women here on the Nexus 4 or something
totally unique just this just thousands
of little circles that shimmer in the
light when you twist it let me bring the
light a little bit closer and you can
kind of see whew that's fun very nice
and we've got soft touch around the
edges here and it feels okay in the head
it doesn't feel as good as the droid DNA
perhaps because this plastic has an
interesting contrast with all of this
glass it makes it feel a little bit
cheap like the edges should have been a
higher quality material maybe metal for
example wears on the droid DNA you get
glass
and the rest is just soft touch plastic
so it feels nice in the hand another
thing about the Nexus 4 is that it
slides so easily the Droid DNA swivels
easily but because it's rubbery on the
back it's gonna stay in your pocket more
easily and it's not going to jump off of
the table like you might see with the
Nexus 4 now the screens are very
different and yet they're not that
different in terms of size we have a
5-inch 1080p that's 1920 by 1080 making
for a pixel density of 440 that's huge
here on the Nexus 4 we have a more
reasonable 4.7 inch display 1280 down by
seven six eight across still a high PPI
of 320 now because of the bigger screen
here the the Droid DNA is a little bit a
little bit wider it's significantly
taller there by about an inch and of
course as mentioned with thickness the
Droid DNA is a little bit thicker if we
put it on a table it's nine point seven
millimeters versus nine point one
millimeters all right now let's turn on
these guys and while they're turning on
we're going to talk about specs so we
turn them on over here and here let's
see which turns on faster go they're
both starting up so both of these
devices have very similar specifications
we both they both share the Qualcomm s4
pro quad core Wow looks like we were
first here on the Droid DNA and to
continue the thought here we've got the
s4 pro quad core snapdragon on both
devices they both have two gigabytes of
RAM and they both have similar storage
situations so on the droid DNA we have
your choice of 16 gigabytes and 16
gigabytes you don't have any other
choice on the nexus 4 you get either 8
or 16 gigabytes neither device has
expandable storage so choose your
storage wisely now of course when you
get 16 gigabytes of storage you don't
actually get 16 gigabytes of storage on
the Troy DNA or 16 gigabytes of storage
means 11 gigabytes use of usable and
here on the nexus 4 8 gigabytes gives
you about 6 usable and 16 gigs of
gigabytes gives you about 14 usable so
that's something to keep in mind you're
gonna get a little extra space here if
you go with this
Steen gigabyte model now what we're
gonna do is test app launch speed and
then we're gonna compare the screens
when I do benchmarks you're definitely
gonna want to stick around first thing I
want to do here is actually turn on
brightness all the way so that you can
tell the difference between the screens
see which one is more bright perhaps go
to brightness turn off auto brightness
check that bad boy yeah we've got a
super LCD free screen here kind of the
successor to the LCD super LCD to of the
One X and we've got LG's IPS display
here both of these displays are awesome
actually let's take a look at viewing
angles so we're gonna turn both of them
to the side at the same degree and you
can kind of be the judge both of them
have really I mean you could still see
the screens it's pretty incredible
both of them have extremely good viewing
angles and we're gonna see what the
1080p resolution means in a wide variety
of cases okay let's test app launch
speed we're gonna start off with
Facebook here we're both over the same
Wi-Fi network one two three
and by the way something to note here
look at the Facebook icon here on the
DNA versus the Nexus 4 it's more blue
more saturated on the DNA as you can see
there compared to the Nexus 4 so just
pointing out some things along the way
here let's launch Facebook one two three
go faster on the Nexus 4 let's launch
Twitter so go back into social folder
one two three
Twitter faster on the Nexus 4 next thing
we're going to do is launch the Play
Store one two three placed over about
the same there next thing we are going
to do is launch bad piggies we can find
it bad piggies HD to be exact
go wow exactly at the same time now what
you're dealing with here is obviously
similar hardware so what you're gonna
get is the droid DNA being a little bit
slower most of the time just because it
has so many more pixels than the Nexus 4
another thing we're in a launch now is
the calorie down here one two three say
she's exactly at the same time let's do
that again the camera is always way
first vote takes a little bit longer one
two three camera okay interesting now
that we have the same amount of programs
in memory
let's check free RAM let's see how both
of these devices do in terms of RAM
utilization so we're gonna go to apps
here running and running and so we've
got one point five gigabytes usable
instead of two and we're using about 885
of it and down here we're using far less
Ram which is really interesting have the
same 1.5 gigabytes free HTC sense man
just takes up a lot of RAM and that's
probably what's happening here we have
about 50 percent RAM available here and
we've got like 75 percent available on
the nexus 4 what are the benefits of
having stock Android on the nexus 4 is
that you don't have to worry about sense
or TouchWiz or whatever interface you're
thinking about to slow you down
these also have different multitask UI's
so we're gonna hit this button and see
which opens the multitask UI first 1 2 3
multitask that was about at the same
time HDC HDC is still going with their
really 3d ask multitask UI we kind of
wish you see we just go with the stock
Android multitask UI if it's not fixed
if it's not what is that if it's not
broken don't fix it alright so in terms
of app launch speed the nexus 4 is the
winner there next we're going to go into
the web now in our review we complain
that the Nexus 4 is chrome built in as
the stock browser and we still feel that
way this stock Android browser is faster
than chrome period in every case so I'll
be interesting to see how these two
devices compare what we're gonna do is
launch pocket now right off the bat
we've got some tabs open it's gonna
close those all right
and the DNA went to the mobile site
let's go to the desktop version really
curious to see how the display
difference really curious to see how the
display differs here because we get so
many more pixels on the DNA and look at
this here on the nexus 4 we can see down
to this story here and that's where this
story is here so we get an additional
almost two stories here on the DNA
another thing that's really striking
about the DNA is from this zoomed out
view you can read this text more than
ever let me show you you can still do it
on the nexus 4 but you're you're getting
to the limit of the screens ability to
show you really small text so can you
read that text probably but from the TNA
it's it's another it's in another realm
okay so let's test out pinch to zoom
okay we're in a pinch to zoom and did
you notice that if I pinch the exact
same amount on the Nexus 4 Izu min less
the screen sensitivity is is worse on
the Nexus 4 it's it's it's got a problem
because of this in cell touch so watch
me pinch the same amount I'm actually
I'm actually pinch I've actually pinched
a more on the nexus 4 and it's just not
as responsive so let's zoom back out
we're gonna double tap to zoom in see
which clears up faster about equal there
and let's zoom back out to move down the
page see if we get any whitespace very
smooth there very smooth there as well
okay so let's move on around the page
pick a story let's pick this one here
and we are going to click on that 1 2 3
go
the exact same time let's see what she
gets there first watching the progress
bar the progress bar and and
DNA finish first we're gonna stop the
Nexus for here you've got a little
pop-up here we don't know if that and
we're going to scroll down to this
embedded video see which renders it
faster one two three go faster on the
Nexus 4 ok so let's go back to the home
screen let's go to another website this
time where you are going to go to the
verge one two three go again the mobile
site on the DNA here we're go to the
full site and see again the displayed
differences and by the way what you can
tell here by this white screen is that
the DNA screen is cooler than the nexus
4 and we found that in all of our
comparisons video with the videos with
the Nexus 4 the Nexus 4 is a warm screen
for better or for worse so here up the
bet you can see a lot more screen
contents here on the DNA let's go into
landscape and see what the story is
there and interestingly in landscape you
see more on the Nexus 4 than you do on
the DNA but of course you can probably
tweak the zoom settings on either of
these device to get a desired effect so
let's move down on the page nice and
smooth there some miss presses are
always always fun a little bit of white
there alright let's zoom in on this area
and see which clears up text faster
having problems here on the Nexus 4 one
two three
actually the DNA was a little bit slower
in that case so it seems that generally
speaking the Nexus 4 is a little bit
faster than the DNA in some cases it's
really a draw in case of web browsing
performance and that kind of make sense
they have the same processor and then
the DNA has more pixels to push while
the Nexus 4 has the Chrome browser which
should it be the default browser so
about equal we'll call it now let's take
a look at YouTube
all right so we've got the same video at
the top you were gonna click on both now
something's a note about the DNA in
YouTube the YouTube app in Android only
does 720p video so you're not going to
see the full resolution but what happens
is that there's some pixel doubling
happening in YouTube on the DNA which
isn't bad so you get a 720p picture
stretched to more pixels it really
doesn't make a difference will you be
the judge so I'm gonna click on this
video and it's going to play here get a
little advertisement in and you know it
definitely does look better on the DNA
we get a a slightly larger view but in
terms of the colors they look about the
same here again a little bit warmer on
the nexus floor we're gonna go back to
the home screen and do some benchmark
tests by the way guys if you're
wondering what this live wallpaper is
it's it's a free live wallpaper super
cool it's called light grading you can
customize the colors and the shapes it's
a lot of fun and it really makes any
high quality display shine although
interestingly it's having trouble a
little bit on the DNA it's a little bit
slower and it's definitely much smoother
here on the Nexus 4 all right let's run
quadrants alright we're gonna run the
benchmark and come back with the scores
and the DNA finished first and let's see
what the results say so we've got seven
thousand eight hundred and thirty three
on the DNA which smokes the Nexus 4 here
and these these results around forty
seven hundred and four thousands is what
we've been seeing on the Nexus 4 but
this is an impressive score here on the
Droid DNA now let's run another
benchmark geek bench too and we'll be
back with the scores okay the results
are in and it looks like the Nexus 4 was
a little bit faster and Geekbench by
about 800 points or so so in conclusion
the Nexus 4 is definitely a bit faster
than the Droid DNA which makes sense
because the DNA has more pixels to push
that said those pixels are beautiful
this screen is unbelievable 440 PPI
might be overkill but when you're
looking at pictures and looking at text
on the screen
it is just a wonder to think about how
they included so many pixels on this
display one thing to consider with the
DNA though is in hand comfort it feels
good in the hand because of the really
high build quality from HTC but the
screen is tall so even if you have
basketball player sized hands you're
gonna have to take out your second hand
just to turn the device on and off
because that power buttons all the way
up at the top with the Nexus 4 you get
stock unadulterated Android the way
nature intended that's something to
consider definitely for the power user
crowd more so than the DNA and you also
have to consider that the hardware on
the Nexus 4 isn't as good as a DNA it
just feels a little cheaper in the hand
and of course we have those touch
responsiveness issues which makes the
screen feel numb on the Nexus 4 but the
Nexus 4 has an awesome price at 300
bucks starting if you're buying it off
contract so both of these devices are
really awesome some advice to you is to
wait for the DNA to to come on more
carriers test it out at your local
carrier store you'll be able to get it
at a subsidized price presumably and
it'll bring the price around to where
you can get the the Nexus 4 maybe even a
little bit lower both of these devices
deserve your consideration if there's
anything specific you want us to compare
drop us a comment and if you like this
video give us a thumbs up thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
