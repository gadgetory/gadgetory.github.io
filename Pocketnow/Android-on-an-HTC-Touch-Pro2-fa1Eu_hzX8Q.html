Pacquiao comm and today we're checking
the progress of Android for Windows
Phones it's available thanks to the XD
Android team and the version I'm running
is modified to work on a sprint HTC
Touch pro2
which runs on a CDMA network the project
has certainly come a long way since we
last did a video so let's take a look at
what's currently working so we'll turn
the display on and here we have the
Android lockscreen we'll slide to unlock
and here we have the familiar Android
home screen we can slide from side to
side to navigate through different
panels and before we get any further let
me actually show you the functions of
the hardware keys so if we press the
power button up top it'll actually bring
you to the home screen tapping and
holding that button will pull up the
Android task switcher which displays up
to 6 of your most recent actions if we
press the M key it'll turn the display
off if we tap and hold the M key you'll
get profile options and the ability to
boot back into Windows Mobile the back
key does exactly what you would expect
which is go back in action and the start
key brings up options for whichever
screen you're on and of course we have
the send key which pulls up your
traditional phone options
so while we're in this screen let's go
ahead and test to see if the phone's
radio is working so I'm gonna pull up
the dialer and I'll actually call my
voicemail and as you can see it's
initiating and I don't know if you can
hear this but it has successfully
connected to my voicemail so yes you can
make and receive phone calls so I'm
gonna end the call we'll go back to the
home screen so one of my favorite
features of Android is actually the
taskbar thanks to its handy window shade
for notifications as you can see it
works pretty well
and we already have some notifications
here but we're actually going to test
this now by sending myself a text
message from another device so we should
see a notification in a couple seconds
oh there it is it says hello so we'll
pull the shade down and click on the
notification and here we are inside of
messaging so we'll go ahead and pull up
the soft keyboard and type out a simple
response and send it off so SMS is
working you should hear the sound
notification yeah there it is on the
other device another feature that's
working is the app tray for browsing
programs and to launch them we can also
tap and hold on a a program to add a
shortcut to the home screen we can just
as easily get rid of it in the trashcan
we can also pull up these options to add
shortcuts widgets folders and to change
wallpapers I'm going to add a shortcut
will go with bookmark and I'll go with
ESPN so here we have a shortcut to ESPN
we'll click that and it'll launch the
Android Browser so as you can see data
is working on this build since we
already looked at the soft keyboard
let's go ahead and use the hardware
keyboard I'm going to type in pocket now
and it should do a Google search click
enter
now here we go so sometimes the Android
browser does lag a bit on the touch pro2
but it's working pretty well right now
so let's go back to the home screen and
we'll check out the calendar click on
today as you can see that works as well
messaging an email both work let's
actually go to the market and I was
looking at amazon.com earlier you can
install all these apps you can uninstall
them and I've already done that plenty
of time since I've loaded this build up
we're not going to do it right now but
when you install an app it will show up
in the status bar while it's downloading
and then installing so let's go back to
the home screen and will actually load
Urbanspoon which i've downloaded and
installed earlier unfortunately GPS does
not work on this build but hopefully
they'll get that working soon so we'll
go ahead and choose the city manually
I'm gonna go with Atlanta Georgia okay
here we go
now the reason why I wanted to show you
this particular app is to show you that
the accelerometer is actually working so
we'll shake the phone and it should
activate the randomizer as you can see
it does lag a bit at the beginning but
it will work and it shows us a random
restaurant to go to so we can actually
click on the result and it'll load up
just fine so let's go back to the home
screen you can also launch the Astro
browser to look up all that are all of
our files on the storage card it works
just fine let's go back to the home page
as you can see I've downloaded movie
finder Fandango all these popular
Twitter clients so you can download and
install many of these apps from the
market so this was a look at android for
the HTC Touch pro2 while it's still
missing gps sound bluetooth and other
key functions it's nothing less than
amazing how much they've been able to
accomplish up to this point you can
download install and run apps thanks to
working data you can send and receive
calls and text messages Hardware keys
Wi-Fi the accelerometer all work you can
also squeeze out about seven hours of
battery life with heavy usage the list
of working features has really grown
over the past couple of months so I'll
post links on packing.com as to how you
can get Android up and running on
multiple windows mobile devices be sure
