now it finally made its way into our
offices the top-of-the-line Lumia phone
the Nokia Lumia 925 I'm Anton denied
this is PocketNow
and I'm gonna go unbox this baby here's
the box the Lumia 925 is hopefully
inside there let's go and dig inside
this bag will cut this wrap light soon
and a very brutal away and get another
bubble wrap out in which hopefully there
will be our new phone and it sure is
will see right from the beginning that
this is a generic Nokia box we have a
picture of the device on the front going
all the way to the sides with the Nokia
Lumia 925 being called out both on the
sides and on the top we've got some
information here and on the back we will
see that you'll find in the box the
phone the charger the USB cable
headphones and also information PureView
and PureView motion HD plus are being
specifically called out as well as the
Snapdragon processor inside ok now let's
open up the box and see what's inside
obviously there's the phone right on the
top I will take this put it to the side
just for one second and then see what
else we have the pin with which you can
eject or insert your SIM card then
there's literature as usual lots of
information we're not interested in that
we have a USB cable for syncing and
charging we have the generic Nakia
charger this one comes from the UK so
this is the UK wall plug and it's always
nice to see headphones being bundled
these are earbuds with let's let's lots
of earbuds but let's put everything back
and take a look at the most important
part the phone itself
now obviously packed in a wrap or gonna
try to get it out
without breaking too much of the seal
and there we go it's sticking to the
phone this is the Nokia Lumia 925 I even
forgot how good this one feels in the
hand
I had a hands-on time in London for a
special event and now it is here it is
the white version and as you can see
this part right here is polycarbonate it
is a very very very soft touch
polycarbonate and the sides going all
the way to the top and the bottom are
made out of aluminum now let's see
quickly what we have here we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack a microphone
right beside that the microUSB port for
syncing and charging this is your SIM
card tray on the back we had that six
lens enabled PureView camera eight point
seven megapixels with carl zeiss lens on
the left there is absolutely nothing and
on the right you will find all your
buttons just like on every other Windows
Phone we have the volume rockers for
volume up and volume down the power
button and the two-stage camera button
and so that you can get a feel of the
dimensions of this phone and we'll just
put in side by side with some other
devices here this is the Samsung Galaxy
Note 2 then we have the HTC One and
let's have the Samsung Galaxy s4 here
also for a big happy family as you can
see it is almost as tall as the HTC One
let's remove the giganto phone and
replace it with the iPhone 5 and this
way you will see exactly how it stacks
up I'd say it's pretty much about the
same size as the Galaxy s4 it may be a
little little bit shorter and when it
comes to thickness and as you can see it
is somewhat thinner than the Galaxy s4
on the sides but it has the camera
protrusion on the back for the lens
let's power it up for the first time the
battery is non-removable
while it boots there's the vibration
while it boots will run down to the
specs we have a qualcomm snapdragon
processor clocked at 1.5 gigahertz this
version is the 16 gigabyte internal
storage version there's of course the
4.5 inch screen with 1280 by 768
resolution and the PureView camera on
the back with lots of software
proprietary to nokia to enhance the
camera experience and as it boots into
Windows Phone there's the boot up screen
and of course we don't have a sim
inserted we'll have a set up off camera
so folks that's gonna do it for today
this was the Nokia Lumia 925 unboxing
stay tuned we have a lot more coverage
