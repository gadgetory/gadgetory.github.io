here in the States the price has just
been slashed by a hundred bucks and it's
probably got the best camera you can
find on an Android smartphone add in the
excellent display and formidable feature
set and you're looking at a smartphone
that finally fulfills its promise of
being the next big thing but Samsung has
been trotting out that old line for
three years now and it's not selling
phones like it used to maybe what people
want is a phone that does a lot of what
the galaxy s6 does but cheaper a lot
cheaper enter the oneplus 2 the latest
in a Chinese smartphone line that
challenges our conception of what an
affordable flagship can be in 2015 but
does the oneplus 2 bring enough game to
keep pace with its South Korean
competitor let's find out I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is one
plus two vs. galaxy s6
anyone who says there's no difference in
smartphones these days has never put
these two side-by-side they have almost
nothing in common and that's apparent
from the moment you pick them up the
Samsung device is sleek and slender it's
glass and metal construction dominated
by curves and cool to the touch its
petite frame is built around a 5.1 inch
display that's one of the best we've
seen its quad HD resolution offers an
insanely high pixel density and it's
Super AMOLED technology makes for
perfect blacks colors that pop and a
very wide range of brightness settings
the phone features an outstanding build
- with great travel and feedback on the
buttons and a fit and finish that oozes
quality the oneplus 2 is a different
beast entirely it's larger in every
dimension nearly three millimeters
thicker and 26 percent more massive with
more angular corners and a changeable
back cover with options for various
wooden and Kevlar finishes or the
textured sandstone version seen here
it's built around a display that's
larger but lower in resolution it's full
HD rather than quad HD with 176 fewer
pixels every inch and it's LCD instead
of AMOLED now it's buttons may not feel
as expensive as Samsung's and it might
be a little rougher around the edges but
in the hand the oneplus 2 exudes a
similarly reassuring sense of quality in
nearly every measurable aspect Samsung
has the edge in hardware the Exynos
processor in the galaxy s6 is more
efficient than the 1 plus 2's Snapdragon
810 and you can get the galaxy in 128
gig option if you need a lot of local
storage there are more accessories on
the Samsung as well an IR transmitter
for controlling your TV integrated NFC
for mobile payments among other things
wireless charging high-speed wired
charging and a heart rate and blood
oxygen sensor for those intense workout
sessions if the oneplus 2 doesn't pack
any of those toys but that's not to say
it's bringing a knife to a gunfight its
higher-end trim offers 4 gigs of RAM
while Samsung tops out at 3
it's USB type-c connector is reversible
for more convenient plugging in and its
battery is 29 percent larger also see
the switch it controls the android alert
settings so you can adjust your ringer
volume without even looking at the phone
which sounds like a little thing but
it's really really nice in practice each
of these smart phones relies on a custom
software load to enhance an android
5.1.1 foundation and each has its own
advantages
once again Samsung comes to the table
with more toys its TouchWiz UI lets you
do things like run two apps side-by-side
it's s health fitness application takes
advantage of the built-in heart rate
sensor to give you a more complete
picture of your exercise routine and the
distinct look of TouchWiz can be tweaked
using a baked in theming engine the
oneplus 2 runs on a homegrown ROM called
oxygen OS that strongly resembles stock
Android while significantly improving on
its interface the oneplus 2 offers
capacitive keys
just like the galaxy s6 but here you can
program them to trigger a variety of
apps and functions depending on how long
or how many times you press them on the
oneplus 2 you can deploy the
notification tray just by swiping down
on an empty portion of the homescreen
you can wake or lock the phone with a
double tap on the cover glass fire up
the torch by drawing a V and choose your
own colors for the system accent and
notification LED also there's a max
audio tuner installed out of the box to
hone your headphone sound and you can
even program a double click of the home
button to launch the camera just like on
the s6 when it comes to that camera
you're getting a 16 megapixel sensor on
the galaxy s6 manufactured by either
Sony or Samsung depending on batch the
oneplus 2 is working with a 13 megapixel
omni vision sensor also optically
stabilized and bringing a slightly
smaller aperture but a slightly larger
pixel size the oneplus 2 also brings a
laser autofocus module and a dual LED
flash the s6 has neither on the software
side the Samsung viewfinder brings say
it with me more features
offering a wider range of shooting modes
and recording options without gunking up
the interface too much oneplus meanwhile
seems to stick with the derivation of
the Google camera app that's much more
elementary and it's also slower to
launch and focus as for the end result
our oneplus two review unit is running
pre-release software that's not the same
as the version that will land on store
shelves and we all know how big a
different software can make to a camera
so take these early impressions with a
huge grain of salt as you can see
daylight performance is often comparable
as far as color and exposure with the s6
doing a bit better on dynamic range and
sharpness where the oneplus 2 gets a
chance to stand out a little is an HDR
it's not as authentic as the s6 but it
looks like oneplus is injecting some
more color into its HDR results maybe
trying to overcome that washed out look
that sometimes results sometimes it
works out and sometimes it doesn't turn
the lights down and well the galaxy s6
isn't known as the king of Android
camera phones for nothing
same goes for video where the s6 offers
many more recording modes slightly
better stabilization higher saturation
and more graceful focus adjustment - and
one more time in case you missed it the
first ten times this is pre-release
software folks more sample footage
coming in the full review once we're
working with the final software built in
day to day use the oneplus 2 gets to
make up some ground the larger battery
plus the lower screen resolution do it
some favors in endurance while our
screen on time with the galaxy s6
usually hovers around three hours per
charge the oneplus 2 routinely sees us
through 4.5 hours of SOT and that's
after the added power penalty of running
with dual Sims in place Samsung does
make a dual-sim version of the s6 but
that's not the one we've got here
speaking of cellular networks as a phone
I've got few complaints with either of
these the earpieces strike a nice
balance between volume and clarity and
the bottom firing speakers while I'm
easy to accidentally block with the
finger are at least better than rear
mounted ones I do believe Samsung
invested in the better driver the
oneplus 2 speaker is a little tinny on
media playback no matter which audio
as for software responsiveness and
gaming performance well I made a point
in an editorial a number of weeks back
concerning what I felt to be the
overblown issue of thermal throttling in
the 1 plus 2's processor and not to
belabor that point too much but I told
you so the Snapdragon 810 may well be
running very inefficiently under that
casing it probably is but it doesn't
show and that's the important part the
oneplus 2 doesn't get any hotter in the
hand than the galaxy s6 does and it
doesn't seem to stutter any more than
the s6 either no matter what I'm doing
in my opinion the Samsung Galaxy s6 is
on the hole the better device here from
display to fit and finish to hardware
features two storage options to
preliminary image quality it's got the
oneplus 2 beat but here's the thing of
course it does even after the recent
round of discounts the galaxy s6 retails
for an average of three hundred dollars
more than the oneplus 2 let me say that
a different way the one plus two is
three hundred dollars cheaper than the
Galaxy S six given that massive
difference in cost the fact that this
boutique handset even gets close to
samsung levels of quality and even out
does it in some corners like battery
life is a testament to one plus so if
you're looking for the absolute top of
the line and don't mind charging your
battery pretty often our buy
recommendation on the galaxy s6 stands
but if you want or need to buy unlocked
and saving money is more important than
ticking off the boxes on a feature list
the oneplus 2 might just be the deal of
the year just get on the list for a
purchase invitation now if you want one
the buying process probably won't be
what you're used to
but-but-but before you do anything folks

the one plus two that's coming the week
