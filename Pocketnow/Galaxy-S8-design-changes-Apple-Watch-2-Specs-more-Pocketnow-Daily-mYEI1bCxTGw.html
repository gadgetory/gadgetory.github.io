ditch the flatscreen altogether other
words claimed that the Apple watch too
is getting slimmer with more sensors the
google nexus 6p continues to gain more
compelling the scans as we wait for more
I'm hi Mary vera and any similarities
with the lion king are strictly
coincidental this is parking out daily
official news today begin with deals if
you are in the market for the google
nexus 6p that is definitely close to a
revamp its little grape phone and find
it now on amazon and best buy for one
hundred and fifty dollars off we're
actually target about the 64 gig model
so yeah I would HIGHLY jump on that and
then just sell it on eBay later this
year or next year and speaking of deals
another compelling smartphone is the HTC
10 the company had an a hundred dollar
off deal recently that just ended but if
you still want the phone right now they
have the JBL aware seat aka USB type-c
really high quality headphones so what a
dollar value included if you buy the HTC
10 I got to test them out there frickin
awesome it comes to the hilarious topics
of the week one market that is currently
disrupting like crazy because of pokemon
go is the battery pack market believe it
or not two million battery of texts were
sold in two weeks ever since the pokemon
go game launch this is just a huge
eye-opener hopefully for smartphone
manufacturers fact that we actually need
phones with better batteries that's the
main reason why kids want to continue
playing and we definitely want to pony
up on that one get better battery for
our next smartphones hopefully that'll
be the case when it comes to the rumors
of the products that we are waiting for
the Apple watch to is definitely one of
them we expected to be announced along
with the next generation iphone and the
as to what to expect we aren't really
considering design changes we mostly
think that what we're getting is
actually a slimmer chassis according to
trusted sources in addition to better
water resistance and sensor is one of
the things that we didn't like about the
Apple watch one was the lack of GPS
apparently that will make the cut I just
hope they do figure out the battery life
on that one as well and finally the very
hot rumors today have to do with the
Samsung Galaxy S aid because we just
end of the galaxy note 7 rumor mill yeah
let's just talk about what to expect
next spring as a trusted analysts are
claiming that the galaxy s 8 will follow
the same trend of the galaxy note 7 and
completely ditch the flat screen
definitely that's something that Samsung
has been pushing for lately obviously
it's rather interesting to see that the
company wants to risk the fact that
there is a market out there are people
that really like flat displays I'm one
of them I have the s7 edge I have the s7
as well I've actually been using the
Galaxy s7 for a couple of weeks recently
for a recent comparison that we're
working on and I actually prefer the
flat screen more than the edge I just
feel it less cumbersome to operate for
day-to-day use but it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think do
you think that it's time for the flat
screen to die or do you think that there
should be a smartphone out there in my
case I do wish that they either figure 2
things they give me the curve display
with a thicker chassis for it to be
easier to hold or palm rejection
software or just bring the flash beam
all together it was a comment down below
