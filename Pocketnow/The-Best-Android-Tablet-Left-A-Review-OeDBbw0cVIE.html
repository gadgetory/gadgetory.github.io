Samsung's latest and greatest tablet
offering and also probably one of the
last Android tablets worthy of a
conversation in 2018 except well this is
actually not your typical tablet and I'm
not just talking about the Android
ecosystem I'm how you mad at me but I
would pocket now when this is our review
of the Samsung Galaxy Tab s 4 at a time
when tablets are on the client and iPads
reign supreme it's valid to question
just why companies would still invest in
Android tablets I mean even Google
abandon the market and the only reason
why that would ever make sense is if a
company is bold enough to grab Android
and then use it to create something
better I think that's the best way to
describe the Samsung Galaxy Tab s for to
a certain degree probably one of my
favorite parts of this tablet is
definitely the hardware this is probably
one of the most beautiful tablets that
I've ever used we've got an aluminum
border that's matched in the front and
back with glass and I do praise the fact
that even if this unit is wide in the
back the front is still black leading to
a more immersive experience consuming
content but that's not all we have a
gorgeous 10.5 inch Super AMOLED display
at 2560 by 1600 that is really stunning
if you join me in calling devices like
the Galaxy Note 9 as having the best
display for a smartphone this would
definitely be the tablet to assist with
the experience we've got four speakers
on each side tuned by AKG that are also
plenty loud and capable of Dolby Atmos
ears hearing Samsung repeating the same
catch phrase and the experience even
extensive the headphone jack which I'm
glad is still here and speaking of the
galaxy note there is a Wacom digitizer
on this display meaning the things that
you love about the Galaxy Note lineup
are also functional on this tablets for
productivity Samsung even takes the
concept a step further thanks to an
optional keyboard that makes it more of
desktop friendly whenever you need it
it has spacious keys and even a slot for
the S Pen to go on though more on that
after we talked about internals inside
is where things actually get mixed we
have last
here's Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 options
for 462 bytes of RAM and 64 or 256 gigs
of expandable storage we have a seven
thousand three hundred milliamp hour
battery that supports quick charge
through USB C and we also have benefits
like intelligent scan because there is
no fingerprint scanner here now if we
continue moving forward and talk about
software this is where things continue
to be mixed mainly because there are a
lot of great ideas here but not so much
of a great implementation I've never
really liked Android tablet so much
because I feel that software
applications don't really all take
advantage of what a tablet has when it
comes to an added canvas and this tablet
is really no exception in some cases
I'll admit I haven't even given much use
of the traditional Android approach on
this tablet instead I've spent most of
my time with this tablet index mode you
know ever since I saw Dex for the first
time using a monitor I was like huh this
would be a great idea on a tablet take
advantage of the larger canvas and make
it feel more like a desktop whenever you
need it and that's particularly what
this tablet can do at a glance it is
visually stunning I love how
applications become windows on the
screen that you can manipulate to your
heart's content I like the fact that
basic elements of Android are still here
but presented differently just to remind
you that this is still an Android tablet
and since this is a Galaxy Note to a
certain degree we have Samsung's UI
which I praised for its aesthetics and
features like smart things and Samsung
flow allow this tablet to communicate
with other Samsung devices that make it
feel more like an ecosystem so what's
the catch as it turns out Dex is a great
idea
the problem is that it wasn't really
designed for a tablet up to the point
where features like the Galaxy Note
services don't really work on Dex and
that's just one problem
you can't for example go handheld and
rotate the screen because Dex only
understands horizontal in one particular
direction the size of the icons is also
really small up to the point where you
need a mouse to operate them and even if
you can choose to use the s-pen the
experience can be a bit uncomfortable
then there's muscle memory a ton of the
icons at the bottom right don't look
familiar at all and if you're expecting
notifications to be a slide
from the top no they're not there
they're in a separate module along with
the quick toggle commands I even find it
annoying that the tablet has to boot
into Dex mode meaning it takes a little
while for it to happen and applications
that were open on the tablet user
interface don't necessarily open index
or at least not all the time for me and
then there's the keyboard I love the
design but I don't like how it works
the keys are just too sensitive I
actually tried using this tablet to
write my scripts on OneNote and then
highlight my progress on the s-pen and
well keys get repeated all the time and
then the keyboard shortcuts are not what
you're used to on a Mac or Windows and
then there's the problem that it's
actually too bulky so if you combine
this with this you'll end up with a
product that's thicker than a MacBook
which is not necessarily great but all
right I'm gonna cut this tablet some
slack not everything is bad there are
things I really like about it and it
starts with the battery life definitely
a tablet that you can use all day so
long as you're again used to either one
of these user interfaces performance is
also great with this tablet being able
to handle an insane amount of tasks on
either tablet mode or indexed and oh
please don't make me talk about the
cameras because yes photography is great
and it's really good for video calls but
you're not supposed to be using this
tablet for taking photos that being said
to conclude let me just put it to you
this way the Samsung Galaxy Tab s4 is
probably one of the best tablets that
I've reviewed in a while when it comes
to the Android ecosystem it looks great
it feels great and even if Android isn't
that great on tablets this is really as
good as it gets you know I'm a big fan
of stylus input as well so having Galaxy
Note features on a large canvas is
awesome
I just really wouldn't buy this tablet
for features like Dex if that was the
reason why you came to this video
thinking oh this could probably be the
reason I could make a move to an Android
tablet no the implementation is not
there the cool thing is that it's really
just the software update away probably
Samsung can notice that it could do a
better job and update it but then
because it has Galaxy Note features the
Wacom digitizer and Samsung is not
necessarily the best when it comes to
software updates I'm not gonna hold my
breath on that one
whatever the case may be I will admit
that I've enjoyed my experience with the
Samsung Galaxy Tab s for it's a
refreshing change from the grid of icons
on iPads at its price it's hard to
recommend over an iPad pro but at least
you have the alternative if you're
looking for one folks let me know what
