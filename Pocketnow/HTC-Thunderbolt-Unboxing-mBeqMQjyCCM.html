pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna unbox a phone that needs no
introduction although we're going to
give one the HTC Thunderbolt the first
4G phone running on the LTE network on
Verizon Wireless let's get to it alright
so here we go the moment of truth this
is probably the most important phone so
far of 2011 alright and when we rip off
this bubble right here and here we go I
have a blank looking box has HTC on the
front and 4G on the top of course that's
the the most important part of this
phone really is the 4G and let's see if
they've at have any specs on the back to
do it comes with a 32 gigabyte micro sd
card those are very expensive so it's
pretty impressive that the HTC and
Verizon are including a 32 gigabyte card
that's a lot of storage right off the
bat so you don't even have to go and get
a bigger card so I've got some really
cool red showing through here kind of
the colors of Verizon alright put that
aside for just one second see if there
are any surprises in the Box let's see
we have car charger whoo not a car
charger that would be cool thing for the
car Chargers win it just an HTC charger
and the USB cable oh and what is this
here 4G SIM card whoa that's cool looks
like it's already been put in the phone
so if you get a thunderbolt you're gonna
get a SIM card and it's so weird to see
SIM card and Verizon on the same package
as you know their CDMA network has never
used SIM cards but for 4G they are
making the switch to sim okay so let's
move everything out of the way and look
at the device yes we can remove this
tray first impressions the device is
definitely heavy but just like the
inspire 4G it is heavy because it makes
use of a lot of pretty cool materials so
I've got some metal over here with this
kickstand very high quality stuff okay
let's remove it turn it on for the first
time
now at my apartment I am pretty much on
the border of the 4G coverage if you
look at a 4G coverage map so it's
possible that right here
there's no 4G but if you walk outside
into the right there is 4G so we're
gonna have to see that let's turn it on
get it going maybe you run a preliminary
speed test this button is a little bit
small you know it's so strange that HTC
keeps changing the location of their
power buttons so if we take a device
like the inspire 4G which is in a lot of
ways the same phone as the thunderbolt
we see that the power button is changed
to the right side of the device we can
also see that the Thunderbolt is a
thicker phone than the inspire 4G now
people are criticizing Verizon a little
bit on the thunderbolt because they took
us long time to roll this out we first
thought it was going to come out in
February and then it was delayed a
little bit
Furber has it that they delayed it
because the 4G network wasn't really
ready for primetime they were finishing
some tests and things like that you know
we're fine with that
look at that animation Thunderbolt that
is awesome
we're fine with them delaying it if if
that means that their 4G network is
going to be ready when the phone
launches unlike AT&amp;amp;T which is launching
4G phones when there really is no 4G
network out there through our tests okay
so let's see what happens here we're
gonna zoom in on the screen will slide
off the inspire 4G and do a little bit
more in terms of comparison in just a
few minutes alright so it might not be
activated or maybe it is let's see what
happens okay it looks like we've got
full bars here while it's doing its
thing let's sort of move around the
device here and talk a little bit about
the hardware now so we've got a 1.3
megapixel front-facing camera of course
the inspire 4G did not have the
front-facing camera again it's quite
thick it's it's probably about as thick
maybe a little bit thicker than the Evo
we've got the microUSB port there for
syncing and charging 8 megapixel camera
dual flash record 720p video let's take
off the back battery cover curious to
see what what it looks like under there
looks like you're gonna have to pry this
off got it here so let's see what we
have here I'm assuming that the SIM card
slot is under the battery this has
huge battery it's about 1900 milliamp
hours compared to the battery on the
inspire 4G which is probably about 12 to
13 hundred millionth hours and you know
the inspire 4G has pretty good battery
life they needed to increase the battery
size for the Thunderbolt because 4G
faster data speeds that means more
battery being used up so they had to
bump that up let's move around see where
the micro SD slot is we'll have to take
another look at this let's see if we've
got any service on this guy pop that
back on there's no real metal back here
except for the kickstand whereas on the
inspire 4G the entire back is metal
which gives it a nice feel this is kind
of the soft touch rubber which is also
quite nice got some fingerprints on the
screen okay right now it's on 1 XR TT
obviously it's not quite it's not quite
ready yet let's go to a website Wow very
fast device that says 768 megabytes of
RAM it's a ton of ton of RAM and let's
see if it switches to hopefully 3G and
then 4G so they've included some stock
widgets here if the friend stream this
is a very fast phone it feels more
snappy than the inspire 4G strangely now
let's really quick see what version of
Android just so we know that there are
no surprises about phone ok so we are
software information there we go Android
2.2 point 1 the same as the inspire 4G
what I'm noticing is that these buttons
have a different sense to them if we
look at the inspire 4G you get you get
this extra sort of bezel here and over
here on the thunderbolt it's kind of
made a little bit smaller by this design
element which really doesn't do anything
it's just sort of a design cube but the
microphone is over here ok so right now
we're getting 3G it may flip on to 4G
but we're going to do a lot of tests
when this is on 4G because obviously you
want to know how fast is 4G we've got a
lot of tests coming up we're going to
compare this thing to the iPhone we're
going to compare it to the Samsung focus
on Windows Phone 7 and of course we're
going to compare
to the inspire 4G because if you're
looking for a 4G phone right now there
are and you want a 4.3 inch screen you
have a fair amount of choices the
inspire 4G and the Thunderbolt being two
of them so a lot more coming up on the
HTC Thunderbolt
subscribe to our channel so you can see
when the newest videos hit and we'll be
will be covering this a lot really
awesome phone please thumbs up this
video if you liked it and thanks for
watching that's it for now
