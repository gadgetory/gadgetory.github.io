settings but often in your security
options there's a feature on Android
called
app pinning or PIN windows or screen
pinning this handy little feature does
exactly what it sounds like it might
allowing you to lock one app on your
screen above the lock screen for your
phone on a nexus 5x head to Settings
then down to security and slide all the
way to screen pinning to activate this
feature on a Galaxy s7 you'll go to lock
screen and security than other security
settings and then pin Windows on an LG
g5 look under fingerprints and security
and on any other phones well you'll just
have to look around I suppose now when
you're in an app hit the multitasking
key and the top card in this list should
show a little thumbtack it that
thumbtack and that app is now locked on
your screen you can't back out of this
app you can't multitask out of this app
no home button no nothing exiting this
app requires a long press on the
multitasking key where you're taken to
your lock screen allowing you to unpin
and unlock your phone
I find this option to be helpful for
short situational issues like
turn-by-turn navigation while driving I
try not to handle my phone while
operating my car but occasionally an
arrant Touch might back me out of my map
or win streaming media pinning my
podcast app prevents accidentally
exiting the app or interrupting playback
and for folks with kids this could be a
handy way to let a child play a game or
watch a video without worrying that they
might get into other areas of your phone
it's a handy little feature buried in
your security settings which you might
not have known about but now you do so
get out there and get pinning are there
other features which your family and
friends should know about on their
phones drop us a comment below and maybe
we can help you spread the word for
example we just recently challenged our
audience to use their phones in
grayscale mode are you game to turn the
color off on your screen it's tougher
than it looks
