us the final design of the Galaxy S 10
nokia has an event for December and it
seems that we're getting three phones
and one of them could be awesome and if
you bought the new iPad pro we recommend
you treat it lightly because it bends
easily I'm Jaime meadow Iveta and I
guess I guess I'm gonna have to handle
it with care
this is pocket out daily sponsored by
tang the official news today begin with
deals as Google is already shining in on
Black Friday you can get discounts of up
to $150 off the pixel $200 off the pixel
3 and and that's the excel by the way
and there are obviously some other deals
when it comes to project Phi again Black
Friday is about to get crazy prepare as
most likely within the next few days
we'll have deals plus deals plus deals
we'll keep you posted now let's talk
about the a sous rog phone the phone
that I thought was going to launch a lot
earlier than the razor phone too and as
it turns out it's barely up for
pre-orders in the UK obviously you get
great bells and whistles and specs on
whatever you want but I'm still waiting
for things like my review unit for
example and that's actually hard to come
by
now hmd has just sent out press
invitations for an event to happen in
Dubai on December 5th HMD invitations
are fully accepted think about it is Lee
seem to have three new Nokia phones
being announced here and with the
setting link Dubai obviously we expect
that at least one of these devices
should be extravagant and it could be
that rumoured PureView smartphone 5
cameras whatever the case may be stay
tuned as I'm definitely looking forward
to it now let's move the spotlight over
to iPad pros and our buddies Zak and
jerryrigeverything you can trust this
guy to do whatever crazy things you
should not do with her products and what
he did was bend the iPad pro and bend it
rather easily and yes one of the major
selling points of that new iPad is just
how slim it is how easy it is to handle
but obviously it comes with a price tag
up I don't expect anybody to be carrying
an iPad in their pocket but I will tell
you this much I mean I carry it in a bag
along with computers in a lot of
Geir so i will tell you i am concerned
about this very expensive tablet bending
so yeah hopefully it doesn't but i don't
think it won't and finally the hot news
today i have to do with patents and the
possible design of the samsung galaxy s
10 as some have just emerged and they
seem possible and for those of you that
thought that the design of the camera
might be a cut out in the middle of
Haley it's gonna be in one of the
corners and it makes sense I mean
instead of interrupting the notification
tray in the middle why not just do it in
the corner and not bother with the rest
of it I feel that that's probably the
coolest way to design a cutout for a
camera without bothering the rest of the
user interface but let us know in the
comments down below what do you think do
you like this concept design well it's
not a concept it's a patent so do you
like this one or would you prefer any
other of the knotch options that we've
seen because in my case I think this is
probably the one I like the most
but leave us a comment down below we
love to know your opinion and before we
end this video let me tell you about our
awesome sponsor ting take this mobile
phone service differently there are no
startup fees no contract no plans best
of all you only pay what you use there's
a full nationwide LTE coverage and it
works with old phones as much as it does
with new ones
use code pocket now ENCOM to try it out
for free whether that's twenty five
dollars off your bill or a new phone

news earlier follow us I'm talking out
our kind of structure both our channels
