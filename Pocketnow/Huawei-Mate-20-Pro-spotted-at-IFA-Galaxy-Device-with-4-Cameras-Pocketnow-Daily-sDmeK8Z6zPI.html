been leaked showing off a triple camera
arrangement there's a possibility of
seeing a Samsung device with four rear
cameras before the end of the year and
the Google pixel 3 Excel was just
casually forgotten on the lift car over
the weekend yeah you heard that right
I'm high metal Iveta happy Labor Day
weekend to all of you in the United
States that are actually taking the day
off
I deserve a day off after this this is
parking out daily from FIFA the official
news today begin with the red hydrogen 1
camera as the Houdini project or the
program for those of you that
pre-ordered the smartphone early is now
available you have to opt in you'd get a
smartphone that's in beta you will be
able to test things like modules for
example where apparently there's this
like 5k module that's available that's
crazy from a smartphone definitely even
though we've been able to do 4k for a
while but there are so many things about
this product that we are really looking
forward to the problem is we don't know
exactly when we're getting the official
one now let's talk about Nubia as have
you've seen our hands on video over the
last couple of days I would consider
this to be the hottest thing that I've
seen an ephah surely I don't think that
it's ever gonna be a product even though
Nubia was very clear this is not a
concept it's a product and this is not a
SmartWatch it's a smartphone there's a
lot of cool in this product at least
visually it looks very sci-fi I just
don't know if it's a functional or not
let us know in the comments what you
think now let's talk about the Google
pixel 3 Excel I definitely believe that
this product is you know what we've been
seeing is Fager I don't know what but it
was now forgetting a lift in Canada once
again we get to see it in the case there
are photos of the phone that's all fine
and dandy but let's see in the end what
we get in the possible October event now
let's talk about Samsung as we don't
know exactly what the roadmap for the
company is over the next couple of years
of what we do here are the possibilities
of a device with four cameras and we
hear that it's gonna happen this year we
hear that the company is working hard on
a rebound for the s10 and everything but
apparently this device with the four
cameras is not going to be the galaxy s
10 up to the point where those four
cameras are apparently not too selfies
and two in the back apparently there's
gonna be some coal
different design here let's see in the
end of it happens or not stay tuned and
finally another one of the hottest news
today have to do with the huawei mate 20
pro we are just a couple of weeks away
from the October 16th event and guess
what was leaked here at Aoife apparently
somebody was spotted using a prototype
of the made 20 pro I didn't believe that
whole El arrangement of the cameras and
this and that but from the leaked photos
apparently this device is real and it's
brought that camera arrangement that
looks all great but let us know in the
comments what you think do you like this
whole design of the made 20 pro do you
think that Huawei is being bold and
different sheet different here I know it
was about to get stuck here there's no
what you think in the comments I will
tell you this much of that design is
real I really like it friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
us on pocketnow.com it's descriptor both
our channels English and Spanish for
more videos like this one can follow me
on Twitter Jaime underscore any that are
on Instagram that kind of leave it out
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I'm Jaime
mitigator thanks so much for watching we
will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
