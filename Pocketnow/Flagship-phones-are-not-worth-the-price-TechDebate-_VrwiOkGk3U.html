look at ways where we can expand on the
conversation of mobile technology to dig
deeper into some of these topics I could
set up some system where I try and
encapsulate opposing viewpoints all by
myself
ultimately they're just sometimes where
we want to have a human-to-human
conversation in real time this is going
to have a little structure to it we
introduce a premise one person will
debate for that premise another person
will debate against that premise each
master debater will have two minutes to
plead their case then there's going to
be a one-minute rebuttal and then it's
up to you to vote on who you felt had
the more convincing argument and to kick
off the series I could think of no
competitor better than to bring on the
man the myth the legend mr. Jaime or
Iveta host of the PocketNow daily and
sometimes contributor on the pocket how
weekly pod whenever I'm invited very
rare okay whatever you're in you're
always invited there're tweeted you
coast in the west coast
you've got crazy different schedule this
is a debate question that I think you
and I have ended up on opposite sides of
this debate at opposite times of phone
releases the premise for this debate is
premium flagship smartphones no longer
represent the best value and so we had a
we had a gentleman lead coin cost before
we jumped into producing this video and
Jaime is going to be taking a stance
against this premise I'm going to be
defending this premise and just being
the gracious host
I think I'm a should go first in
attacking the premise I'm going to give
them two minutes I'm going to take
another two minutes to sum up my
thoughts then we're going to have some
rebuttals and jump back in so I may are
you are you ready to attack yes sir age
before beauty oh sorry so instead of it
backwards sorry
hahahaha jerk alright so uh so he's
going to be attacking this premise he is
against the premise of this of this
debate I have I have two minutes up on
the clock here and I mean you you are
ready I'm going
all right so here we go two minutes and
begin here's the thing you have to be
very clear about what value is for some
people having a phone that just makes
phone calls is fine but that's not the
case for many of the people that follow
us for example or many of the people
that I know at least there are people
that want don't want to buy a separate
camera they don't really want to buy
phones every year I've gotten on subways
and I've noticed people using iPhone
force still today the reason why is
because flagships have the advantage
that they last a lot longer they are
more future proof you're buying into the
latest and greatest hardware and
therefore it will be number one the one
that's most supported in most cases I'm
not going to name companies that don't
but it's also going to be the case where
you're literally getting the best that a
company can offer and so I've noticed
one very important difference one is for
example camera quality there is a huge
insane difference between the quality of
photograph from a high-end flagship than
from a mid-range err the second would be
that peace of mind that when you buy
that phone it's most of the time more
durable most of the time like you've
never heard milspec 810g coming to a
mid-range er yeah you're gonna I know
you're going to mention a few there but
those are really ugly I'm not going to
include those and then the third thing
is the peace of mind like for example if
you're in New York you have to rely on
public transportation at some point it's
raining weather is unpredictable ip67
ip68 water industry system they make
your life so much easier you don't have
to worry about a lot of things with a
flagship I do run away
what 30-second warning 30-second warning
really you're going to do that all right
let me talk to us you had two minutes
that's the whole point of the debate
listen I feel that their agenda 15
seconds now and whatever value in the
value that's pertinent to me I care
about photography I care about a phone
that always looks good and I always care
about carrying the latest and greatest
because I want it to be future proof
over time for me flak chips are the way
to go and set I let you go for seconds
over I'm a really nice guy like that do
you have a timer you can pull up if you
want me to
let me yeah take your chute no hold on
it's not going to be therapy do it how
would you know let me look for one like
bend lime let me look for one here we go
here we go okay timer okay I am set go
so I know I upset a lot of people when I
call phones like the 1 plus 3 a mid
ranger but in this grand scheme with
phones from $100 to phones that are now
costing somewhere around $1000 it's in
that middle point where I feel we get
the absolute best value for your cash so
- a lot of high makes points you might
lose out on things like design and style
a lot of these phones are going to look
like the unholy love child of HTC and
Apple deciding to make low rent children
to put out into the populace but you
can't deny the fact that we're already
seeing them reach parity with things
like display resolution with the
chipsets that they're incorporating into
these phones the Galaxy s8 was a late
entry this year it's got the benefit of
this really super great processor but in
terms of future proofing you're on the
pulse you're not that far behind and
ultimately these companies want to
compete for your money more aggressively
so not only are we getting great you
know support warranty stuff like ZTE
with their screen replacements those
companies are also putting in killer
features you might not have all of the
features be killer but if you want
awesome audio the axon 7 is really
second to none except for maybe the b20
when it comes to the headphone jack
you want to killer Tamara you can go
with something like the honor rate for
some of the best still photography that
I've ever seen if you're looking to
really stretch that dollar you're
looking to really maximize that purchase
I think you also get some of the best
support for some of these phones
especially because of some of those
drawbacks like not having super
aggressive skins and zombies that Oliver
we're injected into them so then you end
up with faster releases you end up with
faster Android updates like the 1 plus
3t already on 7.1 where the Galaxy s8
launched with 7.0 you want to stretch
that dollar mid range is the way to go
good time 12 seconds left to spare any
last words before I come whoo and I see
by 12 seconds see i seated my twelve
seconds ahead of time so that you could
wrap up your point
in putting that all together excellent
points all the way around I really
appreciate what you had to say there
Jaime so I think this is the proper time
for us to take a short rebuttal so let's
take 60 seconds and you can reply to
anything that I said or if you want you
can also expand on some of your ideas
because I know we were running right up
against that time limit there are you
ready for your rebuttal sir yes sir all
right one minute on the clock and begin
I got your points I agree with some of
them and that's the reason why I
mentioned at the beginning there is a
market for everyone BMW is not going to
sell to the mainstream but there is a
purpose I mean think about brands like
volvo for example a lot of the ingenuity
that volvo has brought into the
automotive market has defined technology
for the future the thing about flex just
says they're not going to go away these
are the vanguard phones that allow other
companies to know what they can do how
reflections don't exist technology is
not going to push itself the Galaxy Note
one did not exist once people would have
not followed the trend of phablets at
some point I feel that it has to
continue right now we're dealing with 18
by 9 displays it's going to take mid
Ranger's a while to catch up and I'm not
saying that it's a standard right now
but again a lot of these standards were
born with black ships particularly in
photography for example I feel that
black ships are necessary and the market
should continue and clear for seconds to
spare nicely summed up sir you got a one
minute timer for me there we go give me
a second
ready let me know alright I'm set go so
I totally appreciate you know the idea
of BMW you're buying into an idea of
luxury there but then I also look at
products like a Louie Vuitton and I'm
not saying there aren't returns when you
start creeping north of that four or
five hundred dollar price point I'm
saying are those those returns are
diminishing you're getting less and less
if you start climbing higher and higher
and price and that that relationship
isn't really a linear curve I'm you know
isn't a straight line curve as far as
I'm concerned I think it's got a little
bit more of a parabola going on so again
I feel like you know I can invest a
certain amount of money for a certain
tier and then I'm going to start
spending more and more and more and I
feel like I'm getting less than
unless for that purchase you know I
think ultimately the the concession has
to be on something like labeling and
branding I don't want to take that away
from people who walk don't walk around
with Louis Vuitton bags or you know I
rock my Levi's 501 I bought I spent more
on my 501s because I knew what I was
getting a durable product that is sort
of timeless for my style but that also
doesn't mean that I want to spend five
six seven hundred dollars on a designer
pair of jeans like I don't really feel
like I've gotten that much more for my
purchase by spending much more money I
forgot to give you your warning your
times up Oh playing dirt oh that was an
appropriate place you had 12 oh that was
inappropriate place all right all right
yeah I was like I was an appropriate
place to go ahead and leave off I think
I think people watching the video
they've gotten my point there and maybe
that just has to be an extra bonus point
of consideration when people are
tallying their vote first of all at the
end of this video and so now it's up to
you it's up to you to vote in the viewer
poll if you look in the upper right hand
corner of this screen you're going to
see four options when you saw the
premise of this video I'm sure you as a
viewer had an idea of how you were going
to respond to that premise premium
smartphones no longer represent the best
value you had an idea audience member
and so if you agreed with that premise
before we started speaking or if you
disagree with that premise before we
started speaking we're either of us able
to change your mind so you're going to
see those four options I agree with the
premise and I still agree with the
premise I agree with the premise and now
I disagree with the premise I disagreed
with the premise and I still disagree
with the premise and I disagreed with
the premise but now I agree with the
premise I love your vote we're going to
follow this up I know it's a little bit
of tricky math in there but we want to
hear from you definitely drop some
comments down below this video this is a
series that we hope to expand on because
this type of interaction we have some
structured ideas we have some thoughts
and then you all get to weigh in you all
get to vote on how you feel one of us
might have been more convincing than the
other as always folks thanks so much for
watching be sure to tune in to future
tech debates we're going to have Jaime
on again absolutely we're looking for
other guests that I think will be
interesting too
you partake in this type of mano-a-mano
fisticuffs exchange of ideas you're
going to be seeing other producers here
from pocket now I'm sure and I think
this is going to be an exciting way to
dig deeper into some of these ideas and
some of this nuance for pocket now in
Ponte Carlos bag now I'm hiya Meadowvale
I'm at some gadget guy on Twitter
hi Matt underscore Iveta thank you so
much for watching we'll catch you all on
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
