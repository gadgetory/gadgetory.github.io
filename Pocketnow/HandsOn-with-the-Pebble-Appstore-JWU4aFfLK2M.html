limited in functionality but that's soon
gonna change I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is a hands-on with
the pebble app store while pebble is
currently the front-runner in the
wearable category many feel the
SmartWatch has lacked in certain areas
officially until now pebble has done
little more than deliver notifications
to your wrist and tell time some
third-party developers got clever and
found different ways to bring more
functionality to the SmartWatch but
discovering those apps and sometimes
getting them up and running was a bit
tricky however for the next major OS
update pebble 2.0 pebble aims to change
that with the pebble app store a
centralized location where you can find
watch faces and watch apps alike we've
already spent some time using the latest
pebble tirado betas and showed you some
of our favorite 2.0 watch apps for
android last week but this time it's
official and it doesn't require
searching the web high and low for
compelling applications for pebble first
know that this is not final software
it's a pre-release version of the App
Store as well as beta software on the
pebble also note that this pebble app
store preview is only available for iOS
at the moment but we're told the App
Store for Android will be available very
soon now that that's out of the way what
can you expect from the new App Store
well we've got a few minutes of hands-on
time at CES for a pebble CEO Erik
Menshikov ski showed off some of the
cool new features including partner
applications Yelp Foursquare ESPN and
GoPro let's take a second to look at
some of those in more detail with the El
you can get restaurant reviews straight
on your wrist as well as the ability to
discover nearby nightlife coffee shops
mechanics drug stores and shopping spots
if you have the discover mode enabled
while within the up app a flick of the
wrist will pull a random nearby location
whereby you can then get more
information such as reviews the address
or contact number the ESPN app also puts
need-to-know information straight on
your wrist you can get live scores
straight on your pebble pressing the up
and down button scrolls through current
and upcoming games and pressing the
select button in the middle takes you to
settings where you can then choose your
league set the Refresh interval and
invert the colors of the app and
Foursquare makes checking in incredibly
easy using your phone's GPS signal
checking in is as simple as opening the
Foursquare app on pebble scrolling up
and down to find your location and
hitting the select button in the middle
but where the real magic happens is
within the new pebble app store there
are three sections my pebble get watch
faces and get apps under get watch faces
all compatible watch faces are available
divided into three sections all
most-loved and pebble picks tap on a
watch face to open its page and click
Add to install the app section is
understandably a little more detailed
and categorized daily tools and
utilities notifications remotes Fitness
and games are the six main categories
and their featured in four different
sections all most loved weekly top picks
and pebble essentials you'll find apps
that do everything from remote camera
controls for your iPhone to sleep
monitors and games
there are currently twenty games ranging
from brain twisters like Sudoku and
chess to more casual stuff like
asteroids you can choose up to eight
watch faces and apps in total on pebble
and once the pebble is full additional
watch faces and apps will be stored in
your pebble Locker pebble locker and
installed watch faces and apps are
managed in the my pebble menu you can
scroll left and right to get a visual
preview of all the installed watch faces
and apps on your pebble as well as the
apps in your locker tap one to bring up
a pop-up window from there you can load
unload or delete the watch face or app
and if there are configuration settings
a configuration button will be available
in the pop-up or beneath the selected
watch face or app some examples of
configurable watch faces are modern one
of our favorites we covered last week
pebble Mars a live updating feed of
pictures from the Mars Curiosity rover
and studio cloth within modern for
example you can invert colors turn off
the second hand to preserve precious
battery and customize the date and
weather appearance so far the pebble app
store has nearly 1,000 apps available
with over 6,000 registered developers
all of those applications at least in
the pebble app store are currently free
however developers can require a paid
companion application on Google Play or
App Store
thanks to the pebble app store that may
be something we see more of in the
not-too-distant future but if it brings
more functionality to our wrists
we won't complain after just a short
while with the AppStore installed the
usability and functionality of our
pebble has increased significantly along
with the user experience it feels more
complete and truly streamlines the
process of finding watch faces and apps
not to mention the locker has helped
offset the small amount of storage which
limits the number of applications which
can be installed at once by adding the
ability to quickly swap out commonly
used applications we're definitely
excited to see what new capabilities
this will bring to pebble that's gonna
do it for this video if you enjoyed it
