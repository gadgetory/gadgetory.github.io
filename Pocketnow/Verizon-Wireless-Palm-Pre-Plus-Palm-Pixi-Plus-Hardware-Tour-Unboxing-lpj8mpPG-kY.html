going to be doing an unboxing and
hardware tour at the verizon wireless
palm pre plus and the palm pixi plus
both models are available exclusively
starting on january twenty fifth through
verizon wireless the palm pre plus and
pixi plus both offer enhancements
incremental upgrades compared to their
sprint counterpart the original palm pre
and pixi let's go ahead and first do an
unboxing and hardware tool of the palm
pre plus and then we're going to go
ahead and do the same with the palm pixi
plus so let's go ahead and take a look
at the palm pre plus on the outside you
have an attractive vellum sleeve and the
palm pre like packaging that debuted
with the original palm pre on sprint's
network removing the box or the top lid
you have the device here which has a
glossy finish front and a matte backing
very attractive and feels very
comfortable in the hands let's go ahead
and set that aside the device rests on
top of a molded plastic tray inside you
have a getting started guide a gesture
guide and some consumer information
about radio frequency and safety there's
also a pamphlet with a picture of the
device turn on with the cards on the
webos engine on the back it shows palm
resources and ways to contact palm for
help and setting up the device lifting
up on another vellum tray you have here
it looks like a wall charger that
connects to the device via a USB cable
also peasant stereo headphones a USB
cable to micro USB so you can connect it
to your wall charger or your computer to
charge and sync the palm pre plus
there's also a swated leather sleeve to
protect the device and from scratches
the device now has up to 16 gigs of
storage memory of which 15 case is
accessible to the user this is up from
the eight gigs on the original palm pre
it looks like palm
has addressed some of the user
complaints on the original pre with a
more solid and stable sliding mechanism
the slider reviews in portrait mode a
keyboard and it looks like the keys
although are similar to the original pre
on sprint now has more of a clicky feel
rather than the mushy feel of the
original palm pre keyboard on the left
hand side of device you have the volume
up and down switch moving up to the top
you have in the center Adrian hat
millimeter headphone jack a vol our
ringer silence or switch and on the top
right corner here you have the power
button on the right hand side you have a
flap here which lifts up to bring to
reveal the micro USB charging port or
for charging and syncing on the back
side device you have a 3 megapixel
camera with autofocus and enhance depth
of field along with an LED flash and
speakers on the other side there is a
depression here on the bottom which you
can push in with one finger and run your
fingernails along both sides of the
device to remove the map battery cover
which reviews a touchstone compatible
battery cover so you only need to
purchase the touchstone charging dock
which attaches to the device
magnetically which is a nice touch so
you don't have to purchase a separate
touchstone compatible battery cover the
touch screen measures 3.2 inches
diagonally with 320 x 480 resolution and
24 bits of color supported so it is very
crisp and vivid inside you have 16 gigs
of storage capacity also the RAM is
doubled compared to the palm pre so
things should be a little bit snappier
you have the excellent Palm synergy
engine which integrates all your
contacts into one application which is
nice also gone from the original palm
pre is the center home button here is
that you get this to power this touch
sensitive strip here which acts in a
similar way as the original home button
on the palm pre with more RAM things
will scroll through
very smoothly and also opens up doors
for 3d gaming courtesy of the devices
power v3 graphics processor along with
palms on sdk the device is very
attractive and addresses on some of the
complaints with the palm pre chiefly the
sliding mechanism and the mushy keyboard
there is very minimal branding the
verizon wireless logo here is actually
from the screen which is flash the only
other branding that we see is on the
back side where the palm logo is on the
back battery cover and here you have the
verizon logo on the back of the slider
which is imprinted on a mirror-like
finish perhaps for taking self-portrait
so let's go ahead and take a look at the
palm pixi plus now which employs a
similar packaging style or the same
packaging style rather that the palm pre
uses let's go ahead and remove the
plastic screen cover the palm pixi plus
compared to the palm pixi is relatively
similar on the outside you do have
similar guides that the original or that
the pre plus comes with inside
accessories are a little bit more scarce
you only have the USB to microUSB charge
and sync cable along with a wall charger
you do not get headphones and there is
no protective swated sleeve for the pixi
plus the pixi plus has a smaller 2.63
inch diagonal screen that has a
resolution of 320 x 480 bits of color
which is down from the 24 bits on the
pre plus removing the unibody like
rubber plastic rubber battery cover you
see that there it's not a touchstone
compatible battery cover here the device
on the back has a 2 megapixel camera
with with a LED flash and only mono
speaker similar to the
creeper the original prion spread like
the Sprint model and the pics in law or
the like the sprint pixie model and the
pre plus model you have the same
capacitive strip here instead of the
home button the physical home button the
keyboard here is a little bit raised and
offers more travel it's a nicer feel I
think than the both the pre and the pre
plus software wise it's very similar you
do get the synergy engine that
integrates contacts and calendars nicely
and the screen is also very gorgeous
different from the original pixie you
have 16 gigs instead of the 18 gigabytes
of storage and also included with the
pixi plus is Wi-Fi so Wi-Fi is
significant in both the pre plus and the
pixi plus in that the mobile hotspot
application will be available in palms
app catalog which will turn both devices
into a mifi like device allowing you to
share your verizon wireless broadband
connection mobile broadband connection
with up to five other devices you can
tether wirelessly one on the go the
downside of that is verizon wireless
will be charging for the features on
both the palm pre plus and the pixi plus
on top of your voice plan you do have to
add on a thirty dollar data plan just
for smartphone usage and if you use the
mifi like tethering capabilities over
Wi-Fi Verizon Wireless will tack on
another forty dollars on top of your
voice plan so that will give you five
gigabytes of data transfer per month and
overages are charged at five cents per
megabyte both devices are attractive the
palm pre plus has a very organic and
comfortable feel to it in the hands on
the device is shorter than the pixi plus
and a lot of comparisons can be made
between these two devices and the Sprint
counterparts both devices will be
available on January 25th the pre plus
will be available for 150 dollars on a
two-year contract
through verizon wireless as a more
high-end device the entry-level
smartphone the pixi plus will be
available for ninety-nine dollars on
verizon wireless with a two-year
contract so this is chang winnin this is
a quick tour of the hardware on both the
palm pre plus and the pixi plus thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
