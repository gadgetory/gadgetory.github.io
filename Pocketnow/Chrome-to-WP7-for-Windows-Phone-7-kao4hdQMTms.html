pocket now calm if you use the Chrome
browser on your computer you've probably
heard of Chrome to Phone this simple
extension has previously been released
for Android and it lets you quite simply
send links from your web browser to your
Android phone with one click so this is
perfect if you want to read a post later
or there's something that you want to
take a look at while you're on the road
you don't have time to look at it on
your main computer you hit a button it
goes to your phone boom one step now for
Windows Phone 7 the same functionality
is finally available for free and in
this video we're going to talk about it
let's get to it okay so the program is
called Chrome to Windows Phone 7 here
it's free I've already set it up and it
literally took two minutes the
application will give you a code that
you plug into the browser so here I'm
going to go to a page and let's say I
want to check out the lg optimus 7
review maybe later I'm on my way out
somewhere and I want to read this on my
phone so I'm gonna press this button in
the upper right corner here hopefully
you can see it it says Chrome to Windows
Phone and watch what happens on my phone
ok I've just clicked it and there it is
and got a pop-up notification it uses
Windows Phone 7 pop-up notification I
can swipe it out of the way if I want or
I could actually action on it let me go
to another page here and you can see
what it's like when you actually tap on
the notification swipe it away like I've
just done so again I'm going to go up
here to the little windows sign and I'm
gonna hit chrome to foam it's gonna say
complete and let's say I'm doing
something else I'm scrolling around on
my phone could be doing anything there
it is the notification right on the top
hopefully you can see that if I tap on
that it will bring me to the application
and it'll show me a list of all of the
links that I've set to my phone and
here's a list of past history so I can
go back and see the ones that I've sent
to my phone and of course from here you
can just tap on something and it's going
to open up the web browser and show you
the page so a really really cool tool if
you have Windows Phone 7 it's called
Chrome to WP 7 it's free and it works
really great if you use the Chrome web
browser on your computer please thumbs
up this video if you liked it and thanks
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
