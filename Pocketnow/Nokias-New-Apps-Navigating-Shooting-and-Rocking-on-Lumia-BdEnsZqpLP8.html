now this is Tony behind the camera we're
still at mwc 2013 at the Nokia booth and
yesterday Nokia didn't just announced
new hardware it announced some new
software initiative on Windows Phone
specifically some apps that had
partnered with others to build or some
that it's just showcasing on its Lumia
devices let's head inside and check them
out so the first thing we'll start with
is something very very basic here map
sweet now this is something nokia
announced yesterday the none of these
apps between here maps here Drive plus
beta and here transit are new they are
the same Nokia Maps Nokia transit nokia
drive plus beta you've come to know and
either love or loathe depending on your
experience but what's important about
this is not just that they've been
rebranded with an accessible you know
easy to remember name it's that because
they no longer carry the exclusively
Nokia branding they're available across
all windows phone devices that means
Samsung means HTC presumably it means
while way that we haven't confirmed that
ourselves especially here transit which
I really really love Nokia transit if
you live in a city that's covered with
with public transit then this is a
really indispensable app if you don't
want to go third party and it really is
beautiful obviously we have some network
issues in here but there it is yeah so
at any rate really probably the most
important takeaway from this is that
Nokia is broadening their offerings and
including other platforms in it and we
think that's a really cool thing for the
Windows Phone 8 platform and ultimately
for nokia as well and over here on the
other side of the booth we've got music
on lumia this is being demoed on a Lumia
720 this is actually nokia music+ and
you're not going to see a plus on the on
the icon we happen to the apple we've
seen nokia music before we're very very
familiar with this but what's nice on
this is if you hop on in the settings
you hid upgrade you're given the option
to try nokia music+ and this has several
kind of interesting improvements to the
base experience first of all it's not
it's not free you certainly pay for it
it's for euro a month in European
countries is four dollars a month of you
in the United States but what this does
is if you're listening to mix radio and
you want to skip a track instead of
limiting you to say six skips as the
current implementation does you have
unlimited skips your
instead of just downloading for mixes in
the basic implementation you can
download an unlimited number of mixes in
the new one and your streaming all that
music and a much higher bit rate whereas
before you were confined to 32 bits
kilobits per second you are now is
streaming at 192 which is obviously a
much higher quality experience and
something that real audio files will
will definitely appreciate particularly
if you're listening to it on some
headphones that are that are worth
something and finally the last
improvement we're going to note which we
can't demo on this particular one is
synchronized lyrics so if you're
streaming a song and you're listening to
music and you have that very familiar
moment we're like what did that the
singer just say the music the lyrics are
actually being synced directly on the
screen in sync with the music which is
really awesome you can get that on some
third-party apps and other platforms but
they have it integrated with nokia
music+ it's a big deal there are more
improvements but we're going to finish
up on one that is a personal favorite of
mine the GoPro integration on the new
one this is a in the partnership with
the GoPro company that makes very rugged
and very tiny outdoor cameras and very
durable cameras this is an app that is
built for lumia it is not exclusive to
Windows Phone you can see this app on
other platforms what it allows you to do
is remotely control the camera it
doesn't function on this demo unit but
you can remotely control the camry you
can start it rolling you can cut and you
can see what the camera is rolling live
what's interesting though what's most
interesting to me is if we have a look
at the demo video here this is kind of
how the app you can you can change
resolution on the fly you can change a
lot of camera settings remotely is
through Wi-Fi direct you don't need a
cellular connection and what's awesome
and what we're told is exclusive to
lumia on this is not only can you see
what the camera is rolling you can also
shoot a second angle from the phone
cameras simultaneously so you can be
shooting a video from from two angles at
the same time using a GoPro remotely
from a nokia lumia device that's awesome
it shows what you can do when you invest
a little bit of time and effort and
probably money into building a
customized app experience once again i'm
