on video or so it seems the HTC perfumed
flat chip specifications get mentioned
in reports and it seems that we're still
too far away from folding displays I'm
hi Mary vera and if you can't wake up
early don't keep trying just don't this
is parking out daily when it comes to
the official news today it's really
about Microsoft and both good and bad
things in the good sense hey if you want
to surface three it's currently
discounted around 150 bucks if you want
the hundred twenty eight gigabyte burien
which is good but then again for those
of you using the surface pro 4 or
surface pro 3 there is a recall and
power adapters because apparently it is
a fire hazard and there's just so much
more to know about how to qualify to get
a replacement links in the description
as Microsoft has already confronted
they'll will be recalling them you know
a really cool thing about starting a new
year is analytics yeah I know I'm
kidding but hey we get a lot of that
right now particularly because we know
exactly what happened in 2015 what to
expect for 2016 and just like we heard
about smartphone sales for this year now
we hear about what to expect for app
downloads as we've got analytics already
confirming that number one even though
the google play store selling or should
I say downloading twice as many apps as
iOS that sort of makes sense because
there are a lot more android phones in
the market than iphones but then when
you start looking at these stats from a
money perspective Apple is actually
making twice the money and we would love
to know in the comments down below why
you think that is and for all three of
you that fell in love with the idea
foldable displays coming out an h2 of
2016 because holding your phone is
something you actually like doing for
some people I guess well we've got some
very interesting trusted sources
claiming that apparently it's not going
to happen apparently the technology is
not there yet they're having issues with
finding the right amount of radius for
you to actually be able to fold a
display or phone and even though we
still haven't seen the first foldable
battery out there for that to actually
work or foldable materials like aluminum
stay tuned the parent
it'll happen in 2017 now now let's talk
about HTC even though the company has
claimed that their whole vibe project is
more important than smartphones we do
know that the company wants to make a
comeback in smartphones and the HTC
codename perfume is going to be part of
it we have rumors that the phone might
not be ready for mwc which is okay I
mean hey as long as they announce
something early this year will make
sense but we also hear another thing
which is rather interesting it seems
that we will get two flavors of
processors which would kind of be a
first for hcc not necessarily that we
have seen previous case but apparently
the Snapdragon 820 will be an optional
variant in addition to a MediaTek
variant so we kind of know that mediatek
bear health is probably gonna be for
China stay tuned hopefully we learn more
and mwc at least some teasers and
finally the very hot news today all
around have to do with the iphone mini
there is this video that leaks the
iphone mini in theory and if you trust
the video which i kind of don't it seems
that it'll look identical to an iphone
6s which is rather bad because well hey
it's not like if the design of the
iphone 5s was bad to actually change it
and bring these horrible antenna lines
and everything but it seems that that's
what apple wants to do but the reason
why i kind of don't believe in these
leaks is because this phone doesn't look
any different to a 4.7 inch iphone up to
the speaker grills which is rather not
logical there should be some scaling
here just like we see with the iphone 6s
plus but it leads me to the question of
the day do you believe in these leaks
and if you do would you like an iPhone
that's smaller and it looks identical to
the current models because in my case I
don't believe it and no but leave us a
comment down below hey I could be wrong
