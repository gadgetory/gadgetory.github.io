pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to show you one of the most
graphically impressive games that has
been optimized for the retina display on
the iphone 4 it's called Archer type
it's a multiplayer first-person shooter
and let's uh let's get to it are you are
ok so this game costs 299 in the market
and I'd say it's definitely worth it
it's a multiplayer game that works very
well over Wi-Fi let me just show you
instead of tell you so there's a whole
story behind here but I'm going to skip
past that and just get to the gameplay
and the controls are really really good
considering this is on a mobile phone
without any hardware buttons or
joysticks ok so I'm going to start match
and I'm going to do a team deathmatch so
it's going to happen now is it's going
to populate the game with about 10
players and this takes about 60 seconds
but right now we're over Wi-Fi you can
do this over 3g but it's not as fast we
have a countdown until the game begins
so I'm going to skip ahead ok so here we
are and the controls work much like the
xbox 360 the joystick on the left
someone just shopping the joystick on
the Left controls the movement the
joystick on the right controls your aim
and you want to get the crosshairs lined
up in front of your enemy and down here
we have a little radar that shows you
where the other guys are so I'm looking
for orange dots and I'm going to walk
towards an orange dot and it's going to
be an enemy but the graphics as you can
see are really really amazing I'm not
too good at shooter games so that's why
I keep dying you can also throw grenades
if you have someone long distance you
can tap up there and boom explosion you
can also change weapons if you find
another weapon to use let me try to find
one to show you how that goes get a
shotgun and some really crazy weaponry
so I'm going to try to kill this guy
I shouldn't probably stand there but I
killed him so there we go okay here's a
weapon what you do is you stand on top
of it and I already have that weapon so
it's not letting me pick it up so we're
to move around a little bit more but
really really impressive graphics for
for the iPhone and this isn't killing my
battery as you may think it is with such
high intensity graphics here so so
pretty cool again this is called
archetype it's three dollars which is
there is a reasonable price it's really
tuned very well for multiplayer and you
don't have to really do anything but
wait in the lobby and you are hooked up
with a variety of other people who want
to play this game that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
