premium Windows Phone experience on
Verizon Wireless began and ended with
the Lumia icon from Nokia well this
morning at a press event in NYC HTC
changed the score announcing a new
version of its well-received One m8
smartphone now powered by Windows and
now in our hands
i'm michael fisher with pocket now let's
unbox it and take a first look
Microsoft HTC and Verizon are
positioning the One m8 for Windows as a
premium device and the packaging
reflects that though minimal it's classy
and sharp and the box materials
definitely don't feel cheap the bundled
accessories are nearly exactly the same
as you'll find with the Android version
of the one with a 1.5 amp charger USB
cable and the included earbuds were
always thankful to see included with a
high-end smartphone as we described in
our first impressions post at
pocketnow.com in every respect to its
Android counterpart right down to the
brushed detailing on the gunmetal gray
finish which is just as smooth and
upscale in the hand as ever this back to
the same to see our post at
pocketnow.com
how're it up and tap your way through
Verizon's setup assistance and the
Microsoft DNA shines right through the
new One m8 runs Windows Phone 8.1 1 out
of the box with 25 gigs free of the
on-board 32 gig allotment the usual
Windows Phone enhancements like the
Cortana voice assistant are here an HTC
is also ported its blinkfeed social and
news streaming app to the platform not
to be left behind
Verizon has also bundled its NFL mobile
app along with free live streaming games
all season long to those who add the One
m8 for Windows 2 they're more everything
planned when we consider this phone
alongside the Lumia icon we're a little
concerned about the lack of some Nokia
exclusive apps and we'll be interested
to see how well the
well camera does on Windows Phone as
well on the flip side it's really nice
to use Windows Phone on hardware this
gorgeous and we're very much looking
forward to giving it the full review
stay tuned for that then for the usual
in-depth comparisons here on YouTube and
at pocketnow.com until next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now

watching and we'll see you real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
