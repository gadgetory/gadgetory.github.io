pocketnow.com here in Barcelona and the
BC Tony on camera illusion somewhere out
there getting us coffee and guess what
this is our unboxing review of the Sony
Xperia S which was launched today for
sale here at Barcelona and whoa what do
we think of it starting from now well
this is sony design 2012
this is sony design 2011 there's a huge
difference let's talk about it
okay so the difference between Sony
devices last year was a lot of plastic
honestly terrible hardware flimsy the
screen was not great hardware buttons
and obviously they've changed the line
this year let's start talking about the
Xperia S which was launched today let's
start our unboxing just pull the flap
here okay
nothing here okay here we go
this is the Xperia S we got it in white
because obviously we're not fans of
fingerprint magnet so let's move this to
the side let's go through the box see
what we got here
we've got well good question not sure
what that is
literature I guess a lot of literature
and we've got some sort of a screen
protector which I obviously hate and
some cleaner cloth somewhere there let's
continue going here we've got o NH mini
HDMI to HDMI cable awesome it's got HDMI
out so it's great to have the cable and
I'll have to pay for it let's continue
here we've got a micro USB cable yeah
for charging see here in ear headphones
good quality or not it's well it's gonna
be my daily driver for the next couple
of days so we'll see and obviously we've
got the European adapter through USB
because we're in Europe so let's move
this aside let's start talking about the
Xperia S so far well this is plastic at
the back it's not really the most
amazing plastic yeah very flimsy very
cheap but if you could see the battery
is non-removable this is a seven
seventeen thousand sorry 1750 milliamp
hour battery micro sim jack right here
we've got a 12 megapixel camera with a
LED flash and this is the Exmor R sensor
camera it's a great camera apparently
we'll see about that and kind of funny
their branding this is a sony in well
this then snapping well let's try to
snap it back here we go and we've got
the old Sony Ericsson logo there Xperia
we've got this sort of train
sparrin I'm not sure if you can see this
let's try to put it here but you can see
that this is transparent on each side
obviously we've got this plastic here
let's peel it off we've got a
front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera we've
got a 720p 4.3 inch display and as it
mentions in the box at the bottom it's
got the Bravia Engine which helps with
contrast and everything it's a
PlayStation Certified phone so we've got
the and Reno GPU included 3ds suite
panorama for photos I imagine X loud
enhanced engine for audio so these this
actually this sort of a chrome strip
it's got these three little points here
which are actually capacitive buttons
and well at the bottom we've got pretty
much a land yard hold to the side we've
got the microUSB connector it's covered
which is kind of nice some people like
power on power off button 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack the speaker we've got
micro or mini mini HDMI out here and
we've got the cable included and we've
got a dedicated camera button which is
actually really good obviously they're
taking advantage of their XOR sensor
volume up volume down button the
Spreaker here we're gonna be testing
this gonna become my daily driver from
today on we're gonna put our vodafone
prepaid SIM card and test it out again
if we could probably look at this I mean
look at this
plasticky and ugly this is still plastic
but it doesn't look as cheap obviously
we're gonna be comparing it to other
phones you already saw our comparisons
in the PR boots and everything you
already saw our hands on and now we're
gonna tell you if the phone is worth
buying or not so Tony on camera
Lucien at the back again this is the
Sony Xperia S 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon processor forgot to mention
also one gigabyte of RAM 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage it costs the 600 euros
which is about 750 dollars somewhere
around there is it worth your
hard-earned cash we'll tell you now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
