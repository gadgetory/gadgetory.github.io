pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to take a look at the netflix
streaming movie application for windows
phone 7 let's get to it okay so this is
exclusively a straining application you
can't actually manage your cue from it
and down here I've got an icon and it's
a free application of course you can pin
it to your Start screen it's not a live
tile it's just a simple application
launcher so let's go into netflix and
see what it's like to stream a movie
from the netflix catalog it takes
sometimes about 10 seconds to get
started i've already logged in so i
don't have to do that again and again if
you have a netflix plan you can just
plug in your username and password you
have streaming built into your account
as you probably know already and so it
will work on this device so from here we
can flick through a different few
different areas it's got the Metro
interface this is one of the first
Windows Phone 7 apps we saw the
beginning of this year it's been around
it's been floating around for a while
and now it's finally available on the on
the Windows Phone 7 marketplace so here
we've got a variety of featured movies
we can swipe to the right to dial down
by television or action an adventure
different genres we can search here and
it's an instant search so as you type it
will actually bring up results so if I
typed on wait there are some results if
we sweat to the right again or tap to
the right we get our instant queue so
you can add a variety of movies there to
watch and back to home so let's look at
a movie and see what the quality is like
on the streaming application it's
actually go back to John MERS for a
second and dial into action and
adventure okay let's see if there's
anything interesting here just flicking
through you should be able to do this in
a landscape view as well and there we go
ok there's x-men let's take a look at
how that looks streaming on the Windows
Phone 7 device here this is the Samsung
Focus says connecting to the netflix
movie server downloading movie in from
zoom in on the screen so you get a
better sense for the quality here right
now over Wi-Fi by the way so here is a
look at the movie let's fast forward a
little bit and when you fast forward do
you actually get a live preview of
what's happening in the area you're fast
forwarding to so it's buffering a little
bit buffering happens very fast and here
it is picture quality is very impressive
just trying to get to a high action
scene here so you can see what the
framerate is like what a lot of stuff is
happening so very good quality this is
definitely something you would want to
take with you on a subway or on a plane
and be able to watch this content
although you're going to need Wi-Fi
wherever you are or 3G connection
because it is streaming from the
internet and it's not storing the movies
on your device so overall the netflix
application for windows phone 7 is quite
well done it's exclusively a streaming
application so don't expect to manage
your queue but you want to watch some
movies on the go it's a great app great
app to have thanks for watching and
please thumbs up this video if you liked
it that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
