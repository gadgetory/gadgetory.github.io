calm and we're going to do the software
tour of the lumia 800 the reason we're
in the car is because it really the only
interesting thing is the nokia drive
it's a big bubble this so let's check it
out
okay so first up if you want to learn
more about windows phone 7.5 be sure to
search pocketnow.com for our windows
phone 7.5 review you'll see all the cool
features in this operating system but
here I'm just going to look at what
nokia has done in terms of
customizations so first off we have the
color this is the nokia blue so that's a
little thing that they've changed and we
see these are the default live tiles and
we see Nokia drives right there and
that's pretty much the only thing that's
added by Nokia however there is a couple
of things there's contacts transfer so
this is going to just connect to your
Bluetooth phone and it says you got to
turn it on and what not and it will
transfer your contacts so that's good to
have nice little feature and we also
have we care this little thing from
Nokia and it's pretty much a waste of
space it's just this little note from
Nokia that's all it does yeah and the
other thing that comes with it is no key
drive i also downloaded know Kate maps
and WRC live from locate those don't
come with it if I go to the marketplace
there is no nokia store here so not much
customization here let's go to first
before we go into maps let's see if it
integrates with being so here's a
restaurant that I found in vain and I
pinned it to the start menu if I had
open table installed you see a reserve
button here and ideally with the
navigation programs you should see and
navigate using blah blah blah Nokia Maps
that should be a button here and if I go
to the apps that navigation program
should appear here but it doesn't it is
not that integrated
so I can't really easily press the
navigate button I have to tap and hold
the address copy it and now I have to go
back in the Milky drive and here it is
launching and I'm going to press this
button so here are my options I have 2d
and 3d views set destination settings
about and feedback settings is nothing
special we have map color landmarks the
voice you can choose history location on
manage maps when you first started up
you're going to it's going to ask you
which map you want to download you can
download the whole USA or just specific
States or other countries and repress
the plus button we can download even
more maps for free let's get back to the
destination so set destination and now i
can paste that address it's not going to
work because there's a sweet number
there so that's the restaurant i want to
go to and what kind of hit drive and
we're gonna hit start right there go now
i can turn music on and we can drive
like so
and let's hear what it says I just made
a wrong turn so we're gonna see it
recalculate
now turn right and then turn right so
there we go it's telling us to do that
and it's going to tell me turn right
again but I'm gonna just be in a
different program the voice just stopped
so we do not have voice going on in the
background but let's just press back and
see a flick allergic oh that's right now
turn right so that resumed pretty
quickly so not bad they're all right let
me pull over again wait two miles turn
right so that's working pretty good and
it has the nice smoky blue theme there
as well now when I'm on the directions
this is 3d mode I can tap it and now
it's like a full screen I can pan around
i can multi touch and I can zoom out so
I can look for different things and
tapping and holding doesn't do anything
and as your compass and the settings
just goes back to here and that's about
it for options and functionality when we
stop navigation and set destination is
only one field right there I can do a
search term but it doesn't pick up my
contacts list so I have to go into
contacts I have to copy the address and
then paste it in here so there's pizza
places we can search for and that's
pretty cool
for options pretty good design a little
little weak on the functionality but you
are getting it for free so that's pretty
good okay we'll take a look at Nokia
Maps this is a lot like Bing Maps
different colors we have option to have
zoom buttons here which are good because
you can use them with one hand instead
of having to hold it with one hand and
pinch to zoom like that so that's pretty
nice feature we have layers public
transportation is going to show some
there's a train alright and place this
is kind of cool when it works so this is
going to be kind of like a local Scout
ish feature so we get places there and
we get explorer buttons so that's kind
of cool to have and when we go into one
of these you've got a very Bing like a
card and so we can pin it to the Start
menu as the pin button there's a share
button and you get photos that's pretty
cool there's a guide
nearby but it doesn't have an apps
button so you can't you know get other
functionality that way getting
directions does not go into no key drive
it just makes a list of directions and
this is not there's no voice prawns for
that so it's not really integrated even
with Nokia's own software so that's
almost the extent of functionality okay
let's go to settings there's nothing new
in settings except for this feedback to
nokia oh and you want to see the camera
don't you here's our settings nothing
special here 8 megapixel no real
customization for the you also get some
nokia sounds anyway not a huge amount of
customization on the nokia lumia 800 but
if you liked this video give us a thumbs
up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
