the best selling tablet in the world but
sadly it's also one of the most boring
ones and the reason why is because iOS 6
is extremely dated and even though we
were expecting Apple to do something
really great about it well it really
didn't cut it so if you want to do
something about it evasion for iOS 6 was
just released and if you want to
jailbreak your tablet well I'm high
Meadow iveta this is pocket now and I'll
show you how to jailbreak your ipad
alright so jailbreaking is a fairly
simple procedure all you need is an iPad
a compatible computer and obviously a
USB cable for everything to happen you
navigate to a website called evasion
calm though the 0 is actually a0 evasion
will check of your browser is compatible
and it'll give you the options that
downloaded for linux windows OS 10 it'll
give you other official mirrors
requirements and port and read the
information frequently asked questions
credits and thanks to and then once
that's done you just download the file
you click here to download and once that
begins you'll automatically receive an
installer file that will contain the
application that you need to continue
the jailbreak yes this is an application
and you will have to download it and
install it once you launch the
application they don't typically tell
you where it's available and then you
once you launch you get a readme file
and you also get a change log and then
evasion will actually obviously tell you
that this is not a supportive
application and it will give you a
dialog box with a jailbreak button all
you need to do is grab your iPad connect
it to USB and once connected to USB that
the high lockbox automatically turns on
the jailbreak button at the end and
you'll notice that we just press the
jailbreak button and the whole procedure
begins right after that you have to do
nothing to the device everything happens
automatically you'll notice that once
you press the jailbreak button
everything is happening on the computer
it is automatically syncing all your
information and installing the city of
file and installing the jailbreak on
your device so it'll take a couple of
minutes we're fast forwarding this at 8x
so that it obviously is not as painful
as it should be for me and once that's
done you'll notice that you'll get a
jailbreak button at the
end of your application tray you press
that jailbreak button and that'll
automatically tell the computer that the
device is ready to be jailbroken press
the button it'll give you a black dialog
box it'll go away and we're
fast-forwarding again and it'll
automatically install cydia and restart
the iPad so once everything loads and
we're fast-forwarding again because this
is taking a long time it'll continue to
boot if you have a password lock on your
iPad it'll give you the password dialog
box or it'll give you whatever slide to
unlock feature you have and then you
move to the end of your app train you'll
notice that city is installed for those
of you that don't know city is actually
where you get your applications and your
site loaded applications and services
for the whole jailbreak thing to
actually make sense it'll reboot your
device once again and you'll notice that
cydia is in full effect the beginning to
Alaska of your user or hacker or
developer so obviously in our case we
are a user then once we go into users
Cydia is fully loaded this is all you
have to do to jailbreak your ipad is a
very simple procedure that anybody can
do all you need is a computer the iPad
and a USB cable it is that simple thats

jailbreak your ipad I'm hi Madame a
