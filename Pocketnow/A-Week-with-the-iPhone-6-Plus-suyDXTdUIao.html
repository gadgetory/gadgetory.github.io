six-plus was delivered I've spent almost
every waking minute with it
testing probing comparing and mostly
playing with it our full review will
come next week but how do I feel about
the phone so far I'm Taylor Martin with
PocketNow and this is one week with the
iPhone 6 plus for a little background
the last iPhone app purchase was the
Verizon iPhone 5 two years ago I've been
carrying it almost every day since only
swapping it out for a few review loners
from time to time I carried it mostly
for its camera but also because there
are some things I simply prefer to do on
iOS tweet read news stories in reader
too and browse reddit using alien blue
just to name a few but over time the
iPhone 5 found itself in my pocket more
than in my hand it was simply too small
for me to comfortably use so when Apple
announced two new larger iPhones I opted
for the biggest one possible the iPhone
6 plus it's exactly what I expected it
to be nothing more than a larger iPhone
Apple did almost nothing to justify the
size of this phone Samsung for some
contrast pared its oversized phone with
an inductive stylus which acts as a very
powerful peripheral for the handset and
several software features that make use
of the extra display space Apple instead
gave users a way to access elements
along the top of the display by double
tapping the home button this temporarily
slides the very top of UI down to the
middle of the display so you can easily
reach things one-handed some apps like
settings come with multi paint views in
landscape for a more tablet like
appearance and the entire UI including
the home screens can now rotate a full
360 degrees like iPads not once have I
found any of this actually useful though
you do get some additional keyboard
buttons in landscape some dedicated for
copying and pasting and even navigation
arrow buttons but I never type in
landscape there's nothing that truly
makes use of all that space no true
multitasking no floating windows no
extra functions at all it's just bigger
for me that's perfectly fine Michael on
the other hand says the six-plus is
trying too hard I don't disagree but I
also won't deny myself iOS 1 a device
size that I actually
prefer speaking of size coming from the
Z ultra and being a longtime note user
the six-plus feels average that's at its
heftier and thinner than I imagined
paired with how slick the phone is its
rounded edges the overflowing glass
effect up front and a completely flat
back it's begging to be dropped I felt
somewhat apprehensive about carrying
this foam without a case the six plus is
one of the very few phones that feels
better in a case not because it feels
bad or cheap in any way just because in
a case it doesn't feel so frail the most
impressive part of this phone however is
its battery life I've gotten used to
just okay battery life over the years
needing to charge in the late afternoon
or evening to make it well into the
night I've been abusing the six plus
since it arrived on Saturday for example
I unplugged the six plus at 10:00 a.m. I
played about an hour and a half straight
of table tennis and alone two of my
favorite mobile games streamed over four
hours of audio to my UE boom speaker
texted and IMed throughout the day took
dozens of pictures browse the web watch
some YouTube videos and tweeted some at
2:00 a.m.
sixteen hours later on Sunday morning
the 6 plus still had 34% battery left
pure insanity both the camera and
speaker aren't present - the speaker
isn't quite as loud or as crisp as the
one on the one m8 but it still has some
punch to it even if it's located along
the bottom edge and is entirely too easy
to cover up and the camera it's just
great I've been snapping photos left and
right of anything and everything not
every picture turns out amazing but it's
extremely consistent and usually gives a
shot worth using
I would prefer the HDR mode to be a
little more dramatic and oh is isn't as
helpful as it has been on other handsets
particularly on Lumias but low-light
shots are pretty good and I'm more than
happy with most pictures I've taken
finally at this point it's difficult to
be impressed by iOS 8 its features were
over-promised and they ultimately
under-delivered
for me the most intriguing part of iOS 8
so far isn't what I thought it would be
in fact it's the one feature Apple
announced that I could not have cared
less about today widgets I found a few
that I really enjoy like launcher cheat
sheet and Evernote and the promise of
more awesome implementations of
Notification Center is very high but
third-party keyboards and third-party
sharing the to highlight features of iOS
it's extensibility api's are
underwhelming at best these will take
some time to branch out and develop but
for now they're buggy limited and just
not what anyone was hoping for
continuity is also a bummer since it
won't actually go live until Yosemite
hits sometime next month otherwise I've
been very happy with the iPhone 6 plus
it's the first iPhone I would feel
comfortable carrying by itself meaning
without an accompanying Android phone of
course that won't happen because I
recently bought a moto 360 and I just
like having both operating systems at my
beck and call for more iPhone 6 and
iPhone 6 plus coverage stay tuned to the
