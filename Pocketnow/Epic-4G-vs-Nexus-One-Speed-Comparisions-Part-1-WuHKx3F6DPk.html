I know you're wondering the samsung epic
4g is super fast but is it faster than
the google nexus one let's go take a
look so how fast is the samsung epic 4g
compared to the google nexus one let's
go ahead and run the quadrant standard
full benchmark test and find out so we
tap those at the same time already the
samsung is off to a quicker start then
the android running next to it which is
the google nexus one but i need to come
clean this of course is running android
2.1 the nexus one on the other hand is
not only running android 2.2 which is
also known as froyo but it's also
running a custom mod called cyanogenmod
rom and it has a custom kernel so it's
got a lot of speed advantages already in
its favor but let's just let the two a
two benchmarks run side by side and see
how they turn out one thing that I
should mention is they both look very
good on screen the frames per second
it's all looking really nice all the
graphics are really really smooth and
it's good to go but you'll notice the
Samsung finished first and its ranking
up here around nine hundred and forty
points over here on the android google
nexus one it took longer to finish but
when we look at it it's 12 11 which is
quite a bit more than the samsung now
you'll notice over here nexus one to
point two plus is a benchmark above that
these are both daily use phones I use
them all the time we've got lots of apps
on them it's just loaded so what I want
to do is now see if we can boost the
performance of this this sprint epic 4g
and get it any faster but before we do
that that's
that's a topic for another video before
we do that what I want to do is show you
another measure of speed and I think
you'll really be impressed with this
measure so let me get that set up ok the
next measure of speed for these phones
is network speed so I've turned off
Wi-Fi so we're not going over my my
wireless access point and we're going
over the fastest network connection that
the phone has it at this location now
that's kind of important because this is
under 3g umbrella not the sprint WiMAX
4G ok we'll do that test at another time
over here we've got an H that means
we're under the t mobile HSPA not hspa+
just HSPA umbrella and I've got full
bars on both so we're good next thing we
need to do is make sure that and this is
the FCC mobile broadband test it's free
and it's in the market so you can test
this yourself I've set them both to the
same thing we're reporting in kilobits
per second kilobits per second and we're
connecting to the same server which is
in orem utah now for some reason the
Samsung over here thinks that it's 1,300
miles away and that the the nexus one
thinks that it's only 92.7 for miles
away this number is more accurate but
we're not going to worry too much about
that so we're going to go back we're
done there all that was in the settings
tab now we're going to go over to test
both of these and I'm going to try and
start them at the same time we'll begin
test first thing it does is it starts
with a download the Samsung was quicker
to get started but I think you can
really easily tell that the nexus one
running the Korean radio I might add is
up at 2.3 almost 2.4 megabit per second
whereas the Samsung is at one point two
and a half megabit per second upload
speeds were a little bit different as
well and I talked about this in my my
hardware review my actually I think it
was my software review of this fall over
here
the latency of this phone is really
really high i mean 377 milliseconds
that's quite a bit over here 183 so
let's not take the first test let's go
ahead and run it again see what we get
started the Samsung a little bit earlier
this time now you want to run these
tests through three four five times
before you get a really really good
benchmark and this test isn't going to
be valid anymore because it went out it
got a little bit of a 4g signal and
connected to that for a minute and then
switch back to 3g which is why we have
the lower speed so let's go ahead and
run that again while that's running
again at 2.4 megabit per second and
almost 400 kilobits up so that's really
pretty good the latency here is good and
that's kind of why I like t-mobile if we
ever get a really good VoIP client for
voice over IP on our mobile phones
latency is really important the lower
the latency the better over on sprint
that's more of a problem because they're
Layton sees have always been 300 to 600
milliseconds I don't know why but that's
just a little bit too much lag when
you're talking about voice
communications but again here we didn't
have all that great and I didn't see it
while I was talking switch into 4G and
back it might have but even still as far
as 3G phones go nexus one wins hands
down but as soon as I can get back under
a 4g bubble which I might have to do on
location the Sprint just blows
everything away it's amazing how
ridiculously fast it is but now let's go
and check this same test with Wi-Fi
connected to the same wireless access
point okay so for the Wi-Fi test I have
an 802 11 n buffalo wireless router
connected to comcast cable i would say
probably 20 feet away as you can see
I've got full bars over here on this one
and bordering full or one bar less than
full over here
so let's go ahead and start these at the
same time now right before this test I
repo'd it rebooted both phones to make
sure that I got a really good thorough
test one other thing that I need to note
the samsung has 802 11 n built-in so as
soon as you turn it on hook up to Wi-Fi
if you're on an 802 11 and access point
you are golden on this other side
however the nexus one has a chip that's
capable of 802 11 n but doesn't come
with 802 11 n as far as i know with any
of the stock roms cyanogenmod rom which
again this is running enables that end
so i get extra speeds out of it now down
here we look 40 100 ish kilobits per
second versus 3700 kilobits per second
about half a megabit up then millisecond
latency times that are about the same so
as far as Wi-Fi speeds go they're pretty
much the same i mean that's that's
margin of error right there that could
be internet congestion or who knows what
but the the nexus one has been just
marginally faster in most of these tests
and you can see now that the epic 4g
just leapfrogged that but even still for
megabit per second that's not bad at all
I'd kind of hoped for a little bit more
than that with 802 11 n but it's still a
phone it's still really really fast for
a phone so looking at both of those
pretty good now let's go to just general
you I I'm going to go home on both of
them and I've tried to set this up
pretty much the same on both now not
identically but pretty much the same and
if we swipe back and forth here which is
really hard to do with my left hand
because I'm not left-handed you can see
it's pretty responsive on both of them
even the scrollable widgets on both and
I've got more of them on the end the
nexus one being displayed then on the
epic they're both pretty good going in
to
the app drawer not an equal number of
apps so that's why you've got a little
bit time difference but they're still
very fast very responsive phones so all
in all pretty good now what I really
want to do nor an upcoming video is to
apply what's called a lag fix to the
sprint epic 4g that might explain some
of the lag that you guys have been
reporting in not being able to multitask
as well as you'd like and and other
similar stuff where you just get
unexpected hangs I think that's also why
these buttons down on the bottom arm is
responsive as I'd like them to be so
what we're going to do and I'll just
give you a teaser into that video Sprint
is using basically a fat style
allocation table whereas the Nexus One
is using your Linux partition types the
linux stuff is a lot faster and well
since the android OS is linux based it
makes sense to use linux why they used a
fat I don't know and I'm going to have
to look up exactly what the name of it
is RFS or something but it's their own
special journaling system which
journaling comes with the Linux file
allocation tables and and partition
types if you will and is getting really
really technical and in depth and I
didn't mean to do that in this video but
just to finish it off they've applied
some of the Linux style journaling to
the typical das fat style allocation
tables and a lot of developers out there
think that that's causing some lag
because the the file system is really
not optimized for multitasking it's
really not optimized for the Android
environment so they've come up with some
neat tax and I'll go in to show you how
to do that in a upcoming video but
looking back here at the speed
differences between the epic 4g and the
google nexus one with a custom rom on it
they're really really impressive in a
future video like i mentioned i'll show
you the differences between 4g and 3g
and i think you'll be really impressed
with the speed of the sprint 4g network
wish it were in more places so again
speed comparisons between the epic 4g
and the google nexus one for
pocketnow.com I'm Joe leave I give this
video a thumbs up if you'd like to see
more speed comparisons and if you have
not yet subscribed to our video channel
now is the time to do that so you don't
miss out on some of those videos that I
told you were up and coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
