we've got three Nexus phones now we've
got the nexus one the nexus s and the
Galaxy Nexus so let's go ahead and take
a look at the history of the Nexus phone
alright so what we've got here is the
nexus one this was the first Nexus
device from google although not the
first launch device that really goes to
the g1 which unfortunately i don't have
here to show you that was the one with
the flip out slider keyboard so let's
take a look first of all the nexus one
it was a keyboard lyst device very slim
very slick had this really cool whitish
rollerball that got gray over time as
you can see here this also was your
notification LED it would light up and
blink and was multicolored so you could
have all kinds of different
notifications come through here via apps
and and custom roms now when this came
out really was introducing the Froyo
operating system which was really only
available on the original droid if
memory serves this came out after that
and it served to show off everything
google had and as you can tell this
phone has really been well used the back
panel slides up and off where you've got
your micro SD card and sim plastic with
some metallic like plastic right there
built by HTC very well-constructed
microphone at the top volume rocker over
here on the left hand side with nothing
on the right the power buttons at the
top along with the microphone or headset
jack really camera with flash speaker
that kind of stuff down on the bottom
we've got two things that i want to show
you first we've got the micro USB port
and second are the little gold dots now
those were used in Google accessories
for charging and pairing and
not with the desktop dock and of course
the the car dock so that is the nexus
one next up was let's go ahead and turn
this on so you can see it it's it's been
updated to Gingerbread so you can tell
running some widgets and whatnot custom
launcher so overall you know really
smooth really cool you know really nice
so moving on to the Nexus S the Nexus S
introduced a curved screen if you can
see that and also brought with it the
gingerbread operating system now this
was just like the previous nexus where
it was a flat screen this time you do
have a camera up front speaker up front
but overall very clean front display
that's all you've got on the front on
the top you've got nothing but a way to
access the battery compartment over on
the side we've got the volume rocker
same as before over on this side power
button now that's different from the
last where it was up on the top down on
the bottom we've still got that micro
USB this is where the headset jack has
moved to you can see that but if you'll
notice there are no red dots this device
was built by Samsung not HTC so Google
is not just an HTC shop they work with
motorola samsung and HTC so far probably
other partners in the future looking on
the back we've got another camera with
flash now this is 5 megapixel kind of
interesting speaker placement with a
little bump on it and a couple things
that i don't particularly like about
this number one it's got kind of a cheap
plastic ii feel where the last one even
though it was plastic let me bring that
back even though it was plastic had kind
of a metallic feel to it and was kind of
grippy whereas this one is really really
smooth second thing if you look over
here I've got very easy to access
buttons these are capacitive buttons not
physical buttons but whenever the screen
is on there on so I can use them over
here on the neck
s see if we can get this turned on the
buttons are capacitive as well there is
no notification LED and unfortunately
your capacitive buttons which aren't
turning on right now for some reason are
turned off unless they're on so when the
screen is on they're not necessarily on
so you have to kind of remember the
order you know was this back was this
menu as this search was at home and know
where they were not really cool I didn't
like it on the the galaxy s phones but
that's kind of what we were left with so
you can see it's booting up there with
the unlocked bootloader and on to our
last device the latest device this of
course is the Galaxy Nexus that we've
shown you in the past introducing the
Ice Cream Sandwich operating system
which is android 4.0 looking around this
is also built by Samsung and it also has
that nice curved front to it curve
they're just really subtle but enough to
to be there I can get it at the right
angle you'll notice we have our three
dots back again and that's going to be
used on the as yet unseen or unreleased
I don't think anybody's actually got
them in hand yet the accessory docks
there are several accessory docks for
this not just the desktop dock and the
car dock there are various different
kinds of desktop docks and that is to
accommodate that MHL port which is also
the micro USB port so that you can get
hdmi video out in the dock but you
cannot do that through your three gold
dots there so let's walk around the
device again smooth front in this case
we only have our cameras some some other
indicators or sensors rather and the
speaker grill but down here at the
bottom you can tell we've got a blinking
notification LED hopefully it'll come
back there we go multicolor so
eventually you know we'll be able to get
customizations of colors in there
through apps or custom roms right now
I've seen kind of this bluish purplish
white and green as my status
LEDs up at the top nothing at all over
on the Left we have a volume rocker that
functions very nicely and over on the
right we have the power button on the
bottom we've shown you that headset jack
microphone and MH l / microUSB port the
back of the phone has a much improved
back case this is textured it's still
plastic but it's kind of grippy as well
it doesn't feel like cheap plastic
anymore in my opinion we've got the same
same specs essentially on the camera
this is a 5 megapixel camera the same as
we had on the Nexus X it does have a
flash speaker is down here on the bottom
which is really ingenious a lot of
people don't realize that that speaker
sending sound away from you so if you
want to listen to stuff their movies or
music or whatnot it's pointing away
that's really not cool until you realize
that you're holding it in your hand like
this and you've just created a sound
channel right there to redirect that
audio back towards you on the other
phones when you're holding it and that's
where your sound comes from so when
you're holding like this it's going away
from you over here same thing that's up
at the top so it's going away from you
as well now as far as processors go this
guy had a 1 gigahertz processor this guy
has a 1 gigahertz processor and this guy
has a dual-core 1.2 comparing the size
of the see if I can get them all lined
up you can see right there how the the
sizes have evolved quite a bit into
larger phones they're still easy to hold
in hand in fact one thing that I'm
really noticing about the Galaxy Nexus
is how nice it is to hold in hand and
how much more room there is to breathe
in the in the screen in fact going back
to the Nexus S was relatively difficult
for me not not all that fun in my
opinion to go back to the the
gingerbread interface let's look at some
dimensions now put these side by side
here so you can kind of see them that
kind of all
also shows you the curved screens but
all slates all nice all really really
kind of cool devices and all launch
devices from google so there you have it
the evolution of the Nexus phones if you
want to see more videos like this
comparing cool stuff make sure you
subscribe to our video channel if you
haven't done so already you give the
video a big thumbs up so you can share
it with your friends and to get more
in-depth specifications about each one
of the devices head over to
pocketnow.com where we'll break those
down in a little bit more detail for
pocketnow.com showing off phones of the
past as well as phones of the present
