interesting new approach to design
Spotify is reportedly working on
bringing us some sort of hardware and we
get more details on the possible naming
schemes for the future HTC flagship I'm
hi Mary then AB back in the studio and
according to certain people Skaar was
the worst villain of all time even
though to me it still is heath ledger's
joker this is pocket now daily oddly
today there aren't many official news or
deals but let's talk about the future
galaxy note 7 I know it sounds odd
because it's actually the refurb that's
coming back and for those of you that
are wondering if it is going to happen
apparently it is we've covered many
rumors about it and today we have Wi-Fi
certification to the product and we get
some information on specs starting with
the fact that it's running Android 20
nougat and pretty much everything else
except for the large size battery that
it had before we can't wait to see what
is going to happen with this product
once it launches I mean I don't know
we'll see those of you wondering exactly
what we're getting on May second from
Microsoft we've been covering it windows
cloud a competitor to Chrome OS and it
seems the Microsoft is taking this
competition seriously up to the point
where there are some leaked images of
the guidelines for Windows cloud
manufacturers and everything all the pin
points have to do with what Windows
clouds should do to compete with
Chromebooks startup times battery life
etc server you can learn more in the
description a little spotlight to the
future HTC flagship many of us thought
that I was going to be called the HTC 11
and that the you lineup was going to be
a thing on its own apparently that's not
going to be the case it seems that the
HTC you 11 is going to be the name of
the next flagship obviously it's
supposed to be somewhere in the middle
of the you ultra and the you play
hopefully in design because in
specifications it's just going to
completely under play if it's anything
less than the you ultra but time will
tell now some very interesting
developments that they come from Spotify
we hear that the company is serious
about giving us hardware the question is
exactly what kind of
where can we expect from Spotify I mean
the only other competitor that Spotify
have is Apple music when it comes to the
size and everything and we do know that
Apple builds iPods but the medium first
Spotify is literally smartphones and
tablets so what exactly do you think
that Spotify could be bringing to the
market because i do not think it's going
to be a music player and finally the
very interesting news today have to do
with some leaked body designs of the
iphone it seems that there are some
molds that have been leaked and this is
very interesting because number one that
vertical camera hump is coming
apparently but the other is that this
design seems to be like nothing we've
ever seen number one of the borders are
stainless steel and it seems that there
is 2.5 big laugh at the fact that's
designed in a way to curve with the body
of that stainless feel sort of like what
we see with the Apple watch which is
interesting I don't think I've ever seen
that sort of a design in any smartphone
the iphone doesn't do a certain degree
but not as well curved as we see on the
leaked images of this possible iphone
design it could just be that this is
apple's new way of treating hardware but
the most important part is that if you
look closely this actually looks like a
first generation iphone it leads me to
the question of the day do you like this
week do you think that it would be a
smart idea for apple to play with this
whole glass stainless steel design it
looks nothing like the iphone 4 in my
case I don't know Apple surprises leave
