pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to talk about the home screen
experience on the motorola droid x let's
go okay so let's walk through this on
the home screens here you get three
buttons along the bottom the center one
opens up your program list the one on
the right is your contact list and the
one on the left allows you to open up
the phone application now you can't
change these shortcuts along the bottom
and they follow you on all of the seven
home screens and by the way when you
swipe you get this little navigator on
the bottom it makes it pretty easy to
jump from home screen to home screen in
case you're filling up all seven with
lots of widgets and shortcuts and other
things like that now we've got some kind
of trippy live wallpaper back here i'd
call it spooky instead of trippy we have
the droid x live wallpaper we've got
some smoke we've got a I that seems to
be twirling every second pretty cool if
we go into the wallpaper settings
because this is android 2.1 we obviously
get a variety of choices for live
wallpaper most of these are all of these
you've seen before on other devices like
the nexus one and HTC Desire so I'm
going to leave it on droid x now I'm
going to swipe to the left and show you
some other widgets that come on the
device so here is the calendar widget
which quite simply shows me my next
appointment and I can tap on that drills
me into the calendar nothing too fancy
their Google search at the top and I can
use my voice to search for things this
is a pretty cool widget it's a messaging
widget but it integrates with a lot of
things so if I tap on it I can go to
widget settings and I can select where
it's pulling messages from so we can do
Twitter and Facebook text messaging
gmail pop3 all kinds of different
messaging services and you can even name
the tug the widget to anything that you
want so you can really customize what
services are being are notifying you
when there is a new message and you can
also change how many days of items are
shown very handy to have so I think to
the left we have an active weather
widget which actually opens up within
the home screen which is nice you're not
having to dig into an application up
here we have some pretty cool looking
toggle switches which are very visually
friendly
and so I just turned on bluetooth now
it's on it changes color to blue quick
way to know what's going on swiping to
the right we'll talk about some other
widgets included on the droid x this is
actually pretty cool this is just a
update widget so if I tap here I can
update twitter i can update facebook in
one shot what's also cool and i was
taken away from that screen is that i
can resize this widget and this is
something we've never seen on an android
device the ability to actually change
the size of widgets with little handles
in the corner it doesn't always scale so
well but i like the concept you can do
this with multiple motorola widgets let
me show you some others so if we tap and
hold and go to motorola widgets you've
seen all these airplane toggle bluetooth
otago will just walk through those this
one is really cool quick contact quick
tasks so let me add a contact to my home
screen real quick and show you what this
does ok so what I've just done is put in
widget here for Adam Lane and I can add
to quick tasks based on that person so
if I click Add I can see their twitter
status so I click done and it's going to
load and if I tap Twitter it will jump
me right into Twitter and i can see that
person's profile although it's going to
the web not to an application and what's
pretty cool is that you can actually set
other quick actions so along that
drop-down I could have the other one be
to call Adam or to text message Adam so
you can have two quick actions for a
given contact kind of a cool way to save
some time let's jump back in and see the
other widgets we have here simple date
and time widget and you can change the
clock color let's do blue analog I'd
like that digital and here it is just a
simple day and time widget and let's
delete that go back into motorola
widgets gps toggle you already saw that
messages is that one lets you pull in
for a variety of sources that will
provide messages news i'll show that to
you in a minute photo slideshow it's
like having a picture frame on your home
screen social networking so that's the
one that you just saw at the top of the
screen actually social status the one
you saw on the top of the screen if we
go to social networking you can change
the name of it you can scroll down for
some items
I've only got Twitter hooked up to this
phone right now and so right now I'm
seeing the latest twitter update in my
for my final followers let's jump back
in and continue our way down the list
see what else we have here sticky note
you saw that earlier whether pretty cool
accuweather widget and of course Wi-Fi
top now let's jump to the screens on the
right so here i have a few quick context
i'm not sure why didn't pull the picture
and here's another one of those quick
task and drop downs and we can change
the size of this to be huge with
multiple actions or just small with one
action so and shrink it back down
sometimes it gets a little tricky to
resize these let's wipe it all the way
to the right and now you just have two
actions even smaller you have one action
so just going to leave that alone swipe
to the right so now we have some other
widgets we have a widget for photos so
we can tap here to see pictures that
you've taken you can launch the camera
quickly like that we'll talk more about
photo quality and video quality in the
review and up here is just a simple
android widget for playing multimedia
right from your home screen so the right
we have that news widget i mentioned and
this pops up just like the weather
widget in the messaging widget and you
can click here to read the full story
from USA Today and we can go back and we
have some tips and tricks for the droid
x usually just toss that away let's see
if there are any final remaining widgets
that i want to show you if we go into
android widgets we have the basic things
that you'll find this is a really cool
widget that i got from the market called
battery widget it's free and you saw it
earlier it simply gives you the battery
in percentage on your home screen
because of course you don't get to see
the percentages up in the notification
bar so that was a look at the home
screen setup on the motorola droid x i
really like the widgets the motorola has
added to this device they're very
powerful very social friendly I think a
lot more customizable than what you get
on the motoblur interface which were
never a big we were never a big fan of
coming up in the next video we're in a
journal to some of the included programs
talk about the hdmi output and all of
these other fancy things that the droid
x can do if you like the video please
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to our
channel for
more smartphone videos i'll put a link
up in the upper right corner to do that
