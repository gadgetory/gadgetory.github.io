wireless charging will finally get us
iPhones with the bigger batteries
Samsung is apparently working on a
foldable phone with xiaomi's me fold
form factor and the huawei mate 30 line
is already being tested according to
different executives I'm hey melody
betta today's joke was supposed to be
about me not saying my name but that's
kind of boring today's April Fool's so
definitely all the news will be taken
with a grain of salt this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
the launch of the galaxy s 10 5g for
those of you wondering exactly the dates
we've had rumors in the past now we have
a confirmation it's going to happen on
April 5th it's going to happen in Korea
initially even though there's still no
5g there obviously that's still in a
rollout but if you're interested
apparently it'll be then launching on
different markets afterwards we'll get
you the dates as soon as we get them now
it's not about Samsung as apparently the
company is actually working on more than
one foldable design we've been covering
this for a bit but now we see that that
whole teaser from Xiaomi is actually
part of the plan as there are some
patents that show an outward folding
device that folds in two pieces and
everything and apparently that's
actually not a new patent when will we
get something like this it's hard to
tell but I actually do like that design
and speaking of out folding designs
Richard uy away CEO of Mobile was
recently on record an interview and when
being asked what he thought about the
future of foldables according to him
that is the form factor for the feature
every single smartphone should fold up
to the point where where they are
working hard according to him and
figuring out a way to drop the price tag
of these phones whenever they obviously
launched which is actually gonna take
some time we heard in a previous
interview that was good was gonna happen
somewhere around 2020 probably a little
longer obviously because of the parts
but yeah more factors for the future
will be all foldable that's gonna be fun
and let's continue talking about huawei
for those of you wondering about the
mate 30 lineup yes we barely got the P
30 right now we haven't even reviewed it
but apparently there are executives
already testing this phone it already
has a new karin processor and rarely
there are two oled displays being
planned one for the mate 30 which is
gonna have a samsung display and then a
boe display for the mate 30 pro wide
that it was the other way around and the
same thing this play was better but
whatever the case may be obviously we
have to wait until the fall
and finally the hottest dish that I have
to do with reverse wireless charging in
the fact that apparently Apple wants to
adopt it and that we're actually gonna
find some benefits to it because for the
longest time I phone batteries have
actually dropped in size over time as
processors have become more efficient
which I feel is definitely not the best
approach but according to my Sheikh whoa
what is going to happen is because of
the whole reverse wireless charging the
Apple is apparently going to adopt we're
getting a significant bump in the
battery life of the 11 s which would be
now the 11 pretty much and then the
whatever 11 R is going to be it's gonna
have a minor bump and then the 11 max
whatever name that's going to be it's
gonna be a minor 10 to 15% whereas in
the case of the 11 it's going to be
somewhere around a 20% bump in battery
size which is rather interesting
but in today's question let me know I
mean how important is it for you to have
reverse wireless charging because in my
case I find the genius to be able to
charge my accessories not other devices
that's just me we'd love to know your
opinion in the comments down below
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on fucking out on
