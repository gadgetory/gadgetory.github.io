Samsung Galaxy altea seems to be there
next SmartWatch and you bunt to preview
for the galaxy nexus and nexus 4 is
coming next week i'm home i believe it
up and if i look hungover to you it's
most probably because your screen is
blurry this is parking out daily we're
just four days away from HTC m7 or HTC
One event happening on februari 19 then
we're already quite excited we've got
new leaked images of that HTC One coming
out in black and yes we've got the two
grills but still the design is quite
beautiful even if it looks like an
iPhone who cares they want their patent
deal but aside from that the interesting
news is there is a 0 e camera which we
don't know if we should call Zoe being
mentioned that apparently this is the
new ultrapixel camera which is being
mentioned as a 4 megapixel camera which
should be for ultrapixels right we'll
keep you posted and for those of you
waiting for the you bun to preview to
come to the Galaxy Nexus well it's being
scheduled to be launched as of next week
but what makes it even more interesting
is that there will be a port for the
nexus 4 as well being launched at the
same time so make sure you pull out your
nexus devices from the drawers because
they are about to get even more
interesting now we all know that there
are three Nokia Lumia devices being
remitted apparently there is this new
Dutch ad from a carrier showing off with
device that looks a lot like the Lumia
820 to that we already reviewed the vice
looks really good but it's obviously a
mid-tier device hopefully their events
at mwc 2013 will shed some light on this
device coming to Europe soon so what
happens after you evolve phone calls
into video calls well you should evolve
voice messages and to video messages
skype has just launched a new service
update for iOS and Android that allows
you to record a video message to anybody
for as much as three minutes and even
though the idea is quite genius the fact
that phone calls going over the video
calls hasn't really taken off kind of
makes a skeptical try it out tell us
about it and finally for the interesting
news of the day new rumors have a new
galaxy LTSs samsung's new SmartWatch and
apparently the SmartWatch will be part
of Project J so it hopefully will be
launched at the same time as the galaxy
s4 but interesting enough this device is
not running Android it's running a new
all tsos that looks so
like Windows Phone 8 and that leads me
to the question of the day how important
our smartwatches to you in my particular
case I've stayed away from covering all
the iWatch rumors from Apple because
first of all if it's not water resistant
if it doesn't have push to talk to do
the whole dick tracy thing then I'm
really not interested but leave us a
comment down below and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone without the
world make sure you follow us on pocket
now calm and subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi Natalie better thanks for watching
see you next week there's a lot of HTC
One coverage on Tuesday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
