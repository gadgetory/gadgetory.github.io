now still in Berlin still at the Samsung
Galaxy Note event and we are taking a
look at the samsung galaxy note 3
compared to the samsung galaxy s4 let's
take a look at what hyper glee was and
what better is today i was actually
debating whether to take the grease off
of the back because hyper blaze is is
like this but now hope you can see the
fingerprints right there it gets ugly
especially if you have the dark version
but no the galaxy note 3 changes that we
are ditching the plastic the hyper glaze
and we have this smooth to the touch
feeling good in the hand leather which
is nicely precision stitched all the way
around which really feels good in the
hand the previous version which we
looked at had the S view cover and that
also is made a letter and it comes on
top of the back but you can see this one
is the naked phone and this is how it
looks in its leather version now let's
jump under the hood let's start with the
specs we have a four-point 99 AKA 5 inch
full HD Super AMOLED screen here while
the note 3 has a larger screen that the
note 2 at 5.6 298 k five point seven
inches still full HD still super amoled
now this version in particular which I'm
rocking here is the Exynos 5 octa core
version or a dual quad perversion the
note free will also have a Exynos 5 octa
core version in addition to the qualcomm
snapdragon 800 version for LTE markets
now taking a look at the back we have
the 13 megapixel sensor on the samsung
galaxy s4 and
same 13 megapixel sensor on the note 3
but with an improved LED flash and the
note 3 will also have a version which
will record 4k videos are in terms of
memory 16 32 and 64 gigabytes are
available both of course expandable but
the memory ram is two gigabytes behind
the note it's two gigabytes on the s4
three gigabytes on the note 3 you can
look at the software of course the
escort does not rock the s pen which is
right here and which has improved as you
can see on previous videos we have
Android fortitude to on the s4 for that
three out of the box on the note 3 of
course with all the added capabilities
and functionalities of the s pen which
you've seen in previous videos so that's
it for a very very quick glance of the
samsung galaxy note 3 just announced
today compared to samsung galaxy s4 it's
been Anton coming to you from Berlin
Michael behind the camera thank you very
much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
