when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappeared
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say by the devices they
wear a min over the course of a day or
so but really nobody ever goes back and
revisits these devices after that
initial blast of a review to see how
they feel after a couple weeks so let's
do something about it let's have a look
at a device when it's a couple of weeks
after release and not shiny and new
anymore I'm high memory better with
varga now calm this is the HTC windows
phone 8x and this is episode 11 of after
the buzz
when both HTC and Microsoft announced
the Windows Phone 8x it was hard to grip
the concept of a signature Windows Phone
if Allah liam's were forced to retain
certain similarities across the platform
add to that the fact that this is one of
the most expensive windows phones in the
market and it was clear there had to be
something amazing about this device to
justify that price tag holding the
device for the first time gives you the
immediate impression that they did do
something right at times when the world
is full of jumbo phones all around HTC
manages to build a gorgeous device in
design that feels premium and adequately
sized for your hand it's tapered edges
and it's soft polycarbonate body make it
feel impossibly thin and light and
honestly it just makes you want to hold
a device again and again match that the
gorgeous 720p display and it's clear
that the designers were lost when they
said they built the phone to blend with
the Windows Phone life tiles if it
wasn't for the devices lack of a
replaceable battery or external storage
to back the decent 16 gigabytes of
storage at this price tag I really would
have no complaints when it comes to
hardware software is a different story
since there truly is a lot to love and
hate about Windows Phone 8 on an HTC
device on the positive side this device
makes Windows Phone look elegant and
sleek when those phone is a well-oiled
machine and so far there isn't a shore
we've thrown to this phone that it
hasn't handled with ease the display
just contributes to making this an
excellent user experience HTC also
shines in adding additional applications
and services like a clock tile that
really make the phone appear different
to any Windows Phone counterparts but
sadly it won't the throne the Nokia
Lumia when it comes to added software
and features mainly the problem with
Windows Phone is the lack of popular
applications that don't allow you to
interact with other users from other
platforms well like the case of the lack
of Instagram or Spotify or other
services that Microsoft can't ignore
have been the cornerstone of popularity
for Android and iOS and when it comes to
the applications that are available the
little things like the weird
multitasking services that force you
into the menu if you want to return to
the application in its previous state
instead of allowing you to launch the
application where it was from the live
eyal and the lack of true notification
center just makes the experience
frustrating at times in the end there's
really nothing wrong with the operating
system or the way the phone handles it
mainly the problem is the ecosystem
because it doesn't really provide you
with options that allow you to blend
with today's popular task for smartphone
when it comes to the user experience the
camera is good but it's not what many
would call great it takes good
photographs but it seems a common thing
for Windows phones that still struggle
to focus on subjects well before taking
a shot and making low-light photography
hit or miss the fun facing camera is one
of its high points though and I went for
more subjects to fit into a frame
through a wide angle lens which is in
addition that we feel should be standard
on all smartphones especially for those
facebook bathroom pics 1080p video is
good and the phone does a great job in
picking up your audio but it's
frustrating that you can't tap to focus
on anything since what the phone does is
actually stop the video and start a new
one instead of actually focusing on
whatever you wanted to focus on now
battery life really amazed me giving the
sleek design of this phone there was
really no problem getting through the
day no matter what I through to the
device and when it comes to daily usage
it handled phone calls with an amazing
clarity and data speeds were also well
handle even through hspa+ now Beats
Audio is really where I had trouble
judging this device it sounded a lot
better on the One X with the included
headphones that on this 8x when it comes
to fidelity so it's really hard to see
if Beats Audio is really an OS thing or
it could just be a HTC thing so bottom
line what I still recommend that you buy
an HTC windows phone 8x after a couple
of weeks of usage well that answers kind
of complicated on its own the device is
beautifully designed it provides a great
day to day performance and it's just a
good device to any HTC fan out there
when judged against competing devices
and other platforms things get tough
mainly because of Windows Phone 8 since
it really isn't where we wish it would
be when it comes to applications and it
just makes us wish that HTC brought the
same designs of Android
when compared to other Windows Phones
things get even worse since flagships
like the Lumia 920 easily beat this
device when it comes to storage capacity
and added features for half the price
tag overall I'm sad to admit that unless
you're a die-hard HTC fan like I am
you'll most likely prefer to skip this
device over other options that will give
you more for your money that's it for
episode 11 of after the bus thanks for

impressions or comments of the HTC
windows phone 8x in the comments down
