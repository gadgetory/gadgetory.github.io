pocketnow.com here with my very first
video for the site today I thought we'd
take a dip in a hot tub time machine and
venture all the way back to 1999 when
cellphone plans still cost a thousand
dollars for a hundred square feet of
coverage and Verizon was still just a
weird word sharing space with singular
in the imaginary dictionary what you see
in front of you is not an actual cell
phone though it does feature many of the
same characteristics as your modern
wireless handset notice the large
touchscreen and graceful curves around
the periphery take note of the icon
filled home screen representing just a
few of the thousands of applications
available through Third Point through
third-party unregulated app stores as
you probably guessed by now or read on
the device itself this is a model VX
from the palm corporation formally known
as palm one and now better known as a
tiny subsidiary of computing and
information services giant
hewlett-packard for those younger
viewers in the audience it's probably
easiest to think about this gadget as a
smart phone without the phone people in
the late 20th century referred to it as
a personal digital assistant which is
sort of funny because this assistant
couldn't even check your email for you
or could it actually with the addition
of this handy though far from compact
attachable sled the 20 megahertz VX
could transform into one of the earliest
wireless data data devices that's right
even with its 160 by 160 grayscale
screen and eight megabytes of memory the
VX could slide into Nova tells minstrel
modem for downloading email and even
rudimentary web browsing obviously its
functionality was severely limited by
the relatively small wireless coverage
footprints back then but those who could
find a signal were golden this made the
two-way pager look absolutely archaic in
comparison
unfortunately the minstrel won't hook up
to any modern cellular providers meaning
we can't actually run any
internet-enabled programs although I can
tell you that a bandwidth speed test
would not yield very impressive results
the same could be said of palms next
attempt at a wireless PDA the seven
or VIII which embedded the modem
directly into the book to the device but
sacrificed aesthetics in a return to the
boxy palm 3 styling well that's all the
retro fun we have for you today good
viewers but please tune in next time as
we take a look back at some of the
devices which have shut which have
helped shape both our lives and the
gadgets in our lives thank you for
tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
