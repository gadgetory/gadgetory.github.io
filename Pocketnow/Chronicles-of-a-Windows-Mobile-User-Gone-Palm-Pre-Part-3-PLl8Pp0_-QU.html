calm and where I'm take a look at the
palm pre's user interface and more
specifically the task manager this is
probably the best feature of the palm
pre tom has never been one for
multitasking or task management it was
always you open a program and use that
program and that's it you can't really
switch the webos on palm pre has totally
changed that in it I think it's the best
task manager around on mobile device
first off you have your home screen and
you have these four icons at the bottom
now a swipe from the bottom up we'll
bring you will bring those four icons up
with your finger and you can scroll
across them and then you have a little
tooltip telling you which one does what
which is great and one thing you may not
notice you can just go like this and
swipe it right off the screen and
that'll activate those the icon on the
right so you don't have to look at it
the screen to do that so that's pretty
nice I do it with the other hand it goes
straight to the phone doing do you have
to kind of do it a little slowly for it
to catch up so this is your application
launcher you can scroll up and down we
can also scroll side to side that was a
little bit confusing because you have
three pages to the left and right and
you also scroll up and down so it's kind
of hard to find applications sometimes
however there's an easier way because
we minimize our current program we have
a keyboard so when I'm on this home
screen and the applications are
minimized like so I can just type and
then I press ENTER because that's
program that I typed and is selected and
it instantly opens that program really
really great Universal Search feature
for finding the program's you want to
get back to that I have to minimize that
again and then i can type another
program and as long as it's selected
right there i just press enter and it
comes up now if i don't type that much
we also get contacts
and now if i type tap in the background
we get smaller program thumbnails that i
can scroll through quicker but if
they're this size i can swipe one at a
time so that's pretty nice
and closing them I just flick it off the
screen and that's others obviously not
intuitive because you know how would you
know that there's nothing in the
interface indicating that that's how you
would close the program however you
probably went through the tutorial at
the beginning when you first boot it up
the palm pre and that would've taught
you how to do that so very nice now if
you get too many of these programs
opened and you try to open another
program it's going to tell you that you
have to close some of these cards
compare that to Windows Mobile which
would just kind of try to close the
least used open application by itself
and maybe that will slow it down maybe
it'll freeze who knows so the pre is
really putting task management back into
your hands now these four icons are
customizable so if I tap on it hold it I
can move it around and if I remove one
of them
I can put another one in I kept an old
there we go
again not intuitive but a nice little
way to move things around come back here
I might email back all right one thing
that is kind of annoying if I'm in the
email program say I you know type the
email air and I hit enter now you know
normally I hold the phone like this
would keyboard but now I can't do
anything with the keyboard I can't
access the menu I can't scroll to my
inbox I can't open it all in bucks you
really have to take one hand off
keyboard and go up here and tap it with
your finger so that can be kind of
knowing because you also have to do that
in all your applications if you want to
do anything even a great new message now
you gotta tap there you have type and
you know I want to get down to the
message body but I got to move my hand
again sat down there so that's kind of
like let's take a look at how this
interface compares with the treo pro
windows mobile also capable of
multitasking usually your recent
programs are up here so that's a pretty
quick and easy way to access those and
what's nice about the treo pro is we
don't have to move my hand to access
those I can do everything with keyboard
and we also have our customized program
icons are hardware buttons so those are
always there unfortunately it doesn't
have the nice universal search for
finding programs but everything is still
controllable by the keyboard
without touching the screen see all my
my hands are stay in one place so that
that's the nice feature of windows
mobile and go back to pre
that was an appointment
there's my trios just talking to me it's
made an announcement and read it to me
that's another thing that I miss on here
free no no text to speech and no voice
control so you just hear a ding and then
you have to go find your phone and look
at it and read it kind of pain but the
notifications are nice sit down here and
it kind of minimizes the rest of the
screen and we can tap on them to read
them so overall love be task management
here close programs really nice and easy
switching programs again great so that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
