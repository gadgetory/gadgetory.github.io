pocket now calm and this is the software
tour of the new HTC touch diamond2 now
there are a lot of things to talk about
in terms of software changes we're going
to talk about everything thoroughly in
the upcoming review on pocketnow.com
but for now we're just going to take you
through the the most major changes to
the new interface this is a new version
of touchflo 3d and there are many
changes to talk about so let's turn on
the device and get closer to the screen
so everything looks really fantastic on
this WVGA screen so that's 800 pixels
down and 480 across it's the same
resolution as the Touch HD and it's in a
smaller area so actually the screen
looks a little bit more crisp on the
diamond too than it does on the touch HD
so let's start off with the time if you
tap on the time you're taken into this
nice little interface you can add a city
to have multiple places with the time
and we can also go to the next step here
with alarm clock and this device is a
really robust alarm clock application
it's kind of like the iPhone so if we
tap on any of these we can have a an
alarm only for Monday Wednesday and
Friday
at you know 6 a.m. just a really elegant
interface here for setting the alarm and
let's go back something else that's
changed is the notification area so if I
tap up here at the top we have a
notification area and if you have a new
email or new SMS or missed a call it'll
all show up here and then we can go into
the Wi-Fi screen right from here which
is much different it's much more elegant
now I can see that I'm connected to GM 1
2 3 there's agreeing check shows the
signal strength of all of the networks
and of course you can flick your finger
up to see your next appointments and
there are none coming up here if we go
to the next tab and I've rearranged
these a little bit to suit my needs we
have a few options here we can customize
the tabs of course by moving them around
and this isn't anything new we've seen
this on previous versions of touchflo 3d
we can edit our contact card I'll talk a
little bit about that later
and change your wallpaper your ringtones
or we can jump into all settings which
is the usual windows mobile interface
that you're accustomed to
the next ones email and you've seen this
before this is present in all touchflo
3d versions I'm gonna skip the next tab
and I'll come back to it here we have
SMS and the next tab is something I
definitely wanna talk about push
internet this is new for the diamond too
and the touch pro2 push internet will
preload pages based on a set schedule so
that lets say everyday 12 o'clock you
check your email and so you can set this
so that every day at 12 o'clock it will
check your email so right now if
pocketnow.com preloaded so if i tap on
this watch how fast it comes up there
it's almost instant because it's
preloaded it says last update 58 minutes
ago while I'm in this screen I'm going
to talk about the the zoom slider so
there is a capacitive zoom slider here
which allows you to zoom in on the page
if you slide your finger the zoom action
is pretty smooth but one of the biggest
problems is that it's imprecise so if
you double tap anywhere on the screen
you can choose exactly where you want to
zoom in right it's like that in all
versions of Opera Mobile but what if you
want to zoom in right on the center
right here on the center of the screen
well if you use the zoom slider it's
gonna zoom over to the left it's it's
quite random and you'd think intuitively
what would happen is you tap an area on
the screen then zoom in and then the
zoom would go to that area but that's
not the case so I'm not sure about the
utility of the zoom slider it would be
nice if you could customize how it
functioned so let's get out of that let
me just take you through how you add a
new push page so I'm gonna tap add a new
push page and let's do the address let's
do amazon.com and it wants a title is so
Amazon okay and frequency of updating
you can have every six hours what let me
go back there every every one hours 3
hours 6 hours 12 hours or 24 hours so
I'm gonna set that to 6 hours
and save and you can also set whether
this happens on the weekends cuz maybe
you don't want to see a certain webpage
on the weekend so you go down to menu
and you go to schedule settings and here
we can determine when this actually
occurs so you may not want to
to pull down the webpage when you're
sleeping if you don't want it to use the
data on your phone or use the battery
okay moving along we go to the calendar
tab and this is kind of new for HTC
devices what's really neat about the
calendar tab is that it also integrates
weather so if I go to the 19th it will
show me that on the 19th it's going to
be raining if I go to the next day
Monday it's going to be raining with 47
here in Philadelphia and so on and so
forth it will go all the way out into
Wednesday because it's a five-day
forecast and of course we can zoom out
and see our calendar again and we can go
to the next month with a nice really
nice animation that goes from month to
month the next tab is stocks which has
been read read done a little bit so if
we tap on Apple it will show us the
stock details and we can change the the
graph to a longer time period out to two
years if we go to photos and video you
can of course flick through your
pictures and if you tap on a picture it
goes into landscape and then you can do
a circle to zoom in or you can use the
zoom bar and it zooms right to the
center of the picture which is more
intuitive than the way it works in Opera
Mobile where it kind of zooms off into
the left now to go to the next picture
it's got a really interesting flick
scrolling capability no longer is it
just one action and everything
automatically flicks you can actually go
half way and hold it there it's it's
more intuitive I think than previous
versions of this photo gallery all right
the next tab is music and you've seen
this before you can flick through your
your album art and play music right from
the home screen
the next tab is weather and this is the
weather for the taller screen so you get
the forecast right on the screen which
is great and you can have multiple
cities if you'd like so you can go to
menu add location and let's go to
Venezuela Barcelona and then it will
download the weather data and then you
can flick from screen to screen by going
upward like that so now when you press
the start button on the newer HTC
devices you are taken to the HTC program
launcher so you're no longer taken to
the standard Windows Mobile Start menu
you can actually turn this off if you
disable touchflo 3d and it's quite nice
you can add your favorite programs right
now there's only a small amount of
programs listed there but if you press
add you are taken to the entire list of
programs that are stored on the device
so let's say we want to have word mobile
and there it is word mobile now
something that HTC has done is changed
all the soft key menus to be more finger
friendly so if we go into File Explorer
you can see that there and we go to menu
all of the secure all of the menus now
our finger friendly and you can kind of
Kairosoft through these this is
reminiscent of windows mobile 6.5
actually the way that everything is much
larger on the screen I'm surprised they
didn't do this with previous versions of
touchflo 3d devices because it's a
really smart idea to make it easier to
navigate with your finger now something
that is new is this unified
communication screen and the idea is
that if you are on a call with this
person you want to be able to see in one
shot all the text messages you've had
with them all the emails you've had with
them all the calls you've had with them
and also any other information about
them such as where they live or their
their cell phone number or their home
number things like that and this is a
great way to do that whenever you're on
a call with someone you're taken into a
screen that looks like this so right now
I can see text messages that I've had
with this person and this is the new
text messaging screen by the way so I
can go in here and I can type hi and it
takes a minute to show up as it sends
and there it is nice elegant looking
way to to text message someone if I go
over to the right I can see all the
emails that I have had with this person
and it will look into your outlook inbox
so if you have emails from a year ago
they're not going to show up here but if
you have emails from you know however
long your sync period is so I think mine
here is set to 3 days which is why I
have some from April 16th and April 15th
now this is what happens when you call
somebody and what happens is that
there's this new slide down for more
options screen I really don't understand
why this is here probably because they
don't want you to accidentally press the
other buttons on the screen but you
could end the call or open the keypad
accidentally as well so it doesn't
really make sense so if I bring it down
I've access to those unified
communication buttons so I can see any
calls that I've had with this person or
any text messages and of course this is
a number to a administrative building
somewhere so I haven't had any
interaction with this phone number and
of course to end the call you just tap
and the call right there now something
that we still don't have is Universal
screen rotation so if we're in this
screen and we rotate the device nothing
happens we go into the Start menu and
rotate the device nothing happens
the only places where screen rotation
happens is an opera mobile and in the
photo gallery just as with other HTC
devices we really wish that this
functionality would finally come so the
software on the HTC touch diamond2 is
well done the incremental upgrades to
touchflo 3d are much welcomed and we're
really looking forward to the free
windows mobile 6.5 upgrade that we'll
get hopefully sometime soon and also the
increased screen sensitivity makes using
the device much easier and and
comfortable because you don't have to
press as hard and as you've seen in this
whole video demonstration I didn't take
out the stylus once because everything
is just so well tuned for finger
friendliness so if you want to touch
diamond2 of your own be sure to check
out clove cote UK and we're gonna have
the full review coming up very soon on
pocketnow.com
be sure to check out the unboxing and
hardware tour videos of the touch
diamond2 in case you missed that we'll
post links in the sidebar if you want to
take a look at that that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
