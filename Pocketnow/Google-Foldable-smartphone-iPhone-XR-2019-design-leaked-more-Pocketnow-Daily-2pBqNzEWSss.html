even if it seems that they question the
concept according to new leaks the
iPhone 10 on 2019 could embrace a weird
back come to make it look as odd as the
other one and airbox three could be even
more expensive but they would also
include new features I'm high metal
Iveta and date two of Google i/o it's
getting crazy but oh my god if you ever
get the chance to do this event go for
it this is firing out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for an iPhone a really cheap
one there's a simple mobile deal where
you can get the iPhone se for eighty
seven dollars
8750 there's a special code you can find
it on the link in the description also
if you're in the market for a Mac oh my
god more iPhone discounts wealth Apple
discounts Mac minis $200 off the new
generation as well which kind of puts
them at the price that this should have
been in the first place you can also
learn about that out of the scriptures
now so about Oppo you know they're op o
Reno was probably one of the devices
that brought the most headlines over the
last couple of weeks but it was
interesting that what they launched the
phone all we got was 20x optical zoom
when apparently they had other you know
options for you apparently there will be
a software update for those of you
interested will which will boost at the
60 X is digital and yeah that's for me
the 50x on the p30 Pro is like you know
if I need a you know binoculars to look
at something from afar then that's what
I use it for but other than that it's
not really useful we'll see what we get
now let's talk about the feature of air
pots we've even seen mint she quote
talked about the feature of them first
of all we hear that air patch too will
remain has apparently 159 and $1.99
price points and air pods three will
bring the noise canceling that air pods
wanted to really desperately need and
these would cost more money apparently
there are other features that they will
bring and the veer we'll see
and speaking of Apple iPhone 10 are 2019
reports have it that we're gonna get a
horrible stove camera hump on this phone
as well we've got some leaked renders
already where you can see that Apple
might be experimenting with that same
design only that instead of three
cameras you're only gonna get two so
really it's more of a
gimmick than anything which makes me
wonder why not just stick to the design
that they currently have with the iPhone
10s whatever the case may be let us know
in the comments if you like what you see
or not I don't
and finally the hottest interests that I
have to do with foldables and Google
yesterday at the Google i/o keynote it
was clear that the company is working
hard on the feature of foldables they're
talking about the fact that there are so
many OMS that are already working on
this that they've been working alongside
these OMS to bring this future to the
market the interesting part is in part
of the interview where they were asked
and they were like ya know we've been
working on this for years we just still
don't see a use case which I was like
alright so you're working on something
but you still don't see what you're
doing it for it could just be that they
didn't necessarily mean it that way but
let us know in the comments down below
do you see that there's a use case for
foldables or not in my case I feel that
the added functionality after being
after using the Galaxy fold was really
positive but yeah you don't really need
a foldable so obviously we should price
it a little more aggressively that's
just me leave us a comment down below we
left it on your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
us I'm talking out our comment subscribe
to both of our channels English and
Spanish for more videos like this one
