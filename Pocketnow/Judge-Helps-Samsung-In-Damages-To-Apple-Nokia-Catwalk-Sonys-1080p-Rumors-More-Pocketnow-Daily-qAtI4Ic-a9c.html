on their trial against apple nokia
looking for new design technology soon
and Sony's 1080p device now rumor until
the summer I'm hi Mary Vettel and you
can bet that i'm waiting for the
barcelona vs real madrid game tomorrow
this is parking out daily now even
though a jury granted apple a couple of
billion bucks in their apple vs samsung
trial recently a judge now states that
apparently the way things were
calculated was wrong it has now decided
to return 450 million dollars in damages
to samsung even though nobody's actually
even paid each other yet but the
interesting part is that apparently this
judge is also asking for a trial again
in order to look at these cases once
more it's kind of interesting because if
you didn't know a couple of days ago the
UK judge the force Apple to apologize
publicly to Sampson was actually hired
by Sampson for some reason no comment on
that now let's move on over to nokia
rumors have the company working on new
design technologies for their future
smartphone lineup among these changes
one of them is that apparently they're
working on a catwalk codenamed design
which will be an aluminium only
smartphone that should come to t-mobile
eventually though that's kind of
interesting since AT&amp;amp;T has always been
there us launch partner but well we'll
see how that ends up but another rumor
has the company working on water
resistant technology for their next
Lumia smartphones and OEMs everywhere if
you're listening every smartphone should
be water resistant I mean if Motorola
and Sony could figure this out everybody
should and speaking of Sony the company
has proven that they can go completely
absent from mwc 2013 and even though we
did see the Xperia Z smartphone being
launched at CES 2013 when we were there
we were expecting this 4.8 inch 1080p
display sorry 1080p display smartphone
to be launched at mwc n it sadly did not
happen so I'm not sure why but new
rumors have the company working on this
smartphone for the summer of 2013 so all
of you that we're waiting out there just
get the Xperia Z we don't know if this
device will ever make the light of day
but we'll keep you posted now let's talk
about carrier unlocking after the
petition was formally presented to the
White House
a week ago well the FCC chairman has now
come on record to state that yes he will
have a look at it he is very interested
it is very important for this to be
dealt with and according to the Chairman
he stated that well this would hinder
competition it would hinder innovation
as well and it also hinder your pockets
to be stuck to a contract or do they
stuck with a device we can actually just
get another device and resell that one
but we'll keep you posted on how this
happens let's just hope it happens
during the Obama administration or else
we'll be stuck to a tease clutches and
t-mobile's clutches as well eventually
and finally for the weirder and weirder
news of the day more rumors have apple
working on a cheaper thicker and made a
polycarbonate iphone to be launched at
the same time as the flagship iPhone and
well this device apparently would also
be bigger than the current generation
iphone which is just completely weird i
mean think about it apparently this
device will have a 4.5 inch display and
the current generation iphone as a
4-inch display it's completely an
opposite to what Apple does but hey
these are desperate times so that means
you to the question of the day do you
believe that Apple would ever change
their design or product launch mentality
by launching this bigger the visor this
could just be another product that we
don't know about historically Apple has
shown us that they work differently i
mean the ipad mini the ipod shuffle the
ipod nano were all smaller products than
their flagships and so is the case of
the 13-inch macbook pro being smaller
than the larger generation flagship
macbook pro but i mean you never know
Apple could change their mind anytime
and new products could come to town next
year but leave us a comment down below
what do you think I think it's a new
product I don't think it's a cheaper
iPhone of course if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone it's half a world make
sure you follow us on Parker now calm
and subscribe to our YouTube channel as
well please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I'm primary
better as always thank you very much for
watching see you on Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
