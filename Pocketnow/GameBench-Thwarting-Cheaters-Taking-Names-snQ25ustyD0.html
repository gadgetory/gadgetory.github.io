GPU or just lines on a spec sheet what
do they mean that's where benchmarking
comes in but they can be gamed and even
cheated I'm Joe Levi with pocket now
today we're going to go hands-on with
game bench flirting cheaters takin names
with so many components inside our
devices and complex in relations between
them it's all but impossible for us to
gauge how fast something is just by
looking at it specifications additional
cores may have an impact how fast those
cores are clocked play into the equation
what type of technology is inside those
cores plays a huge role in how fast our
devices are add to that the amount type
and speed of ram and all the same
considerations for the graphics
processor and you can see how the stack
of variables keeps getting higher
changing one spec can have unexpected
consequences when the devices looked at
on the whole that's where benchmarking
comes into play in theory benchmarking
is a concept wherein you run several
devices through the same set of tests
since the tests themselves are the same
the devices are water tested the result
is a score that should be comparable and
tell just how fast one device is when
compared to another device the issue
with benchmarks in general is that those
tests are often waited such that the
score that you're interested in is
factored lower than the score that
someone else is interested in then vice
versa and then there's the potential for
cheating not long ago we saw some
manufacturers gaming the benchmarks they
artificially ramped up their speeds when
they detected a benchmark was loading
this resulted in false highs another
issue is the test themselves especially
when comparing graphics processing
benchmark gaps often have to build their
own graphics engines which usually lag
behind what real games and graphic apps
can do and the manner in which they do
it that's where game bench comes into
play it's a new kind of benchmarking
utility that approaches the problem from
a completely different angle rather than
running a series of tests that may or
may not represent what you actually use
your device for game
lets you run your own apps testing is a
bit unique rather than installing the
app and pressing the go or start button
and sitting back and watching as it runs
through the tests here you select which
apps you want game bench to monitor when
you fire off the test you'll notice a
little time with the stop sign placed on
your screen this is a visual indicator
that lets you know that not only is game
bench monitoring the app but it's also
recording the session so you can analyze
it later you've got to run these tests
yourself that means playing the games
the app won't do it automatically for
you well that's a bit inconvenient I
mean really who actually likes playing
games right it does provide you with
some very interesting data and brings a
lot of firsts to the mobile benchmarking
industry game benches the first app to
provide detailed performance and battery
analysis across all Android devices it's
got the first usability benchmark in the
market and it even records frame rates
and battery drain rates you can also
visually correlate on screen events to
frames per second it's got some simple
to understand ratings game performance
and battery analysis reports on those
framelits that we mentioned earlier and
quick identification of bottlenecks
inside the game which can be especially
useful for developers and then for those
of us who like to make presentations and
put stuff in articles it's even got
graphs showing CPU usage GPU usage and
battery drain rates there are however
some nuances to be aware of currently
device is powered by mediatek processors
aren't supported because many of them
have not enabled systrace in the kernel
options we think that's probably
something that media tech is done and we
hope that they'll change getting the
kind of data needed for deep digging
benchmarks like this usually requires a
rooted device although game bench
doesn't require you to root it will make
you go and enable USB debugging connect
to and run an app on your desktop
computer though you only have to do that
once if you like seeing this kind of
video please give it a thumbs up make
sure you subscribe and share your friend
if you like seeing this kind of video
make sure you give it a thumbs up and if
you like game bench in particular make
sure you tell your friends about it on
all your favorite social media networks
subscribe to our channel so you don't
miss out on what's coming in the future
of course make sure your benchmarking
your devices for pocket now throwing off
game bench I'm Joe Levi thanks for
