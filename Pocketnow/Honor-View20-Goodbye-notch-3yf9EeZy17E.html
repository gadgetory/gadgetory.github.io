smartphone display with a hole punch in
it
this is baka now and I'm Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and here's a
first look a bit of a hands-on with the
honour view 20 we were lucky to get a
review unit at CES 2019 after honor made
a presentation for us that will probably
mimic a little bit of their big launch
out in Paris in a couple of weeks our
full review will be coming sometime
after that so you can stay tuned for our
final opinions and all of the analysis
on this particular device which does of
course as I said come with a hole punch
in the display one of the worries that I
had with this screen aside from the fact
that it does have a bit of a cut inside
of it is that the hole punch was going
to be too close to the back button in
many Android applications thankfully
that's not the case here it's actually
squarely inside of the notification area
so that when you swipe down or rather
you have a black bar at the top it's
something that you might not even see
one thing to note here is that the hole
punch is only four point five
millimeters and according to honor it is
the smallest one definitely smaller than
many of its competitors the screen
itself is six point four inches in size
because there's nothing to really
occlude up the screen and there's very
little bezel all around it is a Full HD
Plus display at 23:10 by 1080 resolution
they call it the all view display and it
does look pretty nice so far we haven't
really gotten any media on the device
but we're going to do so with plenty of
different pieces of content from places
like YouTube and Netflix ahead of our
full review the design of the view 10
it's also really eye-catching on the
back here we have this V design looks a
little bit like a reverse level of
Chevron's and it shines really well
under the light showing you a bunch of
different down arrows that go all the
way down the device back the look of the
device is really great but the feel is
even better you might be surprised to
see this much screen in a phone that's
easy to handle in one hand at least in
our initial testing of course another
main thing we're going to test further
is the camera array and things are a
little bit different this time around on
the back there is a third camera and
that third camera is a 3d camera one
that allows for the 3d lens to instantly
identify and precisely separate people
from backgrounds aka better portrait
modes the main sensor really is the
story here because the view 20 comes
with what they called the world's first
48 megapixel rear camera and with all of
those megapixels
you could get a lot of quality a lot of
detail in all of the photos you might
notice that the app the camera app
inside of the honor of u-20 looks a
little bit familiar and so with that we
have some familiar modes the main one
being a night mode imagine a forty eight
megapixel sensor working for six seconds
with all of the stabilization built-in
so that you can get a really great night
shot and all of this is being powered by
the Kiran 980 with its dual npu again
being used for AI in the camera and
there are different SKUs for this that
allow for a gigabytes of RAM Siksika
bytes of RAM and then 256 gigabytes of
storage or 128 gigabytes respectively
honor is really trying to put itself at
the forefront of all of the trends that
will be coming in 2019 and hopefully
honor is going to make the view 20 also
quite affordable but all of that
information is going to come after their
big launch event out in Paris some
design cues are really making the view
20 and attractive device not only with
that hole-punch was you didn't let us
know what you think of it in the
comments down below but also because of
that great backing with a wonderful
design that really makes it stand out
stay tuned for the full review of the on
review 20 coming in a little bit but for
now enjoy this video from CES 2019 which
is where we also got a lot of content
that you can see at this channel
subscribe to pocket now and keep it
tuned here for even more from the
Consumer Electronics Show of 2019 see
you in our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
