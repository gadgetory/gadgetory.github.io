i've got an android quick tip for you
today for this one I'm going to be using
the t-mobile mytouch 4G but the same
battery saving technique that I'm about
to show you will apply to almost every
Android powered phone on the market
let's go look ok so this Android quick
tip is basically setting a more
conservative Wi-Fi sleep policy so of
course this has to do with Wi-Fi but I'm
showing you on this phone for a
particular reason you see the t-mobile
mytouch 4G is one of t mobile's phones
that comes with Wi-Fi calling enabled in
fact it kind of encourages you to set up
Wi-Fi calling when you connect to Wi-Fi
access point right off the bat which is
good but that also means that you might
have some some battery life impact now
I've advised you in the past to turn on
Wi-Fi to use Wi-Fi whenever possible
because even having Wi-Fi on looking for
a connection point will save you a lot
of battery life when you're surfing over
Wi-Fi or browsing over Wi-Fi or
streaming music over Wi-Fi are watching
video over Wi-Fi rather than watching it
over HSPA or whatever your data
connection might be while all of that
holds true what doesn't really make
sense at least first glance is why you'd
need to leave Wi-Fi on all the time I
mean for example if we're at pocket now
calm and I turn off the screen I don't
need my Wi-Fi on anymore now it might be
nice if I kept my Wi-Fi antenna alive so
that when i turn the screen back on and
went back to pocket now calm and wanted
to go to the next page I didn't have to
renegotiate for you know an IP address
and all that stuff but that gets into a
lot of networking that we don't need to
worry about what wouldn't be good is if
when i turn my screen off my Wi-Fi stays
on all the time but with Wi-Fi calling
it has to do that and why does it have
to do that well basically if you're
going to receive a phone call over Wi-Fi
your Wi-Fi has to be on to be able to
receive it makes sense right but let's
go take a look and see exactly what i'm
talking about
any Android phone you should be able to
go to your home screen hit menu go to
settings go to wireless and networks
from there go to Wi-Fi settings from
there make sure your Wi-Fi is turned on
go to menu advanced and this will take a
minute because it's connecting right now
if yours was already connected it would
go right there really quickly best Wi-Fi
performance if your Wi-Fi is kind of
slow if your access points kind of far
away turning that on will help get you
better performance but it's also going
to consume some more battery power so be
advised about that setting but what
we're really after here is this Wi-Fi
sleep policy open that up and you can
see by default on the t-mobile mytouch
4G it's set to never sleep now what is
sleeping basically it's just turning
Wi-Fi off I don't like that but again if
you are using Wi-Fi calling you need to
have that but there's the trick if
you're not using Wi-Fi calling you don't
need to have that so let's change it to
never when plugged in now why never one
plugged in meaning it's never going to
sleep it's never going to turn the Wi-Fi
off when it's plugged in well to me
that's great that's perfect when I'm
plugged in I'm charging up in most cases
and I'm able to stream down any podcasts
any RSS feeds news feeds anything like
that that I have scheduled to happen at
night can come over Wi-Fi where it's
much faster and it's not going to impact
my battery life obviously because I'm
plugged in well more conservative still
is after 15 minutes so now when i turn
my screen off Wi-Fi is going to be on
for 15 minutes and then it's going to
turn off now that's not the way it is on
all phones for example let's come over
here to the epic 4g we're going to go
ahead and do the same thing if i can
find where it is on these capacitive
buttons that hide until you press them
go into settings wireless and networks
Wi-Fi settings menu advanced Wi-Fi sleep
policy and
right here you can see it will sleep
Wi-Fi when the screen turns off not
after 15 minutes but as soon as that
screen turns off or Never when it's
plugged in or never in this one defaults
to when the screen is turned off now
after 15 minutes and immediately when
the screen turns off that seems like an
awful big gap so let's see another phone
see how it does it this of course is the
g2 and we are going to go into settings
wireless I'm going to go to Wi-Fi
settings and this is a little bit slow
to respond right now because i just woke
it up and it's very very overclocked
normally it's a lot faster at responding
go into advanced again the Wi-Fi sleep
policy and again overclocking your phone
can mean that some things respond slower
than you'd expect them to and you can
see the settings we have here again
immediately when the screen turns off
never when plugged in and never so it's
the same as the epic 4g so how can you
use this technique to save battery power
basically as long as you don't have your
Wi-Fi set to never sleep move it to
never one plugged in or when the screen
turns off or after 15 minutes after the
screen turns up you should be fine the
impact that you're going to have of
course is you may not be able to get
some of those Wi-Fi calls or if you are
well if you're not under a cellular data
network then obviously you don't have
any data connection so at that point if
you find yourself in that circumstance
you may want to set it to never as well
but in any event as soon as you turn
your screen back on your Wi-Fi policy is
going to kick back on you're going to
connect again and everything should be
just fine and dandy but doing this will
save you in my experience about two to
three hours of battery life on the
mytouch 4G every day otherwise if you
have this at never you might not make it
through a full business day I usually
did but then had to plug in on my
commute on my way home otherwise I would
lose all of my battery light on the
phone would turn off so really quick
really simple kind of very deep in the
OS way to save some battery life simply
making sure that your wife I can sleep
when you don't need it to be awake kind
of neat let me know how much battery
life that saves you and if you've got
any other options in your Wi-Fi sleep
policy dialogue I'd be interested to
know what phone you have and what
settings you have in there as well as
which one you use on a normal everyday
basis leave that down below of course

quick tips and for pocket now i'm joe
