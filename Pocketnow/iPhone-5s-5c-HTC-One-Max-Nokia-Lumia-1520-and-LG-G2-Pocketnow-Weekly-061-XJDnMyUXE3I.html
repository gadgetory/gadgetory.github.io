as in the shoe at least according to
some pocketnow editors but what does the
s in 5s stand for will speculate on that
and speaking of letters and numbers will
get caught up in just how we feel about
the LG g2 and the Nokia Lumia 1520 and
so much more on episode 06 one of the
pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocket now where we discuss
smartphones tablets and the state of
mobile technology in 2013 I'm your host
Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now and today I'm joined by a
multimedia manager and chief football
expert Jaime Rivera down in Honduras
welcome back to the show sir hello sir
and I'm surprised you're able to always
nail that intro on the first clip you
know I almost choked on my coffee while
I was doing it and I'm sure it sounds
like it and opa thank you i appreciate
it and we're also joined by the man who
can't catch a break this week microsoft
fanzone punching bag contributing editor
Adam Dowd hello to you over there in the
middle of our great nation hello to you
and I'm impressed that you said football
and not soccer's I did it was important
to me that I pay the proper amount of
respect to a sport I pay no attention to
but which the world does and I've been
watching a lot of hype pocketnow daily
this week so I've seen a lot of pocket
now geez I've seen a lot of time his
shirts like yeah you know everyone else
is paying attention to this soccer thing
so I will call it football as is proper
house you don't have you know do you
know the United States team is already
dead they're pretty much classified to
the world to the world cup I pretty much
forgot that the u.s. had a soccer team
there their plan they're playing really
well that's awesome that's awesome to
hear there's normally I feel like I
don't hear about the US as lesser known
sports teams for a reason where it's
like oh we're doing really poorly and
like rowing or whatever well actually
the United States is more known for
their soccer team than they are for
football or baseball trust me what you
mean oh you mean on a global in a global
on a global scheme yet they they played
actually
this team plays really well in
comparison to other teams in previous
years well speaking of that before I get
out of my depth we're going to stop
talking about sports because I know
nothing about anything but I do want to
say that as we talk about these global
affairs it is really really nice to be
home this is our first podcast since the
international funk ausstellung in berlin
better known as Aoife Tony and I last
podcast it from a hotel room poised over
an unlikely and unstable microphone
stand did you guys see that picture I
didn't see the picture but I in my head
I saw you and Tony with a bottle of Jack
Daniels each smoking cigarettes hunched
over kind of like 1960s FBI style oh
yeah with like a single dangling exposed
light bulb and yes look wearing like
sweaty tank tops and just moving yeah
yeah lets you know close to it I mean
half of us where chain-smoking and we
were not drinking jack but Tony did did
expose me to some Romanian alinka know
his number wasn't p√°linka this tiny
although I did huh I I do have some more
uh he was nice enough to bring that it
no it was like some kind of sherry or
something like that it was it was like
an aperitif anyways lovely we were not
drunk as many many commenters some
commanders thought we were in fact just
exhausted but the point is and now I'm
back in my sound booth in America hi Mei
is in Honduras Adam is in the center of
America instead of the the coastal
seaboard and everything is where it
should be Tony's back in Romania he's
not on the podcast today and you guys
are welcome to ask me any questions
about Aoife that you would like I'm
talking to you guys on the air with me
and listeners and listeners if you want
to check out all of our Aoife coverage
which includes a whole bunch of
smartphones and tablets seriously a
whole lot you can check it out as they
clumsily named pocketnow.com / tags /
Aoife dash 2013 a link which will put in
the description below yeah yeah that's
good cuz I cut yeah you lost me after
pocket now let's just go to HTTP colon
front / front / yeah yeah c z colon
backslash okay I've only got one
um you are not a fan of tacky materials
so um how is that note 3 4 u.i I sadly
you know I couldn't get like the real
decision is Michael Fisher really liking
that phone so the note 3 you mean tacky
in the sense of like style well the back
is not real leather no it's not it's not
real leather but you know what i will
say this i had to be told that it wasn't
real leather not that I actively thought
that Samsung was going to use real
leather on its one of its most popular
smartphones I mean that would be very
very unpopular with a large swath of the
of the population who don't eat meat or
don't believe in you know using real
leather and stuff and yeah I'm fine with
that but I just didn't think about it
and the reason I didn't think about it
was because it felt good enough to me
that my brain didn't even go there I was
like oh yeah okay leather whatever so
whatever it is I unfortunately don't
know what it actually is i don't know if
it's technically pleather or if it's
just some kind of weird synthetic but it
feels great and the stitching you're
either gonna like it or not i feel like
this is the bold 9000 bold 9000 moment
for sound I was about to say and I love
the bold 9000 so you know I guess that
in the past for me the the Galaxy Note
the first iteration was like oh god I
can't I can't even see that thing then
the note too kind of grew on me after
your review but you know the note 3 is
like the first galaxy note that I see
and I'm like oh ok I want that yeah I
want that so I mean it's cool i'm glad
you say that because i haven't heard
other people's impressions of it too
much or haven't had the time to read him
and you know they've redone the rail
around the side they've made it Anton
was smart enough to call this out on the
last week's podcast I think he said the
kind of edge detailing on the on the
bezel or not the bezel but the the mid
plate the chrome bit all that is it's
meant to resemble pages of a notebook
and of course it is so you have all
these parallel lines in there and to me
it looked like a 1950's stylistic choice
unlike the side of a pencil sharpener or
something but you know it really looks
good and interesting yeah I'm just so
glad to see hyper glazed gone on the
note 3 we don't know what they're going
to do in the galaxy s5 and the rest of
their devices but it's it's cool i
understand that some people will not
like the pleather but i like it it
feels good it's got stitching I think
it's cool I'll I'm thinking I'm thinking
galaxy s5 stay with me here guys
feathers what if it was a touch would
know what a fix like what if it's like
velour and like you rub it one way and
it's one color you rub it the other way
it's a different color oh now you're in
the bay Sexton it just reminds me of
that scene and coming to America or king
jaffe Jaffa arrives to them to the
barbershop and so you know the guy comes
up and touches the line on his chest and
is like wow is that velvet you remember
that scene know you've made me want to
rewatch coming to America now oh that
was ever said a Murphy right yes it was
actually Eddie Murphy's when when Adam
and Eddie Murphy funny Murphy and yeah I
wish he still did funny movies so anyway
that yeah that that's the story in the
note 3 and we can talk more about if as
we roll in but that's not that you know
that was the news of last week it will
be the news again as we are going to get
review units of that the galaxy gear and
everything else for Saudi fuh but we
have bigger news this week and we're
going to kick things off with iOS
probably for the first time in the
weekly is in the last four weeks for
months of the pocket and weekly i would
say i think the last time I OS was first
probably was when the last iPads dropped
it's not like anything big happens right
oh well so so we had a collaborative
piece and I want to thank I may Rivera
for for putting up with my obstinate
ways whenever a collaborative piece
rolls around and I see it my inbox like
oh and there's a lot of reasons for that
but I thought I was alone on that oh you
two guys but the rumors the readers
actually like him in that is that the
comment threads are big and we're gonna
rework the collaborative template a
little bit because it's not very pretty
right now and we're going to do
something about that but we had a piece
where we all wait in except for me with
our thoughts on the brand new iphone 5s
and iphone 5c and we have Jaime Rivera
on the show today for a very specific
reason he is pocketknives resident iOS
champion we've adam doubt here on the
show because he is pocketknives resident
Windows Phone champion alongside Adam
Lane and I
hater and I we press out there right not
really but you know so we have a little
balance perspective and as usual I'm the
the control rod here so hi may I want
you to walk us through your thoughts of
what Apple you know let us through
earlier this week and I will remind our
readers also that there is a there's a
live broadcast recording you can watch
of all of us getting this news live on
the air which is tagged under the iOS
tab on pocket now but Jaime your
thoughts on the five s in the 5c you
know I guess the 5s it's you know it's
it's like I was actually watching your
review of the galaxy s4 a couple of days
ago because I was doing the script for
the after the buzz that I'm working on
um and you know the iPhone 5s is like
the galaxy s4 for the galaxy s3 and
submitter of improvement you look at the
phone and it's really hard to tell any
differences but you know the little
things that they changed for me
particularly in my usage scenario are
substantial you know that fingerprint
thing I'm the type of guy that does use
passwords you don't for example um so
for you that is not important for me it
is you know I live in a country in a
country where theft is very common um
and your your phone continuously becomes
your wallet um in so anyways you know I
keep all my credit card information on
my phone I keep all my personal
information on my phone you know all my
contacts my communications with
everybody is on my phone and definitely
I want to keep everything as private as
I as I can in the case of theft um and
the fact that I don't have to be hiding
my phone to hide the password for my
kids for example um because they could
just sneak up and sneak up on you and
play with you play with angry birds or
stuff um you know the fact that that you
know that they finally figured out the
fingerprint scanner it's like we've had
it for years I used to have it in IBM
computers years ago and it worked kind
of well um and you know motorola took a
stab at it you remember those HP pocket
pcs from years ago they took a stab at
the
the ipaq 5555 I think it was does it
really have this yea yea years ago it's
been it's been a while and nobody has
really gotten it right and I'm just
happy that somebody finally did you know
for me the 5s is not really about the 5s
but it's the fact that now everybody's
gonna start doing it right finally so
hopefully hopefully that's the case yeah
let's let's let's let's hedge our bets a
little bit we haven't actually seen this
in practice yet so and it is tough but I
understand why I would put it that way
because it is it when Apple has
something ready for release generally
it's yes ready for prime time and it's
you know really cooked Apple is always
late to the game that you know they
either leapfrog or they're late that's
just the way they are right and you know
you know I whatever I I guess I'm just
disappointed at the whole at the whole
idea of the camera it's like oh we've
got a new technology of a flash and I'm
like man you tell that to a photographer
and he's gonna gag you oh why because
it's not necessarily new because there's
no optical image stabilization in this
day and age and the flash is not a
solution for people you know right but
you but the flesh has been a problem
point I want to say I got excited when
they announced the flash because i hate
the flesh i never use it because it
destroys photos when I exactly because
it exactly she's yet but but a flesh
that doesn't you know white out your
whole foreground it will be nice yeah
but the problem is for example you those
photos that you have of the review of
the HTC one where you're taking a photo
of the depth of that subway yeah okay
you can't do that with a flash for
example right no it has to be that has
to be a long exposure with exactly so I
guess what I'm saying is the flash is
you know I was expecting Apple to at
least figure that one out to not be late
to optical image stabilization too
that's the only disappointment with the
5s you know I i love the fingerprint
scanner um I've been reading so many
articles of the 64-bit processor and
what it means to the future of
applications um the only thing I'm gonna
tell you is I'm sadly not Joe Levi so I
still don't really I still don't really
know how great this is gonna be until I
see it in practice um this sadly sadly i
come from the time where I remember or
64 bits coming to pcs and it was chaos
at the beginning it was
I remember that too and you know what I
didn't even understand it back then and
I'm fortunately I didn't have enough
foresight to research it then so i would
know what i was talking about now
because it was funny when the the live
broadcast just completely derailed when
all of us were like wait we don't know
what we're talking about yeah but okay
so you know the the fingerprint scanner
i like the 64 bit i'd like to see in the
case of the camera is another thing
where i'm like ok let's wait for the
review unit most likely you know
Brandon's gonna get it and he's gonna
tell us if he likes it or not that's
that's gonna be the point in the case of
it yeah in the case of the iphone 5c
gentlemen and ladies that you know
listeners you be careful one man on this
show ordered that stayed up until 3am to
order that 5c last night you stay up
until 3 i'm drinking Dunkin Donuts
coffee you may be no sacrifice for that
no that's not true I was so comfortable
on my couch I was falling asleep to
family guy after a gross pizza like
that's what was happening in my life and
it was so nice and then my alarm went
off and it was freaking 250 and I was
like oh come on man and then I had to
deal with the apple store click all
right babe I'll talk about that a second
tell us about your thoughts on the 5c
that I have committed to like okay so
there is nothing different between the
5c in the iphone 5 there are some
differences the battery is bigger the
battery's bigger one else it's a pretty
color right okay so yeah I guess what
I'm saying is this um Apple is getting
slammed right now in the stock market
and the reason why is because they you
know they were being pushed to provide a
budget alternative to the iphone and so
you know here comes Tim Cook and I say
oh we've got a new strategy now where
we're not gonna be leaving the old phone
and dropping hundred books on the price
what we're gonna be doing is gonna bring
the whole new phone and so it makes you
wonder okay so you know they would have
you know they switched the materials to
plastic but then it's the same iphone 5
only with different materials and they
pretty much did what they would have
done other years they just dropped the
price tag by a hundred bucks and so
they're getting slammed in the stock
market because this is not a budget
iPhone it's just another iteration of
the iphone 5 you know nothing has really
changed its like that they would have
left the five it's like the view it
listeners if you have a knife
five right now keep it yeah but there is
no point to upgrade all right but but if
we can be a little more forward-looking
what what Apple is done this is the
first time in Apple's history with the
iphone that they have today have taken
the iphone and they have split it
they've split the family into a high-end
version and a lower end version no
longer is the high end version
automatically going to become next
year's low end even though i'm sure that
will persist assault agree now they have
to product families now that this gives
them the room now next year to take the
higher end and go like here's a bigger
one hears whatever and then here's the
five Cs or whatever okay but that's
that's exactly what I'm trying to tell
you soon they that's what they said on
the keynote but they didn't really do it
you know the iphone 5c is just the five
only with a plastic you know it's it's
the iphone 5 with the case sure but
video but if i do exactly where you're
going with that high may even recognize
you're getting ready to say it is the
iphone bible the case but isn't the case
you shouldn't we not marginalize the
case considering how much customization
has entered the market since the last
iphone launched I mean shouldn't we
treat the case as important even though
that sounds stupid to treat a plastic
polycarbonate color yes you know I guess
I guess that the point that I'm trying
to make is this the iphone 5c would have
mattered it would have cost three
hundred dollars three hundred fifty
dollars four hundred dollars if is like
a high cost here but my point is that
they have not really innovated in any
way with this phone you know in favor of
the masses they simply change the
backing of a already existing phone and
they kept the same price scheme that
they had for the last four years so
they're not really changing anything you
know that that's my point i mean if they
would have launched this phone with a
plastic bag and that plast i mean what's
the difference between giving me an
iphone 5 with anodized aluminum in
different colors than to give me an
iphone 5c with a plastic back in
different colors because that's pretty
much what they did and they're charging
me just as if they would have downgraded
the iphone 5 into the you know the
entry-level model this is the second
entry level model i guess i guess my
point is that the reason why apple is
being slammed in the stock market is
this phone is just a camouflage way of
doing the same thing they haven't
changed anything if this phone if the
iphone 5c would have been a hundred
dollars less or if it were if it would
have brought you know a different
pricing strategy to you know to pull in
teenagers or something I mean this looks
like another microsoft kin you know like
another product where they're gonna have
to pay the full data plan and just for a
hundred bucks more you can get the full
iphone 5s so I do feel honestly sorry
but I feel that this phone is gonna flop
you feel the fact she is gonna flop i
mean III do if it were any other company
i would agree with you i do and the only
reason why we're not gonna know this why
are we not gonna know that this phone is
gonna flop is because apple sadly calls
their iphone sales as a whole meaning
regular don't break it down between 5805
they don't break it down we don't know
how many iPad minis were sold we don't
know how many iphone and and you know we
just have no way of knowing so sadly we
won't know the phone flops or not well
you will get a feel for it though you'll
be able to keep your finger on the pulse
of just yet through anecdotal evidence
is like what do I see on the train yeah
and this and this is I know that's
that's crappy data but you know it's
something at least yeah so and you know
what it's funny I might want to walk the
line at the boylston street apple store
next week and just be like what do you
what do you buy which one are you
getting because they're both launching
on the 20th right yeah yeah yeah so all
right we have a windows phone guy on the
podcast we want to hear is some
alternate perspectives here and adam
doubt i will say before I let you talk
about the iphone adam doubt is too
polite for the pocket now weekly just
jump in just just just you know this is
the this is the show that Taylor Martin
co-host on all of ya you know this right
she just does just steamroll over it
there there's a reason why there there's
a reason why that is Taylor the tailor I
am to me before the shows like enjoy the
podcast without me jerk I was like yeah
we will it'll be nice to have a
transition for once serious I actually
he imed me I total I told them I'd hook
you up with a couple of a segue Buster
oh I appreciate thank you yeah
absolutely so tell us Adam dad wrote a
piece called a Windows Phone fans view
of the new iphone and this was basically
a III what I would probably say you
panda you know I the so tell us Adam in
fewer
then you used in the piece and why you
are not going to be standing in line
next Friday and what you know why that
is well well as you said on the intro i
am and i am anna kind of an apple hater
I really I just I've never liked Apple
I've never liked the whole you know by a
two-hundred-dollar mp3 player and get
the exact same thing for what a $35 mp3
player I'll get now just I don't like
that I just never have never will so I
will not be I will not be staying in
line although I will admit I you know I
was watching a tailor's iOS 7
walkthrough and then there were some
intriguing things there that made me
kind of like mm-hmm but i'm still not
there so that's that now we i was
looking at your 5s and 5c our
collaborative piece there and you were
say you know sometime in the future it
may not be completely crazy for me to
support an iphone as a daily driver said
items out and then you're gonna verse
imploded on you my hand spontaneously
combusted yes flip flop Adam down choose
a side no I am a flip-flopper I'm very
much offense writer so but what I mean
what a boils down to is I mean from a
windows phone perspective there was
nothing about the iphone that made me
say oh I need to go get an iphone screen
you'll screw this iphones or this
Windows Phone stuff so it's just you
know I kind of ran down like the key
features the 64-bit chip does nothing
for me the fingerprint scan he does
nothing for me the camera compared to
the 1020 it does nothing for me so
pretty much where I am is I'm still just
kind of waiting for Apple to you know to
blow me away and they have yet to do
that and you know further what Apple
does is not going to have it's not going
to affect Windows Phone a lick windows
phone is really too small for them to be
concerned for competitors are doing
windows phone is small enough where
they're gonna make or break themselves
so there was nothing about the iphone
announcement that made me think oye
windows phone is gonna charge or there
was nothing that says oh no we're
screwed so it was just it's windows
phone is sitting on its on its own right
now and it determines its own fate so
that was kind of my view well yeah but
that's true but I mean windows phone
just like any other platform takes a
note of what the competition is doing
and and appropriates what it needs to
and delight in its own version so you
don't see any any kind of thing we might
see in GDR for Windows Phone you know
making up things because I still just
want amber huh I've got I've got my poor
AT&amp;amp;T lumia 920 that still is amber lyst
Thank You carriers yeah so all right so
another compelling reason to get an
iphone so it's in September 18
everybody's gonna get iOS 7 that's just
the way it is we've mentioned this a
couple times now and the link is in the
rundown as usual folks the iOS 7 gold
master is it's officially out right yeah
yes and Taylor Martin that's why Taylor
Martin was able to do that walk through
sorry guys it's the end of the week and
I'm a little confused in the head but
Taylor Martin did this great great video
walkthrough of like hey here's what iOS
7 looks like now that it's out of beta
here's the changes that have taken place
here's what customers are going to be
seeing on their on their iPhones yeah
and I watched this video right before we
came on the air and I tweeted that I was
giggling like a schoolgirl watching it
and not in derision but in excitement
because as listeners know because I've
said it 40 million times I haven't had
an iphone since 2008 so coming back to
iOS after that amount that stretch of
time is filling me with a lot of
excitement particularly because I like a
lot of what i see in iOS 7 that's good
that's gonna be huge for you having
taken such a long layoff exactly and as
it relates to you Adam having spent
having myself spent so much time with
Windows Phone because there was seven
maybe it's the flood and elements maybe
it's the pronounced use of color there's
a lot of factors to it but it reminds me
a lot of Windows Phone in its simplicity
particularly at the lock screen if you
just kind of hop on over to the to the
unlock a keypad I'm like oh yeah well
those aren't squares their circles but
it's like oh yeah hey Metro what's up
okay so I'm excited in that sense
because it was always the chrome that
kept me like annoyed about iOS so I'm
very excited to look at it from that
perspective I'm excited to see it from
the perspective of somebody who's been
away for a long time but for an old
guard person like you high man
we've talked about before but now we
have the gold master what what are your
feelings about this new flavor of iOS so
I've been using the beta and now the
gold master since day one reverie single
beta since it's been right that's why I
asked because you've been using it
consistently but you also spend a whole
lot of time with the old chromed up
version yeah um I like it it's visually
pleasing to me at first it was hard to
to get used to the contrast and and you
know because the greens are like really
green yeah and then the Reds are like
really red but you know there's a lot of
genius you know I I told us we had this
call with a Brandon yesterday and I'm
like man you know sometimes I feel like
if Apple somehow discovered who invented
HTC Sense 5 and hired the guy secretly
or or within that whole HTC and Apple
settlement they kind of came to an
agreement of collaboration or something
because i've been using HTC Sense 5 for
like three weeks on the HTC One X and
you know I see a lot of you know a lot
of things are very similar like the
weather application it's like a strict
copy of hcc sense um the photos
application that whole stacking of
photos with events and everything that
sends five um you know that the
typography looks a lot like since five
but then again you know i like it i feel
that it was it was a great enhancement
and you know it's not a lot of people
are like oh this is just lipstick on a
pig and well now it wasn't really a pig
it just it just needed a revamp a we
won't be my argument that it was indeed
a pig but that pig has been not just you
know putting a lipstick has not just put
been put on it but we've gone with the
dress okay so you know the hat and so
for example if you goes in so for
example um is it more efficient no um is
it faster no but iOS 6 wasn't slow no I
know it wasn't slow so I guess that's
the thing you know what what could Apple
enhance from iOS that wasn't aesthetics
and that wasn't you know how practical
it was because for me yet control
centers like oh god what
to take these people so long a simple
control center is the swipe up from the
bottom and you get those goggles like a
Lima and you get the targos i guess i've
written like six editorials on what are
you gonna do this and it's finally there
and not only is it there hi mate but
it's not implemented in the android way
which is increasingly stupid as you get
higher screen sizes and you continue to
have to swipe down from the top which is
dumb because it's from 100 usability
swiping up from the bottom makes all the
sense in the world and i will mention
this because the commenters will yes you
can get custom roms that do this my
friend Chris Larson is running a droid
DNA with a custom rom where you can
swipe arts from just from the clocks uh
well you know people not on this podcast
but but a lot of people listen nobody
but the point is I've seen it I've seen
it implemented well in a custom rom on
android i just wished android as a whole
would undertake this but you know what
we're not talking about that right now
we're talking about iOS 7 and the
control center coming up in the bottom
is yes so incredibly logical i just i'm
in love with it before I've even used it
yeah no I guess that like for example um
there are some applications that are
already being updated to iOS 7 like for
example there's this temperature
application that i use that i really
like because it gives me a toggle for
for the information of the temperature
and for example in the past and you you
have to deal with this with Windows
Phone you have to deal with this with
Android where you launch an application
and you have to wait for it to refresh
and with iOS now it notices which are
the applications that you use more and
it'll automatically update it in the
background if that's one of the
applications that you use the most so
I'm so that's like for example Wow you
know i I've hated this ever since you
know I had to move away from windows
mobile because in Windows Mobile you
didn't have that problem the application
would would trigger the the update it
wasn't a server it was the app that was
doing it right you know and and so for
me ok so these these are things that all
operating systems struggle with and that
iOS is finally figuring figuring this
out simple things like that syria's
getting better so again if you're
expecting this to be to make the iphone
better than it was no but again I
you know I like that I really think it
does make the iphone better than it was
listen it's just visually better um it's
usually better we just spent long
minutes talking with a yeah oh yeah plus
we've got the cards and I know Adam dad
will appreciate the the card based
multitasking yeah yeah what's her face
multitasking oh it's this thing that
they got lighters for this old company
oh yeah you see it on windows phone
every day oh yeah but on Windows Phone
infuriatingly you can't throw the car
can't toss them away oh so you know and
I let you can do that you can I'm gonna
I'm gonna stomp on here something really
quick I just saw something come from
Stephen shank on my Twitter feed saying
HP is going to make a windows phone what
isn't that great wait is that true I
just saw it was just on the twitter feed
is probably on the homepage i'm looking
at a remote panetta right now as well
let's see when does my HP rumored to
produce Windows Phone hands rumored
excuse me all right this is just
breaking I love this I love Friday
afternoon late breaking news and by the
way should renounce this a top listeners
we're going to try this friday thing for
the weekly from now on because i like it
better and rumors very light on
specifics but supposedly a trusted
source indicates HP's been working a new
smartphone for a while now and it looks
like it's going to be a windows phone 8
model basically but we're down since
2010 but anyway listen this makes all
kinds of sense but i doubt they're going
to impress me considering what they've
done in their tablet sector but yeah
we'll see we'll see here anyway uh sorry
i didn't mean oh no dude that was that
was awesome thank you for that heads up
uh so there's a lot to talk about here i
want to ask about one more thing before
we move on to the final topic of iOS 7
part of my wonderment and excitement at
watching taylor's walkthrough was seeing
the parallax wallpaper effect in iOS 7
which is one of the most useless pieces
of crofton whole thing but it looks
amazing on video how does it look in
person i'm it because it makes it's not
just that the wallpaper is moving with
your with your motion which we've seen
on android since 2010 it's yet the icons
appear to be hovering on a different
layer than the background right yeah
everything is layered and I you know I
like that
mentality where you know everything is
like logical you know that they're you
know you know that the that control
center is laying on top of something and
it tries to give you that that
perspective and and in the case of the
parallax you know I guess what I like
about it the most is that it works with
anything you put on it meaning it
doesn't have to be an apple wallpaper
like for example you know moving
wallpapers on Android have to be moving
wallpapers for them to work you know and
and there are certain things that just
don't happen unless the wallpaper
support center stuff like that work
whereas here it could be a photo of you
of you and your girlfriend or whatever
and the parallax will work and I like
that you know I I like that it's it's a
very you know it's a very simplistic and
some people will call it dumb visual
effect but it just gives the phone this
this this um dimensions it's a little
detail I'm it's a little detail yeah
it's the people people get caught up in
the details that it's been an awesome
thing of the cell phone worlds yeah the
one of the cell phone room the crown
molding oh when you when you go into old
building and they have the wood thing
going around the top of the top of the
wall what is he like with where the wall
meets the ceiling is that what the
molding is there's a molding there's
yeah it's kind of it's kind of a big
deal in carpentry so really yeah you a
carpenter Adam death ah my father was
filled with many things up yeah yeah
cool so was Jesus hey you're sure
learning all kinds of things on the
pocket I week later that's right month
so before we moved entirely out of iOS I
want to spring to the defense of
something that both of you have maligned
savagely on the show today and you know
I've got a bone to pick with the both of
you I think the fingerprint scanner is
cool I love it so you love it I love it
oh yeah it's great wait you look you
just talked about how useless it is how
doesn't do it no no no I was the one
that said that I love it I for me that
that though that's right i'm sorry it's
adam that single feature alone is enough
for me to buy an iphone 5s I think you
just dismissed it in terms of like the
broad the broad appeal but listen that
thing excites me more than anything else
about the 5s I just couldn't depend on
how it works I mean you know he's a lock
code Adam I do you know I do not not
sure why I
I do not and the reason I don't is
because that is the last thing I want to
do is put this added step every single
time i unlock my phone I've either doing
a gesture or doing a lock code or doing
a facial recognition or something like
that right the the thing that is the so
compelling about the fingerprint scanner
is that if it works as advertised it's
just you know every time you want to spy
a nap you want to buy an apple you do is
put your friend right you know brilliant
and we just think about it in the case
of security I mean what better than your
fingerprint there's nothing else is
infallible your your password could be
seen by somebody else um it is just so
easy no security system is better than
your fingerprint and for me for that to
become a standard in smartphones because
that's the way it's gonna be next year
the galaxy s5 is gonna bring a
fingerprint scanner you can bet on it
yes gonna hell they would implement that
though cuz i mean the home button makes
perfect sense to put a finger print
button you know to make it put a
fingerprint scanner there cuz your
fingers gonna be touching anyway and
it's it's right there its front and
center on the phone I don't know where a
galaxy s4 would put a fingerprint you'll
give you they'll give you a bigger home
button that's what they'll do that's
probably with it because we know they
love their home button yeah but that's
not going away so that's that's the real
genius here and i can already you know
despite the fact that we've mentioned
this before i can already see the
comments streaming in it's like Apple
wasn't the first but yeah we had it on
the atrix on the back and it was part of
the power stand by key from motorola
motorola first they do it was terrible
and it didn't work very well at all
right it was terrible I mean that that's
my problem i mean how can you how can
you rely you know rely your security on
a part that you can't guarantee will
always work it's like you know apple
still has syrian beta for example
they're still smart enough to tell you
that it's not finished no you know it's
so I I approached for Gmail yeah for
gmail but it's true I mean how can you
sell me a phone and boast about the
fingerprint scanner if it's not gonna
work all the time right yeah well I'm
curious to see is how it's gonna work in
adverse conditions how is it gonna work
when it's raining how's it gonna work
when your hands are dirty alyssum
weren't listen and this is funny you
know people were making this comment
they were like it's not gonna work with
my glove and I'm like
in the past for you to type in the
password to your iPhone you had to take
the gloves off anyways well I mean like
where I'm going from us it's like if
your hands were wet you still had to dry
them out to touch the screen so why why
are you trying to make a point about
this it is you're still gonna your
behavior pattern is still gonna continue
this is not a galaxy s4 active it's an
iphone I get it but Jaime I'm a
geocacher my hands are rarely clean yes
so I just you know right I'm out in the
woods I'm you know digging through grass
and leaves looking for stupid ammo boxes
and you know I'm a dirty dirty boy and I
need dear God where have we gone oh my
god average listener account just
plummeted 2500 two thousand so we have a
division of nails yeah tool time okay i
guess i I just I just want to make this
point clear make it there nothing
nothing is gonna change about your usage
you're getting an enhancement in the
past way you had as a button that the
button will still work meaning if you
have your gloves on and you push it the
button will still work so the only
difference is you're not gonna be able
to unlock your phone or turn off this
the the the fingerprint and set it to
your password you're still gonna have to
take your gloves off because there is no
sensitivity on the arm we've got that we
are going to circle back to this on
listener mail by the way so you will
have the opportunity to opine further
there never was and over fifty percent
of the population in the United States
is carrying an iphone right now and
they've learned to live with it mmmmmm
that's a great marketing slogan by an
iphone and live with live with it dot
jpg you know the brings amperes oh no no
no no no I want to talk about the
component okay because I this is
important because the fingerprint
scanner we're never going to get a
consensus on this until there's millions
of them on the market and finally people
either deal with it dot PNG or as a you
know return them all right so that's
humbler
compy ok so thatthat's we'll talk more
about this in the future but the problem
is right now it appears to be giving
apple some serious serious trouble in
meeting demand and that's that's
projected demand at this point I think
but the iphone 5s fingerprint scanner
yield meaning they're good the capacity
of the companies to build it is
according to one analyst terrible yes
this one's say I'm i want to say today
does it say I'm gonna say this animal
Apple is apolis you know they did it
last year with the iphone 5 bomb they're
trying to create buzz in order for the
demand to skyrocket you think the key
bogus I think this is bogus I feel that
Apple manipulates the system for the
stock market to to like them you know oh
they're out of stock so out of stock
means they've sold a ton of phones and
that makes your stock prices skyrocket
well no that's actually quite the
opposite the analysts is saying that
because they're going to be unable to
meet the band their stock prices going
down and to address your other point i
saw when i saw that comp that same
comment they're just trying to create
demand when has apple ever had to create
demand for an iphone I'll give you an A
cup I'll give you a clear example why is
there no pre order for the 5s why either
start there's their stock price is fifty
percent down right now and what they
need is for people to plummet those
stores for the media to go crazy for CNN
to report on it for The Wall Street
Journal to report on it so that
investors are happy that people still
want to buy an iPhone ok so yet so
you're saying it's it's purely a
tactical push it's a tactical push
that's my purse that's my opinion ok
I've I've got a delves as far into the
boiler room as I can go on this one so
yes I mean the deal is that they're
they're saying that the foxconn or
whoever is only going to build between
five and ten million 5s units this
quarter which will you know not at all
meet meet meet the projected demand i
don't think so i guess we will have to
see what what happens here but i guess
my question is
is assuming this is true are the added
benefits that the fingerprint scanner
brings worth the trouble essentially
well in my particular case um if you
want to sell your iphone 5 this is the
time so so yeah you know if you don't
sell if you don't sell your phone now on
ebay it's gonna be worth a lot less next
week so yeah this is what isn't it's
it's the smartest thing to get rid of it
now and get the 5s you know so yeah
that's that's like the only compelling
reason why yeah you want to get the
latest and greatest you want to get some
good gravy over your current devices
like the right time to sell it and to
probably live with a nokia 33 something
for you know one of those old dumb
phones while your phone arrives but yeah
i guess that's the only reason why it's
compelling for people to go crazy over
it now because that that's that's it you
know the head I don't know how many the
thing is I think they're starting to
sell this phone on day one in China yeah
that's that's good that's a big deal and
we should have talked about that alone
that that's that's gonna make the phone
like disappear on day one you know
they're the shipments are not even gonna
leave the factory right you're just
gonna go pick them up there get you know
you know by the way before before we
leave before I I'm sorry I'm killing
your segue but yeah I'm doubt or even
like it's just in my brain it didn't
even make it to my mouth yet you're
going the bonus round on Segway I know
I'm gonna ask you one little thing about
that Nokia that Nokia feature of the
high sensitivity on this on the display
speaking of the fingerprint scanner so
sensitive touch tell me something that
super sensitive touch is automatic or
you have to send it as far as i know
it's automatic as i have never said it
you can set you can set the level the
sensitivity level to utilize change it
yeah okay so see that that's no better
yes that that's really my problem that's
see that's the only that's my problem
with with these products it's like yeah
it's cool to have but if you have to be
setting it then what's the point well
because you want to be setting it in
different conditions you're like if
you're if you're the type of person who
hovers his thumb uncertainly over the
screen when you're browsing like I don't
know where to
go you don't want that hover to trigger
a link you know like you want to be able
to customize a little bit like Windows
Phone fell into the trap of not allowing
enough customization so in a lot of
Windows Phone there's just you going to
like settings and it's like wow I can't
really manipulate much of this and
lately nokia kind of came to the rescue
with some some stuff in the amber update
to oh yeah I guess what I'm saying is
going back to that comment that we've
been getting about you know the iphone
not being usable with a glove or
anything I don't want to go back there
I'm so tired of this stupid argument
let's let's let's talk about something
else okay pretty sure we rolled up the
shutters on them yeah I'm so done I'm so
done with that but i did want to i do
want to continue touching on
fingerprints as we move into android and
we'll go back we'll get back to iOS on
our next week's show and also i'll be
unboxing my 5c on friday and i'm really
jazzed so well color league I got blue
when I meant to get a green case for the
blue phone but instead I was so
exhausted that i got a blue case for the
blue phone so i'm gonna be the most
boring iphone 5c carrier you're serious
I didn't meet I was tired we're gonna be
carrying a blue phone and everyone's
gonna know oh he got the cheap one oh
look at that yo you what would this is
classic be finished in brave new world
right now right what's nice is that
thankfully you do not have to be on iOS
to experience the wonders of a
fingerprint scanner if any of these
leaks are going to be believed we're
talking about android now we are
changing up the links in the rundown
just a little bit and we're talking
about the HTC one max the branding has
leaked for it we well supposedly we know
that it's going to be called the max
with 1x which makes sense because they
don't to get mobile motorola it has
popped up in some test photos and this
has been consistent throughout i think
all of the HTC one max leaks there is a
big ol square sitting beneath the big ol
camera lens on this big big phone and
that square is what everyone believes to
be or many people at least a fingerprint
scanner in a level in a lovely placement
in it lovely placement now we were just
saying that the fingerprint scanner is a
power standby button didn't really work
on
motorola atrix and it's the home button
is kind of the perfect place for it on
the iphone 4 at 5s but this one is right
below the camera lens on the back
coincidentally in the same location as
the volume buttons and power standby
button on the LG g2 which I have right
here in which we'll talk about in a
second and also where the convenient
little dimple is on the back of the
motorola x it is a very natural place
for your finger to go when you're using
a phone is this guy's a sensible
location frosty I think a fingerprint
scanner on HTC it's gonna be a brilliant
idea unlike the iphone no I'm Kelly I
was just gonna say are you just being a
troll is that what's going on da da da
uh no actually I'm just wondering how
many dirty camera lenses we're gonna
have because people you nailed it you
nail you need a lot of ultrapixels to
make up for the fingerprint blurs on the
knee they getting on your phone your uh
photo sir right so hi mate you agree
with that oh yeah that's for me it's
like yeah it's a good placement sadly
you know the camera is exactly just on
top of it so that's gonna be nice it's
brilliant and it's stupidity well you
know maybe we're going to see something
done with texture here it is a square as
opposed to a circle maybe the corners
will be definable by your fingers and
you'll be able to tell the difference i
have not had any trouble on the LG g2
with differentiated in the lens from the
buttons but that's because the power
standby has a little hump on the back
and of course the motorola x dimple is a
dimple instead of the lens so maybe HTC
will do something similar but i'm
curious as to your guys thoughts on the
implementation on the software side I
mean will will this be a custom build of
sense that disallows and unlock unless
your finger is on that little square do
you think will or will will that in
laxmi and implementation not even be
used will they use it for something else
well I do know that the the sense lock
function is very unique to sense up to
the point where there's this application
that i have its called the delay lock
where it's always like if you have an
HTC phone this is not gonna work it's oh
yeah and so go ahead go ahead and it's
gonna be awkward as hell if you're gonna
be using that for a lockscreen i just
got me
I guess maybe if you're using your index
finger but I'm just when I pick up my
phone I don't really naturally put any
fingers anywhere close to the camera so
really and we only like like bear claw
like you good thing like I users oh okay
yeah not just I don't know I just pick
up a phone my palm it you know this is
what I do so I mean I just I don't I I
don't see how that's gonna work for a
lock screen but I been wrong before is
many many many Twitter users have
pointed out where you know where else
would we implement such a thing I mean
maybe authentication in the Google Play
storages does android allow for that
kind of for that kind of customization
of authentication or no I mean I imagine
if any OS did it probably would be
Android it would be Android yeah I wish
I wish we had Joel iveta shed some light
on this when i'm sure the homes are
there's something better with a home
button is where's the home button on the
one max that I it's like a skit alright
so we've talked enough about
fingerprints but maybe that thing isn't
even a fingerprint scanner maybe it is
the biggest flash to ever grace a smile
I was about to say yeah it could be a
xenon Wow there's my I mean there's a
little spot just to the left of it yes
which looks like a flash well but the
load the Lumia 1020 has an LED flash in
a xenon flash all that's true you can do
both now what one question did do any of
you believe that the reason why we
didn't get a one max editha is because
they wanted to see what Apple was gonna
launch you know when it comes up when it
comes to fingerprint when it comes to
fingerprint technology that would make
sense well HTC likes doing their own
thing like yeah Samsung does too but
they've also launched all of the notes
at Aoife so that's kind of a you know
tradition for them I don't as far as
long as I've been covering this stuff
which isn't very long HTC has not really
been a huge present set at Aoife I mean
they kind of launched their mid range
stuff there you know so no yeah I didn't
really had a good point you have to
mention the one max I mean it's it's
been in development for what 12 months
or so I mean this is not like a brand
new thing they just decided to toss out
in the oboe wait let's see what Apple
does and if Apple does something similar
we're gonna scrap exactly right because
they say they're way too late in the
game if
thing is real they're way too late in
the game to change anything yeah mobile
device development is not nearly as
nimble as people like to think that it
is right so I mean it's not like it's
not like Samsung is gonna you know now
that they've seen the iphone
announcement now we're gonna go and
we're gonna get to the drawing board and
we're gonna start designing the s5 they
probably already have cocktail napkins
with the s6 already sketched on it right
yeah as fast actually I got some insight
into that in my first my first ever
event that I covered remotely which was
the galaxy s3 launch and we were talking
to a lot of people inside Samsung that
was wonderful and I really got some nice
insight into how far in advance that
stuff is planned like these guys were
saying yeah you know we we got the s3
out the door in phase 1 of 4 or whatever
we that moved on from our department and
we immediately turn to our next project
and it wouldn't say at that point what
their next project was but it turned out
to be the note 2 and you know that was
you know far in advance so anyway the
one max before we move on to the other
HTC device concerns me gents and it is
concerning to me because it doesn't seem
to listen we know nothing about the
software but there's no hardware support
for anything other than a phone what is
this big display right what I'm saying
is why is this thing so big it has to I
think the software has to carry this I
guess what I'm saying is there's no
s-pen analog no stylus and so it's just
a giant screen for a giant screens sake
right and so which means that the
software will have to carry this
entirely and this is not the last time
on this podcast we will make this point
because there's another big screen phone
we have to talk about in a second but so
what do you guys think this will be the
first super huge HTC screen we've seen
how do we think that they're going to
take advantage of this extra real estate
and besides smaller tiles and blinkfeed
you know I would hope that they would do
like a an S galaxy note 3 type of
implementation of like a side-by-side
app usage you know some type of
multitasking capability i mean i don't i
don't have an HTC one so i'm not even
sure what their multitasking capability
is on the one excited from what i've
read
um the one I haven't yeah there's not
there's really not much there's I
haven't seen anyone doing with ya no no
that's because it has a 4.7 inch screen
I mean it's not a big it's not rotten
room 5.3 or 5.5 I mean isn't it just
time to make a big a phone just because
everybody wants a big a phone at this
point so I'm using Michael's swearing
strategy there thank you yeah yeah well
it's not new i mean we've got the galaxy
mega decrying and then nobody cares
about these things that the problem is
the only reason why the note makes sense
is because call it gimmicky or whatever
you want to call it the s-pen lures
people it makes it gives it a gives it a
reason for being but it is it'll wreath
it's not just the s-pen I mean it's also
the multitasking approach which is very
intelligent right but it's just funny i
have two friends that have a node 2 and
they had no clue that that thing had
that multi screen ok i thought you were
gonna say that no clue it had an S Pen
like they bought it just for the S Pen
you know and they bought it just for the
S Pen it was funny and i sat down with
the guys and listen just press and hold
the back button he's like oh my god hey
I wish the s3 had a nice fence I mean I
would hey you would buy just about
anything just by the siege by the sea
pen bro it's the same day you know come
on our listeners are gonna believe you
they're gonna go on don't don't 5c pen I
won't have a special episode of worst
gadgets ever just for the sea pen god I
hate it so the HTC One max we'll see if
it can differentiate itself we got to
keep moving here because we do have so
much news and shows getting longer every
minute the big phone coverage continues
with the LG g2 which I have sitting next
to me you know what I have sitting next
to that guys and maybe on another LG g2
is correct and you know we got no its
next to that LG g2 LG is hilarious so
the reason we were late in the g two
guys is because we had an address
problem this this was supposed to go to
tailor while i was at Aoife and instead
it came to me in boston and my office
and unfortunately what happened there
was i wasn't yeah
so that my office unloved and untouched
by anyone for the entire time I was if I
came home and I got off the plane and
I'm like God why isn't Taylor's G to
review up yet what's going on with this
and then I found out what was going on
with that so that's why our G to review
is late but then LG did something funny
the next day after I'd unbox the GTO
Mike okay I'm gonna start getting to
know the g2 at my doorbell rang and went
downstairs to my office from my office
and I came back upstairs with a bag
containing two more LG so we owe this
isn't not only do they said you the one
you weren't supposed to get but
essentially two more just in case
exactly exactly so that's it's pretty
cool and you know item I don't mean to
seem seem like it's it's a stupid thing
I mean it's great we get to experience
both flavors we've done the double
unboxing we've shown you how that what
the differences are key among them the
unlit global unlocked version comes with
these awesome headphones and the
carriers variants do not and you know
that's just sad panda that's just really
mean to do on a flagship class device if
you're going to take headphones out of a
mid-range or fine if you're going to
take headphones out of a like banner
halo smartphone that's just I don't know
man I a much money could they possibly
be saving yeah i understand i wonder
then want to pass that cost on to the
consumer excite i want to break the 199
price point or whatever it is but cheese
anyway point is I've got one we compared
it to the HTC one we are very excited to
get one of them is going to hi May yeah
one of them is going to Taylor Martin
he's going to compare it against the
galaxy s4 and our review will be up next
week and guys I gotta tell you I mean
I'm looking forward to trading notes
with you on this because I I didn't like
this thing in New York I will say that I
was a covered the launch event
commenters many LG fans didn't like that
I covered the launch event because I
didn't really give the thing any slack I
mean it feels like a galaxy s3 in the
hand and I don't really like that but
you get it away from the tethers in the
showroom you spend some time that you
move into it and does the thing have
flaws yes it has many but it also has a
lot of advantages and I'd like it I mean
this is a little spoilery
I have no idea how I'm going to feel
about it once I actually sit down to
write the review but I am very surprised
at how well I'm enjoying my time with
the what well you like the optimus G oh
you were actually surprised about that
phone i remember when i was editing your
review and you were like i like this
phone you know LG is as has taken you
know they had there not only doing a lot
of wow with their UI and everything but
they actually got it right it's it's not
laggy it's not exactly yeah it looks
elegant it babe gianna huh well so the
optimist the reason the reason that I
didn't do the g2 so much the reason I
gave it such bunk in here in New York
City was because because of the optimus
G the optimus G was beautiful it was
glass yes was fragile but it was glass
and fake metal which actually felt good
if it was just a gorgeous little device
and the g2 is it is a rebadged to
samsung galaxy s4 except with different
detailing a much thinner bezel yes and
then the keys and some of that but I'm
talking about the material it's a
plastic big phone and it no one says
that no one has asked me about it I use
this as a bit of a barometer because
every one of my friends knows what I do
so when I go to hang out with them they
always know I'm carrying a new phone i
SAT with my phone nerd friend at a bar
the other day and I I put the thing on
the counter in front of me and it SAT
there for like 20 minutes before and I
had to point it out to him that's how
you know how much this device doesn't
stand out hey new phone here yeah come
on crazy right look at me come on
whereas with the optimus G you know that
was not the case i mean the optimus G
was understated too but I guess the
point is I'm disappointed LG retreated
from a boulder track to make it conform
to make the newer phone conform more
with the landscape but we've all heard
that before it's you know wait for the
full review for my full thoughts on that
but that does directly impact how
excited we are about the nexus 5 how
excited are we about the nexus 5 which
may have been spotted at the FCC
I've been saying I'm talking out daily
for like three days straight if that
thing is gonna have all the specs that
are at the FCC oh man and and they keep
the price tag this is gonna oh this is
gonna make you know this is going to
make like the Nexus brand go ballistic
this reminds me of what the HTC which
was the nexus one was you know back then
the nexus one was the first one
gigahertz processor it was a lot of
firsts in the case of that phone and it
was set it sadly hasn't been the same
case with every other phone that's been
launched and so yeah this is not gonna
be a first row but at least it's not
gonna be a punching bag dealers tell us
about the specs what are the specs smell
it Snapdragon 800 you know two gigs ram
um the camera is up as apparently
optical image stabilization which you
know if it's the same module is in the
g2 that would make sense apparently this
is a d2 that's just rude bad rebranded
in every way whereas the you know in the
case of the nexus 4 not everything was
right in the nexus 4 was I mean you we
won't go back to talking about the nexus
4 but it was a underwhelming not only on
the spec sheet but also in performance
in a lot of different ways I remember
how much people just went crazy over the
fact that it didn't have LTE and this
one has doesn't have just LTE that this
gsm unit has all the bands does it yes
this is this FCC device yeah yeah and it
also looks to have a matte back cover am
I looking at that yeah yeah yeah listen
this is like looking at a nexus 7
smaller mmm-hmm do you guys you won't
remember this time a bit Adam Dowd did
were you ever on sprint I've never been
on sprint hmm I've been on 18t longer
than God alright Justin maybe like one
or two of our listeners will remember
sprint had a friend header device at
flip phone only one or two of ours
that's exactly right sprint had a device
called the SP HM 610 from Samsung it was
a flip phone back in the how do you
remember those names I used to I used to
work for him so you know and I but I was
a big samsung fan in anyways a flip
phone but the point is it looked like
when it was closed it was the thinnest
flip phone in America it might still be
one of the thinnest ever produced me
stupid ridiculously then and i loved it
i never owned it i loved it but it had
the soft touch
black finish on it and the phone had
gently rounded curves when it was closed
but it was high end so it wasn't rounded
in the way that like I've stupid like a
jitterbug is or something but man it was
beautiful and that's what this thing
reminds me of the new the nexus 5 FCC
photos so if you have a chance listeners
check out the link the FCC has taken the
photos down I believe they were bundled
Enda like the verizon GG release right
yeah so so the problem is that the
paperwork was mixed with in the same the
same area the same portion of the
website so that both files were at the
same area but it was actually two
different units okay it was it was
another two to two different phones um
and you know I I feel that this this
could be like this could finally be like
the big break for the Nexus brand it's
not like a it's not like if they're
actually looking forward to it Google's
never been the company to to you know
they don't care about that but this is
sundar Pichai as Android now truly we we
are no longer in at Andy Rubens
territory so you know there's the guy
that brought us the Chromebook pixel
he's crazy he got is a $35 got is a $35
chromecast so if in a thirteen hundred
dollar netbook if she had any doubt that
i had any single sort of admiration for
Sindar after I paid those 35 bucks for
the chromecast buddy you are my friend
yeah I have a lot of admiration for you
those that requires guts and and if he
can give us a Snapdragon 800 LG Nexus 5
oh that calls guts and that is gonna go
be men listen the prices on smartphones
have not dropped in a long time
technology has become cheaper technology
has become more accessible and if this
guy challenges the market with a very
affordable flagship phone this is gonna
make everybody's price drop if they can
figure out a way to market it well think
I'd know exactly what i have on the
podcast when this thing drops you
excited hi may I like I am I am I miss
about excited about sorry I'm sorry I
was just I fell in love with the nexus
one and I've hated that every other
Nexus has not been as great as the next
is why I liked long xss I think the
nexus s got too much hate
love the design of that thing put a
curved screen on anything I'm gonna like
it I'd giggle like a schoolgirl if this
came out as the google nexus 5 and what
why don't you guys think why is like
yogurt I don't it's it's an old
expression I felt like a 70 year old
when I used it earlier today on Twitter
and I still feel let's let's move on
because we got to keep the to keep the
pace up and we want to talk about
another big phone before we leave
android i want to say we skipped a topic
listen HTC is probably gonna release a
gold one oh yay okay let's move on yes
does it come with a big fat bike ride by
the way Brandon was all we in our
conversation yesterday was like men i'm
getting that golden iphone and I'm like
once you go outside once you go outside
and you notice that every single girl at
the mall has the golden iphone you're
gonna want to return that thing yeah
that's definitely or i mean are you
gonna take your walker and walk up to
the counter with it and say give me a
gourd iphone i want one of the new hot
ish I don't know man I've said it before
but if we already talked about my time
at sprint but before then I worked for
nextel before we get acquired and in
2004 the bronze edition motorola I 830
was released and was released in silver
later but it came out Browns first and I
was like man there's just no way I love
this little tiny thing but there's no
way I'm buying it at Braun you remember
that you remember that Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana
v3 yes oh my friend had one of those for
like years I would always see him at a
bar oh my god there's there's Mike G
razor wells its heat yeah i hear be
appreciated of the finer things I'm not
actually made of gold no thank you yeah
even then it's gross anyway let's let's
move on all right another big phone in
the Windows Phone camp finally Adam jab
gets to sink his teeth into something
Brandon minimun speaking of him never
mind Adam that was a different Segway
Brandon minimun asked me on the phone
earlier what do you think about that
Nokia Lumia 1520 and I said well I think
it's probably going to come out
September 26 that a nokia event in new
york city but personally what do I think
about it I have no idea what to think
about it at a microsoft event you mean
when we're gonna talk about that sorry
dad it's an arena that is still in it in
the future that is still that has not
happened yet we still have nokia in its
traditional configuration they don't
even have a CEO anymore come on they do
two of it they have an interim CEO yeah
but IBM that he's in charge of the other
departments he's not in charge of all
right all right all right okay anyway no
humanity nice x go Lumia 1520 has
exciting things about it it looks to be
windows phones first true phablet with a
six inch screen at least right or maybe
he's at six on the mark not so not as
exciting as as a resolution though in
six-inch but 1080p which would be a
first for Windows Phone and that would
require the gdr3 update because the
current iteration of witness one does
not support 1080p souls that's exciting
being able to fit more live tiles in the
same space is exciting because I am so
tired of scrolling down to the second
half of my home screen to see all my
tiles even when they're all small and a
giant battery also exciting less
exciting I don't know what the hell to
make of Windows Phone on a six inch
screen Adam yelp event of an evil upon
any phone with any phone no I know what
to do with it in other platforms but not
only listen I don't know what to do Adam
what yes your thoughts I need an opinion
well I'm at it I'm at sea I wrote while
you were while you were across the pond
I wrote at an article called and
actually the day that microsoft
announced their nokia deal at like three
o'clock in the morning on Tuesday last
week they were so proud of her man
that's seven o'clock that next morning I
post an article that said if Nokia wants
to make a phablet go ahead but I'm not
interested and I'm just like do I need
to change the headline now because it
was just like one of those things it was
like scheduled to go out it was it was
in the hole that's right yes anyway so
um I will reiterate if they want to make
a phablet go ahead I'm not particularly
interested I don't need that third
column of of live tiles I am kind of
like the anti Michael I guess in that
particular
Camp I just I just think it's I I
honestly think it's gonna make Windows
Phone too busy so I think it's going to
be too many too much information trying
to update all at the same time and I
just I'm not into it I just I did and
1080p is awesome don't get me wrong um
but just the you know the extra the
extra tiles and the extra rows I think
it's just going to make the screen too
busy i'm not going to be able to reach
the tiles in the left-hand column with
my thumb so that's gonna be annoying
it's gonna almost require two-handed use
so I'm just I'm homies not playing that
so hey what do you think of me is that's
a good move for a Windows Phone a bad
one can you please get Taylor Martin on
the phone and just ask him what he
thinks about six inch phone I mean
seriously I for example in the case of
Windows Phone it's not like in the case
of Android for example where look
probably one of the things that I loved
about the Xperia ZL is how they fit the
5-inch display in that chassis but the
reason why I was possible was because
these were soft keys you know these are
software buttons not hardware button so
imagine windows phone with its mandatory
three buttons at the bottom plus a six
inch display plus the chassis how big is
that thing gonna be it's gonna be a
monster I mean it's gonna be a big old
it's gonna be a monster and I'm like
what is the value behind the phone that
big well we are getting word that from
this source then this is via wpcentral
by the way that the 1520 is really thin
but it has some weight to it so no
surprise to have a weighty device coming
up and but in a gigantic battery right
and well that is true we have to talk
about that because one of the things
that going big allows you to do is to
throw a huge battery in there i love
stevens headlines nokia lumia 1520
tipped to have a big old battery and
yeah we're looking at three 3,400
milliamp hours according to the room
rumor and that's that's massive dudes I
mean that's bigger than the note that's
no energy to hear and in the case of
Windows Phone I mean when those phone
has been using like the smallest
batteries in the market they just don't
need a big battery that's true so that
is a pretty compelling now we have to
factor in the 1080p display of course
right it was most likely a quad-core
processor this is a way this was rumored
it what is it Snapdragon 800 as well
yeah yeah yeah so and that's exciting to
me because by the way my first
experience with the Snapdragon 800 has
been this g2 and this thing sips battery
life it does not gulp it down nice so
that's nice so okay you know it in on
the one hand nokia has to or windows
phone has to compete at the phablet size
category if they ignore that sector you
know that's stupid they shouldn't get it
right yeah and as my article pointed out
that's why i said go ahead and make it
there's a market for it people want big
screens people want you know Lana towels
because you have titles you know if you
can fit more on the screen then you can
no more without having to do it fulfills
the glanceable info promise that Windows
Phone was built to fulfill right I mean
not me but sure yes somebody wanted yes
so I think they should play here I just
wit I just hope I think my hope is the
same as it is for the HTC One max I hope
they find a way to make the most
intelligent use of that added space not
just throw a big screen on there because
they can you know like you see in
another Android then they're not samsung
I mean come on oh man Samsung's the
exact wrong example because they're the
ones who leverage know are you talking
with the Meg talking about the galaxy oh
yeah let's let's forget the galaxy mega
because I just had the weirdest image in
my head right now of three columns of
tiles and when I talk about three
columns I'm talking about the three
midsize you know tiles I'm not talking
about the tiny toilet I'll cut obviously
though you get like what six of those
but when I'm fixturing three columns and
like a like a slot machine like
each one independently moving of the
other ones so that if you have your
weather and in like the right column you
can move just that one up and you can
still see your email on the left-hand
side yes I versatility is good write
what you know whatever enhancements gdr3
brings to the table will be nice you
know these guys figure out how to make
split screen on Windows Phone that would
be amazing but
well and and maybe there will because I
mean we see that in RT I never any those
windows it oh yes you have the snap
feature yes now that's what now that
would be smart oh snap and and we've
we've heard rumors of Windows RT merging
with Windows Phone 8 we have and they
and listen I mean I'm lawyer i remember
when i read the rumors and i was
building the script for the daily i was
like what took these guys so long I why
didn't why you know if they would have
simply figured out you know if they
would have simply made both operating
systems the same it would allow the you
know the those gigantic amounts of
applications on Windows Phone to work on
Windows RT would have saved the platform
hey I don't know every time we get close
to talking about our tea I just like
feel well why don't we I mean we've got
the notice serious to talk about as well
I mean come on wait did you so you
haven't been looking at your skype feet
I was about say I'm a has not must
feature either hi Mei is ignorant of my
last message or he is just trollin good
yeah there's no kids apparently making a
tablet and that's exciting anyway
speaking of Nokia even ah yeah well it
was since you mention it we should note
that we have a lot to talk about with
regard to nokia tablet do you guys think
that that will be released on the 26th
or excuse me announced on the 26th or
are we still too far away from a
possible release for that very brief
walk come on microsoft launches things
you know they announced things today and
launch them a year from now why not well
cause it's still not Microsoft you know
I think what why not let's get to ya I
don't know you listeners you can click
the link there we're i think that i need
at like a whole two hours before a
podcast to actually put my thoughts
together on what a Windows RT tablet
from Nokia soon to be Microsoft's
hardware division means because I don't
know what it means III know that Windows
RT is something i don't really ever want
to use yeah I know that if you know if
they take the best of Windows RT and the
best of Windows Phone and put them
together into something I think there is
real potential for something
hello there absolutely but I don't know
what complexities that would entail you
know just with that snap feature imagine
running you know games or specific
applications from the phone on your
tablet and having those work as well on
your phone and you know backwards I mean
that's really what they needed for RIT
to survive and Nokia can add their bevy
of applications from the phone to work
on the tablet that would make it really
compelling yeah i gay I just why and I
hate to be a sound like Taylor Martin
but I actually wrote an article about
about what what does know what wouldn't
a nokia tablet offer I just I I don't
see it i mean nokia what nokia really
brings the table right now is useful for
phones their maps their camera there
yeah you know they're here services and
whatnot i just i don't see any of those
being really all that useful on a tablet
so i don't know why they would bother
don't mention that you have surface down
so okay fine Adam I will stop defending
your platform let's move on thank you
would you please get back in your own
kin well we're going to go back into the
I have a feeling that we're going to get
back into the windows 8 vs windows RT
discussion very very shortly because we
have a rumored surface 2 event actually
I'm sorry it's not rumored it's
confirmed we're just not going to it but
we will be covering it remotely I don't
know if we'll do a live blog or whatever
but let's see Microsoft developing
Cortana as its new voice assistant this
is cool let's end up the windows phone
category jumping listener mail and then
we'll have a weekend to ourselves guys
doing can we call that thing chords or
anna not court an y or CH it is imagine
Cortana what's the weather like I don't
think you're gonna have to do that you
get you get the reference right how they
yeah I have no idea oh and halo yeah
come on okay we have to make it clear
let's lay the foundation for our
listeners here okay Microsoft Windows
Phone 8 has a lot going for it one of
those things is not its voice interface
if you ask me I think it is the worst
voice interface I've ever encountered
it's certainly the worst
transcription I've ever used right I I
hate it uh yeah yeah because I use
Google's services all the time and I
really love how they work is in terms of
voice interface with with you ever used
s voice oh my god I'm sorry you're right
yes please okay he's no O'Donnell
vindicated now you you okay I
reflexively retreated from my position
because I wanted to be nice to both you
and windows phone but no I'm gonna say
this on the air and I don't care if you
call me crazy s voice is still better
than windows phones voice interface
you're crazy I know I know but it's true
yes and I hate as far as I think as boys
then listen we're not going to talk
about s voice well we're saying is that
you can disagree in the comments if you
like listeners guys we can fight about
this in the playground after school but
it's horrible as it is right now so the
fact that Microsoft is building a better
voice interface excites me to no end the
fact that they were smart enough to code
name it after one of their own
properties and Cortana if you didn't if
you never played halo Cortana is the
computer voice inside your head right
and so the the it's the ship it's the
lady she's attractive guys help me yeah
okay i'm not a gamer so you lost me
either my halo is like the only game i
play just wish I mean that we don't have
to call anything like Cortana what's the
winner I want to do that I think that
would be exciting maybe like can I call
you Anna right but you know what
probably there's going to be a new way
to to address it there seem to be some
rules we had a bevy of leaked
screenshots emerged this was from
phoneArena it looks like oh excuse me
this was via phone Arena source original
source is eating it and the verge
screenshots indicating polling intervals
with particular contexts particular
contacts you can call weather-alerts
calendar night they sank all this kind
of stuff that seems to point directly to
a more robust voice interface which is
only codenamed Cortana I'm sure that
won't make it to production which makes
me sad but I just wanted to throw it in
here and say I'm very excited about it
it's one of Windows Phones pain points
for me I know Adam Lane would also
disagree by the way Adam you you have
somebody else in your camp
yeah Adam loves it you know he actually
go ahead I call it baby Siri so man now
don't get me wrong i have sent text
messages to people deliberately like
really wrong text messages just because
they were so funny with what they came i
would transcribe something saying you
know i'll be there in 20 minutes and you
know it'll come back with i'll grow hair
for 5 i'll send that text message saying
sorry i had to send you know what and
listen google has those moments syria
has those moments as for they all have
their bad days but with Windows Phone
that the functionality is so limited
like would the fact that you can't
pronounce punctuation that you know they
just there's a whole lot you can't do it
and it's really annoying although the
one thing that really impressed me I
just a little anecdote here when Rich
Dunbar he's a nokia developer ambassador
he came to Chicago wants to put on a
workshop for us and you know we were
communicating by a text at one point and
so he sent me a text back sat NP and
baby Siri actually read it aloud as no
problem and I'm like that's so impressed
see that's nice no mean what it mean
went okay i have my LG g2 set to set to
tell me who's calling bye-bye voice and
so the phone rang it was Brandon before
she's like new phone call from Brandon
minimun 610 million 348,000 I'm like
wait what are you doing and I realized
she was reading the phone number as an
integer you've got to be kidding me how
does that get passed the final quality
checks anyway that's us so voice voice
interface still has a long way to go
guys let's let's close up our main part
of the podcast and move on to listener
mail bambang very nice very nice indeed
that is add this is the first piece of
listener males going to come from Martin
florin and since I have done the
speaking for a little while why doesn't
our own Adam Dowd read this one allowed
oh I should have been logged into the
email no you shouldn't it's in the
rundown it's not the bottom of the
rundown oh it is okay living in
and okay pedal up ahead of a flow of
Windows Phone hi guys or actually take
guys sorry Martin hey guys I think that
the new iphone 5c is just an opportunity
for Apple to sell a low-quality iphone 5
with lower production costs and get
higher margins that's okay for me
because I'm not buying one alrighty then
but what I cannot understand is why
nobody is talking about the bad design
of the cases the non cutout is laughable
what is your opinion on this greetings
Martin cos nth MIT meinem Nexus 7 oh
that's my nexus 7 said with nexus 7 yes
indeed march from the compass in the
country i just returned from so yes
Martinez referring to the case that goes
around the iphone 5c that makes it look
like a crock a shoe you with it with the
holes that let the the bottom is the
phone casing color shine through the
case color yeah just for some context
for our listeners if you haven't watched
the live hangout of the of the apple
event they've dear the end Taylor Martin
it's it's gold yeah that's brilliant
it's ok so a lot of people have been
talking about this and I think Apple
achieved something interesting not that
they needed more buzz but I think it's
always cool when a company makes a bold
choice that not everyone is going to
like clearly I tend to like it because I
like do dual tone colors but I can
understand where people are coming from
where it looks like oh yeah the iphone c
is 5 c is for iphone 5 cheese grater you
know it's like i get i get that it kind
of looks like it's wearing a polka dot
dress or it looks like a water filter or
you know whatever so I don't know guys
what do you think about the aesthetics
of the casing design you know I'm
surprised that I'm surprised that um
have you noticed that the holes don't
cover part of the iphone name at the
back yeah so it's like I pump on I look
at that and I'm like how did this cross
quality control yeah cuz Steve Jobs
isn't around anymore I am serious I just
looked at that and I'm like man what
would have Steve said he would have been
like you would have had a hair
all psyched to march around in his grave
right now maybe just maybe I may be
there the that could have been a big old
bubble there I i guess i guess i would
have liked the whole concept of the
cases that they would have brought more
patterns than just little dots you know
more than just a croc phone um yeah but
but but but but but the circles play
nicely with the new ios7 interface
elements with the circular buttons the
circular signal strength the done yeah
true fine I guess you know it would have
been cool of like the blue case would
have been you know squares and you know
the other one would have been triangles
and I don't know it was not so heinous
like a like a mall kiosk you know go get
it you know I guess I guess I've never
been a case guy um and so I don't know I
i don't really like it it's like for
example i've seen other cases like for
the galaxy for the galaxy s4 for example
where you know the whole text samsung
galaxy s4 is well printed on the back
and so even even the iphone 5s case um
has apple and everything well printed on
the back side just I don't know it looks
kind of cheesy that I'd love to you know
actually hold it before I get an opinion
about it i just i don't like that iphone
text being cover that I'll tell you that
yeah yeah that's that's pretty ugly and
and I think we've already kind of
discussed the whole low-quality iphone 5
thing earlier in the podcast so yeah
over it a little bit yeah but yeah the
case is pretty any I guess it's okay but
it's it's predicted the one thing I will
find i will take issue with Martin's
characterization of the current state of
the dialogue though because I cannot
understand why nobody is talking about
the bad design of the cases Martin you
look hard enough plenty of people are
talking about those cases that I am so
tired of my twitter feed being loaded up
with people making fun of this thing i
think you know i think it could have
looked better I don't think it looks as
bad as people are making it out to be I
think people are looking for things to
hate about the 5c and are finding it in
a bold design that you know not everyone
has to like us and you know what there
is a thing there's a good point being
made that those exposed parts of the
iphone casing it stand a very good
chance of staining or fading or doing
whatever
as a result of dirt or exposure to
whatever so it will be interesting to
see in about two years how many iphone 5
c's look like they have a polka dot
pattern screen printed on them and then
once you take the case off then it won't
say Oh it'll say I I knee oh by the way
I'm you know that is a very good point
Michael um for those of you that owned
the iphone 3gs i guess the reason why i
became such a case hater was because
whenever you would put a case on that
phone the lint around the case would
become start so that would become stuck
to the to the glossy plastic member then
yeah okay so so i would definitely not
use that iphone 5c with the case well
you know it which would be great and
normally I would agree with you because
I'm not a case guy either but in this
case the case if you get it in a
different color it enhances the appeal
of the phone or a tech center just makes
the phone more your own without the
whole idea i guess so i guess that the
point being is sadly I don't know that
polycarbonate is got hey even my HTC One
X has you know I actually got a case for
it because I lend it to uh to a friend
of mine for a couple of days and I just
you know I give it gave him the phone
with the case and that you know when he
when he gave it back to me the phone
look intact but the whole back has all
these marks from the lint and I can't
clean it off hmm alright cannot wipe it
off of course the 1x the 1x is matt
polycarbonate this is glossy so well
after i have the same problem with the
3gs you know that's right yes so I don't
see ya we'll see and it's gonna be
interesting I mean according to applets
and it has this special coating so let's
just see why don't we stick with case
discussion and I mean why don't you read
the short one hear from our friend Jace
crowson ok so hey pocket now I have a
question regarding the iphone 5s cases
how do you think the big cases like
lifeproof and otterbox are going to make
their cases cover the front of the phone
and still have the touch ID work really
curious to how they would do this Thanks
oh you know Jace thank you for asking
the same question I've been asking
myself really cool
that is yeah okay so bye Jace by the way
I am and I am a lifeproof fre user and
the reason why is because i used the
iphone for running and I sweat like a
pig um so it is really easy for me to
soak the phone and that's the reason why
I use that special case and yes I've
been asking myself the same question um
the the thing is you don't really to my
knowledge touch ID is something that you
can turn off um and to my understanding
what you'll most likely have to do
because there's just no way to insulate
that special portion of the of the
button because the button on itself is
definitely non-permeable meaning you you
can definitely get the phone the phone's
internals wet through the button so you
know now the good thing about the
lifeproof phrase that it's got this like
little box um this like little plastic
that actually does the home button
pressing so most likely you will just
have to disable touch ID while you use
the case and if you use it permanently
because that's the we like to protect
your phone then you'll most likely have
to compromise and not use touch ID it
sounds like the most likely explanation
at me as well yeah absolutely because i
was gonna say the current boxes they
just have the button that kind of hovers
over and you push that button to push
the other but exactly yeah one thing now
one thing is for example um the touch
ideas as a capacitive sensor so if if
lifeproof would make that casing
transparent because it actually sort of
like takes a photo of your fingerprint
um and you know I just I don't know how
the chrome ring would detect the heat
but then again you know the plastic over
is able to detect your finger as you
touch the display so it would be really
interesting if the engineers would
figure out a way to make that whole
casing transparent and give it a try
most likely they will and bring just
another version of life proof for the 5s
and have touch ID work that way but most
likely your current case will you'll
have to compromise and just switch it
off the good thing is your current case
is still usable with the 5s yes you know
what case will you have to put on to
make it work with gloves I'm sorry I'm
sorry I'm just trolled searles got a
troll all right
item I was like 500 milliseconds late on
my laughs on that and it's because I'm
sitting here I'm all bummed out you guys
are talking with these cool things like
fingerprint scanners my 5c is not going
to have them I'm really really bummed
out about that I wish that was on the 5c
as well where the 5c you know I like
colors colors all right let's move on
the neutral head goes you don't like
gold come on no this is my problem
that's uh thanks for the a for the email
there Russell let's move on to
Christopher sorry let's thank for the
email there Jase let's move on to
Russell's email guys I want to know your
thoughts on how Apple is going to manage
the changes to iOS 7 for the general
consumer I don't think general consumer
knows what's coming and I'm not sure how
they're going to react are people going
to see this update for their device come
through and install it and just be hit
with all the changes or will Apple
rollout iOS 7 is coming info emails
ahead of time to help ease and ready
them Christopher this is a cool question
yeah Russell Fletcher sorry yeah she
always Apple always does this they
always send an email the same day that
the update comes and they'll give you
links to go learn more about the
operating system um they always do that
they even do it they even do that for us
developers um because i have a developer
account um and in the case I know I know
I I guess you know probably the cool
thing about iOS four you know the
general user the general consumer is
that well it's just aesthetically
different but overall you know if you
don't know that control centers there
you won't really miss it because you can
still go to settings and just switch
everything on and off what's so funny my
mother and father I think both of them
still don't know that notification
center is up there every time I come
home to visit I'm like hey swipe down
from the top like oh what's all this
like actually nevermind so yeah you're
right there's a lot of features that
just kind of read under the level yet
Ernest show me that on your Lumia 1020
your moms say
oh no M dick burn let's go I'm gonna fly
to Honduras just like it's slang ok I
think we got I've got friends at the
airport trust me they could time oh dear
God alright so before we get into that
thank you that was there was a good
question Russell thank you and let's
finish out with Adam doubt reading
Christopher drummers mail about windows
phone when Windows Phone was first
announced many were put off by the
limitations OMS were restricted to
Microsoft obviously did this to ensure a
consistent experience across devices
which enlarge has worked but now we see
OEMs okay nokia have more freedom with
the UI lumia devices are now able to
change the default camera app or the to
nokia smart camera pro cam do you think
we will see more customization of
Windows Phone say HTC blinkfeed at start
or isn't or as an interactive lock
screen or Samsung's bevy of random
features thanks for taking my mail and I
love what you all are doing Christopher
drummers sent from windows mail yeah and
I will say this Christopher thank you
for the email and before Adam you lend
your response I will say this is already
happening Christopher if you check out
our review of the HTC 8xt face print
pressing the camera button optionally
can launch you into HTC's custom camera
app Samsung has the same thing they have
written their own camera app for the for
windows phone on the TV s neo also for
sprint and they have also started
bundling in some lower level stuff like
a tea beam which is a port of their
galaxy beam feature under Windows Phone
so yeah I think we are seeing the the
reins kind of relax around windows phone
as time goes on yeah and on my on my
lumia when I'm when I'm going back to
geocaching again because that's my
second second self whenever I'm
navigating to a cash it'll ask me do I
want to navigate with here maps or with
google maps so and it asked me every
time I wish there was a way I could set
it as a default he closed his integrity
of the choice yeah it's take your
exercise three man just take your Galaxy
s3 that's the way I couldn't add I could
I could talk for hours about the
geocaching experience in the s3 but
anyway
but it's it's fantastic i'll just put it
that way but um yeah so I mean there is
it there's definitely already some
customizations going there i'd like to
see a little bit more i'd like to see
them borrow a page from androids book
where you can actually set those default
you know ask every time or you know make
it permanent that type of thing but I
mean for now just the fact that we can
do that is is much better because I mean
on on the Lumia 900 you you're stuck
with I think it's the the Bing Maps
stuff yes right yeah yeah we've seen
flexibility and be injected into the
system and I think that's nice because I
think one of the things we've learned
from Android is that yes it's possible
to overdo it with manufacturer
customizations and skins but it's also
still able to go micro managing sure but
it's also possible to go the other way
it's also possible to be like well you
can't do any customization the only
customization dues and hardware so eat
it you know in the facts and you know
going back to the point that Christopher
makes at the beginning when he's like
when Windows Phone was first announced I
remember that event like it was
yesterday I hated it and many were many
were put off by the limitations OEMs
were restricted to and you know
Microsoft made a compelling point they
were like okay so we are going to be the
anti I Android the anti iphone but we're
going to be our own thing that's the mix
of the two because we're gonna control
the software so therefore you won't have
to wait for software updates and then we
have mr. Dowd who's still waiting for
Aurora and so I guess that yeah it makes
sense at the beginning uh I'm just sad
that it never really worked them I'm sad
that it never really it made it makes so
much sense at the beginning for
Microsoft to be like I we want to
control the software for everybody to
get timely updates and they never pulled
it off right um you know it's just sad
so yeah it would it's great to see that
OEMs are finally being like you know
what Microsoft you never figured that
out with the carrier so we're just gonna
do our own thing I just wish they would
do you know more than just the camera
button and you know what things like I
will say this man even with those
limited changes boy deity vests and the
8xt were easily both my least favorite
windows phones to review ever
because of the performance hit that
Windows Phone took now I'm not saying
that it's definitively as a result of
these software modifications it may very
well be a nun optimized Snapdragon 400
problem it may be something else but if
it is because of the allowing these
manufacturers to make those
modifications it's a really bad step
because Windows Phones one of its key
differentiators sorry to use the
overused term has been that it is really
responsive no matter what hardware it's
running on and that just wasn't the case
for either of those phones so i don't
know if it was sprint i don't know if it
was manufacturers i don't know if it was
i I think it is because i mean III
edited the review for the Lumia 521 that
a hundred-dollar you nokia from from
from the Home Shopping Network yes and
you know I looked at open all the raw
footage that Adam sent me and you know
the phone looked like a breeze through
everything and there was no
customization here aside from the Nokia
ones that we already know about you know
at least some of some of them and some
of the things were actually watered down
for that specific phone but the phone
worked well I mean for a hundred dollars
I was like man this is cheaper than a go
phone yeah in some cases you know it's
true and there's a lot more to explore
in that in that area and I'm really
looking forward to the next windows
phone update just in terms of broadening
the platform's abilities and taking
advantage of some of this new hardware
we're seeing so i also want to thank
Christopher Russell Jase and Martin and
everyone else who wrote in this week
last week and the week before we're
