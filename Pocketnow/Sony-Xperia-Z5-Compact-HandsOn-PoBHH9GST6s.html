better believe Sony's got a compact
version i'm michael fisher with pocket
now at Aoife 2015 with a quick look at a
phone built for one-handed use the Sony
Xperia z5 compact Sony calls this phone
your perfect sidekick and based on size
alone it's easy to understand why the
compact line is built specifically to
cater to appreciators of the petite most
hands will be able to reach every corner
of the 4.6 inch display the spec sheet
includes everything from IP 65 68 water
and dust proofing to the newly
redesigned 23 megapixel camera there are
a few more sacrifices here than in
previous generation compact so though
while a snapdragon 810 processor powers
the phone the same is on the bigger at Z
5 the compact step sit down on the RAM
side with 2 gigs instead of 3 and the
battery takes a slight hit as well
stepping down to 2700 milliamp hours
from 2900 the display is also lower res
at 720p versus 1080p but given the
half-inch size reduction that's not
really a problem it's not really the
spec reductions that bug me about the z5
compact these are still excellent
figures for such a small smartphone but
Sony has also changed up the industrial
design here and not all the changes are
improvements over its predecessor the z3
compact shown here in green the new
frosted finish backside is in some ways
a step up from the glossy panels of your
but the sides are now almost completely
unadorned that means there's nothing to
distract from how thick this phone is
which is a shame because this thing's
got some girth while the addition of a
fingerprint sensor is welcome
the newly repositioned volume key is now
way too low for comfort and the
two-stage camera button is mushy er than
previous generations granted this is
pre-release hardware but Sony's Aoife
samples tend to get pretty close to
retail quality if you don't care about
any of that and just want a small phone
with a big feature set the z5 compact is
still worth your attention certainly
it's so nice skin sitting atop android
5.1 has finally gotten something of a
refresh to keep it current and
hardware now comes in four colors the
side hatches and styling have been
refined and the whole phone certainly
feels more contemporary based on prior
Sony performance it's likely the z5
compact will sit near the top of the
heap in mid-sized smartphones when we
review it this fall I'm just not sure
all of Sony's aesthetic changes qualify
as improvements there were two other
smartphones shown at the Sony booth this
Aoife one of them a premium one go check
them out in our other hands-on coverage
here on YouTube and follow the
up-to-the-minute news at pocketnow.com
till next time has been Michael Fisher
and Hayato huesemann from Aoife 2015 in
Berlin stick around for more and thanks
