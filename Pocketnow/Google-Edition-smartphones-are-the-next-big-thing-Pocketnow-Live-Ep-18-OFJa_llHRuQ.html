differently today just to shake things
up we have not yet publicized the link
to this hangout but we are broadcasting
so just a couple of logistics mentions
if you have a question on youtube or on
the pocket now boast please post it as
usual with all caps I will try to read
as many questions as i can and my
colleagues as well as I will try to do
our best to answer and with this I'm
going to publicize the link right now on
google+ and it's out as well as on
facebook and it's out and as well as on
twitter and it's out and people should
start joining there's the topic for
today is google edition phones quick
Advani one minute one minute conclusions
or ideas Jaime what do you think of them
I think they're hot I think they're an
excellent idea that steak
years to happen and then finally is
happening I don't know I don't know it
took Google so long seriously Joe you
know this goes back to what we kind of
alluded to a long time ago wouldn't it
be nice if you could get a device and
choose the rom that you want it to run
on it and today we're realizing that so
called it okay let me do my due
diligence and mute everybody who is not
muted everybody please if we are not
talking to you please mute your
microphones and hopefully we can avoid
energy Thank You Vanessa and with that
I'm gonna I'm gonna turn a show flow
over to Jaime please well I do the
comment thing and everything hey joe
newman stop showing me your bed man you
have no idea how i wish i would be in
bed right now and i was going to talk to
joe newman but apparently he's is he
available or not I can see him in the
corner of the thumbnail but i'm not sure
if he can't see or hear us yeah his arms
right there man good name but that's
what that's what happens when you're
slow so let's talk to mr. sorry oh there
you are okay so exactly why are you not
facing the computer uh I was just doing
some of my other gear in here so I was
gonna ask you ask you is the toilet
there haha yes all right we're getting
some feedback here but anyway so let's
start off with you how are you worried
from are from the UK and I'm fine thank
you no I'm little is 999 okay so can I
ask you any good questions or you're
only interested in my phone I have an
android phone this is history anywhere
in there okay so the question today is
what do you think a family are charged
you like the lengthen you know I just
got it must have been that bin just just
one second second its buses all she
wants you to lower the volume on
computer because we have verbal feedback
here yeah yeah there we go hurry
still but someone better um I think new
edition smartphones are good ideas but I
think they should make more budget
edition budget efficient meaning you
want them to be there either yeah
essentially like a pen seven hurdles for
a phone that you're gonna have for about
two years and then switch to a new one
essentially probably two years time you
know I have to I have to agree with that
I honestly probably the only thing that
I don't having to pay so much money
money very seriously I don't know or
even you sell them as a contract now we
know why you have to come to tablet
collections um not potentially okay okay
anyways any questions from years of you
um I was just wondering what's the best
like Android wrong because I have the
sand you more 10.1 rs3 at the moment I
don't know it's just curious which one
we both knew Joe you're the expert there
by Roy yeah I am running the RC 3 on my
Nexus 4 so I am a big fan of that
paranoid is another really good one and
if you like pink unicorns aokp ok ok
cool any other questions no thank you ok
it's a pleasure to move you from the UK
you know you know the drill I'm now
joined but thank you fine oh man I had
this terrible echo Joe please if
anyone's in the toilet seriously it goes
our fun it's part of the technology is
part of the experience I haven't seen on
a prom on before so why don't you go
ahead and chime in tell us where you're
from and what you think about the google
edition phones and a kind of a follow of
the high my settle what about google
edition tablets yea or nay
yeah you guys can hear me yes all right
back so talking about Google edition
phones to me they're just a stupid idea
because I'm Nexus 4 is not the greatest
phone ever or not the worst phone ever
and its price just perfectly for a
developer or just a regular consumer but
outright six hundred dollars to seven
hundred dollars just for a vanilla
Android to me is just crazy yeah that's
what I have to say about that and about
tablets same deal they're gonna be out
right among you sleep over price and
then they're just gonna flop after a
while after when the google actually
announces their new nexus products
because this is just a gimmick for the
OEM and Google just to sell more product
and get more Android out to the markets
to compete with apple and maybe even
windows phone so I said about that ok so
my my comments on that I'm comparing
prices we're looking right now at the
only to google edition phones Nexus
aside as being the two top of the line
phones the pricing that we're that we've
seen you know it's they're not in the
play store yet but the the pricing
that's announced has been essentially
the price of the devices if you were to
get them off contract so they are
unsubsidized and they're going for not
necessarily the cost of the device but
cost plus a reasonable markup because
you know people have to have profit to
make things worth building I guess so
good way to put it maybe if you think
about in Joe I mean in the United States
we don't like the idea but in Europe
that's you know that's what people do
they pay for phones yes yes sir exactly
part of the disconnect I believe is the
nexus devices Google is putting out
there not necessarily subsidizing them
but they are selling them very close to
their own cost so you're looking at a
nexus for running for three hundred
fifty dollars u.s. versus an HTC One
running for six hundred dollars so yeah
there's there's a relatively large
difference there but I believe that's
because HTC is still taking their
profits so that they can stay in
business my 2 bits but when one is the
google edition samsung galaxy s4 and
then add vanilla Android but doesn't it
still have all like the features of the
s4 like the barometer the thermometer
sounds over there yeah sounds good by
their own OS can't handle hey I think
Joey do you think I don't think so I
haven't seen anything official from
either side on that but to the best of
my knowledge all of the advanced Samsung
utilities smart stay and whatnot those
are all a function of the launcher and
even a bit more than that it goes deeper
into the version of Android that they've
put together those are not and I I'll
eat Tony's hat if I have to I don't
believe those are going to be included
in the vanilla addition the google
edition because they're not part of
android they're part of what Samsung
built on top of Android so although this
the sensors are still there developers
can still develop to them through a pis
and whatnot I know when you're not going
to have any of the advanced features
that come with a samsung edition of the
the galaxy s4 that may be a big deal if
you're a fan of those things or it might
not if if you're not a fan and to some
people that's just overhead and bloat
and looking at what samsung said
recently about how their phones are the
memory the storage on their phones is
being eaten up half of it by their own
roms and their own stuff yeah it's not
worth it to me to have all that space
eaten up by stuff that I may not use
yeah because Joe Joe in and out of thumb
if you don't mind me interrupting you be
the first person is fine
I mean I think he's flushing the toilet
somebody was somebody was okay so you're
the first person that we hear that
saying that you don't like the Google
edition idea so tell us something what
phone do you have I have the s2 and i'm
planning to get the nexus 4 okay their
water all she looks away the next book
nexus products gonna be okay so if
Google let's just assume let's switch
the idea here what if google would
charge you a hundred dollars to make
your galaxy s2 an official google
edition smartphone would you pay for
that instead I pay Google a hundred
dollars to make my phone and google
edition yeah officially meaning your
phone is going to get all the updates
immediately and everything you know when
you would you be willing instead of
buying a six-hundred-dollar phone would
you be willing to pay a hundred dollars
or fifty dollars or something would you
be paid willing to pay for an official
rom for your phone what that I will
because healthy be more reasonable yeah
because uh I would because it's all
about the debate about how much
something usually costs like you're not
going to go for something you're on a
tight budget you're not going to go for
something that what you like and it's
like 600-700 and if I had a phone that I
can give to google for like a hundred
fifty bucks just to turn to official
google product i totally would but why
would you do that when you have
cyanogenmod that's true you to side of
jamaat but some of the I don't a
scientist marra's pretty good to me but
I ha I put cyanogen mod online but he
keeps on crashing on my phone so don't
use the night please use playful verge
even our see it 3a gonna have it still
crashes on me I put the IRC for
point-to-point to Virgil on my android
on my phone it still crashes for some
odd reason ok back to you Joe I you know
I love hearing the other side of the
debate by now I think everyone knows my
thoughts on it so thank you on a pond
for for sharing that with us if you have
any any way you want us to contact you
or people can talk to you and debate
your side of things or you on twitter or
google+ yeah i'm on twitter is right on
his name a DNA th 10 and the camera is
now locked on you and facebook and
google+ with my name right there well
fabulous thank you for coming on the
show and for sharing your thoughts and
opinions with us I if you want to go
ahead and follow along go ahead and log
out of this and follow us over at
pocketnow.com where you can watch the
rest of the show online and that will
free up a spot for the next person and
who is going to be picking the next one
I will be the one picking but before
that i have a question specifically for
you Joe of course hi makin you can
always answer or complete Joe's answer
it's a question which it's it's
interesting for many many people and
it's also interesting to me so the
question goes like this what is the
difference between a google edition
smartphone and a nexus okay that line is
very very blurred or will become blurred
on the twenty sixth of June a Nexus
device particularly is contracted
between Google and some third-party
manufacturer thats HTC or LG or Samsung
to build a device to google
specifications to highlight and show off
everything that the OS can do it also
shows off the stock android user
interface and does so at a price point
that is relatively affordable you have
to do it as an unlocked version to be
able to get out to people so you don't
have to have a contract you don't have
to have even a cellular carrier to be
able to use one of these decide from
that Joe what makes a nexus a nexus is
it just the pure vanilla stock Android
experience or or is it something else
because of course yeah there are
contracts between Google and OEMs for
subsidizing and pushing the Nexus
devices at a lower price point but if we
take that apart and look at the consumer
and user experience perspective
is there a difference between say the
nexus 4 and the s4 Google edition yeah
so that gets to the second half of your
first question and and segues into it
really well from an end-user perspective
these Google Experience devices may as
well be a nexus they're going to have
the same user interface the same user
experience the same purchasing route
since they're both being made available
through the Play Store as a Nexus device
the differences are going to be
primarily one is price because we're not
going to have google offer it at or near
cost and the second and this is what
really really is exciting to me you're
not limited to Google's view of where
the hardware should go so the software
is going to be the unifying thing
between all of them but if you go for
for example the galaxy s4 Google edition
you've got a removable battery and
you've got an SD card slot that you can
pop in there which kind of breaks the
way that Google is trying to push the
hardware you're paying a premium for
that marklar you also get an IR blaster
as well I mean yes there are but you
will probably not be able to use true
but okay so you're getting LTE
connectivity that you don't get on the
nexus 2 so you're getting the arra
blaster you're getting the removal
batter you're getting expandable storage
so it's like if they're making these the
high-end Nexus devices meaning you can
buy the nexus 4 and that's like your
entry-level non-expandable pretty phone
but then they have and you notice the
tears you get the HTC One which
ironically in my opinion should be more
expensive than the s4 is actually
cheaper than the s4 you get the IR
blaster 32 gigs and you get you know
every you know the aluminum and
everything and then a better display and
then you get the s4 which gives you
expandable everything so you get a
choice you get three different products
that you could consider to be the
mid-tier and then the high-end boat
before the next question which will go
to high may a follow-up question
actually two questions quick yes or no
Joe and i'ma do you think that at this
moment we have three Nexus devices out
there and hope
we will have four by the end of October
uh from a consumer perspective I think
that's going to be the perception yes I
man from june twenty-fourth is gonna say
yeah that's the perception but more
devices will depend on what jun 24 says
okay and quickly next question goes to
hi mate do you think Apple would come
out with an with AE tablet having
calling functionality no yeah ok that
was a quick for sure i'm not gonna
happen they've could have done a large
ipod 10 years ago and they chose to look
for the intelligent way that you would
carry a music player ok thank you then
let us move on i have never spoken to mr
Davey Tassie hello hi where are you from
I am from New York you're from New York
one island do you have any specific
questions or just you want to talk about
Google edition yeah kind of would like
to talk about the goal addition because
I'm gonna think about getting it I'm
thinking about gangs of one for HTC One
so I am it is my understanding that you
do not have the HTC One at the moment I
have 2s for actually at the moon oh then
this is an interesting question why
don't you ps4 google edition everything
about the s4 i would say like just touch
with that's the only problem just touch
with google edition google edition
styling google edition with samsung yes
it has the place the 650 price point but
then like you see the HTC one with 500 i
mean i could sell this on ebay I'll go
get it for like 650 and use that to get
the east to see one okay a little bit of
devil's advocate but with the HTC One
you will not get the removable battery
and you will not get the expansion slot
for micro SD this is that that's not
that's not why yeah that's not why I
brought this for is because the reason
why i did not get HTC One when when I
didn't even know about the audition
was I didn't like census five I really
did not like that's fine it just looked
too I don't know just look too weird and
lengthy was a waste of a home screen and
then the animation from like going to
the app drawer like you just three or
four when I could just see oh no i like
i like how I have my nova launcher it
looks like stock android on it cuz i
just go home but I mean I like the
physical home button but I'm gonna like
the build quality I'm not a big fan of
five inch I like the 4.7 inch I'm gonna
give you props David I mean seriously to
pay for a galaxy s4 and to and to add
another launcher to it says a lot of
that I'm sorry but I must go go ahead
I'm sorry no I could not stand touch you
is from the moment I thought I also like
earlier this year I had the tab 7 points
and song yeah and I won that a bingo
night and I'm just like oh do you know
TouchWiz before playing 4.1 for the
first time okay let me try it I did not
like it after probably like five minutes
because it was so laggy in touch with
she's just you know leave it I I by no
means I want to tell you what to buy or
to imply or two I don't know to him no I
just have a question it will probably
you that you're hearing this from
somebody who is using both the s4 and
the one as n fibers you will give up it
will give up a good good camera for a
mediocre camera camera camera yeah but I
play was just a 13-megapixel a lot I
really did but i think that worth it
it's the dual speakers in the front the
build quality that's awesome yeah Jules
be win7 that low light I mean that low
you still get the low light capabilities
and sometimes with the 13 megapixels I
was like playing with it I still saw
some grain
yup yup and sending the pictures even on
13-megapixel so I wasn't kind of
satisfied with that but you know I'm not
really cameras and deportment this is
how do you do for me okay I just wanted
to get your opinion to share exactly why
you want to switch which is good i heard
up a lot of people switching from the
one to the s for but it would be
actually for the first person I'm
talking to you the switches from the s
for two to the one do you have any other
questions or any other topics you want
to talk about the real quick and I'm
probably going out of context with this
but now that the Moto X phone is coming
out hahaha later this year I want your
opinion on that both any anyone well I
am I am as excited as I could be even
though Motorola is not among my favorite
OEMs not because I have anything against
motorola it's because of my geographical
location and Marilla is not that present
in in Europe and in this part of Europe
but the more players out there the
better and with with all the rumors
which we're hearing about the X phone
with the customization options and with
their close relationship with Google I
wouldn't be surprised to to see a sixth
Nexus as in the nexus 4 maybe Nexus 5
the s4 Google edition the HTC One
relations maybe the motorola x google
edition that would be an awesome but but
Joe Jaime what do you think in all
honesty okay so i'll show you something
and actually I'm gonna write an
editorial today of why I went so crazy
over getting this review you this is the
atrix HD yeah okay so there is a reason
why I wanted to spell I've owned 10
Motorola phones and that i grew up with
a motorola that had excellent call
quality which this phone has I grew up
with a motorola that had sturdy design
which this phone has I grew up with a
motorola that had excellent display
technology and everything this phone has
a problem of this phone is their
implementation of android though every
every single problem that exists with
this phone is the way that android was
implemented so if you get motorola out
of the way of the software experience
I'll be honest with you I want a
motorola
x I do yes I really i am on the list and
you know what one of the biggest reasons
why is because i like the fact that this
thing is waterproof no I like that I run
a lot I do i do a lot of working out and
I like to have a phone that I have to
worry about trashing over my daily
lifestyle I want to be able to be in the
shower and get an email to be able to
look at it without wait until I get out
of the shower by the way that's a
spoiler alert for the Otori allah they
um oh yes I do want a moto x because i
assume you know starting with the call
quality of Motorola phones it's just it
i may just what that as a maid and Joe
you you you review the eight which one
was it the droid razr a peek uh yeah
I've reviewed a couple razors and I
still have a droid bionic sitting over
on my on my shelf in the corner they
just asked for the razorback ironically
from a long time ago so I don't have
that one anymore the thing that really
strikes me about the motor all is just
to build quality and that their
willingness to to go away from plastic
and two more exotic especially back yeah
and Kevlar is I love those back pieces
it's amazing it feels good it doesn't
attract fingerprints it's not slippery
it's durable I haven't been able to
scratch that thing it's great and then
throwing in the huge batteries on their
max editions that shows us that we we
don't have to sacrifice how long we can
run a device with thickness has it
snowed speaking of the the razr maxx
versus the razor there are no fikr once
you factor in the camera bump it's it's
just amazing the call quality is great
I've got to go along with jaime and say
i'm not a fan of motoblur they're making
progress to lighten it up to make it
look less less heavy but you know the
recent additions I I kind of like I
would love to have a google edition razr
maxx
RAZR MAXX HD that'll be it beautiful
yeah i mean like i had my first moto
device was the motorola droid the first
one and i was on because i was on
verizon before now i'm on AT&amp;amp;T cuz i I
don't like Verizon that much anymore
that was my first device and I loved we
make okay my first motorola device was
the motorola be 16 no wait a second is
the smart tech how did I remember but to
just remember the v60 it was made you
had an aluminum shell it hadn't
replaceable a little bit of shells it
was a beautiful phone altogether and I
missed that Motorola I want that design
right yeah I want to go back to Motorola
myself so yeah I'm just waiting for that
to David will have to end this do you
have any any final thoughts I know but
um had something but no okay then then
how about you tell everybody where they
can find you on social networks actually
one thing you remembered sure go on yes
it's the only bad thing about the HTC
One a button placement no that's now
you'll get no home button a home put on
the right side is annoying mark my words
you will not have a problem with the
home button on the right side you will
more often find yourself pushing the USB
port on the bottom because you'll be
mistaking it for the power button at the
top that's gonna be your main problems
we're kidding well where can we find you
on twitter die dia n 0 RK dine or
awesome thank you very much for dropping
by and the hope to talk to you again
soon thank you have a good day big hear
that I Oh have I got your turn please
okay let me talk to mr. Obama's lang set
yellow you hear me hello so first and
regarding the price point
uncool away and that is here the HTC One
toast like eight hundred and fifty
dollars okay so 650s to me isn't much so
I don't have any problem to death but
the question is have an option do you
lower your volume a little bit so that I
don't get any feedback for here okay
okay so um the question is are you in
Norway gonna get the option of being
able to buy look up because in icade buy
boniva deal is something on the grill a
store anybody had time to become an act
like if I'm the United States give it to
my forward and then then it either they
import it to Miami it's crazy probably
is there any chance he can blood in some
headphones because we have terrible
terrible echo and I cannot even
understand hymas words we can just do a
five second okay one so while he's out
you're saying that your phones come
imported through Miami yeah I have our
Miami up I needed him okay okay yeah why
is everybody flushing the toilet today
come on it's just one of those days man
get regular seats look at this is a
regular seat I can't flush anything from
here so yeah I have a my I have a Miami
address and it's like if I would live in
the United States everything ships there
and then these people just notify me I
have a phone I have this I have that and
then you know they either import it
through shipping or through the air
depending on what I want to pay for
Thomas I'm sorry I'm sorry back to you
but meanwhile I most probably muted you
so please on you ok I'm back there man
enough yeah much better than much yes
great I probably won't have the
opportunity to get a list see one google
edition here I read the piece of wood
you guys released it but it somo talked
about maybe HTC would release wrong so
you could install on your current HTC
One driver you that for me that would be
great but the thing I always talk about
this might concern about them markwest
ultrapixel camera camera will
we support in stock Android for
optimization that ACS potato sense in
the test remove because I've read
somewhere that people have rooted and
installed custom rom and really a
decrease in camera quality well not
necessarily I'm gonna jump in real quick
and I don't want to step on hi my stairs
but I think I'm the one that uses the
HTC One has daily driver among the three
of us and I can tell you this much while
I don't see any decrease in image
quality because basically the sensor the
lens and everything is the same you will
most probably use functionalities like
Zoe's and highlights and some of the
effects which are still proprietary to
HTC's Sense and HTC's camera application
okay amia no can correct me on a
theoretical level no and the way it
works is most likely Google is not going
to delay their update process for these
phones just to wait for HTC to optimize
the software in order to comply you know
with everything so yeah most likely
you're getting a bare-bones no sense no
image well it's a image sense is a chip
right it's not really software
implementations but yeah you'll most
likely not get any of the features most
likely just what the hardware is capable
of doing it so from a more theoretical
perspective anytime you have hardware
that you want software to talk to you
have to do that through a driver you may
also have firmware that lives on that
hardware and once you get everybody
talking together it's beautiful so the
hardware the camera itself isn't going
to change the firmware on that camera
chip probably isn't going to change the
camera application itself is going to be
the stock camera but that also includes
some of the driver if you if you're
going with the whole software driver and
and hardware model of development the
drivers kind of built into the camera
software itself they're going to have to
have modifications in there to be able
to talk
to the physical hardware as if it were a
driver so how extensive that's going to
go to bring forward all of the HTC
advancements and and whatnot has yet to
be seen but you're going to have camera
support it's going to look good and
probably I'm going to go out on a limb
and say probably as good as it would
have if you were running the stock HTC
experience rather than the Google
Experience now don't Joe one question I
mean what do you think do you think that
this is going to be another nexus s you
know scenario because it just pisses
people off i mean the nexus s is the
last Nexus device to get Android updates
for some specific reason that I don't
understand so do you think that galaxy
nexus in the nexus 4 gonna get the
updates first and then the s4 and the
HTC One are gonna be next just because
things happen uh yes to answer very
succinctly because there's different
hardware involved in those devices
you're going to have a delay in getting
those roms to market just as you have
delays in I in getting the Galaxy Nexus
roms versus the Nexus 4 on those to
happen relatively quickly together but
the Galaxy Nexus always takes a backseat
even if it's just an hour or a day or a
week the older those devices are the
longer that delay is going to be until
eventually they just drop off to the
nexus s case that's not because they
can't it's because Google feels that
that hardware isn't fast enough anymore
to run the current version of Android so
they're just not supporting that when
we're talking about this new stuff it's
super high-end yeah there's going to be
a delay so let's use key lime pie as an
example key lime pie is going to be
released it's probably going to come out
on new hardware and then either that day
or within a couple weeks it will start
to trickle out for the next version down
and that other stuff will start coming
in after that and we'll have full
saturation within probably a month month
and a half of all the currently
supported devices running the current
rom because of the camera because of the
hardware because of the other
differences in hardware of the google
edition devices they will and rightly so
I believe be delayed in getting the
updates but not anywhere near as delayed
as they would if you were getting it
through a carrier update or even
directly from the manufacturer oh true
go that that that is a good point now do
you have any other questions thoughts no
that was oh thank you that's a pleasure
meeting you can we find you on twitter
or google+ or anything yeah google+
that's not really just your name yeah
just my name ok well it's a pleasure
meeting you man have a good one yeah
have a good weekend too usually before I
hand over to jail and since it was hi
mr. and I have a question for Jaime
Jaime what is your opinion on HTC's
chances for making a new Nexus device or
do you think that the LG Nexus 5 rumors
are legit oh that's a good one uh you
know LG is being a very bold company
because they're producing very cheap
hardware um cheap or inexpensive
inexpensive inexpensive um LG doesn't
happen ok so LG so here's the problem
let's say let's not talk about HTC let's
talk about Google which are the two
manufacturers that are more convenient
to google to build their phone and not
have any supply chain issues
manufacturing issues etc honestly LG and
Samsung you know LG makes their own
displays Sampson makes their own
displays um LG makes a lot of the
modules or they they partner a lot with
toshiba um so I do and then Sampson
makes everything you know so the problem
the problem with HTC is you know the
problem but still we you know we have
the the problems with the LG Nexus or
with their launch so you know I honestly
see Google wanting to go back to Samson
just because of what happened with LG
but yeah I don't think that they're
gonna choose HTC unless HTC becomes
really aggressive about it this is I
believe that's going to be more on HTC's
turf and being able to step up their
game than anything else because yes HTC
is building in my opinion the best
Android hardware and then we could have
motorola which would build just as good
hardware as well so i don't know thank
you amy jo please take the floor i still
wonder why we don't have a motorola
device from google I mean that we should
have had right away yeah something else
that surprises me HTC's having a hard
time keeping up with demand for the HTC
one HTC edition and now we're opening
that up to google and all the people who
are going to want a nexus experience i
I'm worried that their supply chain and
their manufacturing processes haven't
improved enough and we're going to end
up with another nexus 4 experience where
you've got a preorder it and wait and
wait and wait and wait that's that but
that's not a bad move Joe actually I
mean it's very different if i come to my
display manufacturer and tell him that i
want a million displays than if i tell
that i want five he's going to give me
more priority if i tell them that i want
five that that's absolutely true the the
other side of that is if i go to my
display manufacturers say I want a
million and they say okay that's got a a
three-month lead time and then I've got
another month that it takes for me to
receive those and build them into
devices and then another month to get
them into the hands of the people who
ordered them by that point were the
people who preordered are ready for the
HTC to or whatever comes next let me
follow up with just just this according
to unofficial number so don't rely on
them don't quote me HTC One sold 5
million units yeah this could be for
this could be three regardless according
to somewhat official numbers the nexus 4
made by LG sold three million in total
and that was a google nexus device now
the HTC One
Google edition is not an official nexus
device so I'd say it will sell much less
than 3 million do you think that that
1,000,000 google edition in addition to
those five million normal HTC editions
would make such a big problem that we
asked about production issues and supply
chain I don't think so on on the
contrary it's like for example you heard
the news recently that Apple that it's
it's sort of a change in topic but it's
actually has to do with it you notice
that the that the 4th generation ipod
touch was recently pulled from from
being sold and now they have a new fifth
generation cheaper version of the ipod
touch okay what really happened there is
that Apple still had a stock of those
devices in the factory and all they did
was sell it at a cheaper price get rid
of all their stock prepare another one
for production and once they got rid of
that they would punch in with the other
so obviously the HTC one is not selling
as well as every other phone out there
so it is the smartest thing to do to for
you to figure out how to get rid of that
inventory instead of sticking with it so
I would rather have two ways of getting
rid of the inventory than sticking with
it for beyond the period which is the
reason why and this is these are some of
the mistakes that I feel that HTC makes
um like for example um and I don't know
about this is the galaxy s3 still sold
in the United States jokes you can get
them their carriers who still have stock
of them who are trying to move them so
yes okay so here's the deal I mean I
don't understand why the HTC I know that
the HTC One X is still being sold on
AT&amp;amp;T you know I would have made the move
of of leaving the 1x as my mid tier
phone and not come out with a desire 600
so that I could get rid of all the
inventory that I have the HTC one of the
1x and keep the HTC one is the high-end
phone what you do is you improve your
supply chain and you get rid of the
inventory that's really the purpose and
they're not doing that they're bringing
out that desire 600 which is cool but
it's only adding more processes into
their manufacturing and just
complicating everything for them that's
my point and to build on that this is
what Apple does that there is no
a current generation that has high
high-end middle tier and low-end no I
mean there's not an iphone 5 mini I me
know if you want to get a cheap iPhone
you get an iphone for an iphone 4s that
gives longevity to their product and it
also lets them focus on one device at a
time so it puts all of their efforts
into making one thing really really good
rather than spreading it out amongst two
or three or four different devices which
they might even be doing two or three or
four per carrier so the Apple way really
makes a lot more sense so I like where
you're going with that yeah and not only
that but it also benefit please just
with this please wrap it up because I'm
seeing already comments of people
complaining that we take up all the air
now I'm kidding I'm kidding but okay so
the cool thing about doing this as well
as you don't feel you know if you bought
an iphone for us and it's still being
sold and supported you don't feel that
your phone is old and you feel that your
company is treating you better that's
really the other thing I mean if the HTC
two comes out next year I you know they
always ask me the same question should I
get the HTC One now is it already too
late to get it why because in the next
three months it's going to be obsolete
and that's you know you get rid of this
that's psychosis from customers n point
I would agree with that point thank you
let's move on quick quick questions
these this time quick questions for me
do you still use the phone bad know at
the moment I'm run out of SIM cards I'm
using the one and i'm using the s4 i'm
not even using my iphone so yeah that
should tell you a lot and another
question it's not a question really
nakia phablet spotted i call it a fake
and with that full stop Joe your call
all right let's uh let's go over to
Connor kirkby where are you from and
what are your thoughts on the Google
edition devices oh my fault in the
Google ition devices is I feel as if
Google China push where the next device
line and by giving over compares stock
Android from say how the box so I don't
think that's a good idea
so girls in China abandon the Nexus
lineup is the flexion device so they'll
pull the rosemary on the earth so I just
don't regret it at all so that brings up
an interesting thought google has been
doing Nexus devices kind of to show off
hardware and what hardware can do and to
make Android really look good what I'm
well I'm kind of hearing from yourself
and from others who have the same
opinion is and just extrapolating from
that could Google possibly be
discontinuing the Nexus line and going
over to Google edition devices that are
leveraging the the top end devices from
the other manufacturers and then
utilizing those are we going to see a
nexus 5 and have that be the last Nexus
device that's available and just have it
replaced with with Google edition what
are your thoughts yeah I do find out the
next five little bit last one because
there's no need from the carry on with
the next line up we've got over phone
shipping with stock Android especially
you know waste and there is also some no
ha so yeah I mean what do you think on
that do you think the the Nexus line was
just a way to to showcase Android and
Android hardware and now that we've got
Oh am to have sufficient enough hardware
that they don't need a nexus anymore
well no I mean Google is that they are
the inexpensive company and I like that
about Google except for google glass you
know it's not quite sure they've got
fiber they you know they did the Nexus 7
they've always tried to push the line
and to make the most affordable high-end
hardware available to everyone and I
like that mentality and you know Sindar
back I was very clear and 11 the Nexus
program is not going away it is staying
it has a purpose and it's not really
there you know it's not really there to
compete it's there to force you know the
rest of the OEMs to either lower their
price or step up their game because we
were seeing a lot of stagnation before
the nexus one you guys remember that mhm
guys remember how we were getting full
of of android launchers and
and you know the HTC legend had sense of
everything it was just this clunky
device and it was just not really
showing off the Android capabilities
that's the reason for the Nexus program
I can't disagree with that I think
that's really good do you have any more
comments or questions you want to wrap
up with Connor and if you do go ahead
and give those and then let us know
where anybody who asked questions for
you can contact you on social media
right so my question is is what do you
think it's a good idea for low OMS to
stop boy in SD scouts pour in their
devices ha I'm gonna answer that I just
I'm I'm be I'm the probably only person
on the team or at least who speaks as
vocally as I do who doesn't really care
about microSD expansion cards given that
you have a decent amount of internal
storage now in my particular case I can
live with League gigs I don't care I
have everything in my cloud I live in
super internet country but if you have a
16 gigabyte device like the s4 and you
only have eight gigs available that's a
problem but if you have well that's only
an ape getting device that's the one
short of it it's an aging device but if
you have a 32 gig device out of which
you can use 30 years and a picture on
the s4 is to point something Meg's and a
picture on the HTC One is below one Meg
then that speaks a lot so I personally
couldn't care less about microSD
expansion cards I don't know I I in my
case I do want microSD expansion my
problem is how Android handles it now
because you know in the past you could
load ever you could load as much as you
could on the micro SD and now you can't
and it's just stupid I mean I have a 32
gig class 10 you one micro SD card
that's probably close to as fast as
flash as a Ron chip as a ram chip and I
cannot load Spotify on it unless I I
hacked my way around it so that the
music is sent there so it totally
defeats the purpose of having expandable
storage that if that plus sin so doesn't
allow you to install any applications on
the SD card which is a samsung thing
exactly so
that that it I want it it just doesn't
make sense right now with the recent
changes of Android because that wasn't a
problem i think it was in Gingerbread
right Joe that sounds about right they
switched over the way they were doing it
because people were removing their SD
card which is something that you should
be able to do but once you have device
is installed on them your devices once
you have software installed on them it
becomes complicated in how to deal with
that from an operating system level
especially when you have widgets that
are running on the screen true okay as
then answered all right very good Thank
You Connor odd how would you like people
to get ahold of you on the social
networks I keer MIT ki ll er very good
thank you very much if anybody has
comments or questions send them Connors
way we thank you for being on the show
is next up in our rotation I am but
before that question Joe these ring the
OEMs it's a question from youtube i'm
reading now do you think the OEMs would
agree to google's editions of their
flagship devices if these two flop
because of the price point i don't think
they're going to flop because of the
price point i think if anything it's
going to help underscore the true value
of the devices because these are
unsubsidized prices this is how much it
is and if you're getting it from your
carrier for less than that you're
getting a deal I think that's going to
to outweigh that wow that's just an
expensive device I'm probably going to
be wrong but that's what I hope that
having been said we've got to define how
how someone could defend what is
flopping its flopping selling a quarter
of what that device sold without the
google experience and if so is that
really a flop because that's probably a
quarter more than they would have sold
otherwise so i would see that as a big
success
personally if I were an oem if I were
Sony for example I would see this as a
huge opportunity for some free publicity
and some marketing and a way to sell
more devices and I would be calling my
my contact at Google whoever that was to
see what I needed to do to get my device
into that program so i could start doing
it okay thank you let us move on we had
enough new people let's talk to a
recurring guest mrs. danessa hi everyone
I anissa how are you oh good let's talk
about what you want to talk about um
regarding the whole fool phone stung
versatile the phones being gold I mean
it to me it might be unnecessary because
um they r is for you to have your phone
with android if you're lazy and you're
willing to pay all that money for a
whole new phone then good for you but I
just find it unnecessary now this is I
think and I've been I've been talking to
my colleagues from from the states and
even with I'm a but time is more in a
similar situation that I am guys in the
States refer to buy a phone on a
contract because they pay out right much
less even though that throughout those
two years they pay at the end of the
contract much more for that phone in
this particular region where I live in
and in my particular case I couldn't
care less about contracts I have prepaid
cards and I just buy my phones out right
unlocked I'm not tied to a carrier I can
sell them in two months and i can buy
myself another one so for those people
who think like this and don't mind
spending six hundred fifty dollars now
versus 1000 or 1200 dollars over the
course or two years they will probably
like to have a phone with a google
edition or a nexus experience but for
those who prefer carrier contracts or
debate less i think that this will not
be such a great deal and I how does a
student how does it work in the
we can Republic because for example here
if I would want to get a phone with a
subsidy so here's the difference if i
want to buy a phone outright it'll cost
me a thousand dollars or an iphone 5
costs 800 let's say eight hundred bucks
okay hundred bucks downright 800 bucks
and then I would only pay on a prepaid
plan 25 bucks a month for that phone for
that you know for airtime + data but if
I would get a phone with a subsidy I
would probably pay the same as in the
United States two hundred dollars but
then I would be stuck on a two-year
contract where I would be paying a
hundred dollars or the subsidy was
everything plus the insurance of the
phone plus so there is just such a big
difference that it's actually cheaper in
less than six months for you to buy a
phone outright than to go for a subsidy
exactly what on here is pretty much the
same as in the States just that is um a
little cheaper but what you get in that
plan or contract then you get into is
not as good or better as it is in the
States here it is just as Tony says you
buy a phone with a company under a
contract and you what you could be
paying for an unlocked phone that maybe
I don't know five hundred five hundred
dollars but if you go to a company and
you sign a contract you end up paying a
thousand five hundred thousand or
something because that's how they get
you oh it's cheap because you just bake
this tiny amount for the phone right now
but then in the course of two years
we're going to rip your kidney out of
your body and then set it on the black
market because that's how it works so um
I people look at me like I'm crazy
because a 454 my sensation XL and here
that would be on seventeen thousand
pesos yeah hang up and people were
looking out you're insane I paid for my
galaxy s3 oh I don't know 250 maybe I
don't know 10,000 Faisal or something
it's so much cheaper and I asked him I
asked them all the time so you are
under a contract rate you want that
where the contract okay yeah but it
still is cheaper and I'm like no you're
going to end up paying 25 maybe 30
thousand pesos for that by the end of
your contract and you if you get out of
that contract but for the two years you
have to pay a penalty which is pretty
much the rest of the time that you are
there you have left on your contract oh
no it's stupid it is a lot of money that
you have to put in you have to put down
at once but at least you better have
that extra money even though you're not
gonna see it they're like with you so i
think is probably always by not a unlock
phone it's yes I have a question for you
I know you were an HTC girl what I don't
know is whether you are a sense girl or
are you a vanilla stock Android girl um
well I different versions of sense I'd
be like but lately it's just it's
annoying me and I'm afraid so uh you
know um root the phone and gas antigen
was because I had a bad experience with
my touch 3g from t-mobile that I got
three years back I decided you know what
I'm a hack it and I've decided to UM
upgraded to froyo and that complete I
would read I regret about the station so
hard is not your funny because the phone
was completely laggy it will freeze on
me all the time so after that I said you
know what I'm gonna leave my phone as it
is and just use launchers it's not a
wonderful for that all over again and
this one is brand new something I just
can't okay thank you very much if you
have any final thoughts or questions for
anybody here please go ahead uh well I
just want to say that the whole thing if
you are willing to pay all that money
than good for you but I still think is a
little necessary even though they
probably would give it out for a cheap
price but it's just not I don't see it
necessary at all okay and my camera is
as if now logged on you and that's your
account
it is it is right it is right there and
we can see it's healthy cuz I think
thank you very much as usual I think
donessa is the person who probably
skipped one out of the 18 episodes we
had so I thank you for that and that's
exactly the reason why both myself hi
met Joe and everybody else on the live
takes the opportunity at one point when
we have it to talk to you because we
love you just as much as all the new
friends thank you very much i love you
guys ah take everyone take care and i
guess i'll see you guys next week and
and by then you will be one year older
so happy an event thank you baycare
bremen high man and it's your show floor
ok i have not met mr. alex / how are you
hello reaching out to MU where's liven
on the air can you lower your volume all
right good yeah sounds good sounds good
worry from offer from a Hollywood la
you're from only one although I guess
yeah you know California I would so I
three questions i had was first put in
my head with that haha how do i phrase
correctly is that when the leg leaves
the phone it's a six gigabyte what was
out when you think all the things become
say so why doesn't manufacture make it
twenty four gigabytes and margot is 16
so when a person gets a phone it's the
full 16 gigabytes not eight I don't
think there are short pass ities chips
made in in up in multiples that way I
believe that it's one gig than two gigs
import get an eight gig then that would
be 16 gig which would beat 12 x eight
and then it's a 32 which is 2 times 16
and then six before it Joey you're the
expert here yeah you're exactly right it
used to be a little bit different when
we're talking about hard drives
you could do different sizes and
different densities and whatnot when
we're talking flash memory whether
that's flash on SD cards or what is it
NAND if it's inside it's very very
binary based the point that you're
making i agree with entirely yeah I
don't care if I have a 1 gigabyte drive
inside my phone if I only have 200 mega
available I want to know how a miracle
yeah how much is available to me what
what data can i put on there what apps
can I put on there what movies what if
it's 200 say 200 I know that's doing sir
but if your name will be samsung you
would know that it would cost you the
exact same amount of money to buy a 16
gig chip whether you should be free or
not and they buy 16 gig chip they price
it accordingly the 16 gig they price it
accordingly you as the user will pay for
it but Samsung will say look you have so
many features here but that comes at a
cost yeah yeah I can't disagree with
that at all and on that side of the
argument you know it you've got HTC with
since you've got samsung with TouchWiz
look it's got all this stuff already
built in so you don't have to add third
party apps to do that so there is an
argument to be made there but I still
want to know you know give me a
parenthetical reference this is a 16 gig
phone parenthesis eight gig user
available yeah it's just a surface all
over again yeah how was you it's good
that you said it a night it you a
surface have a history hymen yeah I have
a history of according to everybody
Microsoft hater ship that's even a word
um don't worry I said okay Alex Eddie
sorry we're crashing in what yeah you
make a solid point you do make a solid
point my question that I had was that my
HTC doesn't do that game computer that
samson is doing or like other
manufacturers
gimmicky features like satin is doing
because they're like my opinion the only
real reason people switch may be from an
S from an s3 to s4 all roads getting
through teachers I mean yeah the cameras
better make it spin figure but I mean
that night and this is my finger are we
talking about hardware features or
software features not a thought of it
like Fairview when I ok let me answer
let me answer the stepping shamelessly
on hi miss those with a question how
many friends or acquaintances do you
have that have the s4 none okay i have i
have a few i have a few and i'm not
counting my pocket now colleagues and
out of those few do you know how many
have the features enable beyond the
first week yah hours a day none so okay
Donnie you can lock the camera on me and
let's do the whole gift thing again come
on just yeah yeah why should this way
come on you know it's funny there was
this tweet from samsung recently and
they were trying to make it a very good
point they were trying to make a very
good point they were like they were like
we invented the whole this air swipe
thing that they have they invented the
whole thing because of your hands are
dirty and you want to do something with
your phone you're not gonna need to you
know to touch the phone to be able to
interact with it and I'm like oh really
and how the hell am I supposed to turn
the thing on to be able to interact with
it without touching it like it's a
gimmicky teacher nobody uses it oh my
god my hands are full of mustard and I
have a cold yeah let me just oh yeah but
I have to turn off the damn phone how am
I gonna do this there's you know says
the only reason Alex the only reason why
Samsung justice because they can but the
galaxy the galaxy s3 and galaxy s4 have
not sold for the gimmicky features
they've sold for something that's called
marketing Samsung has figured out how to
make the how to put the phone in style
just like Apple did with the first
iphone that's the only reason why
everybody wants a galaxy because
everybody has a galaxy it's like also
add to that that the
galaxy phones whether we're I'm not
talking about the 2 the 3 and the 4 are
also solid solid everything yeah yeah
you know honestly the only reason why I
wanted an s3 and the only reason why I
had an s3 and now a note 2 is because
you know honestly TouchWiz even though I
hate its its its design it's like one of
the most stable and most effective
version launchers in Android it for me
it never lags it always works it's
always you know I turn on the phone and
it's always active I wanted a galaxy s3
and now note 2 just because I get
expandable storage the the replaceable
battery and because that thing is never
gonna lag that's the only reason why I
got it but obviously I'm a more educated
customer you call that if you call it
that way but band humble too does the
rest yet the rest of the people just get
it because everybody has a galaxy or do
you have a new galaxy that's the
question that every oh you got the new
galaxy and that's a you know when people
say that I'm like men marketing oh yeah
at the new galaxy one of the 55 models
out there yeah yeah yeah also the sprint
store than a day and I was looking at
homes and there were a lot of people at
a Saxon boot that were nobody at the
agency boot and that when they're
presented it was like oh you know where
they can see and a lot of customers like
what what they see and I'm like I can't
believe you just said that I mean agency
you know they make great fun people wore
into them attention folks but that's
what's because HTC has made a lot of
mistakes um everybody remember the days
of the old touch pro2 um it was never
called the HTC touch pro two on AT&amp;amp;T it
was called the AT&amp;amp;T tilt you remember
that right I had one so that the problem
is that HTC at first was an odm they
would build for compact for a poem
Pompey yeah they built for HP for a lot
of these companies and then they came
out and we're like oh we're gonna we're
gonna pull out on brand but then when
they approached the US carriers they
offer the US carriers the ability to
build their own AT&amp;amp;T and verizon phones
and so they deluded their brand again
and now that they want to make people
know what HTC is nobody knows
you know and obviously if AT&amp;amp;T is not
going to have their eighth this is the
AT&amp;amp;T one if AT&amp;amp;T is not going to say
that to the customer they're not gonna
push it they're not gonna try to sell it
seriously you know and obviously if HTC
is not doing a better job in marketing
than AT&amp;amp;T is then the phone is simply
not going to sell and some Samsung is
killing it with billboards in the
bathroom I'm serious I am taking a leak
and I am reading a galaxy far me like oh
this is like that is a marketing ambush
that makes me want to buy a galaxy oh
yeah mark I don't know if I want to buy
anything that I see in advertising while
I'm doing my business cuz I'm gonna
associate that product with doing my
business i I'm just gonna associate that
product with your product yeah to put it
another way look if it's a phablet then
you won't be that you know size does
matter because if this is welcome to
 no lie this is the crazy plugging
a lifeproof so yeah that's a pocket now
live a happier dog is scheduled time any
anyway so yeah Alex god I gotta let you
go buddy anyway with your contact you
Twitter I don't know Google Plus you let
us not uh I all really use anything like
that uh I got one last question yes I
know you guys don't need two phones and
tablets I just know you I get the new
game system like things but one or a
theist of the ps4 yeah I'm gonna answer
that question by saying that I'm not
gonna answer the question and stay tuned
to pocket now that's my silly face just
log in you know that how stuff that you
guys don't yeah anyways Alex a pleasure
to meet you you know the rules sadly you
have to go but you can keep on watching
us on the live feed it's a pleasure to
meet you all right well how do you guys
have the day yeah bye bye Joe please yes
Mike battle your last name is battle
that's awesome tell us what you think
all right um what I think about the
nexus program is I think it's actually a
pretty good idea but my only problem
with it is I don't think it will really
fly well with consumers to be honest I
don't think I don't think you know the
average consumer the average everyday
person who goes out and buys a phone on
contract or something like that will be
interested at least in this country at
least in the US okay so let me let me
ask you this this is is the google
edition program let's call it a program
is that targeting is that hearing two
times Joe and myself can you please Mike
just lower a little bit your volume so
that we don't get this terrible echo
thank you sorry jail vector no problem I
was feeling the same way so the question
is with this Google Experience Program
are the people that they're targeting
going to be just everyday people off the
street that would normally get egg let's
say that would see an advertisement for
an sgs4 in a bathroom stall or is this
targeted to people who are coming to
tech sites like pocket now who are
developers who are the more for lack of
a shameless plugging the android-powered
users and if so is it going to succeed
there where it wouldn't in normal
everyday well I believe the intent would
be to get everybody as many people as
they can on board so i believe i believe
they i believe they intend on you know
selling it to the mainstream consumer
rather than the android power user but i
believe the devices obviously appeal
more to the android power user more so
than the mainstream user and of course
you go back to the thing about marketing
and pushing the devices and we're not
not sure if the devices will be marked
i'm pretty sure the devices won't be
marketed as well
Liz you know the non the non-google
editions that is true because at the end
of the day and I'm sorry Joe I just have
a sentence to say your average my
neighbor my ex-girlfriend I'm whoever
doesn't really care about a google
edition because all they see is for
instance sense 5 and nothing on sense 5
I see all the pictures from facebook on
google edition I can't see anything same
goes for Dutch Shell they prefer the HTC
/ samsung experience versus the Android
experience which I think people's more
to guys like us which are in the
minority and and not only that but just
let's not forget how many nexus wars is
I mean it's an extremely it's an
extremely expensive relative thumb and
it still hasn't taken off gloriously
even with the Galaxy Nexus even with the
nexus s even with the HTC One X I'm
sorry HTC nexus one none of these phones
are popular even if they were affordable
so now that they're making an affordable
move on mission phone I don't things you
can sell any better because it not to
make you team yeah you're gonna get in
today added hardware but is Android
still right I I agree with that I here
making a solid point oh my god I guess
what I'm trying to say is I see how
you're making a solid point on phone
yeah it is pretty much a niche product
for the most part ii it feels it feels a
niche for those who crave stock Android
yep that's not then at the end of the
day you're still going to sell those
extra 10,000 or 20,000 units that you
probably wouldn't have sold because they
would have gone with a Nexus device
rather than one of those so I think
Google is probably going to be
cannibalizing some of their own necks of
sales and giving them over to the Google
experienced sales it's going to sell
more product for those OEMs especially
to see who desperately need sales right
now where I agree I'm gonna say
something as I just realized i am being
with my galaxy s4 and
i am i'm shocked realize they had to get
the cover off the entire camera module
is moving is wobbling i'm not sure if
you guys can see this i'm gonna try to
move it really it mom let me try to get
an angle it is wobbling like say three
maybe four parts of a millimeter it's
definitely moving and i just realized it
when I wanted to clean my lens so doing
it out out too and it's not wobbling
weird I'm sorry back to you I just have
to say this anyways Joe Mike uh yeah I
think I covered most of what we did here
I'm sorry Mike I muted you so we
wouldn't echo so when you come back in
for your last comments and questions
make sure you unmute the point you make
is good and I think its overall a good
thing for for everybody all around it's
going to sell more product and it's
going to put more of those OEM products
in the hands of people who otherwise
wouldn't have had them for example I'm
going to talk with Tony and see what
it's going to take for me to get an HTC
one google edition in my hands as soon
as possible as soon as we're done here
so that's one more product that we
wouldn't add otherwise what Paul first
why wouldn't you get an HTC One just
left cyanogenmod on it oh ok I see with
you had no I know I know and you know
I've got my nexus 4 and the second nexus
for that I've owned by the way and I
didn't root it I didn't throw a custom
rom on it I stayed stock for longer on
this device then I have on any other
device that I have ever owned because i
feel that stock android right now does
the majority of the stuff that i want to
be able to do in fact I probably would
have stayed stock if it weren't for some
videos that I wanted to do for pocket
now that required root and then once
I've got root you go cyanogenmod I so
that having been said I want to go stock
and buy stock imagesstock google edition
with
HTC one I would love for them to have a
64 gig version but that's you know
that's just me Mike I have unmuted you
but I'm not sure if that works so maybe
you might just want to double check okay
now I hate I hear you're unmuted let me
see you and try to fix it right quick no
problem it's as long as I keep on
shutting up it's not a problem all right
um one my final thought on this would be
it would hurt back to a point Jaime made
earlier earlier about HTC you know not
releasing about the new upcoming HTC
device at their final release it's
supposed to be there mid tier device I
actually agree I actually agree with
that point in there I I think it was
kind of dumb I think it's kind of dumb
and it's kind of a bad decision for them
to make a whole new phone and I thought
hi May made a good point that they
should probably use last year's hardware
as their mid tier device and maybe that
would work better for HTC as well as a
no amped and you know they're struggling
they've been struggling we all know that
and I think I think that would have been
a smarter choice rather than you know
coming up with a whole new phone that
has basically the same specs or similar
specs to last year's model I just think
about it I mean if you want a mid-tier
the phone right now you get a cutie a
display on that inside I agree and I get
a 720p display on the 1x what am I gonna
prefer you're gonna the 1x oh yeah a
little bit further 1/3 i can i can i can
testify that because i just recently I
just recently got a 1x myself oh I just
got the one it's myself so it's still a
great phone and I'll see why anyone
wouldn't get it except the camera I can
agree that you know magic matches on
item in your online so we've got the
match 20 phone a group here right now
I'm just cracking up over the the camera
enthusiasts yeah just throw that thing
away best
the trash get caught me with a trust
Kevin picks up later if you throw that
thing away it will break through your
walls go back to you sorry man so yeah
do you have any last thoughts or
comments that you want to leave us with
Mike and if not how can we get a hold of
you and continue the discussion offline
and you're muted I didn't do it this
time I did it cuz I'm trying to try to
stop that a pill but you're bad at home
but um no I don't have any final
thoughts and I can be found on twitter
at um I at I use q 4g 4g com I mean at i
use to 4g and that's why I'm a very good
well thank you for joining us and being
part of the conversation today make sure
you come back and if anybody has any
questions or comments make sure they
follow Mike over on Twitter alright
thanks for having me guys thank you take
care and how about guys we do something
different because I'm I'm always the
host on the show so I'm every week here
you guys are not so since we had 10 more
minutes left how about we skip the part
where I choose somebody and we go back
to Hina and then to Joe for the last two
goals of the evening evening in my
crease okay yeah let's talk to matts how
are you then just to talk to a recurring
member there if you throw that phone at
me i am going to be very upset how are
you can you hear me I remember you have
a nexus 4 I remember that how do you
feel about this these google edition
phones with all this with the fact that
you purchased the nexus 4 how do you
feel about these publishing pounds okay
first off can you hear me yeah yes okay
I never know what Google you know and
also I I'll be almost and say I'm I'm a
little bit childish harvester that I was
kind of hoping this wouldn't happen I
like being special I like having my max
I like pulling this out when my
friends have s fries and no twos and
everything and I polish it up and there
you go oh well I have this mini-course
and I do this and the ID dot and I do I
wave my hands like a woman what am I
don't drop too many s bombs and f bombs
because this is a family-friendly show
and we want to keep it that way somebody
might be offender I'm sorry yeah I'm a
and I go yeah what version of Android
you have and they don't even know so I
like being special and it's a little bit
in the sound that no everybody can get
not only the best phones on the market
but it'll have the best version of well
I'm going on hopefully though I do i do
hope for the sake of the nexus program
that they will yes it will get timely
updates but the Nexus would still be the
first you guess y'all ready or else i
don't i don't understand or else they're
killing off their own brand I mean to me
this is the google version of the iphone
yeah yeah okay let me jump in there hi
me cuz i got a sec um google is not
about the hard work um they're about
hardware that shows off their software
as long as that's out there it's
available it's affordable and it runs
their software and their services very
efficiently very fluidly they're happy
now the Nexus line has been look at what
we can do to make this awesome hardware
with these awesome services that you buy
stuff from our store fast enough durable
enough and affordable enough that people
can get it just off the street and that
forces the OEMs to to compete really
against Google hardware so it's never
been about Google wants a google phone
it's always been about Google wants to
be the service provider that is
everywhere in your life they're on your
web they're on your phone they're on
your TV they're on your
shooter there in the bathroom looking
back across the stall they're everywhere
and that's what they want because with
Google they're not selling you a product
you are the product that they're selling
to advertisers exactly q just cutest
googled commercials oh yeah oh yeah but
anyway anyway so you feel you feel a
little let down would you consider
selling that nexus 4 and getting one of
these you know google edition phones or
would you rather go for a full sense
phone and you know use it with sense
right now and then go cyanogenmod
eventually what would you prefer well
with an android phone I basically rooted
and I flashed like every night player
there is so I would essentially just
quite a regular one and they go with
that and to be honest I I do know that
this is that google is not trying to
make no i phone i do understand what
you're saying and I wasn't saying that
they should be doing data flow cheaper I
was just saying that I as a very small
man like being special and now my
special thing is taken away so uh yeah
and Stan left yeah so you would
definitely prefer to to stay with your
nexus for now or you're keeping your
nexus 4 are you switching what's your
what's your plan okay I'm keeping it
until the nexus 5 I want to see what
that's all about and yeah interesting
interesting well any questions for the
team we're running out of time and no
not really i just i actually thought it
was not going to be able to come today
and i sat down on the couch since like
why it was real time and i went on and i
actually got in so last thing I'll point
out is that I have actually this habits
pin drop that we're talking about
harnessing this thing has been dropped
20 times and you stayed for nokia I feel
sorry for the rockefeller
now tell me something as well as well
have you also made phone calls on it
because usually that's really what
phones are for I know is it complete
complete lesson on it gomez go it has
some of the best sounding microphones
have ever used to ram it a nominal for
phone calls the signal is beautiful and
it to be honest as a phone this fits
this any day it is the perfect parking
brake I lock hold on let me let me show
you something I wanted to do this for a
long time and now I finally had the
opportunity so this is the back cover of
the samsung galaxy s4 and this is the
back cover of the 808 PureView see this
see it bends see this this is almost 2
millimeters thick it doesn't mend yeah
and that's just a cover I am you know
whenever that phone is not usable to you
anymore to send it to me um I know that
my neighbors got parking brake issues
with trust and i will just you know i
like to be a nice neighbor come on
anyways match is a pleasure to talk to
you again anyway we could contact you
Twitter or whatever yeah I think I've
got the thing Andals now with the whole
yeah 31 their ego and yeah i love the
team love the pocono team and i wanna
give a little shout out to Joe Levi
because your Android power user videos
on YouTube honestly it wasn't for those
videos I wouldn't have a single clue
when I started up yeah he's a bad
influence he's a well thank you for that
I I appreciate it I'm glad to know that
the that power user was put to good use
I think I think the one sentence in the
whole whole series that sold me on
routing a phone was you talking about
routing the Nexus full and you said well
and you might break
phone but that's half the fun they know
ah yes I've only bricked two phones in
my history but and i bought replacements
for both of them because that's the kind
of guy I am so brooding them for four
friends but very very good all right
love you guys yea big here bye bye and
this is going to be the final goal of
the evening and it goes to Joe Levi
Thank You unjust to follow up on the
last one before I pick somebody I like
being in the Nexus club and I kind of
think maybe Google called them Google
Experience devices rather than you know
the samsung galaxy s4 Nexus so that we
could kind of keep some of that
exclusivity and that Club like feeling
being nexus users so just a thought
there that having been said I saw you
waving Matthew let's go ahead and talk
to you unmute your microphone come to
the front tell us where you're from and
what you think of this whole google
experience devices and also what device
are you using today hi so I'm from
Canada I knew Toronto and i'm currently
using the no 2 very good race with the
whole the whole thing with this he's a
google edition devices I I don't find
the price point to be to be bad at all
because only finally yeah i live in 11
canada and i bought this this note to
outright i paid eight hundred and fifty
dollars for it because 729 and then
taxes which are crazy up there it's
canadian the nursery yes canadian
dollars which is pretty close to
american so yeah guys have like two
three year contract so it makes sense to
my phone series yeah I'm well that's why
I keep buying them out because I'm I'm
walked to a three-year contract on an
original note no one and ever since I
bought in three phones out rights and so
I just keep paying for for the mode of
my pocket so six hundred fifty dollars
doesn't seem doesn't seem too bad to me
yeah I completely agree on there seems
to be a mentality issue with people
especially in America it probably bleeds
across the border to the north as well
and people want things for free and as
long as somebody says it's free that or
cheap that's that's great and they don't
look at the extended costs of it one of
the reasons why I'm really really happy
with what t-mobile is doing going
completely contract list for their their
new signups if you want to get a device
that's great they'll sell you a device
at a low cost right now and then they
will tack on monthly payments for that
device going forward but you're still
free to leave anytime you want you just
gotta pay off the rest of your phone or
whenever i'll leave they'll remind from
you and I I don't know it's a fair
market value minus yeah whatever
refurbishing fastest i think the
t-mobile approaches smart like you paid
twenty bucks for a phone a month i mean
that's like oh come on that's awesome
yeah there's they're still throwing in
the time value of money equations and
whatnot so you're still paying interest
and whatnot on it rather than paying it
outright but i think it's a good half
step for where we were to where I think
we need to be which is someplace more
like Tony and what they do over there in
in Europe people need to to be more
responsible with their money and realize
hey you know I can spend 500 bucks right
now and get a really good device and
have it for as long as I take care of it
versus I can pay a hundred bucks for it
now and another 800 bucks for it over
the life of the contract and I'm stuck
with them I don't have a choice I have
to stay there until I pay it off so I
kind of like that but I'm let's go ahead
and go back to Matthew uh rather than
talking over the top of you what other
comments are points do you have about
the google edition phones oh I think I
don't know that I would personally
purchase it because I do i do enjoy the
skins on it especially TouchWiz so yeah
it probably wouldn't be for me but I
don't
as far as the price point I don't find
it too bad so since you bought your note
to outright if there were a note to
google edition that would you be tempted
to buy that one instead of the Samsung
addition if you had to do it all over
again no I don't think so because if I
if I was tempted to to try out stock
Android again I would just root and put
cyanogen mod on what it was just a quick
question as a layman wouldn't the having
stock Android under no tooth completely
killed yes Ben yes yeah I would it would
with what's out of the box but you got
to remember samsung added stuff to
android and you can add a lot of that
stuff back with third-party apps not as
deeply integrated as samsung has
obviously but it's possible so that kind
of takes the Thunder out of my follow-up
question Tony thanks for that I was
going to say if it were available to to
flash a google edition rom onto your
note 2 would you do that why or why not
and I think we've just gotten that
answer the power behind the note 2 is
really the s-pen would I be fair in that
conclusion yeah yeah no well i'm
currently using the note 2 and the power
here is a size yes for me the big
advantages i don't i just i like the
size of the phone that's me I've got you
I've got Gigantor hand was very good
well thank you for your input Matthew do
you have any last questions or comments
that you'd like to add and then follow
up with how we can contact you on social
media so we can keep the conversation
going oh yeah that's all that's all I've
got for today you can follow me on
