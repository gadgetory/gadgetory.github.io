color options and ETA for the samsung
galaxy s 8 several reports claim that
the iphone x might be ditching touch ID
/ facial recognition and what they will
prepare for the second generation shall
me me mix I'm high memory that I'm back
in the New York studio freezing
absolutely every inch of my behind this
is parking out daily official news today
begin with deals if you want to get
yourself a really inexpensive smartphone
that's really good there's the g4 play
for moto it's currently at B&amp;amp;H for just
one hundred and thirty dollars there's
even a coupon code that will drop the
thirty bucks you can learn more on the
link in the description now let's talk
about shall me yes lavada is no longer
in the company but the company CEO is
kind of teasing what to expect we have
heard that there is a new me mix in the
works and pretty much there is a
confirmation now and for those of you
wondering exactly why we need another
awesomely mix that's because apparently
the company is working on bringing an
even thinner profile for those vessels
wow that's going to be awesome we can
not wait to see what's next now and some
very interesting developments that seems
that HTC plants to continue broadening
its scope of the way it operates first
of all we see the company working in VR
definitely if smartphone business is not
doing great but rally the company wants
to do a little more Oh dming and for
those of you that don't remember HTC
used to be an odm that's how the company
started eventually it started showing us
its brand but in the past there was the
maker of the compact I pack addition to
other devices out there apparently the
company just at that with a Google pixel
and it seems that it might start doing
it again with US carriers for those of
you that don't remember the HTC touch
pro2 back in the day of Windows Mobile
was very famous mainly because it came
out with an ex tain amount of carrier
variants family that's going to be the
case I'm not saying I'm going to
celebrate this but I don't think it's a
bad idea even enough of you that
followed the rumors yesterday of the
iphone x getting a design that has no
bezels at the top and apparently at the
bottom some sort of it like a touch bar
apparently those rumors are getting even
more traction today new reports claim
that apparently that touch bar
I mean that there won't be touch ID
apparently whatever sort of iris scanner
that this phone is going to bring is
going to bring enough facial recognition
for there to be no need for touch ID
that's going to be rather interesting
because such idea is cool because you
don't have to lift the phone up for it
to look at you and unlock the phone you
just press it from wherever it is so
let's see how Apple pulls that off if it
does happen which I don't think will
happen and finally the very hot news is
they have to do with the samsung galaxy
s 8 and it's possible launch frame
apparently it's going to happen sometime
in week 14 of 2017 which falls in April
that's great I think that's good timing
in addition to that we also hear color
options like for example black gold and
orchid grey whatever orchid grey is but
we also notice that apparently there
will be only one variant of 64 gig
variants that will most likely have
expandable storage etc etc it leads me
to the question of the day what do you
think of these rumors of the samsung
galaxy is a do you think that it's a
good time to announce it in March for
launch in April because in my case I
think that it would be perfect timing
for this phone in particular so long as
Samson take its time and does this right
