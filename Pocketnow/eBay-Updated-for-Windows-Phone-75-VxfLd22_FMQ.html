calm and we are going to check out the
new ebay app for Windows Phone this was
updated with some cool new features for
the new 7.5 update let's check it out so
first off here we are in the first
screen we have your search button you're
searching input field got some deals and
check out it's just going to load you
know a few featured things got Tapia
category got a deal finder and you got
pin to start so if you want your deals
on the start menu we can do that just
going to show up there and we have
really fast resume that's straight back
into it and something you might overlook
the little little dots down here brings
up a menu and we have a scan button so
let's show you this I'm going to scan
something if I can see it properly there
we go
and so that's and an old box and found
the item and it's looking for auctions
related to that so we can see touch
diamond all the prices for that you can
have oxygen is philtrum by auctions or
buy it now so there's the ones you could
buy now or go back to all now from the
search results we've got some options
here you can refine it you can sort it
you can save the search and refresh we
also have pin to start so let's try that
and then again we got a quick access to
that search right there so that's pretty
cool let's look at these items let's
find a good one I want this one and this
is going to load the details so we can
see or review some information buy now
button right there shipping where's it
coming from here's our pictures and we
just have one there's a full-screen
picture that kind of that here's our
menu we can watch it we can share we can
refresh we can pin to start see our
details okay full description
there you go it's all in this HTML glory
you can get the shipping information so
everything is right there and pin it to
start so pinning the specific item
brings you the picture in the live tile
and you'll see when it's when the
auction is ending so this is a great way
to quickly no keep track of something
that you might want to bid on and it'll
be right there on your Start menu and
tapping it goes straight to the item
after reopens ebay few other features in
this a Bay app we have find gifts this
is a this is a ebay Explorer it's in
beta so we can choose a category and
then it's going to ask you some more
questions and we can choose some things

and there we go there's something to
look at
all right let's get out
and there's a couple of recent searches
and over here we can see the list of
what i'm watching buying selling

that's pretty much it for the new ebay
app but there are some pretty cool
features in there that's it for now
