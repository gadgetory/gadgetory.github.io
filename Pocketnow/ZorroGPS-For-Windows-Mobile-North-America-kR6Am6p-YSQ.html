parking calm and today I'm shoe an
inexpensive GPS alternative to garmin
and tomtom for your windows mobile
device and his poems called Zorro GPS
and it can be downloaded directly to
your computer and then save to a storage
card so it helps eliminate the data
usage if you are traveling in an area
that doesn't have data so I'm just going
to go through some of the features of
the program of course we have the map
and we can zoom in and zoom out so I'm
just going to zoom out all the way so
you can see that you can select many
different maps and there's a lot of
different pricing features and i'll post
those on pocketnow.com after i'm done
with this video so it can zoom out we
can zoom in and that and we can select
two-dimensional or three-dimensional
views so that's great feature to have on
a navigational program we're just going
to go in some of the features if we
wanted to navigate to an address we can
just select address point of interest
Willian type it in we can have there's
many different keyboards you can select
because it's an international product so
right now i have the qwerty keyboard
setup so i'm just going to cancel we can
go to our favorite so if you have some
favorites you can save in here this is a
great place to save them to just go back
we can see what point of interests are
around our area so if we wanted to
search for oh I don't know entertainment
and just search apparently there's
garden jenkins creek garden which is
pretty close and go back we can go to
our contact information and this is
where it gives us our contact we can go
directly to our contacts by selecting
one of them will go back now we can view
on the map and we can also go to recent
so if you visit a place you can also see
how to get back to that location again
we'll go over we can get all chicken set
up an alternative route we can go to the
points of interest on our trip route
information route view roadblock and we
can also delete our route so just go to
the next one we can look at our GPS you
can also go to the GPS panel which will
show you the satellites that were
connected to
and you can see where you are and i'll
show you current street as well as
longitude and latitude and altitude
let's just cancel and we'll just hit
cancel we can see our GPS tracks are
planning of our trip help me information
simulation we can change our vehicle so
if we wanted to change to a pedestrian
or to a bicycle we can do that it's
pretty simple just click this button and
go over again this is where you can
change our volume our day or night we
can set that up and I have it in set it
to auto so it will change automatically
you can see 2d and 3d planes and change
the orientation of the screen so if you
want it to be horizontal you can do that
and we can go into options so we can set
up avoidance set up for highways if we
wanted to eliminate the use of highways
we can just click here and it will use
most highways or no highways at all so
highways are ok I'm gonna change our
guidance so I have it set for full
detail you can change it to city and
highway highway detail guidance and
filter and was it canceled on this we
can allow tolls I don't like toll so I'm
just get no tolls and we can see our
destination I have it set to no flag
right now but I'm actually going to
change that and just hit OK go over
again we can get menu information so if
we wanted to change the background like
if I wanted to change this I can change
the skin so if i want to go to like a
jungle it'll change all the buttons to a
jungle theme i'll just change it to snow
because i think that's probably a little
bit easier to see yeah it is so I'm can
also change some of the buttons so if
you don't want any buttons like right
now I don't have any buttons but you can
turn them back on and turn them off you
can also change the colors of your
buttons so right now I've on red change
it to blue and it will load the blue
button so we'll just hit OK we can also
set the speed limit points of interest
on map map alarm voice alarm and go over
again
we can actually play our media through
this GPS navigation program so if we
would have any music or videos we can
actually play them directly through here
so okay we instead of security so if we
only want us to be able to use this we
can change our username and turn off the
security turn on the security set a home
address or company as well as change a
pin so that if somebody was to steal
your windows mole device you they
wouldn't be able to access this program
and click over again and we can select
our country of origin so if we want to
select the city is will actually take
you to the country's i'm going to select
the united states of cords select the
date and time which voice you would like
so right now i'm on us english and you
can actually pick different voices which
is pretty cool so if i wanted to pick
ryan i can pick that person's voice and
we can just say ok and it will change
the voice we can also select miles so if
we wanted miles and yards we can select
that or miles and feet or kilometers we
can also change the text so for
different languages we can change that
as well and there's a few different
languages as you can see this does
support many different country we can
also change the keyboard so I have it
set to a qwerty keyboard you can change
to ABC if you prefer or many different
other language keyboard so what's okay
I'm actually going to go into a
simulation so you can see and hear how
the gps navigation actually works so
we'll just select one of these and it'll
start the simulation program okay so
here how the navigation and it's
actually going through a simulation and
this is just in New York City and it
will tell you which directions to go and
it's actually pretty powerful gps
program so i'm just going to turn it off
right now exit this so this is oral gps
and it works on any windows mobile five
and greater device it does require that
you have a storage card because it is
rather large for the United States maps
alone it was just around two and a half
gigs and i will post a link of parking
lot of comments now to get this there
are many different pricing
features so you can select your
individual state if you want which is
pretty cheap all the way up to north
america or any other country in the
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
