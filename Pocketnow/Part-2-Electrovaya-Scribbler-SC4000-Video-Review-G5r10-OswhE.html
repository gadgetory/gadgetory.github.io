part to the video review for the electro
via scribbler sc4
go through the fingerprint reader and
the Bluetooth hardware on this Windows
Vista tablet pc first let me go through
the fingerprint reader as i mentioned in
part 1 of the video review in the
hardware overview there is a fingerprint
reader on the top right of the device
where you could just swipe your finger
and log in to your favorite websites or
log into the computer it makes it really
easy because this computer doesn't have
a keyboard and it's solely dependent on
using the tablet pen so sometimes it's
just easier instead of having to write
your passwords you can just swipe your
finger across the reader and login for
example if I were to lock this computer
here I've locked it now and now it's
going to bring up the fingerprint reader
software I just swipe my finger across
the top and I just logged right back in
another nice thing is if I go to a
website let's say go to pocketnow.com
and let's go to our user forums
click on that here so here we have the
user forums and let's say i wanted to
login so i can make comments on the
forms itself in this moment the
fingerprint software is going to come up
again I've already loaded in my user ID
and my password tying it to my
fingerprint so if I swipe my finger
print again and a second it's going to
highlight the areas where it thinks it
should fill in it does and in a second
it's going to log me in automatically
again this is a really nice feature it
makes it really easy you don't have to
keep you any passwords written down and
you just swipe your finger across the
device and you log into whatever you
want to log into really great feature
here if you wanted to adjust the
settings on your fingerprint reader
software you just double click this
little icon at the bottom here and to
get into it again it's tied to your
fingerprint we log right in and it
brings up this for these four little
icons that you can go through the first
is just the Internet Explorer auto
log-in so here's where you save your IDs
and passwords the second is a secure
lock it just locks or unlocks your hard
drive on your device third is your user
settings and forth is helping reference
the last icon the botton bottom is just
to exit the application so if we wanted
to register another finger we go to
fingerprint registration and let's say I
want to register my middle finger here
so it click on that and I click on next
and it's gonna bring up another window
here and it's got asked me to swipe my
finger across the screen across the
reader a few times just so I can get a
good read on it so I'm going to swipe it
once and every time it gets a good read
it's going to highlight these little
radio buttons here to indicate it's got
a good read and now it's done and now my
finger is registered for use on this
device really nice feature
so the next thing I want to go through
is the Bluetooth implementation on this
tablet pc again as i mentioned before
this has bluetooth 2.0 the only problem
is it doesn't have the 82 p drivers so
you couldn't use your bluetooth
headphones but i wanted to see how it
would work with multiple devices and
syncing up with my blackjack and my at&amp;amp;t
tilt so what I'm going to do here first
is I'm going to turn off the Wi-Fi let
me move this back a little bit so you
can see here and what we're going to do
first here is I'm going to set up
internet sharing on my tilt here with
the scribbler so I've turned off the
Wi-Fi and if I go to internet sharing
here I got it set up for Bluetooth
personal area network using ATT media
net if I click on connect let's see I
just have to make sure my device is set
is view is visible so it's asking me to
do that so I just set that up as visible
the internet sharing just asked me to
set up a personal area network on the
computer itself so I tap on the
Bluetooth Eric icon join and tap on join
a personal area network and I've got my
my tilt already already partnered with
this computer so I can just click on
connect it's connecting and now i have
tethered my to AT&amp;amp;T tilt to the
scribbler so now i have access to the
Internet this is really nice to have
especially I I travel a lot and to be
able to access internet on the fly is
really nice so I'm on HTC's wiki site
and now i'm going back to pocketnow.com
and that works just great the next thing
when i try doing is actually active sync
at the same time with my blackjack two
so if i go over to active sync here
menu and connect on via bluetooth the
black jack is working at the moment and
now windows mobile device center on
Windows Vista is opening up
as you can see it takes a little time
here and now i can set i haven't set up
a partnership with this computer but
i'll just connect without setting up the
a partnership here and now i'm in
through bluetooth which is really nice
so it's go to file management and here
it's try to login to micah blackjack and
now i can see the contents on my
blackjack and on its storage card so
again you know the bluetooth
implementation on this on this scribbler
is really nice again the only problem I
have is it just doesn't have the 82 p
drivers which is really unfortunate so i
couldn't use the my bluetooth headphones
with and i couldn't give that a run so
this has been raid one with
pocketnow.com and part two of the video
review of the electro via scribbler SC
