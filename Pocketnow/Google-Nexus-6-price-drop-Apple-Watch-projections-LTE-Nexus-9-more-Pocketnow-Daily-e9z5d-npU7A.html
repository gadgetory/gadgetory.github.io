a true shocker carriers are already
applying common sense when it comes to
the nexus-6 pricing and could it be that
will get a moto 360 sooner rather than
later I'm hi melody that I am the
biggest problem with being an early
adopter is you'll most likely see your
product obsolete very soon this is
fargin out daily let's begin today with
what's official as Corning Gorilla Glass
seems to be worried about sapphire the
company is already working on corning
gorilla glass 4 they made it official
today and it'll take a fall from one
meter in height which is three feet up
to a concrete floor and apparently would
stand the fall obviously we know that
even with parent gorilla glass sometimes
one fall isn't enough one fall just
shifts the borders and then the second
fall will do everything but hopefully
this will be a better product link to
the description for full video on the
product and let's see what we get at CES
2015 now let's talk about the google
nexus 6 s carrier seem to be talking
some sense into themselves when it comes
to the price tag sprint was going for
the crazy phablet price of three hundred
dollars after two year contract and they
just dropped that price to 250 dollars
which is currently what AT&amp;amp;T is charging
and still you would say the two hundred
fifty dollars is a lot but then when you
consider the Galaxy Note 4 or even the
Galaxy Note edge clearly two hundred
fifty dollars is not a lot for
everything you're getting on the Nexus 6
although again it's not a perfect phone
I speak of Nexus devices let's talk
Nexus 9 as we are still waiting for the
lte-enabled version of the tablets and
since google has not come clear as to
when we can get this tablet t-mobile
just did them a favor we just made it
official that the tablet will be
available early December and t-mobile
even though we don't have a price tag is
yet for the LTE variant on t-mobile
let's see what we get very soon and in
other news let's talk moto 360 we know
that a lot of you still want to buy this
product as it was constrained when it
came to supplies earlier this month and
we would probably advise you to hold
back the Lenovo VP for Europe was
recently in an interview in Russia and
when being asked about the Moto 360 they
got pretty much still the beans at early
2015 we are getting the next version of
the Moto
the which makes sense CES or mwc 2015
will be covering it live let's see if
that is going to happen and finally for
the very interesting news of the day
Morgan Stanley analysts are already
predicting that Apple is going to sell a
crazy amount of Apple watches next year
now listen to this they're predicting
that the company will sell ten percent
of the current install base of the
iphone meaning they're trying to sell 30
to 40 million units and apparently with
all the recent leaks and apples supply
chain that's really what Apple is
building for next year 30 to 40 million
units which is extremely interesting for
a SmartWatch market that barely cells in
the hundred thousands right now I don't
think any company has reached a million
yet and which leads me to the question
of the day do you believe that the Apple
watch is cool enough for this to happen
do you think that Apple can sell 30 to
40 million products in my case I don't
know 30 to 40 million seems a lot in a
market that's emerging it's not so crazy
given the iphone install base but then
when you think about the Android install
base how is it that Android will is not
selling in the millions leave us a
comment down below what do you think

get it was earlier before this video was
