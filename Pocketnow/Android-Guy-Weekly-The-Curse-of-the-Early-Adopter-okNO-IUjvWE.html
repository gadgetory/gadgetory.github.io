all like new stuff right new stuff is
cool but new stuff turns into old stuff
and old stuff well just isn't that cool
until it gets really old and then it
becomes retro and then for some reason
it's cool again don't worry we're not
going to talk about that instead what
we're going to talk about is what
happens when something is so new it's
got its own set of problems and you find
yourself with the curse of the early
adopter and it's contagious but don't
worry you're not alone there may be a
cure that's what we're going to talk
about in today's edition of the android
guy weekly
so over here at pocketnow.com we get to
play with a lot of new stuff a lot of
new stuff and we go through we try it we
evaluate it we have our hands on it for
some times as much as two weeks I know
that doesn't sound like a lot but
there's so much new stuff coming out we
got to get through it really fast and
usually the people who send it to us
kind of want it back no guys we don't
get to keep this stuff which kind of
makes some of our reviews a little bit
biased now we don't intend for them to
be biased we go to great lengths to try
them out and put ourselves in your shoes
and give you a fair and realistic rating
for lack of a better word and our views
on the experience with the device which
sometimes is even more expressive than
just the raw numbers that you see in the
reviews themselves but it's not fair now
what do I mean I don't mean it's not
fair that we get to play with cool stuff
what I mean is we're not investing our
money like you are to go out and buy
this stuff on a whim you're doing your
research in all honesty that's one of
the main reasons you're here and thank
you for being here by the way but you're
doing your research before you invest
your money to see if this particular
product or that particular product is
the best place for you to invest that
money notice I'm not just saying
spending saying investing because you're
going to have this device well then
that's a smartphone or a tablet or a
Google TV or whatever the case may be
for hopefully at least a year if you're
on a contract that might even be two
years before you get another one so it's
got to be a good investment you're
putting a lot of time and effort into it
and before you're expending your own
cash you're thoroughly vetting that
product I'll let pocket now sometimes
these products are just given to us for
a week or two we play with them we
evaluate them we try and give you our
session of them and then we send them
back but it didn't take any money out of
our pocket
but it did what I'm trying to say there
is pocket now is unlike a lot of the
other websites that I've been to a lot
of these sites do nothing but
evaluations of products that are sent to
them maybe they do more than that but it
seems that way we'll give them the
benefit of the doubt pocketnow is a
little bit different when one of us
reviewers sees a device that we really
really want chances are we're going to
go out and get it we're going to spend
our own money on it and we're going to
risk that and it's going to come into
what we call our daily driver something
that we have on our hip or in our pocket
all the time and we used our own
personal money to buy this that's how it
worked with my galaxy nexus i had that
thing imported from overseas before I'd
even held one in my hand my own money
because well I'm an early adopter so
what's this curse that I've been
alluding to perfect example the Nexus Q
you guys know what I'm talking about
right it's the big black ball thing
really really heavy plugs into your TV
in your stereo and that's about it
google announced it at google io 2012
and they just kind of brushed over it
saying hey this is really cool looking
player media on your big screen TV and
it's really high end and oh by the way
we made all this stuff in the united
states of america because we could
because we think that people might want
that so it's kind of an experiment in
that and you should buy it we're not
going to be able to ship them for a
month but if you want to preorder it you
can go and do it now and of course all
of us went whoa I don't even know what
this thing is but it's round and it's
made in America and it's google and it
it does something and I want it so some
of us put down money and a lot of money
at that for a big ball of who knows what
it does a couple hundred bucks that
ain't cheap 260 was it well what was it
and what does it do nobody really knew
we knew it kind of played movies and
music and stuff
we knew that you could control it with
your Galaxy you know whatever with NFC
and it was cool because you had party
mode and you should get it because it's
cool we didn't know what it did and that
was a problem and when people started
getting this device to review it well it
turned out that people started saying
yeah this doesn't do much it'll play
your youtube videos and your play music
not play music but your music from play
music I don't know why Google aimed at
that but they did and play movies from
play movies same thing I don't know why
they named it that way don't blame me
i'm just the android guy anyway you can
play any one of those three it was great
but all of your content had to be Google
you had to own it on you know you play
music you had to own it on play movies
or rent it as the case may be or YouTube
because you know everything's on YouTube
anyway right except all that paid stuff
which isn't so that was all it did no
netflix no pandora no this was not some
kind of a funky google TV thing no it
was just those three things and that was
it there was really no user interface to
it at all it just played and that was
all and a lot of people just like
yourselves went I don't know if 250 260
bucks is you know something i'm going to
pay for a ball that lets me watch you
tube and that's it so google said oh
crap and they said we're going to go
back to the drawing board and do what
you guys really want now what do we
really want I don't know maybe make it
into google TV and a ball something like
that or maybe a tablet in a ball whether
the screen is your big screen I don't
know they'll do something with it but in
the meantime they said hey all you guys
who put money down on it we're going to
go ahead and send it to you for free and
it's great and I have one downstairs and
I've used it twice and that's it so
another example 3d now in the world we
live in it's 4d I know most people don't
include time as a fourth dimension but
it is
they told me that in physics class in
college and I got a diploma and it said
so I think and we talked about quantum
physics and they said that everything we
learned in physics was wrong so I might
have just lied to you but that would be
a space-time paradox and we're not going
to get into that because that always
messes up movies but anyway back to 3d
and movies it's a good tie-in what about
3d was cool well 3d movies have been
around forever they've come into and out
of vogue quite frequently and there's
one thing that you can always count on
with 3d movies when they come into vogue
they're going to go back out a vogue
again soon I think I used vogue there
more times in that last ten seconds and
i have my entire life vogue but three
this time looked like it was around to
stay because hey it was digital and they
were making stuff well in 3d with these
cool stereoscopic cameras stereoscopic
is a cool word means 3d but they were
doing these cool high-end big-budget
movies and honestly some of them were
amazing and suffer more crap I'm not
going to mention any names spy kids but
excuse me there some of them were crap
and they were made just because they
could be made and because they could
sell a premium or charge a premium for
their tickets however hey this 3d trend
this craze it's here to stay so let's
put it in TVs and now let's make it so
you don't even have to wear those funky
glasses to be able to watch it in 3d you
can just look at the screen into it hey
you know what has screens smart phones
you know what we could do we could put a
3d screen on a smart phone wouldn't that
be cool Oh that'll be so cool you know
what we could do we could put one of
them funky stereoscopic cameras on the
back of it you could take 3d pictures
you can take 3d movies everyone knows
what you're going to be using for 3d
pictures and movies yeah the flowers in
my front yard because it looks so pretty
in 3d don't they
everybody loves the flowers in my front
yard in 3d the screens were crap they
were really real well resolution I mean
you guys complain over pentile displays
I don't know maybe I just don't see it
but I have to trust you if you think
pentaiah looks crappy it doesn't to me
but if it does to you don't get it get
you know something else but 3d screens
super crappy super super crappy even
though you could see 3d stuff and not
everything was in 3d the operating
system wasn't in 3d some of the
launchers had 3d bits in them but unless
you're watching a 3d movie weren't gonna
do it but hey YouTube YouTube has 3d
movies you can upload a 3d movie to
youtube so it's here to stay right nope
it's gone we talked about that before
I'm pocket now put a nail in its coffin
it's dead if you were an early adopter
of a 3d compatible phone one of the two
that i can think of off the top of my
head you have a nice phone and your
movies take up twice as much space as
they would normally and your pictures
take up twice as much space as they
would normally oh and you can't watch
them on normal devices you have to
process them and it's a pain in the neck
because of the curse of the early
adopter so what the Nexus Q and 3d we
kind of knew what we were getting into
and we went into it it was really knew
there wasn't anything like it on the
market and hey we wanted it just to say
that we had it just to see what it did
just so we could hold it in our hands
and see exactly what this new technology
was all about and yes we paid a premium
for it except for a nexus q which we got
for free but we were going to pay a
premium for it okay so that's one thing
how about some of the more subtleties
let me give you a few examples how about
paypal pay here if you heard of that or
paypal here or i don't know what they
ended up calling it essentially it's
like square or into it where it's a
little device thing that you swipe a
credit card through that plugs into your
headphone jack it lets you
swipe a card and pay for stuff right
there using your internet connection you
can process money really really cool
concept I was nearly adopter I signed up
for the paypal pay here program and
while that was a tongue twister and I
said it really fast or a baby buggy
bumpers but I didn't get the reader for
a long time because it was a limited
trial still is but eventually I got it
and you know what works great and then
my galaxy nexus got an update to
Gingerbread and you know what I'm sorry
not ginger bread jelly bean gingerbread
got an update to jelly bean jelly bean
is great it's super fast it's wonderful
Owen by the way didn't work with the
reader didn't work with the app so now I
have this new app I couldn't use just
when I needed to be able to use it I
couldn't why because say it with me the
curse of the early adopter I think they
have since got that fixed another case I
have a nest learning thermostat yes I
really am that geeky and thank you mr.
bill you know who you are for
recommending that to me because wow
awesome I can control the temperature in
my house with my smartphone which sounds
like it's stupid but really cool but it
really has practical applications like
hey I'm not going to be home for several
hours why is my air conditioner on I can
turn it off from anywhere that I have an
internet connection really really cool
actually what that means is when i get
home my house is really really hot but
my power bill is significantly lower or
let's say i know i'm coming home early
from vacation and I want my house not to
be hot when I get back so I'll turn on
my air conditioner an hour two hours
before i get home so when I walk in the
door nice and cool Utah's a desert it
gets warm here in the summertime just
saying so I've got that works great
except on my tablet yep any tablet
doesn't work why you can install the app
just fine no problem put it on there
does it installs great
no warnings about compatibility fire up
the app and it says yes you know sorry
you can't do anything because we don't
understand your resolution we're not
built for it we're not going to let you
turn your temperature up or down turn
your heater or your air conditioner on
or off because you're on a tablet sorry
have a nice day I still have the app
installed on my tablets hoping someday
someday they'll give me an update that
will let it work even if its scales even
if it's just an up and down button to
let me control it on my tablet because
please I'm ending up using my tablet
very very often sometimes I have it and
my phone is in my car or on my desk or I
just like to be able to do it for my
tablet so that's another thing see if
I've got one more how about custom roms
and we'll end with this one don't worry
custom roms I'm a custom rom er I like
cyanogenmod a lot you guys haven't
noticed that already hi welcome to the
series my name is Joe the android guy
this is like episode 27 now but anyway
cyanogenmod my distro of choice love
that thing fabulous hey you know what
else is cool google wallet oh yeah
paying for stuff with your phone man I
can do that and every time I do it blows
the mind of whoever it is that's
quote-unquote taking my money as luck
paid for it with my phone there's my
receipt yes with my phone and then I
flash a rom and Bourque my NFC secure
element so I can't use it anymore
because my secure elements not
responding now what does that mean
essentially means that Google Wallet
doesn't have the key to my NFC secure
element so I can't get into my wallet to
use any of my stuff ever again not happy
you know what the solution is I actually
called up Google Wallet support just
like the error message told me to their
solution by a new phone this time don't
rom it
don't even root it don't do that it's
bad you don't want to do that don't root
your wallet don't root your phone so now
I have to go out and buy a new six
hundred fifty dollar phone just because
I custom rom bit and didn't know that
that meant that it was going to be
thrown away the only key to the wallet
thanks google frustrating yes I know I I
opened myself up to that as soon as I
started thrown on custom roms it was one
of the risks that I took and I went into
it knowing that eventually that stuff's
going to happen frustrating yes
unexpected yes worth it holy heck you
have you tried cyanogenmod oh yeah but
early adopters that's the curse so
there's a few of my personal stories
things that I've done do I have a cure
for it share don't be an early adopter
now how do you get around doing that for
me I've got a terminal case of early
adopter itís it's I'm never going to
get rid of it it's incurable but what
about you well like a pocket now you've
got the android guy or hey maybe you're
not even an Android person not a problem
we got people who like blackberry like
iOS who like Windows Phone and whatever
the next thing is that's coming out
because there's always some next thing
we got you covered will be your early
adopter will let you know is this worth
it or is this not do you want to hang
out and wait even though it may be super
cool what risks are involved pocketnow
is here to tell you no worries but now
it's your turn I want to hear your
stories I want to hear how early
