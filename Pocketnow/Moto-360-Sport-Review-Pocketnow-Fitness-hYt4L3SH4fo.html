every calorie every rep when you're
working hard it all counts and
everything has to be accurate I'm high
memory that I would pocket now and this
is pocketing outfit
even though Android wear is still far
from the popularity of products like
Fitbit we get constant questions on
Twitter from users who are looking for a
good Android wear SmartWatch that can
also do Fitness well Android wear
offerings have sadly lagged behind in
this favoring good looks over a
versatile design that can be easily
adapted for fit bits like in the case of
the Apple watch but Motorola intends to
change that dramatically with the Moto
360 sport our separate unboxing video
can tell you more about what you get in
the box but in a nutshell if you've ever
unboxed the standard Moto 360 the
experience here is pretty much the same
we get the same round box with the same
qi wireless charging cradle that we've
come to love allowing you to turn the
Moto 360 sport into a night clock
whenever charging the similarities with
the Moto 360 and there though the sport
variant does a millimeter smaller in
diameter than the larger standard
variant sports an any light hybrid
display protected by Gorilla Glass 3 as
opposed to a traditional LCD and the GPS
antenna to improve tracking accuracy the
textured ring surrounding the display
provides a nice elegant touch that also
serves for user confidence while beating
up the device during a workout it's
sadly not as customizable as its
standard sibling giving you only three
color options to choose from and then
adding the major hurdle of a non
replaceable band something which does
POY some major concerns for wear and
tear in the long run
but you know what the choices in fit and
finish all contribute to a great
experience wearing the Moto 360 sport
the silicon texture on the band feels
top-notch in the arm and it's also far
lighter than the standard variant
allowing you to forget about the watch
while you're training something that's
really essential in fitness now if you
thought this watch would serve for all
types of training grounds that's not
necessarily the case yes you are running
Android wear 1.3 on a very powerful
Snapdragon 400 processor meaning the
experiences very fluid and third-party
applications load quickly it also
includes the standard moto 360 watch
phases which are all great and in
addition to that a specific moto 360
watch phase that provides your daily
activity at a glance which is very cool
and yes as an Android wear watch you can
load it with a ton of applications that
Center on fitness but sadly this still
needs work also these third-party
applications require you to be connected
to the phone in order to work or don't
take advantage of features like the
optical heart rate sensor when you do or
the GPS for that matter leaving this
watch a step II kind of the likes of
other products like the Fitbit surge for
example that said of you're a runner
there is a lot to love about the moto
360 sport motorola has extended its
proprietary moto body fitness
application to now support running in a
big way first of all it works without
the need of the phone which is awesome
and since this is Android wear you do
get four gigabytes of storage to sync
music along with you the separate
running module was designed to track
your run whether you're doing so indoors
through the built-in pedometer or
outdoors through the GPS you can either
set mileage or time goals before you
start or you can simply go for a quick
start and hit the road weird of warning
though that quick start module currently
doesn't catch up with you as competing
watches do
we had a few runs with horrendous
differences in mileage mainly because
the watch never caught on to the GPS
signal at first we thought we had a bad
review unit and tested a replacement but
it turned out that the issue was the
mode alone simply make sure to wait for
the watch to pick up GPS signal first
and then go for your run once all that
is said and done or you are really good
to go
the any light display is probably to
them for regular use and the ambient
light sensor is rather aggressive as
well but when you're on the road you're
gonna like what you see I simply love
how the always-on mode turns the watch's
display black and white while you run
making sunlight only enhance the
visibility of your stats in the process
this watch is also one of the few if not
the only running watches that actively
detects your heart rate zone on the
watch phase helping you either reduce
your pace or speed up if you're
interested in either fat burning or
improving your physical condition
pausing your run is also a simple
DoubleTap on the display which is
awesome on a touch display since you
don't have to worry about your hands
being wet and once you end your run
you're treated to a very detailed
summary of how it went
the summary also allows you to calibrate
the run of your ran indoors though that
calibration won't work outdoors so again
make sure the GPS is locked before you
start you'd think all the activity would
kill the watch's battery and even here
motorola did a great job
an average 5 mile run and then a day of
moderate to heavy use usually leaves me
with around 30% of battery life at the
end of the day which is the usual for
Android wear nowadays it's just sad that
the Moto 360 sport only caters to
runners at the moment and that's mainly
because of all the additions that the
company has made even to the Moto body
application on the phone still motorola
claims to extend functionality to other
workouts in the near future and if we
were to judge these by what we're seeing
right now with the running application
I'd say it's worth the wait
overall I feel that Motorola did a good
startup job with the Moto 360 sports the
company could have simply played it's
cool launched a couple of silicon bands
for the standard Moto 360 and fitted
with a G
yes but only a runner would understand
how important it is to not run with such
a heavy watch so I feel that the Moto
360 sport does have a niche for it you
might feel that $299 is rather steep for
a fitness watch that only does running
good but the watch is priced accordingly
if you compare it to your average Garmin
SmartWatch that will most likely only
serve you for running and a few other
limited tasks where the Moto 360 sport
wins is that it runs Android wear
meaning that there's promise that you'll
soon get more for that same amount of
money folks just like in the case of the
Moto 360 sport we've got more episodes
