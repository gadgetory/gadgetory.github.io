pocket
calm and this is the video I'm bought
the verizon branded samsung SCH i 760 i
just received the F FedEx yesterday so
let's get started here do the FedEx
packaging and we have the verizon
wireless box this is a windows mobile 6
professional device which means touch
screen and pocket pc OS it has Wi-Fi and
bluetooth and runs on the verizon
wireless cdma ev-do network what makes
this device quite interesting is the
slide-out keyboard which is has full
it's a full qwerty keyboard as well as
the numeric pad on the front of the
device crack it open here get our
standard selection of manuals a CD with
the user's manual a Windows Mobile
professional CD with activesync 4.5 for
windows XP as well as windows mobile
device center for Vista and the verizon
access manager software for your pc so
we have a wall charger with a samsung
connector USB cable with the same type
of connector we have a couple batteries
one the thinner one is a 1040 milliamp
battery and the thicker one is a 1500
milliamp battery and really there's not
too too much difference between the two
so for about fifty percent more capacity
it'll be interesting how I end up using
these batteries and the device itself
peel off the protective cover here and
you can see the numeric keypad on the
front the buttons are angled and that
will be real interesting to see how easy
they are to use the keyboard slide out
to the side here so we're going to stick
the extended battery in here and compare
it to some other familiar devices got a
ipod iphone here from apple and it's
about the same size overall although the
SCH i760 is obviously thicker because of
the slide-out keyboard I have a tmobile
wing AKA HTC Harold which also has a
slideout keyboard and the screens are of
the same size they're about the same
thickness in the keyboards are the
herald has a little larger keyboard it
seems looking out but obviously no
numeric keypad on the front so I'm going
to charge this windows mobile device up
and see what it can do and i'll be back
with a lot more bye for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
