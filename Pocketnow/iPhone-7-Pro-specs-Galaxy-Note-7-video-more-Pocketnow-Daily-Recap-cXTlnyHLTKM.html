vids are boring see oh man I can't
imagine the movie that's gonna be worse
those fellows ha ha don't look at me I
didn't give it the name came here for
thumbs down only for this time it'll be
better you know there are alleys
invented for people like you seriously
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hi I'm editing that aw this is
PocketNow and this is the bargain out
daily recap the last week
so on Monday we talked about the
probability of three iPhones being
announced as there was a fake aid that
showed us there was a plus the iPhone 7
and the iphone 7 pro I asked you what do
you think about three devices being
launched we had 880 comments I'm pretty
sure that these leaked photos of the
iPhone 7 are fake why else would it say
S on the back so the rumors are that
these devices are actually going to be
the iPhone 6s II you never know
Steve Jobs spent his whole life
realizing customer needs simplicity and
look at where Apple is headed now yes
Apple equals new Samsung I could not
agree more buddy o mine Apple releasing
three or more phones a year because as a
customer I want more choices my choices
aren't necessarily the best most of the
time because they either dilute features
or you don't get everything I remember
the old days of the BlackBerry where you
got Wi-Fi on one phone but bluetooth on
the other and so you have to pick
between one of these that's really the
palm when you get too many choices
sometimes you just want a phone that has
everything which is actually neither
iPhone on Tuesday we saw some code names
and apparently we only have two iPhones
I asked you after the rumours of the
three iPhones would you be okay with
just two no plus variant just the iPhone
7 and the iphone 7 pro we have 477
comments quality is better than quantity
not necessarily in the case of smart
phones especially with companies like
Apple where quality is pretty much part
of what you're getting or at least
what's intended versus what matters with
the new iPhone I will not pay more than
what the current prices are or this
fanboy is changing ships at a time like
today when you've got really hot devices
like the Galaxy s7 galaxy s7 edge HTC 10
it's really hard to pay all that money
for an iPhone trust me
guess having two phones through every
count the SE is better than having five
or 10 two different galaxies released
each year keep things simple and less
confusing exactly that was my point with
the previous comment I think
that less is more I would rather have a
good product that has everything that
the consumer needs then to have to
choose that's just me
on Wednesday the topic was the galaxy
notes have an edge there was a leaked
video very blurry and I asked you what
do you think of this device we had 606
comments why is it that everyone who
leaks something has a terrible camera oh
my god I think this is the best comment
of the year like seriously yes leakers
come on get a better camera you can do
that no7 looks good but so what I want
mine on edge version well why don't you
buy the Galaxy Note 5 you can buy it
right now I just need a better battery
life not a razor sharp phone that will
cut my hand those must be some fragile
hands but I do get your point with the
battery dude I agree so on Thursday we
have the first high quality photo of the
Galaxy Note 7 somebody finally got a
good camera and I asked you what do you
think do you like this Ben phone that we
saw or we prefer a beefier phone with a
bigger battery
we had 659 comments more battery and
more powerful phone is it too much to
ask for
I guess that Samsung lately feels that
way battery battery battery we've
complained about this a thousand times
and we still didn't get what we want
actually not gonna agree with that the
Galaxy s7 edge probably has the best
battery of the year in my opinion so hey
so long as it's that good I'll be fine
Archer battery is better than super slim
phones yes I do feel that way I mean if
you want a phone that's really for
productivity and you really want to
replace a note pad that does not have a
battery with a phone then you really
don't have to worry about the battery
with the phone I think that that's
essential and finally on Friday I asked
you because we saw some leaks of three
gigabytes of RAM on the iphone 7 pro in
addition to professional-grade
waterproofing not water resistance would
that make you choose an iPhone instead
of anything else this year we had 1456
comments gotta love that sequential
number Apple so-called waterproof phone
will be water resistant it not proof
it's just Apple being Apple calling it
waterproof I think Apple would look for
a fancier name than that I value shed a
proof own more than any water-resistant
specifications I do agree but that's not
gonna happen I need
soon at least I don't think it's gonna
happen and with this technology
especially when you depend on glass well
this thing's better when it does but
they are usually late as well and I
would rather that we've seen companies
like LG and Samsung push the bar of
Technology with some product some of
these products have been successful but
the problem is then most of these
products were full of gimmicks at the
beginning and then came apple with the
way to fix it I think the only time that
they didn't get it right was with the
Apple watch so I do prefer a company to
think it's time to do it right and to
give me something that's half they can
have me forced to put up with that for
two years while my contract glass but I
do get your point that's it for the
pocket house daily recap thank you very
