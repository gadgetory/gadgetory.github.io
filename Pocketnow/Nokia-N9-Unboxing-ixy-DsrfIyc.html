pocketnow.com and today we're pretty
excited because we're going to unbox the
brand new Nokia n9 now this phone is
interesting from several points of view
number one it is the first pure touch
smartphone on the market which means
there are no physical nor capacitive
buttons on the phone number two it
doesn't run Symbian it doesn't run
Windows Phone 7 it runs Mego and Mego is
a platform you might not be familiar
with and number three if the rumors turn
out to be true it's going to be this
hardware that we're going to see Windows
Phone 7.5 run on next week when Nakia
hopefully announces the 800 Siri which
is going to be looking exactly like the
Nokia n9 so without any further ado
let's get to the unboxing
so what we have here is basically the
classic Macheath packaging all of the
new Nokia phones come in these blue
boxes we have a Nakia branding on the
left side some text at the back again
it's the Nokia n9 branding on the side
and of course a huge picture of the
phone on the front of the box but let's
get it open and see what we have here
let's put this aside we have some
initial documentation we got the phone
here which we'll put through the side
just for a second let's see what else is
in the box we have what appears to be a
silicone case which is always nice yes
indeed it is a silicone case which snaps
on the back of the phone it will
protected and it's cut out for the
camera for the flash and of course for
the connectors it's always good to have
some protection for your gadgets what
else is in the box we've got some
initial literature and QuickStart guide
we'll just put this to the side too
we've got a standard micro USB syncing
and charging cable which is pretty
standard these days and in the European
Union the micro USB is the standard when
it comes to device charging then we have
a charger which is of course with the
European plug it's rounded as you can
see but it has the USB port which plugs
in right here so you can charge it it's
pretty small and lightweight by the way
and of course we have the obligatory
headphones which are not noise
cancelling earbuds but normal phones and
they have what appears to be a clickable
button on them of course we have the
microphone right here so you can use
this button to answer cool and end it
ok enough with the plastics and the
papers let's take a look at the phone
itself and
it's here it's the Nokia and mine let's
get this thing open right there it's
looking really really good
and the feeling which you have when you
hold the phone is excellent because it
feels like you are actually grabbing a
slab of plastic but it doesn't feel
plastic you by the way it's got these
rounded edges which make it look really
really good in the hand and of course
we'll get you the hardware in our next
video but just take a look at this huge
black glass on the front I mean this
phone has a new design it looks really
good
this in particular runs me go but we're
pretty excited to see Windows from 7.5
mango on this type of hardware so this
