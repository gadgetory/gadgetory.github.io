today's video is about the honor play we
are here in Berlin on August 30 2018 and
we attended the announcement of the
brand-new honour play this is a very
budget-friendly phone with a lot of
horsepower under the hood designed for
gamers this is TK and this is PocketNow
on XDA the show was held here at Berlin
a day ahead of Eva the main star of the
show of course was the honour play
although they did cover the honor magic
too as well in the event we've given us
a little bit of a teaser there's two
variants of the there's the player
edition and the standard colors all of
them are basically running the same
hardware the exception is that the
player edition have some aesthetics
basically differences on the outside
which make them look a little bit unique
so overall if you want it to look really
cool you could definitely go with one of
these guys for 349 euros or you can go
with the standard edition ones for 329
euros of course all of this is going to
be coming using the same specification
we're talking about the ki-rin 970 we're
talking four gigs of ram 64 gigs of
internal storage all of course
expandable via microSD the other benefit
of course we're talking about the GPU
turbo that's built in no update required
we also have the 4d shock mechanism
that's built into this so that you can
actually feel when you're playing the
game currently only optimize for pub G
but for the most part it definitely
elevates the experience while the main
city gaming on a mobile phone all of
this is supported by a thirty seven
hundred fifty million battery that's
going to help you not only play for a
long time but also recharges very
quickly using the Huawei USB charging
all in all this was definitely a very
exciting launch event I want to say
thank you to our honor for allowing us
to check out the event and of course
getting some hands-on time with the
honor play keep it here with us for all
coverage that we have here from Aoife
this is TK I want to say thank you very
much for the support and I'll see you
guys in the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
