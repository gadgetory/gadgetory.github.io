one of the most exciting app
announcements we've had in quite a while
if you've been using the instagrams
chances are pretty good you've been
using this terrible old beta app which
is woefully behind the Instagram curve
and and really you should be using six
tag if this is what you've been using
instead but for Windows 10 Windows 10
for mobile we finally got word that the
Instagram beta that supports Windows 10
is finally available you can get it from
the Microsoft Windows app store I'm
going to take a second to sign-in now
you don't get to see my password it
looks like we've got the first official
big-time port from an iOS app so thank
you for using Instagram windows beta if
something isn't working get feedback
okay that's great thanks Instagram and
we're gonna slide through here scrolling
performance is really choppy on this
Lumia 950 but everything is in place in
the way that we would expect to see it
from using the iOS version of this app
so this is on home if I go to my search
options we need your permission yes and
we can explore posts again lots of
little twitches and lots of little
hanging moments they can go into people
that have liked my photos and I'll just
tap on my most recent pic got some
decent likes going on in this macro shot
that I took okay and then let me see my
stat so this is my actual page here and
man yeah it really does pull this slow
I'm going to come up to my little gear
icon here and see so I can find Facebook
friends find contacts and in my profile
all of these settings look like they're
super iOS II you know real quick let's
just see what it looks like when we want
to capture or upload information oh we
do have support for video so that's
pretty exciting but it's taken a sec to
find my library no there's nothing going
on here let me back out again oh dang it
lost it alright let's try that again so
we're gonna pull this so that's one of
the most recent videos I shot it
it looks like it already has support for
oh nice it does it already has support
for wide wide screen shots if you want
to upload sixteen by nine I can go ahead
and stop that so we just want to do take
a photo we can just take a photo if we
just want to do video we can just do
video let me go back in and see if I've
got a picture on this oh I've got old
pics of my little baby girl on here nope
the app just crashed all right let me
try and get back into that one more time
Instagram has locked up so bad I'm gonna
have to reboot this phone now and start
fresh all right so I've rebooted the
phone and I've got Instagram back up and
running again and this is never gonna
get old where every single time you
start the app it's going to ask you to
give you feedback so I might give it
feedback that once I hit okay it
shouldn't keep asking me to give them
feedback all right so I want to see if
we have all the same options for tools
it looks like we will but I just need to
select any photo that I can kind of get
my hands on here and I think I just
crashed the app again going to try and
pull a photo from my library oh good
thank you for using Instagram Veda if
you know if anything's not working I'll
totally give you a shout Microsoft
that's awesome
so I'm just gonna see if I can take a
photo perfect alright so I took a photo
of this crappy layout on my desk and up
here we've got our different options so
here are all the different filters
Wow the filters take a long time to
scroll and scan through if I want to do
any kind of HDR is that for the lunians
okay we can get out of that and lastly
individual options and controls
brightness contrast where is let's see
oh we don't have structure alright
there's no structure setting that's
usually the one that takes the longest
to load up on an android device let's
just see so I've got contrast so let's
see what happens with contrast those
changes take a lot oh look at that look
at that lag oh that's ugly
discard that at it the Qualcomm 808 in
here isn't a slouch it should be able to
hang with this n it crashed again fired
it back up and I'm going to thank you
for using Instagram windows beta that's
awesome
yeah we've been getting reports that
this wasn't actually ported over from
the iPhone using the project Island wood
that it was using Facebook's own
algorithms or software for porting over
piece of software and that's the I don't
know if that's contributing to some of
the stability issues that we're seeing
but so far for right now I'm going to
say that if you're still looking for a
high-quality Instagram experience it's
fun to play with this beta and it is
really exciting to finally see some
official update but this is way
not-ready-for-prime-time but like I said
this is progress this is positive
momentum hopefully at some point we'll
be able to get this really sleek and
smooth you know loading that we see on
the iPhone where when you try to upload
an image it doesn't crash on you as
always folks thanks so much for watching
be sure to subscribe for more rambling
app tours like these and make sure you
hit that thumbs up button to give us a
little extra positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag nail you
can chat me up on Instagram and some
gadget guy hey crash to get to scrolling
uh and I will catch you all on the next
video
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
