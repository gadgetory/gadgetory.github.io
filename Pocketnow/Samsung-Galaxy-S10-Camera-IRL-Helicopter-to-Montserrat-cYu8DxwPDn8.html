brand do yourself a favor if you're ever
offered a helicopter ride you say yes so
Samsung is calling their new Galaxy S 10
their pro grade camera that it's capable
of seeing what your eyes can see to that
I say there's really only one way to
find out and we've got a helicopter
right to prove it I'm high middle uni
with pocket now from Barcelona MWC 2019
let's go check it out
so Samsung was nice enough to offer a
helicopter ride two months of that and
well I have never been on a helicopter
ride or two months of that and I think
this is the best way to showcase what
this camera can do but keep in mind this
is not a full review it's just our
experience so far
this is a beautiful place called gamble
master that we are literally 45 minutes
from Barcelona 45 minutes from moon set
all right this is the midpoint we're
gonna take a bus from here up oh my god
I did so much video and photography
testing right now dynamic range has
improved dramatically it's been the big
Achilles heel with Android phones and my
god the galaxy s 10 plus does amazing
and yeah that's super steady shot that's
even better
yes this place is real and I don't know
if you've noticed this but I've pretty
much recorded most of the b-roll of this
trip on the galaxy s 10 it's just the
way this camera handles color it's yes
it is very warm but it's just the the
Cauvery production and dynamic range is
just so good and this place is flat-out
gorgeous so one of the most interesting
things about using the galaxy s 10 plus
for video is the super steady shot
mainly because it uses the wide-angle
camera instead of the primary usually if
you use any phone for video what it'll
do is crop in this one actually crops
out for it and I find that to be genius
because it's pretty much like pulling a
GoPro it uses that extra space to be
able to stabilize the shot and it does a
very good job I really like it though
one of the things is it is currently
limited to 1080p so even if you set the
camera to record in 4k it'll switch back
to 1080p at the moment you turn on the
stabilizer
my enemies are stebih I'm going to win a
guide we don't have much time but we'll
try to see everything in montage okay
now we are here another square
model is in the middle of the natural
path its 720 meters above the sea level
and then from here we see most of the
buildings of Montserrat and one of the
buildings and we'll visit the first one
is the church we'll go there and we'll
visit the church okay in the church in
where is the Black Madonna the next
building the one with the balconies is
where the mums leave the monastery and
the monastery was founded in 10:25 we
are here to celebrate the Millennium now
one of the coolest parts about the
samsung galaxy s 10 plus is the
versatility in the amount of cameras
that you get in the package
specifications are definitely key here
we have a 12 megapixel primary camera at
variable aperture between F 1.5 and F
2.4 a wide-angle camera at 16 megapixels
with F 2.2 aperture in 123 degrees of
field of view and then we've got a 12
megapixel telephoto camera at F 2.4
aperture and software has also seen some
major improvements we've got a better
user interface I consider it to be more
practical I love how it navigates
between cameras
you also have 10 new scenes in AI which
total is now 30 so definitely the camera
does a better job at adapting to
whatever scene you throw at it
all right we've talked about the
hardware we've talked about the software
how are the photos in a word all right
this is fantastic it's versatile it's
practical its really really adaptable in
about every situation that we've thrown
at it here and low-light photography has
seen some improvements I feel that
Samsung has made some positive changes
when compared to the s-line plus I feel
that it handles moving subjects a little
better there's still more work to be
done here but highlights are great and
colors are just really good obviously we
need more time to test this phone our
full review will provide more details on
other features like for example slow-mo
video etc as I actually did film some
slow-mo clips and for some reason I'm
having issues pulling them into my
computer and that I do notice some
improvements in portrait photography
live photos now looks more natural than
its predecessors and obviously you have
the advantage that you could just switch
that off if you don't like the result
you've got a very interesting case with
selfie photos where Samsung is offering
two angles but they're actually from the
same camera when it's just the crop for
those of you that want a wider shot or a
tighter shot you can pick from either I
do love the performance I do feel that
this 10 megapixel camera at the front is
doing far better than its predecessor
I've heard a lot of people question the
purpose of a telephoto camera on a
smartphone street photography you don't
think of it just as a zoom lens think
about the fact that it gives you a
better crop in certain situations where
you're actually looking for a detail
from afar instead of having to zoom in
digitally and not necessarily getting
that same amount of quality now
seriously love the fact that Samsung
made the move for the wide-angle and the
coolest part it doesn't matter what
galaxy has ten you get whether it's the
S 10 ES 10 RS 10 plus the white angle
isn't put it in all of them it provides
such an epic view of your shot if you're
in a place like this and you want to get
the whole shot in one photo the only way
is to use the ultra wide man and the
company does a really good job at
avoiding distortion obviously I know
that a lot of you are not fans of AI
photography you can't switch this off
and there is also pro mode available
actually I'm shocked at the amount of
modes available on this phone and it
just makes the experience a lot more
practical I think the best way to
describe this camera overall is
versatile seriously and speaking of
versatility our Samsung Galaxy S 10
coverage is made possible by deep brand
if you want to avoid those fingerprint
smudges and pimp out your new Galaxy S
10 plus D brands new swarm skin is
fantastic and of course that's just one
of many options they have available to
cater to your tastes all the link of the
description below to choose the skin
that matches your style most so remember
two very important things have you ever
offered a trip in a chopper you take it
and if you're ever offered to come to
mow satellite do it as well
even if you're not religious this is
such a beautiful place definitely one of
my top 10 places that I've visited
and the experience with the Galaxy S ten
has been fantastic so far let us know
