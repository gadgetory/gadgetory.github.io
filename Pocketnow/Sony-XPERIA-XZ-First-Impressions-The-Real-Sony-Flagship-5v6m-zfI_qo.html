first look at the Xperia XE and we're
already happy to see a few improvements
over the last Xperia we reviewed general
reactions to the X performance were
pretty underwhelming and the XE looks to
address several of our complaints we're
not doing the full unboxing thing here
as this wasn't really a sealed unit when
it arrived it didn't have a charger in
the box but we do have some early
thoughts to share first of all we're
digging the subtle design touches and
updates wrapping edges and rounding off
corners this is still a monolithic slab
look but it feels like a fresh take on
what we've seen from previous Sony's
it's repetitive to say but we really do
enjoy Sony engineering these phones are
sharp clean modern and professional the
XZ continues to reinforce that opinion
on first glance this gadget feels better
pieced together than the X performance
it replaces our review unit which had
issues around the SIM card tray
none of the trim on this device is
separating from the main phone body but
we're not sure what this panel is for
perhaps additional clearance for radio
reception it feels a little different
than the rest of the phone back but
maybe we should invest in some of those
fancy picks for scratch tests now
probably not the tech specs are
well-worn Xperia territory the screen
size increases over the X performance
nowI 5.2 inch diagonal but the
resolution stays the same at 1080p we've
got a Qualcomm 820 on tap with three
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
storage the whole affair powered by a
2900 milliamp hour battery stereo
speakers bookend the front faced with a
13 megapixel camera for selfies up top
the rear of the phone holds a 23
megapixel shooter with a new combo of
sensors which we talked about after this
phone was announced out at Aoife this
year
the right side of the phone holds the
usual Xperia power button a lower
mounted volume rocker and a dedicated
camera button all phones should have
dedicated camera buttons the headphone
jacks up top and new for this product
line a USB C port on the bottom of the
phone ooh-la-la
the setup was fast enough first boot was
quick Wi-Fi scanning was
fully fast and we only got nagged by one
screen to sign up for Sony services well
done there a once we're delivered to the
home screens we're happy to see the
default wallpaper isn't that fuchsia
mess that previous ex phones have
featured this is a much more calming
blue wallpaper a performance update
greeted us after the set up and we're
off and running the software also very
familiar for folks who have used a
recent Sony phone there are lots of
little areas for search like in the app
drawer swiping down on a home screen
even for Sony's additions navigation
through notifications and settings is
familiar and there doesn't seem to be a
lot of blow pre-installed some
value-added software like AVG Spotify
and Amazon but nothing too egregious
eating up your storage and that's about
where we should leave this hands-on but
these first impressions are always so
dull we've spent less than 20 hours with
the phone there's not a lot of info or
experiences to share yet instead let's
play a little game I'm going to make
some predictions about this phone given
what we know about Sony phones we've
reviewed in the past and we'll see how
right I was during the full review first
two Hardware issues are going to really
bug me 1 this phone does not have a
fingerprint sensor this is an obnoxious
omission for how many people have gotten
used to unlocking their phones with
fingerprint sensors and 2 Sony phones
are still super aggressive about
rebooting once the sim card tray is
pulled a mild annoyance for most but
there are plenty of times that I will
need to swap a memory card
I'm guessing this will be a phenomenally
good camera sensor but I'm worried this
camera app will get in the way of great
hardware likewise for audio these
speakers will compare well against many
stereo speaker phones but I'm guessing
the headphone jack will probably land
somewhere in galaxy s7 territory lastly
I expect battery life will probably fall
slightly behind the galaxy s7 given the
difference in battery capacity and
display technology but any improvement
over the X performance will be a welcome
upgrade so there you have folks my
predictions for the Xperia XZ drop me a
comment down below with what penalties I
should face if I get most of these wrong
if you come up with something really
creative
maybe we'll use it for the full review
