since it was announced back in March but
shammies me--for has also garnered a lot
of attention for its build quality high
in specs and low price can it compete
with HTC's flagship for 2014 I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the xiaomi me for versus the
HTC One m8 before we get too far into
this comparison we want to thank 28
mobile for supplying us with a me for
for review you can purchase your very
own me for or browse dozens of other
handsets for sale by clicking the link
in the description below or going to 28
mobile comm both the One m8 and me for
were designed and built with incredible
precision the two of the best looking
and filling Android handsets around
today no question about it
still their designs are quite different
the me four from Xiaomi has a more boxy
industrial design its core and trim is a
machine stainless steel it's like a
strange balance between the iPhone 5s
and Lumia icon undoubtedly the worst
part of the me for its design is the
glossy plastic on the backside it makes
the phone
unnecessarily slick and contradicts a
steel chassis the One m8 as many of you
already know has a curved design which
doesn't exactly help when using the
phone while it's laying on a flat
surface but the image casing is almost
entirely metal and the backside just
sort of fades into the sides in front
this makes the device look and feel
thinner and lighter than the me--for
which actually isn't true the m8 is
marginally taller wider thicker and
heavier than the me--for despite these
differences both have chamfered edges on
their metal trim and have similar
placement of certain buttons and ports
around their edges and both have that
certain heft which seems to imply great
build quality the major difference in
design is speaker placement the one who
mates dual front-facing boomsound
speakers are positioned up front
while the main for single speaker is
found along the bottom edge internally
these two phones have very few
similarities and the me--for seems to
have the upper hand both have the
Snapdragon 801 chipset with quad-core
Krait 400s though the m8 is clocked at
2.3 gigahertz in the me 4 at 2.5
gigahertz but the m8 has 2 gigabytes of
RAM 32 gigabytes of fixed storage with a
micro SD card slot for up to 128
gigabytes more it has two rear image
sensors for its duo
camera setup 4.1 and 2 megapixels the
latter for breeding depth information
and the front camera is 5 megapixels
finally the integrated battery has a
rating of 2600 milliamp hours the before
has an additional gigabyte of RAM to
work with either 16 or 64 gigabytes of
storage with no option to expand and a
13 megapixel rear camera its front
facing camera is 8 megapixels and it has
a 3,000 80 million power battery
connectivity options are similar as well
both have Wi-Fi AC infrared and
Bluetooth 4.0 but the m8 has NFC while
the May 4 does not but let's talk
displays both come with 5-inch 1080p
displays the m8 is an S LCD 3 while the
me fours is an IPS LCD densities of
course are the exact same 441 pixels per
inch though you may feel you're getting
more bang for your buck out of the me 4
since the m8 has on-screen buttons which
take up a fair amount of space this
ultimately comes down to preference the
clarity color reproduction contrast and
brightness azar very similar however the
me fours display is noticeably warmer
than the MAS we prefer the display on
the m8 as it appears more vibrant and
natural choosing Hardware between these
two is difficult on build quality and
finish we give the upper hand to the m8
it has a slightly nicer display and feel
smaller even though it's actually larger
but if you're purely after
specifications the me 4 takes the cake
as far as software goes both devices
ship with Android KitKat 4.4.2 but to no
surprise the software looks completely
different
the me 4 comes running me UI 5 and like
most versions of Android we're used to
me UI doesn't ship with an application
drawer though of course you can add one
if you like and this Chinese variant
doesn't come with Google Play services
pre-installed you have to add that tube
we're told other global versions of
Xiaomi phones come with Google
frameworks and vetted and we're hopeful
that the global version of the me--for
will as well but me why is all about
customization you can download free or
premium themes from the dedicated theme
store these are heavily customised
and can completely change the appearance
of your phone's UI the lockscreen home
screens fonts colors notification shade
Settings app etc you also get some added
features like do not disturb guest mode
and the ability to choose how you're
setting struggles are displayed since 6
on the m8 is one of our favourite custom
versions of Android to date
it looks a lot like since five which
shipped on last year's m7 but it's new
and improved blinkfeed one of the staple
features has more channels larger tiles
and it's more useful than ever
quick toggles and the notification shade
or user-definable but still strongly
resemble stock Android and in the
Settings app you'll find tiny little
tweaks that truly make sense a great
experience like subtle themes motion
gestures and boom sound settings motion
gestures are one of our favorite
features of since 6 if we're to choose
between the two versions of Android
since 6 would definitely get our vote
new UI isn't bad at all it's just
different and doesn't feel as polished
with snapdragon 801 is inside both
handsets slice through everyday
activities without a hitch scrolling
pinch zooming and launching applications
are all smooth and instantaneous lag is
practically non-existent and we've
experienced very few performance hiccups
with either device that said the One m8
fault a tad snappier in most situations
synthetic benchmarks seem to corroborate
that finding as the m8 consistently
scored higher than the me for again we
don't put much faith in benchmarks so
take those for what you will considering
the me--for isn't optimized for use here
in the States and we're comparing it to
over eyes an m8 voice quality and
network speed comparisons don't really
mean a whole lot check out our reviews
of the m8 for notes on how it performs
on various networks in the States and
stay tuned for our full review of the
meat for next week for more on its call
quality and network performance we still
haven't had a chance to really put the
meat for battery to the test so once
again check the full review next week
for more on that as well but we will say
we've been really impressed with its
stamina thus far the One m8 and our
months with the device has put up some
decent numbers in stamina as well about
a day of usage but we typically need to
plug in during the late afternoon to
last well into the night without a doubt
the One m8 takes the cake with speaker
quality its sound is more crisp and
several times louder
in fact the m8 almost completely drowned
out the sound of the me--for while
playing media side-by-side it was short
peppy highlight reel made almost
automatically which give the whole thing
new Lyceus into a short peppy highlight
reel made almost automatically which
gave the whole thing new life
despite having a higher resolution
camera the me for actually doesn't take
notably better photos than the m8 in
fact of almost every picture taken with
both we preferred the m8 camera it
provided more balanced true-to-life
photos whereas the me 4 was low in
contrast and often aired on the warm
side the m8 was more prone to
overexposing and it obviously doesn't
have nearly as much resolution to work
with and it appears as if the m8 uses
some artificial sharpening effects to
make up for its lack of resolution
either way its photos look better than
the me force pretty consistently
especially in low-light the me 4 is a
hot mess in low-light photography the m8
isn't the best we've seen but it
generally captured far more light in the
auto mode and colors don't seem to lose
nearly as much saturation as they did
with the me 4 and if we're talking
viewfinder software hands down it goes
to sense 6 the sense camera is fantastic
the same goes for the front cameras the
mah front camera is 5 megapixels while
the me force is 8 megapixels high
resolution doesn't help them move or
take better selfies though the colors
are dull in the images with the front
camera are washed out selfies taken with
the m8 are actually quite nice so which
mart phone do we choose quite obviously
the m8 that's not to say the me 4 is a
bad phone quite the contrary
but based on availability hardware
software and performance the m8 is a
more complete package multimedia
playback is noticeably better on the m8
the camera is more consistent and so as
performance the me--for isn't a bad
choice though we'd wait for a global
version to ship with Google Play before
we'd buy one ourselves the most simple
way to put it is the One m8 feels more
refined but shammies me--for isn't far
behind
