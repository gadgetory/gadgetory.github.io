there's no tomorrow I know I should
drink like there's no next week he
always apologizes for the noise that
nobody can hear but him and find let's
just switch things a bit i'll give you
the no as in no apology at 53 seconds
was expecting you to say WTF WTF that's
right it's that time of the week i am
high net event up this is pocket now and
this is the point out daily recap the
last week we started off monday talking
about the gear s2 its price points and
when to expect it and i asked you if you
currently have a SmartWatch or if you're
planning on getting one we had 654
comments we start with moto 360 i just
can't get away from that timeless design
and neither can i using gear s and it's
just an okay experience battery life
kind of sucks on it and that's the story
of pretty much every SmartWatch the
experience of kind of okay and the
battery life sucks smartwatches are
still gimmick as of now until they get
some serious functionality and a decent
battery life it will always be an
unneeded gimmick and you're right it's
an unneeded product but it's not
necessarily a gimmick in the case of
certain smartwatches like for example
away Android wear handles notifications
and for example the way the Apple watch
handles fitness I just wish we could
merge them together tuesday we were
talking about some rumors of the huawei
nexus we heard of a 128 gigabyte option
and i asked you of more storage would
entice you to choose between this one or
the LG Nexus 5x we have 318 comments we
heard from one of them saying drink two
gigs as adequate for me but the price
needs to reflect the specifications and
that is the case for most smartphones
but it's odd right now you want to get
32 gigabytes you actually have to get a
flagship and it's just said that these
are not expandable Huawei metal design
and fingerprint scanner plus stock
Android awesome phone I get it that
regardless if you get the storage or not
you'll care about it and true but I
would care about the storage the Nexus
5x sounds almost perfect judging by the
rumors but they better have a 64 here by
an option at the very least or I won't
be buying one and I guess you will not
be buying one then dude sorry once they
asked you if you cared if the galaxy s7
had a Snapdragon 820 or an Exynos
processor as the rumors are that Samsung
is working on a Snapdragon 820 processor
with Qualcomm that's rather unique we
have fun
9 comments we start with does it matter
anymore Samsung is that a fantastic job
they want the ship war this year they
haven't necessarily wanted but they
figured out a way to optimize everything
and that was a really good thing Oh
personal prefer if the s7 came with
annexin oats that way Sampson could
better optimize the phone we can also
hold Samsung solely responsible for any
issues as well you know it's funny in
the past Snapdragon processors on galaxy
phones would perform better this is the
first time that we don't have a way to
compare so it's really hard to know if
that Snapdragon 820 would have been
better but we do know why Samsung did
not choose the Snapdragon 810 which
would have been the case I want to see
more alternatives to Snapdragon arising
and doesn't do us any good to have call
come as a complete monopoly and I love
your comment this is so true in the past
I was like you know what's wrong with
Qualcomm lately but you're right it's
great for there to be competition out
there for these companies to drive their
prices down and for us to get better
options on Thursday pebble surprises us
with a pebble time round and I asked you
what you thought of this new round
SmartWatch we have 434 comments we start
with pebble time Oreo I guess you don't
like it hello round is not that horrible
but it's two days of battery life is a
major turnoff and yes I agree one of the
things that I like the most about the
original pebble that I owned was battery
life and it is rather disappointing that
we have to compromise on this for a
design that's not really any better the
pebble time round has huge vessels 250
dollar price tag only two days of
battery life why not just spend 50 bucks
more and get a moto 360 2015 you're
right dude and now that Android wear
works on the iphone then my god what
would be the point of the pebble now i
do like the pebble time steal a little
but the pebble time around my god that
bezel is just insane i love to back
pebble they're doing an amazing job
don't get me wrong it's just that this
design is really off finally Friday was
iphone 6s day I asked you if you ordered
one or were planning on doing so we had
889 comments we start with watching on
my success definitely impressed with
from a 5s upgrade and no wonder dude
that's major upgrade i worthy upgrade
from the 6x plus the only thing that's
cool is force 3d touch which doesn't
appeal enough to
need to make me upgrade from the
successor sex plus and i agree with you
up to the point where i haven't upgraded
my iphone 6 I was about to say I haven't
upgraded my six but that doesn't sound
right but you get my point I don't want
to sell me kidney i'm waiting for the
Nexus 5x and you make a solid point the
iphone is a premium phone we've got good
flagships out there but a lot of
companies are coming up with great
alternatives for 300 bucks lately the
1+2 we've got the nexus 5x we've got
great phones from oboe and Motorola so
it becomes even more difficult now to
want to consider an iphone it just
becomes a fanboy istic thing now in my
case I'm with a g4 right now from LG and
I really don't want to switch I like to
run enough but I guess that's not the
case for everyone that's it for the
bargain i'll daily recap thank you very
