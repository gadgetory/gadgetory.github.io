Adam Lane I we have Shannon from for
today and she is going to walk us
through the ford sync system by
Microsoft today she's going to show us
how the music and the phone system works
Shannon
you can send a receive phone calls
main menu
phone is by correct phone please say a
command called Belfort
calling go for it
and you can also send them receive text
main menu phone please say a command
read message hello doesn't think great
laughing out loud have fun today as in
new york auto show see you later had
some kisses from microsoft auto
play your music
name
user device you must be please say a
command play artist Toby Keith
playing otters Toby Keith
so this Microsoft Sync system as Shannon
explain to Adam myself earlier a lot of
the controls are used by the by the
steering wheel command you just push the
steering wheel button right here and you
say your command one of the things that
we just learned about the text messaging
is there is some quick responses that
you can use whenever you get a text
message may be on it's just going to
show that again
the only unfortunate thing with this is
the controls for the text message is on
the on screen device only you can't use
the steering wheel commands so that
seems to be just a minor inconvenience
as far as usability on the device so
this has been show us how to access
address book I'm good too
and can you do that can you do a voice
man for the address but where do you
have to
obviously boys meant any voice phone
number
for me
like the request to me it'll go through
your phone
over here we have
here plug USB or an ipod or zune let's
zoom down there flash drive
and do we have also a audio jack there
is that led us on this get recorded
heart moment
okay all right well this has been raped
