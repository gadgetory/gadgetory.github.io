sidekick 4g from t-mobile and this is
the rebirth of the sidekick line so to
speak so we're going to have John from
t-mobile tell us a bit about it
connection all right well this is the
t-mobile sidekick 4g this is a like you
said a rebirth of a sidekick first
sidekick running on the android platform
first sidekick with a touchscreen and of
course the first sidekick with 4g
service so the first I could develop my
samsung rating your face great keyboard
that you know and love about Samsung
about about sidekick and we've got a
unique hinge mechanism to open the
screen now that's new to the sacker and
i right we had a swivel before and this
is kind of a new one I think I think
it's pretty cool though I mean really
sturdy construction you can see on the
back there you know we got a clean
interface over the Android platform is
running on android 2.2 and
some cool features I'd like to point out
is in messaging they're actually a group
texting feature or you can have multiple
people on the same story at kind of like
an email and text between that now look
to any other phone so start a multiple
persons right on here and everyone can
respond to it another cool feature on
this is loud texting where you can
actually have all your texts come to
come to your pc and attached to that way
as well so so yeah great messaging
device great you know access to all the
android marketplace apps seemed almost
like exporting and it looks pretty i'm
heavily skinned i noticed that the names
of the icons of the programs are
capitalized which i don't think i've
ever seen that on an android device
before climates a little bit easier to
read sure yeah yeah i think it's all
part of the interface and style design
mom is it possible for you to I shot the
browser real quick just so we did idea
of how it looks maybe I saw you had
speed test up on there if you can run
through that great short so in terms of
the browser
she got a pocket now yeah it's great my
favorite type
normal written and I think you can go to
the bottom and it'll do desktop yeah
one of one of the many conveniences we
offer our readers there you go okay so
this is on this is on 4G HSPA+ right now
I'm actually this device is a our second
device which offers 21 megamix capable
downloads so it's very fast and look at
the top story on there can there you go
can you read that for us please sidekick
4g on tmobile the cell for honor dollars
on a few dollars there you go play
independent all right so there we go and
then we'll do a quick speed test I can
tell you that you know
I silly hope we've got some great speeds
and that yeah there's a lot of Wireless
interference here so these aren't real
world tests necessarily hey there you go
maybe we got 27 megabits that ate really
strong performance there yeah that's
pretty impressive if you can see that
there that that's almost 10 megabits per
second owie just which switches a lot I
mean in my hotel my wife I'm getting one
maybe a little under 11 so yeah I wish I
had one of these things to tether to and
and this will have mobile hotspot
capabilities correct yeah so great
combination all right excellent oh yeah
that's the sidekick 4g all right thanks
a lot John I appreciate it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
