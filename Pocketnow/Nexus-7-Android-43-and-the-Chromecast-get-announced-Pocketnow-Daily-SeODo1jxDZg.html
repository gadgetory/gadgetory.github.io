refresh to the nexus 7 android 4.3 goes
official with a lot of enhancements and
apples quarter results are in with some
minor ups and downs I'm hi Marietta and
just go by the chromecast don't think
twice about it just go by the damn thing
this is pocket nail daily let's start
off with some non google related news
since that's pretty much going to take
the rest of the show sorry about that
Apple has just published their quarter
results and I'm not going to bore you
with the specifics first of all their
numbers are up some places and down some
other places first of all they've got a
record sale of 31 million units of the
iphone compared to last year but then
again their iPad numbers are down from
17 million to just 14.6 million and
judging by the fact that they've got
more iPads now than they did before
something is really going wrong there so
this is the description for the full
list of details uh let's see how it goes
for Apple in the next quarter but wait
there's more non google related news
we've got some more leaks of the HTC
Zara or a thought out whatever you want
to call that thing and we've got
Snapdragon 400 processor we've got a
gigabytes of internal storage that's
expandable android 4.2 point2 i mean
even though this product is made out of
plastic or so say the leaks apparently
this device will be just another variant
of the HTC One mini that's pretty much
going to sprint so let's see how that
turns out now let's start with the
frenzy of Google News the breakfast with
sundar Pichai happened this morning and
we've got a lot of products starting
with Android 4.3 which even though it's
not the big kaboom of features um this
is really project butter version 2.0 I
mean you could see it in Joe's video
recently of Android 4.3 in the leaked
rom that we got I mean everything is
much faster more fluid more efficient
battery life is incredibly better even
on a leaked rom so it should be reaching
Nexus devices starting today sadly not
for Google edition devices just yet stay
tuned for that but anyways we'll keep
you posted and leave us a comment down
below on your experiences with 4.3 now
there's one product that made a lot of
headlines today in that struggles new
chromecast because this is pretty much
the perfect accessory that you'd ever
want to
I I mean Google is really going to kill
the Apple TV the roku and the whole
smart TV concept they finally figured
out google TV with this the reason why
is because well instead of a nexus cue
ball thing this is pretty much version 2
it's a dongle that connects to your hdmi
port and turns any TV into a smart TV
pretty much you can stream anything you
want from your android devices and
you're even iOS devices to this product
through Wi-Fi and 35 bucks i mean just
think about it you can buy any TV and
then pay 35 bucks for this thing and
turn it into whatever you want so i
wouldn't think about it twice we
actually bought ours during the Hangout
it is that hot and just think about it I
mean it sold out just minutes after the
Hangout minutes after the events so make
sure you get it before it sells out
again and then some dark patch I
eventually tease that Samsung is going
to be making the next version of the
nexus 10 but you already knew that so
stay tuned for that as well and finally
for the hot news of the day google has
finally had wrapped their new Nexus 7
and it's been leaked so well that I'm
not even going to bore you with the
specifics it's the same thing that we
saw on the leaks thinner lighter than
nexus 7 better screen resolution pretty
much the best pixels per inch on any
tablet on the market right now and
apparently the display is very crisp and
sharp aside from that you get a better
processor not this year's processor but
a better processor than sector three the
price point does raise itself a bit
again links in the description for full
details on this tablet but that is used
to the question of the day are you
getting the new Nexus 7 are you ordering
it it's going to be available on July
thirtieth in my particular case guys
well everybody in pocket now we're all
getting this thing this is like the
perfect tablet for touring something
dollars this is pretty much the way
tablets should be so leave us a comment
down below what do you think of course
as always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and help load me she follow
