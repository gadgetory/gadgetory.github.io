pocketnow.com Google showed up the new
android market yesterday and it brings a
brand new graphic user interface a whole
new concept to buying applications
whatever you've known from the old
google android market on your android
smartphone does not apply anymore
instead we have a great looking a little
bit windows from 7 inspired google
android market and we will take a look
at it right now
and we are back the rollout process for
the android market has already been
started and some of the users already
had the Android Market install but if
you are not that lucky you might have to
wait a couple of weeks until the
notification gets to your smartphone
luckily the Android Market the APK file
itself has been leaked to the internet
and i'll post a link on how to get it we
got it we installed it we have it right
here and we have to say it looks really
good now some might debate that google
is taking some elements from Windows
Phone 7 especially the live tiles now
these blocks right here are not animated
or at least are not yet animated maybe
Google would try to animate them and fit
some more information to the same screen
but we have to say we like the new
design because it brings you these
blocks of information it fits more
information on the screen it's easier to
discover applications to go through them
and to navigate the android market
itself now you can see at the top that
you have several windows to click
through and we'll start right from the
left where you can choose your category
and it's scrollable of course featuring
all the categories in the android market
for whatever you want games books
business comics so on and so forth
swiping one more will bring you to the
main screen which is the featured
application screen this screen consists
of blocks of applications which are
permanently rotated are featured and if
you don't know what to download or what
to purchase this is where you would
start and from here you can start your
application discovery you can see some
fixed blocks here like the games or
staff choices and tapping on them will
bring you right to the appropriate
screen where you can discover the
applications themselves let's jump back
and we'll get to the screen a little bit
later flicking one more will take you to
the top paid screen where you can find
all the applications which are in the
top pay category but the layout itself
has been
you can see that now there are two four
six eight ten ten a half let's remain
with 10 applications displayed at once
on the screen with the appropriate icon
title and the developer plus the Stars
ratings and prices so we have lots of
information at a single glance and going
to tap into tapping the title of one
will get you to the application page
which has also been revamped you can see
a search icon on the top a share icon
right next to it plus you have the item
description with the icon the price now
this is in Romanian currency because
we're not Romania but it changes
according to your location then you will
see very very much iOS like display of
the screen shots which are scrollable
and this is the same which you would get
from from an iphone experience tapping
on the screen shot itself brings you a
large full screen screen shot so that
you can see how the application would
look on your phone further down you see
the ratings description reviews
information about developer related
applications and of course if you want
to flag something as inappropriate which
we don't want to do right now basically
Google is trying to make the whole
discovery purchase download process as
simple as it gets and this is good news
both for users and for developers
because the quicker the application is
discovered and bought the better the
experience which Google is trying to
deliver now going even more to the left
you have the top free application
category top row singing applications
top new paid applications of course
these always change according to the
application submitted to me to the
market top new free applications and
this is where you want to spend most of
your time if you only want you to
discover applications and download just
for the heck of it and trending and this
is the last one getting back to the home
screen
you can tap on apps and it will bring
you straight to the featured
applications of course the new android
market also supports landscape mode if
you want to switch for a particular
reason to landscape it rearranges the
blocks very very well it fills the
screen so you don't have empty space
information well except this one right
here at the bottom which of course will
be taken care of I believe but it looks
nice but it doesn't give you a reason to
switch to landscape except if you own a
qwerty keyboard which is a slide out the
aspect and the mode in which the new
market looks best is portrait now
tapping on the menu button will bring
you the small menu at the bottom which
you've gotten use to buy now which
contains the my apps which is basically
a list of all the applications installed
on your smartphone and whenever you have
an update available you either get a
notification in the notification bar or
you have a small update text right here
so that you can know there's a new
application version available for your
smartphone getting right back we have a
Settings icon which brings you to a
screen where you can configure whether
you want to receive ads or not this is
rather interesting and you can set the
level of content filtering currently we
have all applications shown let's get
back
and we have the accounts where you can
choose which accounts are tied to the
android market itself under smartphone
plus your help so this is how the new
android market looks the user interface
has been completely rethought revamped
its taking a couple of kids from Windows
Phone 7 and from Apple's iTunes but it's
for the best we like it and hope you
liked it too if you did please give us a
thumbs up this was entering the united
front pocket naw Kham showing in the
brand new revamped google android market
thank you very much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
