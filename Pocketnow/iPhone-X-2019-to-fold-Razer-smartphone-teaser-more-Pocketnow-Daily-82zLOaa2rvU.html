already have foldable display suppliers
razor reportedly has something for us
over on November 1st and honor is also
reportedly joining the tall display
aspect ratio crowd
I'm hi Marietta and after a very crazy
day I have no clue when this videos
going up but it is going up this is
parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for a modular
smartphone that actually works the botos
e2 force is one of those phones that I
like what it can do not necessarily how
it looks but still $465 in the Verizon
variant on Best Buy yeah that is
extremely compelling and you also get
that digital protector you'll probably
never use but it's a $300 extra bonus
that you're getting in the box so yeah
why not and for those of you wondering
whatever happened to the HTC vive mainly
with everything that's happening with
the company lately well the company
continues to make vive headsets there is
a trademark currently filed in New
Zealand for an HTC vive eclipse and
we're still wondering if that's the
standalone version that we're expecting
with the conjunction with Google or if
it's going to be another version of the
HTC vive whatever the case may be if
there's one company that knows VR its
HTC so I can not wait to see what we get
and everyone sent your calendars for
December 5th I don't know why we're
gonna have to wait that long but honor
has just seized an event to happen on
that day in London and given the teaser
we notice that there's a tall aspect
ratio design here meeting whatever honor
is coming up should be great obviously
we still haven't seen what the make 10
will look like so it could just be that
this is the honor version of whatever
made 10 whatever the case may be I love
this aspect ratio so yeah let's wait and
see and believe it or not there is an
other event also happening on November
1st and this is from Razer for those of
you that are fans either of razors
gaming computers which I am or from next
bit and the next bit Robin remember both
companies came together to build mobile
phones I'm a big fan of both so I can't
wait to see what this company is going
to bring bear in mind I'm assuming that
it's a smart phone because it doesn't
really toast what it's bringing bear in
mind whatever the case may be it should
be awesome definitely and finally the
very interesting rumors today have to do
with the iPhone I'm gonna assume that
Apple is going to retain the iPhone 10
branding and just bring different years
for it just like it did with OS 10 but
apparently the either 2019 or 2020
iPhone is going to bring a foldable
display
we've been covering rumors of foldable
displace from Samsung forever but
apparently LG has already come clear
that it is Apple supplier for this in
the future whenever that may be and
obviously it takes years to build a
smartphone it took two and a half years
for the first iPhone to come to the
market and according to Jonathan Ive the
iPhone 10 took another two years to be
able to make so it could be the case
that they're just working from here but
at least we said the question today now
that we hear that Apple and Samsung are
going you know seriously with this
market what do you think the whole
purpose of a foldable smartphone would
be in my case I would love a foldable
tablet I don't know what I'm gonna do
with a foldable smartphone but hey
