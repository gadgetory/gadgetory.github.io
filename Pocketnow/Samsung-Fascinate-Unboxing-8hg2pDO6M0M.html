now calm and today we have a samsung
fascinate here for an unboxing which as
you probably know is one of the four
u.s. variants of the galaxy s and the
last one to hit the market so if you're
ready here we go so the first thing
you'll notice about this box is there's
not much to it I remember back in the
day when you know you'd order a s'more a
smartphone and it would come with a case
and headset extra battery may be all
sorts of fun stuff now you're really not
getting much here according to the case
we are supposed to get the phone a
pre-installed micro SD card battery a
wall / USB charger which you know they
used to give you those separately but
not anymore warranty product safety
guide and a quick reference guide and I
guess the main manual is available
probably as a PDF online so the actual
box that we got here although it does
look like its retail as you can see here
there's a couple nicks and scratches so
we probably were not the first ones to
take possession of this phone but actual
handset itself is in great condition and
you know we'll be taking a look at that
later but you know here you have the
pretty standard phone tray underneath
that we've got those manuals that were
mentioned before tips hints and
shortcuts and finally you've got your
dual action USB sync cables / charger
with USB adapter here again we think you
know they could have maybe included
headset you know definitely a separate
charger and sync cable but that's way
they're doing things these days and
can't stop progress so that's it for now
and stay tuned as we will bring you
software hardwar tours and eventually a
review of the samsung fascinate from
verizon until then have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
