tablet that's almost two years old well
it was never officially released to the
public so to us it's brand-new
I'm Adam Dow this is PocketNow comm and
this is our hands-on review of the HP
TouchPad go the HP TouchPad go was to be
HP's 7-inch offering in the tablet space
view out in fall of 2011 it would have
been one of the first 7-inch tablets
ever two months prior to its release
however then CEO of HP Leo Apotheker
abruptly ceased all webOS hardware
operations and the dozens of touchpad go
production models were relegated to be
destroyed they didn't all complete their
soldier into the dumpster however as
several have popped up in the hands of
HP employees eBay buyers and most
recently me the touchpad go is exactly
what you would expect it is it's a tiny
touchpad the seven-inch diagonal screen
has a resolution of 1024 by 768 with an
unimpressive pixel density of 183 PPI
that said the 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon processor and one gigabyte of
RAM still measure up even by today's
standards
rounding out the specifications we have
16 gigabytes of online storage radios
for Wi-Fi Bluetooth AT&amp;amp;T cellular 3g and
GPS the whole unit is a beefy 13
millimeters thick but feels great in the
hand due to the soft touch backplate the
touchpad go also sports two cameras but
that's where the camera excitement ends
the front-facing 1.3 megapixel camera is
adequate for video calling and that's
about it the rear facing five megapixel
shooter supports a single LED flash but
lacks autofocus meaning you'd be better
served bringing the pre three with you
if you plan to capture any special
moments moving inside we have a tablet
running the webOS that we all know and
love this particular unit came
loaded with web OS 3.0 point two two
versions older than the latest release
there is a doctor available to load web
OS 3.0 point five but given the limited
nature of the touchpad gos availability
we opted to stick with what was there
and not risk anything if you find
yourself in possession of one of these
gems freeware the ultra homebrew
collection of patches and scripts
becomes necessary rather than a nice
addition it is through pre ware and a
collection of homebrew apps and patches
that you can trick HP servers into
thinking that this is the real touchpad
and not a touchpad go so that you can
activate the device sign into or create
a new profile and access the app catalog
the interface is exactly the same as a
10-inch touchpad including cards stacks
tossing cards away slingshotting cards
away and even includes the famous Angry
Birds Easter Egg slingshot unfortunately
the same holds true of the app ecosystem
which sad to say is even more depleted
now than ever before
while most of the basics are there games
social media productivity you'll be
hard-pressed to find the more popular
apps of today even apps like the
incredibly popular glimpse are no longer
supported on the webOS platform the apps
you do find though will perform very
well email gaming notifications all
perform swimmingly on the 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core processor that this little
baby packs at one point we had over two
dozen apps open simultaneously with
little noticeable lag battery life is a
bit of a concern now we're not sure if
this is because it's a two-year-old
battery some optimizations are just not
there or what-have-you but we could only
manage about a day of light to moderate
usage no doubt heavy users would have no
problem draining the battery in far less
time especially if using the go for
something like navigation and speaking
of navigation while this device does
indeed sport a gps chip there were no on
device controls to turn the Jeep
yes on or off once again we had to turn
to pre wear which had an app designed to
toggle the GPS on a phone it seemed to
work if the built-in navigation software
was to be believed but we couldn't get
it to lock on to any satellites even
when outside on a clear day seems the
software was just not there yet
overall the touchpad go would have been
superior to its older and bigger brother
in many ways if it had been finished as
it stands today it is a passable tablet
companion but falls very short of
today's 7-inch iOS or Android
equivalents including the Kindle Fire
while the hardware is on pace with
current gen devices the score takes a
battery size hit and of course as has
long been the case with webOS the user
experience score is superb while the
software score drags it down like a boat
anchor we had to give the touchpad go an
overall score of 7.3 that's gonna do it
for our hands-on review of the touchpad
go the little tablet that could HP just
wouldn't let it if you liked the video
