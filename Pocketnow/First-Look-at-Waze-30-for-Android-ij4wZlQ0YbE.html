pocket now and today I'd like to show
you something really cool it's ways now
you're saying wait a minute Joe I know
all about ways you've shown that to us
before and yes I have but today I get to
show you ways version 3.0 the next big
thing and it's amazing let's go take a
look ok so if you're not familiar with
what ways is already head over to
pocketnow.com you can read up on what it
is and why it's so cool
this however is version 3.0 actually
it's two point nine nine point nine nine
nine point something or other it's not
quite three because three isn't
available yet this is going to be a
first-hand look at what 3.0 is going to
give us but the version that you get in
the market by the time this video airs
you'll have that version available to
you is just a little bit rough around
the edges so don't think badly of it for
that let's go ahead and take a look
first of all we've got the widget this
widget knows where I am and it knows
pretty well where I'm going to be going
next it also knows what the traffic
conditions are so it says hey I'm going
to be at work in seven minutes if I
Drive now
now this widget hasn't changed from the
last version to version 3 same thing
same thing really kind of cool we'll go
ahead and drive which is going to launch
the app first thing you're going to
notice if you've used ways on a Galaxy
Nexus which this is that splash screen
no longer has the bars it fits perfectly
on your screen
the second thing hey look at this we got
police visible out there great we'll
close that the first thing you're going
to notice is there's a lot less stuff on
the screen remember that Waze bar that
sat on the top that had your points and
whatnot in it well not anymore now it's
got your next turn and the street that
you're going to turn on how far it is to
get there just like you'd expect from a
GPS nav
down here on the bottom shows your
speedometer how fast are you going
according to the satellites that can
come in handy because well frankly my
speedometer is off by about 3 miles per
hour so now I can help really how fast
I'm going
if you switch tires out on your car to a
different size that'll do that kind of
stuff
with anyway let's move right along it
says that I've got about 2.3 miles to go
to work it's going to take me about
seven minutes I should get there at 1750
hours it respects the time format that I
have right up here you can see I've got
that set up as my clock 24-hour clock
it's something I like
so let's say I'm driving along and I
want to report something like I don't
know a traffic jam down here I've got
this report button I can tap on that and
get all of these things now as soon as I
tap that it remembers where I am so I
can take a little bit of time to report
some of this stuff let's say I want to
report a pulley strap go ahead and do
that if he's hiding I can tap that if
he's visible I can tap that type in any
details or hey use this like say he's
hidden hiding behind the bush and this
hiding behind the bush so it took a
little bit more time to do that a couple
more taps than what I'd like to see but
now I've got a voice recording
unfortunately it's a voice recording and
not a voice dictation hiding behind the
bush so just like that great I've got it
and it even got so just if I were
driving I'd be able to do that very
easily I can say if it's in my lane or
if it's in the other Lane I can even
take a picture and these buttons are all
very large very very finger friendly now
I don't want to do this so I'm not going
to report it we'll go ahead and close
out of that same thing goes if there's a
traffic jam hazard
there's a map issue if you want to check
in with Foursquare or just chitchat if
you've got an accident you can report
that too now this is just reporting to
other ways errs not reporting to the
police that integration hasn't come yet
I hope it does eventually but over here
on the other side is your menu button
tap that to get to your menu how do I
know it's your menu well if you come
down here and tap menu it brings you to
the same place you can stop navigation
say you need to go in and get a soda you
can stop your navigation and then resume
it you can choose different routes you
can mute or unmute your navigation
navigate you know actually drive and
they chose this really kind of cool air
for
sure thing you can look at the reports
around you my ways which is your reports
and settings and yada yada yada all that
cool stuff share this kind of high
billing for a share but hey okay it's
better than we have before global
settings and then if you want to turn it
off there's a couple other things that
you can do here if you grab this and
pull you can get right into the share
information about your traffic jam well
I'm not in the traffic jam I'm going to
turn that off if you go the other way
with this button it brings up the
navigate screen where you can type in
where you want to navigate to here it
knows I've got home and work and I can
set another favorite if I want in there
I can use the voice dictation to type in
what I want so let's do this
Weber State University and it does that
pretty good apparently Weber State and
Weaver State sound the same so I'd have
to go in and correct that but overall
very good it does a very decent job with
voice recognition there's a new kind of
weighting thinking thing where you've
got some ways cars driving around in the
bubble so they've done a good job
customizing and optimizing this for
their brand
there's my navigation search so
relatively fast it says it's nine point
five miles away and now it shows me a
map and I can either add that as a
favorite place or just hey I just want
to go because I know that's the right
place by looking at that mini map here
we go I've got I can close this I can go
which is the default action or I can
choose routes if I want to choose an
alternate route overall very cool so
yeah I like that let's go ahead and
choose that one and it'll direct me
they're very cool shows me how long it's
going to take to get there when I'm
expected to get there and how long in
distance it is to get there as well of
course all of these are in my preferred
units so if you're different you can be
different that's cool you can set up
however you want now this is like I was
saying not weighs 3.0 not yet this
version that I'm trying is a pre-release
it's version two point nine point nine
nine
nine pulling something so still a little
bit of stuff that they need to do around
the edges of this but by the time you
watch this video ways version 3.0 should
be available it is free in the Android
Market very neat very cool along
long-needed
update to the interface and just the
overall look and feel it's very nice
it's clean its crisp and it gives a lot
of cool new stuff there's even more
stuff in here you can search based on
check-ins and well just lots and lots of
social stuff in addition to the just
reports and whatnot that we had before
really cool give it a try I think you'll
love it and if you don't let me know why
down in the comments below again this
has been a first look at ways version
3.0 for android speaking for pocket now
I'm Joe the Android guy
