pocketnow.com and today we have the
unboxing in the new t-mobile sidekick 4G
so sit back relax and join us for this
first look since its release in 2002 as
the danger hip top the sidekick has been
on a rollercoaster ride with integration
of aim and being the first cell phone
capable of placing unassisted tty via
the browser it even gained a sign in the
American sign language but in 2009 a
major outage and a date loss followed by
a stop in sales 2010 was thought to be
the final nail the name has been
resurrected with a new core Android so
the box is pretty standard fare this is
the pearl magenta kit so that's what
we'll see in the color scheme here as we
pull this open we can see it's got a
really nice white back and that's the
phone we'll look at that in more detail
in just a moment and if we open up the
bottom of this give me a little bit of a
struggle just a second
there so it opens up just like the
original sidekick does inside we've got
a micro SD adapter we've got a standard
USB to micro USB cable and the power
adapter nothing more really accessories
wise I assume the cards in the case in
the bottom of the where the phone sits
is also the start guides and the manuals
etc so that's it for the box not
anything spectacular to see let's move
on to the phone itself so from the front
view you can see that it's pretty slim
in the hands it feels really good it's
not Gorilla Glass but just feel like a
glass screen and we flip it over on the
side we can see that the accent color
which is nice and the chrome backing
popping off the back of the case just
snaps on we see the Samsung battery
there and the SIM card and the speakers
are down on the bottom those two little
white pieces the battery itself is a
1500 milliamp hours and we'll see how
the battery life actually turns out to
be pretty nice configuration there
and on the side is the micro SD slot
only two gigs unfortunately or
fortunately for the price a headphone
jack volume up and down and the power
button on this side and only on the
other side we've got the micro USB s--
door and the dedicated camera key and a
lanyard hole top not much up here in the
bottom it's got the microphone button or
a microphone hole I can get this case on
correctly the back has a 3 megapixel
camera no flash which is a little
disappointing and you can't really see
it here but it says Samsung on the back
and this model is manufactured by
Samsung 3.5 inch display with a 1
gigahertz hummingbird processor one gig
of ram 512 Meg's of RAM and it is HSPA+
compatible so that means it's a 4G phone
when you boot up at boots up in
landscape mode which is typical for a
sidekick device keyboard is nice and why
the buttons stick up just a little bit
I'll get into more how those work later
you can also see from the front of the
screen of the little 0.3 megapixel
front-facing camera on the left there
and just below that there's two little
spots that are for the multicolored LED
or the charging in the further
notification and they're supposed to be
have multi color options looking at the
back you can see the actual magenta
accent color the pearl magenta kit looks
pretty good I would actually use this
you know like screen slides right back
in place spring-loaded keyboard lights
up as you pop it open which is nice and
that much give there it does locks fully
out it doesn't have any any in between
modes and it feels pretty solid all the
way through which is great home button
quick button a back button and the menu
button and a touch sensitive d-pad that
does it for our first look check back
later for more videos and an in-depth
review at pocketnow.com thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
