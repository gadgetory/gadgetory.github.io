pocket now calm and this is a look at
fennec alpha 3 this is basically
Mozilla's Firefox for mobile devices now
we've shown you videos of alpha one out
the 2 and now our alpha 3 and what's
different is really a lot of bug fixes
so they've improved panning and
scrolling they've improved startup time
revised theme improved you I polish and
things like that overall it's not too
too different from alpha 2 so if you've
tested that before it's very similar but
we'll take a look and see if we notice
anything terribly different okay so
let's test out that improve startup time
we're going to tap on this little fennec
icon here and see how long it takes
okay so that it was about 11 seconds and
if you think about it opera mobile is
about six seconds so it's still slow but
compared to previous alphas of fennec
it's a lot faster so let's go to a
website let's start off by tapping on
the awesome bars they call it up here
and let's go to you can see some sights
I've been to already let's go to msn com
okay here we have msn loaded and just
like on the desktop version of Firefox
you get the little fav icon up here at
the top if you type if you tap on the
fav icon you get a little bit more
information about the site's security
certificate from here we can swipe to
the right to get a list of tabs we can
open up a new tab and we can start
typing let's go straight to pocket now
swipe to the right to get that to close
in here we are with pocketnow.com loaded
and of course we can tap to drag and it
takes a little while to redraw the
screen it doesn't have flash support so
you see the little you know click here
to enable the plug-in notification there
to zoom in on a column you DoubleTap
just like other mobile browsers and it
tries to refit it although it's a little
bit slower than opera mobile s you can
see there a double tap to zoom out again
and at this point things seem very much
similar to what they looked like in
alpha 1 and alpha 2 the tabs are about
the same they perform a little bit
better let's go into settings and see if
anything is different there of course we
swipe to the to the left this time to
get settings and settings is down here
and actually can jump up to favorites
right here by tapping on the star and
you can actually add a favorite by doing
that let's go down to the Settings
button and they've moved the location of
the icons and now they're on the bottom
they used to be on the left side so they
really optimized page space now they
have this kind of yes no toggle switch
really to turn on and off images enable
javascript enabled plugins and one of
the great things about fennec when it's
finally fully developed is that you'll
be able to get a lot of plugins for it
and customize the browsing experience
kind of like you can do on firefox on
the desktop the second tab will show you
the plugins and allow you to search for
plugins out we did a video about this in
alpha 2 right now there are only about
10 plugins that you can
yet for fennec it's not like you can get
the many thousands that you can get for
the desktop and I'm not going to tap on
that icon because it seems to freeze
this device every time I do that's
another bug let's go to the one to the
right of the plugins icon it just shows
you all of your downloads if you've
recently downloaded some files and to
the right of that is really the first
screen that we saw with all of the
options to change the various settings
so fennec alpha 3 is not that much
better than previous versions there are
probably a lot of under the hood bug
fixes but from the end-user perspective
it's really not that different and
there's still a lot of room left to make
improvement obviously this is an alpha
it's not even in beta yet so the Mozilla
developers know this but at this point
there's still a lot left to be desired
and and it's far from being able to be
used as a daily driver because there's
just so many problems with bugs and
things just not working very well so
we'll keep an eye on the development of
Venice we'll be back when there is a new
build to talk about that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
