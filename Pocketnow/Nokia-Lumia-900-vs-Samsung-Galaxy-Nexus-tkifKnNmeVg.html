calm and in this video we are going to
prepare a few aspects of the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus on verizon with the Nokia
Lumia 900 on 18t let's check it out all
right first up let's do our boot up so
I'm going to try to get both of these at
the same time and we'll see how long it
takes them to start up a while we wait
let's talk about the prices Galaxy Nexus
is available on verizon for three
hundred dollars with a two-year contract
whereas the Nokia Lumia 900 is available
from 84 $99 with a two-year contract
this is you can also find this on amazon
for like one sent with the contract
where's this one you can find on the
Amazon for a 99 so the nokia has two
already finished booting we're going to
wait a little while for the galaxy there
we go now let's look at screen
resolution I've got the same picture
loaded on both of these devices let's
just tilt them to get them and when you
look at them side-by-side you can tell a
difference but if you look at them one
at a time it's really not too noticeable
and the Galaxy Nexus has a 720 HD Super
AMOLED screen whereas this one is the
nokia is just a clear black AMOLED
screen with 480 x 800 pixel resolution
this one is 720 x 1280 so we've got a
lot more pixels over here now when you
look at them close up under a microscope
you can see even more of a difference
and if you look at them outdoors we see
both of them with highest brightness
levels are both really quite visible
outdoors next up let's look at the
browser both of these are on a Wi-Fi
network so they should have similar
speeds and let's visit pocket now okay
here we go and it looks like the Lumia
is in the lead lumia is done this by the
way have uninstalled flash so you
shouldn't be concerned about flash
slowing this down and we have an ad so
let's zoom in we can see both are very
smooth and zooming
you see this one is a has to load a lot
see some blank areas there all right
let's click on this first link that time
the Android a tad went faster but both
seem to be finishing very smooth there
of that one had some blackberries are
now let's go for some HTML 5 speed tests
you might think this is biased because
Microsoft made these html5 demos but you
can visit this on your desktop and look
at the source and see that they are
quite unbiased select this to the fish
ie tank there we go and you can see the
framerate is going to be calculated up
here we're going to 48 frames per second
over there and 21 over here 22 so
definitely more choppy there let's try
another one
speed reading we're getting 27 34 37
frames per second and over there we're
going to eight now another thing about
these phones they're both on LTE
networks so I've just shut off Wi-Fi and
we're going to start our bandwidth
testing programs naturally your results
will vary this is on verizon the sun 18t
so we've got differences their network
speed you've got differences in network
speed depending on your location so we
see we have 4G reception there and we
have 4G reception here and let's do a
begin test
so we're getting three point three four
point eight let's go and hire five so
3.3 2 megabits per second over there on
ATT kind of a slow upload here I'm
verizon
so we've got 5 download 1.5 upload 3.3
download and one upload let's look at
the history and we see a lot of close to
five we see it close to nine over here
and the threes we have five and eight
seven there was a nine one time so on
average they're pretty close in the LTE
speeds now let's look at starting up a
nap will do Angry Birds so let's see how
quickly they do it
a little bit faster on the Galaxy Nexus
need the sound and then you'll notice
some differences here because of the
high resolution screen we have much
smaller buttons on the Galaxy Nexus very
quick there same speed that was a little
bit of loading there and again with the
resolution you see much much different
view and slightly different graphics
that time we won over here a little bit
faster on the Lumia let's see how it
goes
both very smooth with the angry birds
now here's another thing there's our
buttons again very very tiny I feel like
I need a stylist for these words over
here nice big buttons and that's because
of the screen resolution difference next
up let's look at the camera launching
speed so let's get both of these at the
same time Lou me it was a bit faster and
now let's try to do a shudder at the
same time
the Galaxy Nexus definitely faster with
the shutter both devices have great
performance with a very significant
difference in price build quality I'm
going to give the winner to the Nokia
this feels very solid this feels a
little cheap I mean this is our around
it's super well built and hardware we
have pretty close to the same thickness
and size pretty close to the same
intimate speed with LTE now what about
battery life this guy the Nokia seems to
get consistently around 36 hours of
battery life
so you see I still have a day left
whereas this one usually gets about 16
hours or much less if you leave a
certain program running like facebook so
i'm going to say better battery life
over here it doesn't have as many pixels
to push it has only a single core 1.4
get hers processor where's this is a
dual-core 1.2 gigahertz processor and it
has a lot more pixels on the screen so
that can slow things down and take up
more battery so overall most of the
aspects are pretty close too close to
call except for a screen resolution
Galaxy Nexus will win on that camera
screen I think the Galaxy Nexus will win
most of the time so that's it for our
comparison between the Nokia Lumia 900
on 18 TLT and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
on verizon LTE give us a thumbs up if
you liked this video and that's it for
now
