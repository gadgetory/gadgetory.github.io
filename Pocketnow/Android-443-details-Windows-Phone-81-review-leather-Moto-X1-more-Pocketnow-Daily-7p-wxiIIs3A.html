and rumors include a nexus fire with
more carrier support they get more
rumors of the Moto X plus one with
leather options again and microsoft
launches Windows Phone 8.1 to developers
and we go hands-on I'm hi Mary better
and if any of you have any problems with
Monday whatsoever please join me this is
parking out daily let's begin this
Easter week with the official news a
very interesting you remember the rumors
of the galaxy k well apparently Samsung
is planning to launch this thing on
April 29th we've got presentations and
everything's out there that's just
interesting why exactly is this new
Galaxy camera are going to be called the
galaxy k if there is gonna be a galaxy
before the k because apparently that
could change as well we don't know
anything about specification or anything
again there are just some leaked photos
of this device and hopefully it is
better than the first two generations of
the galaxy camera now let's talk about
the next generation Moto X which is
being dubbed the Moto X plus one out of
all the ridiculous names you could have
thought about I know some worst ones
from Samsung but then again we've got
rumors from F leaks that there will be
17 color options for this phone moto
maker will still make it up to this
device and yes we are getting leather
options according to the rumors now we
don't get any specifications or any
details link to the description for full
details on which colors you may select
though we don't know exactly when it's
going to launch and for those of you
that are interested in the HTC One m8
well hold it right there as we've got
some very interesting rumors that the
company is working on a plastic variant
for different price ranges which is
interesting because we're trying to
wonder exactly where does the desire 816
fit in this whole equation if there will
be a plastic variant of the One m8 now
we don't have any details on pricing of
the same specification will be there but
I don't find the one mA to be pricey
links in the description and let us know
in the comments do you find it pricey
would you like a plastic option I
wouldn't now let's talk about Google and
particularly android 4.4 point 3 is
apparently the company is preparing to
launch the new operating system but for
those of you that are waiting for this
update it seems to be just full of bug
fixes and this is really interesting as
a there aren't really very many bugs on
the Nexus 5 or any goodbye
it's actually running four point four
point three but even more interesting is
apparently the documentation and the
leaked information and who's affected
the nexus 5 will reach sprint as well we
don't know when but we don't know if
that's timely anyways let's see how that
goes and finally for the very hot news
of the day Windows Phone 8.1 is now
public to developers but if you follow
one of the links in the description
you'll see a full procedure from Steven
on how to get it on your phone which is
great though there's no going back it's
quite buggy though the second link will
show you the full video for Michael
Fisher on what to expect for windows
phone 8.1 it's all for review there is a
lot of hot here like port Anna it's a
lot of hot stuff coming from there the
wallpapers there's a lot of support
Notification Center which is called
Action Center here there's a lot of
really great things that are coming from
Windows Phone 8.1 and definitely you're
carrying a Windows one it's great to try
it out but that leaves you the question
of the day watch Michaels video and tell
us what you think of Windows Phone 8.1
because in my particular case I find it
cool but I find it to be a catch up
believe is a comment down below what do
you think and front doodle the drill if
you want to get the news earlier before
this video's filmer tree follow us on
Park in our comment subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well it also follow
