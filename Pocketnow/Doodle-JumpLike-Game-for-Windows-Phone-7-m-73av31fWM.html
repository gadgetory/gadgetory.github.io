pocketnow.com doodle jump is one of the
most popular games for the iphone and
android and now there is a version of
the game it's not from the same company
but it's just like doodle jump for
windows phone 7 in this video we're
going to take a look let's get started
so for those of you that don't know
doodle jump is a very simple yet very
addictive game that allows you to jump
on these platforms you can hit springs
and the goal is to not fall down and
you'll come across aliens and rocket
packs and all sorts of things to throw
off your balance but the the more of the
game or the purpose of the game is to
get as high as possible the higher you
get here the more points you get but if
you miss something you fall and game
over windows phone 7 has an app that was
just released it is not doodle jump
exactly but it does the same thing it's
one dollar doodle jump on iphone and
android ranges between two and three
dollars and fifty cents and over here
here it's called doodle tower so let's
take a look at doodle tower for windows
phone 7 already you can see it's kind of
doodle jump like we tap to start and
it's not it's not as good but it will
definitely work for you if you are an
addict of doodle jump so you do come
across certain obstacles like platforms
that break if you jump on them and other
things so that one broke can't jump on
the brown thing apparently so pretty fun
