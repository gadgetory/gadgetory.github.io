smartphones at Mobile World Congress
this year and the theme for 2016 is
spatter pattern
I mean micro splash design from
Barcelona this is michael fisher with
pocket now with a quick look at the
desire 5:30 and 6:30
brought to you by D brand so like all
desires these are affordable smartphones
with tough polycarbonate casings and
modest specs a snapdragon 210 on the
lower end model and a 400 on the fancier
one an 8 megapixel camera and a 13
megapixel one 1.5 gigs of ram versus two
gigs better boom sound speakers on the
630 you get the idea also the higher end
desire models will ship with fancier
earbuds in the box in some regions what
they've got in common five inch 720p
displays pretty small twenty two hundred
million power batteries microSD
expansion and sort of retro connection
point for a wrist lanyard the most
notable thing here is that each phone
uses the same chassis featuring the next
evolution of HTC's approach to color the
micro splash design is applied using
high-pressure Jets and each handset
featuring this color scheme has its own
unique pattern pretty distinct and
pretty polarizing this is going to be a
love it or hate it look quick note HTC
also announced a higher-end desire 8 to
5 here at MWC but the review devices on
hand weren't ready for filming more
details on those at pocketnow.com the
new desires will begin rolling out in
retail end at HTC comm in March for the
pricing and availability details are TBD
