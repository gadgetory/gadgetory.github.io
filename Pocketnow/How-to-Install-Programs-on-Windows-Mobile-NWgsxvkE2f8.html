pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to show you how to install
programs on your windows mobile device
now I realize that most of you watching
this video probably already know how to
do that but there are some of you that
don't know how to do that it's not a
given that you know how to install
programs so I'm going to go through that
now and of course there are multiple
ways to install programs but I'm going
to show you the one that I think is the
quickest and that works the best for me
ok so the first thing that we have to do
is download the cab file onto our
computer or you can do it on your phone
but I'm going to show you through the
computer a cab file is like an
executable file for your windows mobile
device so you open it on your device and
it will start installing the program so
here we are with a post from daniel
webster on g alarm which is a program
for the HTC Touch HD Dimond and pro that
allows you to do certain things to shut
off the alarm in the morning so it kind
of wakes you up a little bit so i'm
going to go and download the cab right
now ok and here we have downloaded g
alarm so i'm going to access the file
here it is and i'm going to copy the
file and then i'm going to go into my
computer so start and computer now i've
already connected the HTC Touch HD so it
shows up right here in my computer so
i'm going to go into that and then click
on and i'm going to place the cab
anywhere really I'm going to place it in
My Documents just so I so I can remember
where I put it so I'm going to
right-click and do paste and it's going
to transfer over to the device and now
we can unplug the device ok here we are
back on the phone and I'm going to go
into the Start menu and I am going to go
into programs and go into File Explorer
because we want to get into My Documents
where that cab file is so we're going to
press the down arrow and zoom out to my
device we're going to go to My Documents
and here it is right here G alarm so we
tap on it and it starts to install
and it's done so we can get out of here
all right and let's find the program we
go into Start programs and here it is
down here G alarm so again there are
other ways to install programs onto
Windows Mobile you can download the cab
directly if you're browsing the web on
opera mobile or you could run an
executable most programs have a cab file
and an executable that you can run on
your computer it's a little more
automatic but this method is the one I
use the most and that is how you install
programs on Windows Mobile that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
