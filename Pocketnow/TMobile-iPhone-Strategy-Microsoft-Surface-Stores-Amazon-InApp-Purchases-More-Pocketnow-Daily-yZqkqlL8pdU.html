YouTube returns to Iowa 6 just before
the keynote and Amazon makes in-app
purchases something for real I'm high
memory better thinking about what I'm
going to buy from amazon next and this
is parking out daily now what better way
to learn the t-mobile USA is not going
to get an iphone 5 and to read it
officially from them the carrier is
making a big fuss about how you can save
as much as 50 bucks if you bring a
carrier unlock the iphone into their
stores and getting activated but the
problem is the t-mobile USA is not
offering the 1,900 band and just about
every market so buyers beware even
though t-mobile is going to have an
iphone for us its stores to show you how
the network is make sure you check if
the 1900 ban works in your area before
you make the kiss of death with edge 2g
data speeds now iOS 6 will most likely
be launched tomorrow and google has
already launched their official YouTube
native app to work on the operating
system you ask what's the big deal about
this if you've already got an apple
YouTube native app on your device and
the problem is it'll stop working as of
iOS 6 once you upgrade now this native
app from Google is a complete copy of
what you get an android it's much faster
than using html5 on a browser for you
too but the problem is you won't be
likely to respond to comments as easily
as you can with html5 now if you thought
that Apple invented in-app purchases
think again amazon is now working with
developers to bring real purchases to
applications and i'm not talking about
extra credits or new levels i'm talking
about being able to buy the real action
figure whatever getting you're playing
on the amazon store now this is going to
work through Amazon's 1-click purchasing
program so just make sure you watch out
where you click from here on with these
Amazon applications because one click
means one click Microsoft isn't playing
any games with their new surface tablet
their first ever tablet or dare I save
and computer is going to be launched
alongside with windows 8 and says
microsoft doesn't have enough stores
around the country what they're planning
to do is having 32 outlets all over
malls
the country to be able to sell you the
product if you're not in a place where
the stores are available now the list is
quite big so make sure you hit the link
in the description for details on which
malls will have these outlets and damn
what i would give they would have an
international store for that and finally
there seems to be an official version of
instagram in the works for windows phone
8 but apparently the tricky part here is
that the parent company of instagram
which is now owned by Facebook is not
really working on the application new
speculation has microsoft building the
app just like they did with Twitter and
Facebook which were really good
applications but the really cool thing
would be for Microsoft to integrate this
app into the camera like we know that
when those phone 8 can do that leads me
to the question of the day do you use
Instagram I use it a lot so make sure
you follow me at I'm every bit on
Instagram now we want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pacquiao com please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hina to be better
