surface with carrier detail acer's new
Windows 8.1 tablet makes it hard to
resist your budget we got some leaked
concepts of a possible Nokia SmartWatch
I'm high metal iveta and can somebody
please tell alliums to please end this
crazy race for the most mediocre an ugly
SmartWatch this is pocket out daily
let's say off with some official news as
obviously Windows 8.1 has now become
public and free to everyone and now
starts the whole race for the smaller
7-inch rate inch tablets running windows
and such as the case of acer's new w4
tablet which runs Windows 8.1 at a very
compelling price tag of three hundred
thirty bucks aside from the fact that
the spec sheet is very interesting so
links down below for full details and
obviously storage options and everything
and speaking of Microsoft's the company
is making their support for Windows
better but in competing platforms as
they just launched their remote desktop
client for iOS and Android and this runs
on iPhones iPads and Android tablets and
smartphones and it runs quite well
always a little cumbersome to log in but
still it is the official application
obviously there are other third-party
applications out there that can do a
similar job but sometimes people just
want the official thing we know remote
desktop has existed for more than a
decade and it is one of the best ways to
actually help somebody out or whatever
so make sure you hit the links in the
description and get your free version
now let's talk about Google as the
company has just released their quarter
results and they're awesome we don't
even need to talk about that but the
interesting company here is motorola as
the company is actually still losing
money it is making a lot less money than
a dippy for almost six hundred million
dollars less but it's losing less money
proportionately when compared to last
year last quarter that means that
obviously the company is more efficient
but that also means that the Moto X has
not been the phone that they thought it
would be at least in sales so let's see
how I manarola pics themselves up i mean
do you use a moto x or do you want one i
feel the phone has really left the buzz
recently and speaking of google we've
got some leaked renders of the google
nexus 5 only this time with a telus no
go from canada
and we're still debating if this photo
is actually real or fake because the
telus logo doesn't look you know in the
same angle as the phone so it could just
be a fanfare photo but one of the most
interesting parts about this renders the
fact that we don't have an earpiece it
looks like a camera and that makes us
wonder what exactly is going to happen
to the earpiece is it at the border or
is it part of the camera what exactly is
going to happen with this design so
let's see what we get it should be
launching in the next couple weeks and
finally for the interesting news of the
day we've known for a long time that
nope has been working on a SmartWatch
especially now that they're under
microsoft's umbrella but we have not
seen prototypes just yet until now that
we catch this video of the Nokia facet
her face it whatever you want to call it
and okay this is a very interesting
concept because these are actually six
screens that are snapped into a sort of
a bracelet that's supposed to be a
SmartWatch you can actually make them
work together as an extended display or
you can make each of these displays show
you a different thing obviously the UI
is cumbersome because it's obviously a
prototype but it is probably one of the
ugliest concepts of the SmartWatch that
we've ever seen with a very interesting
idea so that leads you to the question
of the day I mean exactly what would a
SmartWatch need to do for you for you to
consider it over a regular watch in my
particular case honestly it's not just
about all the things these displace can
do I want a SmartWatch that's elegant
not like this nokia one and it's also
useful in any particular reason that
other watches cannot be so leave us a
comment down below what would you want
in a SmartWatch and for as always if you
want to get your news earlier before
this video gets filled make sure you
follow us on parking out on comment
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
and also follow me on Twitter Jaime
underscore be better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi Natalie that I thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
