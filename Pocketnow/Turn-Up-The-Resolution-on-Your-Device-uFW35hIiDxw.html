pocket now calm and in this video I'm
going to show you what it looks like if
you change the DPI setting on your
device now this will work with any
windows mobile device and effectively
what it does is it makes your screen
look like look like it's higher
resolution and if you are familiar with
computer monitors you know what that
means you can see more on the screen at
one time things are sharper there a
little bit smaller but it increases your
productivity because you're not
scrolling around as much so this is the
before let me show you how many icons I
can see in one view without scrolling in
my programs list so i can see nine right
now okay let me go into windows live
search to give you another idea of how
things are before i make the
modification okay so right now i can see
eight icons on the screen i have to
scroll down if i want to see more okay
so that is the before let me show you
the program that i'm going to use to
change my DPI setting it's called real
vga and i will post a link to download
this over in the description on the
youtube video right now it's set at 128
DPI i want to make it 96 and it's going
to require that the device be reset okay
and we're back and now this is set at 96
DPI and what you probably have noticed
is the top and bottom bars here are much
smaller which gives you a ton more
screen space in the center by default
the windows mobile top and bottom bar
take up a tremendous amount of space
really unnecessarily let's go into the
program's menu so I can show you how
many icons you can see at one time Wow
look at that 16 icons at one time before
it was only 9 meaning I have to scroll
around a lot less and I can see a lot
more in one view let's go into live
search and i'll show you how many icons
i can see there i can see every icon
without scrolling if you remember before
i had to scroll at least twice to see
all of the different icons but now
everything is right there and view so
like I said changing the DPI setting on
your windows mobile device is one of the
coolest modifications you can make it
really makes the device have a higher
resolution feel and the power users will
absolutely love that now beware that as
I said before it can make some things
break for example up here next to the
time I used to have a battery battery
meter in every program and now i just
have a
line although it does still work I can
still see my battery status but overall
on my palm treo pro everything seems to
be working quite well with the change to
the DPI that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
