evasion proves that jailbreaking is
still popular on iOS and Spotify reaches
Windows Phone 8 I'm hi Mary venom and
yes that means that my windows phone 8x
is now out of the drawer this is poking
out daily for those of you interested in
the HTC m7 that should be out in the
next couple of weeks well apparently m7
was just a code name and there is
another brand name we know that HTC has
invested heavily in there one branding
with the HTC One X the one acid just
about every other device that was
launched to see you're all great devices
and apparently this device will be
dubbed the HTC One not won something
just HTC One obviously things can change
from here to there so we will keep you
posted at the event and then no kit
comes back to the news because we have
some leaked designs of a possible future
Lumia smartphone and since we talked
about the Lumia 520 720 and even Nokia
Lumia 1001 der which design or which
device could is designed fit it doesn't
seem like this will be a flagship device
but hopefully things will change and
probably mwc would shed some light and
speaking of Windows Phone Mary Jo Foley
has just heard some rumors of the future
version of Windows Phone which is code
name blue apparently there will be some
major enhancements to contacts calendar
and just about every other service
that's built into Windows Phone by the
fault but interesting enough it does
seem that Microsoft is working on
improving performance and battery life
which is interesting since Windows Phone
8 is already a well-oiled machine when
will it be launched well we could
probably expect it to be launched
sometime early this year and then get it
you know in a device probably by late
this year as they always do we'll keep
you posted and yes we've got some more
windows phone news those of you who are
like us dreading Windows Phone 8 because
Spotify did not work on it and only on
windows phone 7.5 well the beta for
windows phone 8 is now live and it's
available at the Windows Store you get
downloaded for free and to be honest
with you it works all a lot faster on a
beta than it did on windows phone 7.5 so
make sure you download it and if you
haven't tried spotify well there's a
free trial for 30 days i do recommend
you give it a try
and finally for the revealing news of
the day if you thought that jailbreaking
wasn't hot to see how well think again
sarrak the owner of city just brought us
some stats and apparently well five
million iPhones a bit jailbroken more
than a million iPads and a couple more
than 500,000 ipod touches are included
in the list more than seven million
devices in just a couple of days so
think about it I mean it's actually
really hot and to be honest with you it
works really well on the iphone 5 so we
do recommend you give it a try but that
leads us to the question of the day have
you jailbroken your device and if not
tell us why to be honest with you it is
worth it so far so we do recommend you
give it a try again leave us a comment
down below and if you want an earlier a
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet roll make sure
you follow us on pocket now calm and
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm hina Rivera
thanks for watching see you Monday and
make sure you catch today's episode of
pocket now live with all of us and a
hangout it was really cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
