pocket now day two of Aoife back at the
samsung booth because we didn't get
quite a close enough look at all the
features specifically the S Pen features
in the new Galaxy Note 3 so let's check
out what you can do with this new
class-leading phablet so the new S Pen
might physically resemble the older one
but it's capable of a whole lot more and
that's thanks to software when you hover
over the screen press the button once
the Air Command the window pops up you
can tap action memo which is the first
we're gonna go left to right an action
memo was first for a very good reason we
showed you a little bit before about how
the action memo could be used to save a
phone number
but we did not show you how it can plug
in to navigation now I'm gonna give this
a very very big address here and see if
we can get the software to pin us at a
specific location but if you have a real
address here we go Smith I have Staten
Island that sounds great
I don't think I want to go there but
we're just going to go there in our
imaginations it's not going to be fun
boom there it is of course you're not
confined to addresses or contact list
you can call phone numbers directly by
writing them in you can send text
messages you can send emails with the
condo there's a whole lot here you can
do you and that's up to a task question
so this is the first feature once again
for a very good reason because it is
pretty versatile another cool
application in that's in the air command
menu here is scrapbooker so you tap that
and it initially looks like
the Selective screen grab application
that we see in all the previous notes
but it is not quite that now say we want
to grab behind me Rivera's little blurb
about the latest episode of the pocket
now daily which you should watch if you
don't already you can draw a box around
it and it's not just grabbing the image
there it's saving to the scrapbook the
screenshot yes but also a computed copy
of the text it's just done optical
character recognition on all the text
dropped all that in there we save it to
our scrapbook we can in fact do memos on
and all that stuff but we're just going
to save it right now and that goes into
the scrapbook and that is very very
handy I'll show you a little bit more
about that later it's a really nice way
of taking notes on the quick the next
function screen right is something we're
all very familiar with you see all the
instant screen grab action there and of
course we can write on the screen in all
manner of in all manner of ways using
all manner of colors and
there have been some just slight tweaks
to the UI here to show you the size
believe we might have another color
option too we can individually target
colors it's my big eyes I might have
been able to do them No - I don't
remember but we all know what this is
like circle things and go over here this
is not something we want to dwell on but
it's nice that that features there for
the people that continued to value it
the fourth toggle on the air command
menu which once again you press you get
just by pressing the button on the side
of the S Pen is s finder this launches
you under a screen which doesn't really
obey the cosmetic rules of any of the
rest of the UI I mean it looks like
maybe the future of where samsung's
touchwiz is gonna go and are really sure
obviously we're just kind of spitballing
there it looks nice and clean but it
doesn't really look like it fits anyway
the reason we saved hime a story before
was because it discussed the Nexus 5 so
I'm going to search system-wide for the
Nexus 5 and hopefully go ahead and find
that somewhere now hey look I've been a
scrapbook entry on it
tap the scrapbook entry pops up that
story before and the text associated
with it this is a very very handy
feature system-wide search is something
that many people find useful not just on
the desktop but in mobile increasingly
in level as it becomes available so
that's really nice to see
and finally in the air command window
for people who don't want to rely on
just the multi screen multitasking you
can hop over to pen window and the most
often used example here is the
calculator you're just going to draw a
window size that you like for your
application side then you can reviews
the Geiger before you've seen that let's
just open up a hangouts window here
there it is there's this a resized
hangouts window we are here's our fake
contact list thankfully helpfully
provided by Samsung this is really wild
this 1080p display allows us to actually
read this text and see these numbers in
here we can start a hangout with any of
these imaginary people because they
don't really exist there's air view at
work we can move that around and say you
want to minimize any of these you can
minimize it it becomes very much like a
chat head from the Facebook app it goes
over there
and we can do another one let's say what
do we want to do here pen window will
make an app a big old wide one so here's
that here's a youtube app the YouTube
app is a little finicky because it
doesn't like being in particular aspect
ratios but you can resize it like that
and you're watching a YouTube video here
an air view is a little buggy there
apparently you're watching YouTube video
here drag it on down and you were having
a hangout conversation up here or maybe
you want to invert that so you can use
the keyboard but this is you know
awkward and cumbersome and you probably
wouldn't do this all that often so we'll
go ahead and
stop this
I'll actually go ahead and minimize this
the video stops automatically put these
off to the side let's do some multi
screen action let's do the exact same
thing we were doing before
there that is here's hangouts down below
and this is great but say you're
watching the let me see if I can
actually yeah I know I know these aren't
real all right fine
well we're gonna go into messaging then
and messaging is going to be our
substitute for for hangouts
don't go there we go alright so Maria
Brown yes well you know it's alright
that our meetings gonna be delayed
because it's it's fake we say we're
watching a video and we see something
compelling in the description on the
video or in the comments say and you
want to grab that and drag it into your
text message conversation all you do is
tap in the little dot dividing the
windows and drag and drop content you
can just take that whole paragraph bring
it down here into the messages boom
there that is you send it to Maria
suddenly Maria knows why your
presentations going to be late probably
won't stop you from getting fired by
your imaginary boss
folks there's a whole lot more new to
the Galaxy Note 3 a lot of it cosmetic
like the new layout of the S note app
here which should help you find your
memos save your memos make it all a
little bit more exciting a little bit
more useful but we're gonna get into
those in our in our true deep dive on
the software functionality for now this
is just a slightly more detailed look at
some of the added features Samsung is
bringing to the Galaxy Note 3 from day
two Editha
as we wrap things up we thank you for
continuing to watch anton denoted behind
the camera and we'll talk to you real
soon from pocket now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
