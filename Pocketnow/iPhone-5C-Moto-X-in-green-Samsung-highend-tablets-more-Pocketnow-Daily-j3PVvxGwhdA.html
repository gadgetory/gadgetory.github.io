called the iphone 5c more leaks keep
teasing what we should expect from the
Moto X and believe it or not Samsung is
working on building more tablets I'm hi
never iveta and I keep wondering when
Sammy is going to figure out the fact
that they build too many tablets every
year this is pocket nail daily let's
start the day off with the releases iOS
7 beta 4 reaches developers sadly not a
public beta but we get to learn a lot of
things first of all the update was only
for bugs and fixes on the current
generation iphones but on the newer ones
well apparently we do get a hint of a
fingerprint scanner in the home button
as you'll see in the photo so let's see
what Apple brings to the table when it
comes to the Moto X we've got some ads
showing the phone and green now we've
also got reports the device might be
ready to be sold this week which is
interesting now set your calendars
Thursday August first at four thirty
p.m. we will be holding it at a toil
roundtable on this device with
everything that you need to know there
will not be a live stream of the event
borrow Michael Fisher will be hands-on
with the device in New York City and
then you will join the hangout to tell
us everything that we need to know about
this phone so we're going to join us
let's see what Motorola has in store for
us now if you are wondering when the HTC
One mini is reaching us Shores well
we've got some leaked press renders of
the device with an AT&amp;amp;T logo at the back
so you do know which carrier is getting
it it's only a matter of time before
that happens we don't know any day 10 we
don't really know we could recommend
that you wait for this phone when
compared to the one so let's see how
this turns out now something is another
company that we can't understand reports
having that the company is working on a
new high-end lineup of tablets that will
be based on the display that you already
know on the Nexus 10 which is long
overdue we can't understand why Samsung
tablets you know after seeing the Nexus
10 why is it that we don't have a
high-end version of the tablets and then
you'd wonder what the company is going
to be doing with all galaxies have lined
up links in the description for all the
variants that we will probably be
getting even though we don't know we
should expect this with a big smile and
finally for the hot news of the day
we've got some leaked photographs of the
boxes of the future direction
iphone being BB i phone 5c and don't
worry we know that the boxes are fake
but some trusted sources do mention that
the name is accurate the budget iPhone
will be called the iphone 5c and well
that leads me to the question of the day
what do you think iphone 5c stands for I
mean what does the C make difference
here from the S that's usually been used
every other time and are you interested
in this budget iPhone in my particular
case I have no clue I know that the s in
the past meant speed I believe but see
leave us a comment down below what are
your bets of course it's always for an
early or scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and temple
