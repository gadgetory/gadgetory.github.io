thousands of dollars if you can even
believe that motorola releases the
development kit for its modular project
ara you can now find the HTC One m8
almost everywhere I'm hi Mary that and
can you imagine a modular Thursday where
you can just skip the whole day and go
directly to the night enjoy the night
and then skip directly to Friday this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
the official news and yeah I know a lot
of you out there or out for the HTC One
m8 to rate your carriers it's been
available online but only exclusive to
verizon and stores as of today now you
can pick it up on AT&amp;amp;T Sprint so you can
even pick it up on best buy for the same
prices that you already know so for
those of you that are out there trying
to get the m8 got a lot of great points
in our review and there's a reason for
that so go to the store check it out now
let's talk about Apple we've got a lot
of segments that include that first of
all starting with the iPad as we've got
some very interesting predictions as to
what to expect for the next generation
tablet apparently Apple will keep the
same designs that we already have which
is what we expected we have a new a8
chip which we still don't know exactly
what it'll do better than the a7 but
then again we also have the fact that
apparently this iPad will finally bring
touch ID and for those of you that are
waiting for the 12 point 9 inch iPad
apparently that will have to wait until
next year apparently these iPads will be
ready in early q3 which is interesting
since we were expecting these in spring
as they always did and if not in the
fall but hey earlier is better or later
is not now the same source that talked
about the ipad also talked about the
iphone and the news were so separate
that we just had to separate the
segments natalie the iphone 6 will come
in the 4.7 inch and 5.5 inch models that
we talked about but this is really
interesting apparently for example the
first device will retain the 320 ppi
that we currently see already in the
current generation iphone so it's just
going to be a bigger bloated phone with
the same aspect ratio so apps won't have
to be designed again for it but the 5.5
inch iphone is rumored to have a 1080p
display so for this first time it seems
that Apple would abide to a standard and
give us a 401 pixels per inch display
with this device but even more
interesting is that
expecting set fire to make it to these
phones and apparently the apple won't
have an upset fire for the production
that they're expecting it seems that
they will only provide this cover for
the higher-end iphone models which would
be the 64 gig model and up if there is
so stay tuned we do hear more rumors
that both phones will be separate when
will be launched first and the other one
later we'll see why now let's talk about
the i watch as yes these credible
sources are also talking about the
wearable panelists will be the biggest
park launch of the year for Apple and
apparently it'll happen at the end of
the year not mid-year as we were
expecting with iOS 8 but very
interesting we have a 1.3 and a 1.5 inch
model two very different sizes obviously
there are women and men out there you
know other smart watch makers and really
interesting apparently this phone will
have an AMOLED display that's also made
out of sapphire and well it seems that
Apple will focus a lot on fashion aside
from fitness but it seems that one of
these devices will cost thousands of
dollars as Apple plans to make this a
fashionable product and not necessarily
just the tech product we really don't
understand how apple plans to sell a
gadget and compare it to anything that
actually is worth a thousand dollars out
there that's been out there for decades
almost centuries you know what companies
I'm talking about but still of Apple
feels that this is the best way to
differentiate its product that would be
very interesting links in description
for more rumors on everything you can
expect on this i watch and finally for
the very interesting news of the day
motorola has just made two announcements
number one they have a new president and
COO Rick Osterloh links to the scripture
for full details on him he's been
working with Motorola for a while and
well this is happening before the
transition to Lenovo but which is even
more interesting but a second that the
company has also launched the product
development kit for project ara for
those companies that are willing to
build accessories for project ara this
is the whole standard and how to do
things standard operating procedures etc
really interesting as this phone is not
appealing at all but hey they plan to do
modular this way but that makes me to
the question of the day I mean look at
the licks of the description look at the
designs and tell us do you like project
ara do you like the concept because you
my particular case i'm so used to buying
smart phones all the time that I don't
think I want to keep the same ugly phone
for five years just because I can swap
the camera it's a cool feature but it'll
depend on the prices of the accessories
