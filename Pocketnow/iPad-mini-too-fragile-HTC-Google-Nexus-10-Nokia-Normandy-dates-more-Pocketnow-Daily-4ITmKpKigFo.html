fragile device and insurance tests a
google nexus 10 follow-up is now being
rumored by HTC and the Wall Street
Journal now claims that Nokia is going
for an android phone I'm high memory
mehta and i bet you ten bucks you've
never seen me wearing a polo shirt this
is pocket now daily let's stay off with
some official news as a sous has now
launched the asuste vivo tab note 8 and
yeah i hate the long name but you're not
going to hate the price tag in the specs
there's a full windows 8.1 tablet an
8-inch tablet that's also capable of
pennant but as it does have a Wacom
digitizer what makes it even better is
that it only cost you 3 29 bucks at the
microsoft store it's currently out of
stock already but apparently it is
available on retail stores if you go to
it so yeah move fast now let's talk
about Samsung is aside from the fact
that we do have an unpacked event
happening at mwc when we do expect the
galaxy s5 we have some leaks of model
numbers now and listen to this we have a
value edition of the galaxy s4 so there
are rumors that apparently this lineup
is going to continue selling though
we're not sure that means a lighter
version of the galaxy s4 that's even
possible with the galaxy s4 mini and
also we're getting a galaxy tab for but
we're not even to talk about that
because I don't know how many galaxy
tabs are needed for samsung to
understand that people don't really like
those tablets though the new UI changes
things now another company that's being
rumored to launch mid-range phones as
HTC n we do know that their strategy
with the one this year was to just
launch one phone and have it be a
flagship but in the end they bid launch
the desire lineup in emerging countries
and rally the company is going to
continue doing that this year or more so
as their quarter results are bad and
apparently the company is planning to do
this as their new strategy but even more
interesting is the fact that if you
wanted an HTC tablets and you wanted it
to be a nexus tablet rumors happen that
HTC will do it but not the next is 8
apparently it'll be the nexus 10 so stay
tuned for that up next let's talk about
no guess we've been hearing the rumors
of the nokia normandy for the longest
time some of us believe that it's an
android phone others believe that it's
an Asha phone The Wall Street Journal is
now
confirming because they pretty much
confirm rumors according to them that
this milk in Normandy project is an
android phone a forked version of
Android as we see on Amazon tablets and
the idea is that probably this will be
the asha line of just running android
and a forked version though again we
don't really know if we're getting
Google Play stores on these phones or
the Nokia is gonna bring their own no
gift store to this but stay tuned we'll
see how that goes is amazon has its own
way of doing things as well and finally
for the interesting news of the day
squaretrade of insurance company has
just launched their statistics on which
devices they consider easier to break in
the mobile line up right now and the top
number one device easiest to break is
the ipad mini which is very interesting
as the second most fragile devices the
galaxy s foreign there's actually a list
of 10 devices links in the description
for details as they'll also tell you
what tests were run there and etc but
it's really interesting i mean the ipad
mini we thought that apple's build
quality was legendary but that leads you
to the question of the day how about of
you share your experiences smashing a
device which would you consider to be
the most fragile in the market and tells
your experience as well smashing a phone
again because in my particular case
samsung phones are easy to smash the
Galaxy Nexus was very easy to smash for
me but leave us a comment down below uh
tell your experience and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is
filming she follows on pocketnow.com
it's the scripture youtube channel as
well you also follow me on twitter hind
