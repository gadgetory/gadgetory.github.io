announced and yes it packs a whopping
ten gigs ram reports claimed that there
might still be at least one samsung
phone with a knotch this year we got
more patents from samsung as well this
time hinting to a foldable tablet I'm
Jaime Rivera and I know it's Thursday I
know it's almost Friday I know I can't
wait for it the sparking out daily the
official loose today begin with deals as
a Best Buy is going all out for the next
two days when it comes to certain
products that are very hard to find on
discount
starting with Apple as a yeah I mean
we're pretty much so close to the next
iPads that of course you've got a
hundred dollars off the current iPad pro
and there are other products like for
example philips hue products as well you
can learn more about all the deals in
the description so far that iPad pro is
like yeah now let's talk about the
oneplus 60 as we've got some sources
already claiming things like the price
tag which is funny cuz one plus is one
of those companies that doesn't really
announce on what your product is gonna
cost up until the event but the rumors
are that the price tag is going to grow
again but not significantly we hear a
probability of between twenty to forty
euros in some cases we also heard rumors
of 50 we're not exactly sure which one
to believe because again it's something
that we don't learn until last minute
we'll keep you posted now let's talk
about Samsung as there are some
interesting patents that just emerged of
a foldable tablet obviously we've been
covering the rumors of this since the
beginning of time the funny part is that
the rumors and the patents are from 2014
that's just to prove how long ago we've
been talking about this so yea 2014 is
when these patents were made it seems
that now they're finally gonna see the
light of day with all the rumors that
have been happening it's just to prove
how long it's taken to get this product
off the ground it's gonna be interesting
and speaking of Samsung there are rumors
that that whole ups under panel the you
know sensor system is not necessarily
gonna make all the Galaxy S 10 variants
we've heard that there are three that
two of these are gonna have a dual
cameras at the back and more storage and
everything but apparently that
technology is going to be exclusive to
these phones or at least one of these is
not go
to have it and the solution is gonna be
a notch according to patents now the
notch is not as we currently see with
competing devices we're talking about a
teardrop small little module that looks
a lot like what we saw with the
essential phone so I'm not saying it's a
bad notch it's just the buyers beware
and finally the hot news today have to
do with the Xiaomi me mix 3 I sadly was
not able to make that event and after
the whole announcement I'm sad that I
wasn't there particularly was in the
Forbidden City but our own Joshua
Vergara is currently covering everything
there stay tuned for his video on what
to expect oh my god so I don't know how
Xiaomi does this because of surely it's
a six point four inch OLED display
finally at 1080p the design is gorgeous
there is this mechanism that sliding
mechanism that brings out the selfie
camera but the price ranges are just
crazy it starts at a minimum of 6 gigs
of ram and it goes all the way up to 10
gigs and the starting price is four
hundred and seventy-five dollars so yeah
of course if you're gonna want to get
the 10 gigs of ram which is crazy
overkill you're talking 725 I believe
depending on the variant but yeah it's
an awesome phone you can learn more
about it once Josh's video is live but
let us know in the comments what do you
think
do you like the me mix 3 do you think
that it's got everything that the me mix
lineup is brought because for me the
first as I try the me mix to us which
was my first experience with Xiaomi
