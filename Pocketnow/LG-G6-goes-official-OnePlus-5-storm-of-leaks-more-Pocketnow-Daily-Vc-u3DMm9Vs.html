control as we are just one day away from
the announcement LG launches its new g6
Plus fixing the minor issues of the g6
and the iPhone 8 leaks just keep going
and going
I'm Jaime meadow Iveta back in the
studio and somebody just told me they
loved my Guns and Roses t-shirt
mission accomplished with apparel this
is parking out daily the official news
today start with deals I'm not
necessarily going to say that these
deals are great but if you're in the
market for new HTC phone not talking
about the you 11 by the way but you will
trouble tan for example 210 you get as
much as 120 dollars off again if you're
an HTC fan because these are phones with
the exception of the 10 that I would
probably be like anyways like the
description now let's talk about
Microsoft's Cortana service those of you
that want to replace your Google
assistant and I kind of don't know why
you would ever want to do that but
anyways if you want to use Cortana have
it sync with your PC and whatever as of
today the new version 2.8 will allow you
to replace the Google assistant and
actually set Cortana on Android and this
is a good update sadly you won't be able
to say hey Cortana and have it respond
but still - good update you should
highly consider now let's move the
spotlight over to the iPhone 8 as the
leaks continue going why because we saw
some leaked images in the past that
showed us photos of what the display
might look like it looks a lot like the
essential phone but I thought today we
do have videos that show us this front
plate and we also have the options to
actually buy this screen if we wanted to
so yeah it seems that this is kinda
legit we'll see now let's talk about the
oneplus five for those of you that want
to know what it's going to look like my
god we've got so many leaks it's crazy
we're one day away from the announcement
just head on over to pocket now there
are at least three posts right now that
pretty much tell us everything we want
to know I am really really excited to
see what this phone is going to look
like so yes they tuned and finally the
very hot news they have to do with the
LG G 6 plus and this is a very
interesting announcement because it's
actually not a larger g6 it's pretty
much just one that includes everything
we actually wanted on the
g6 like for example the hi-fi audio deck
in addition to the fact that we now have
more storage options 128 gigs and now we
have new color options and the front
plate is now black for example things
that we really wanted from the original
g6 and this is all great the only
problem is that we're not exactly sure
if it's going to reach the United States
or not we will keep you posted it leads
me to the question of today what do you
think about this new g6 plus at this
point would you buy it in comparison to
devices like the Galaxy s8 in my case
yeah I actually do want that hi-fi audio
back but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion
Ramji louia goes if you want to get the
news earlier before the video was filmed
