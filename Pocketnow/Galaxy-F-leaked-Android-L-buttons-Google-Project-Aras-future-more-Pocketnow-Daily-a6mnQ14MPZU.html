with metallic chamfered edges Google's
Lee designer of project ara leaves a
company and drop some uncertainty and
Google doesn't seem to have made up its
mind about the buttons on Android L I'm
high Meadow iveta happy fourth of July
to everyone and aren't you all lucky
that I get to work today this is walking
out daily believe it or not fourth of
July and there are official news today
as the HTC One m8 just got dual SIM
treatment you remember the HTC One
receive that same treatment months after
it was launched in a very interesting
way you could remove the back and in a
similar way you can do that with the m8
right now but I guess the biggest prom
and the reason why it's only being
launched in certain countries like
Germany is because it costs 800 heroes
800 euros which is a lot of money in
difference when compared to the regular
m8 how many of you actually need a dual
sim I mean I like using two smartphones
another official news that also happened
Google's lead designer for project ara
den makovski has just decided to leave
the company he posted this blog post
saying that he was leaving to Capital
One and compared to so many things that
he was going to miss about Google though
obviously human project are was actually
a motorola project it's really
interesting to see that things are now
in beta when it comes to project ara but
then again how many of you actually like
the design a project are because it
looked too basic obviously it's really
hard to make a modular smartphone I'm
not judging but leave us a comment down
below what do you think you think it's
better to bring new blood into project
are probably a better design and
speaking of design issues probably one
of the most conflicting features of
Android L that some people either like
or really don't like is the sake buttons
you will say that it's hard to
understand them that it's really
difficult though hey these are buttons
and as long as you memorize them how
many of you have been using the place
they should controlled and understand
what those things mean still apparently
there are other buttons and these are
actually the old buttons that are being
demoed and showcased and all the
software tutorials that developers are
getting so apparently google might
change the buttons back to what they are
or give OMS the option to use the
current one
new ones really hard to tell what but I
mean aren't beats just buttons now when
even more confusing news for the longest
time we believe that the leaked photos
of the LG G Vista were of the verizon
variant of the g3 but the verizon
variant of the g3 already launched and
we are getting more leaked photos of the
g vista and when she compared them you
can see the difference is the price and
logos in a different section and we're
trying to make up exactly what is going
on what is the purpose of this g beast a
lot of us are assuming that this is the
g pro two or three or whatever variant
that verizon might be getting which does
look a lot like the g two or three or
whatever this is really confusing we
really don't know the purpose for the g
vista but the leaks are still continuing
they come from famous tips for a bleak
so it's a phone that will happen and
finally for the very interesting leaks
of the day we have the first photos of
the samsung galaxy f actually just one
photo but we've been waiting for this
device for the longest time it's almost
a year now mainly because we've been
assuming that this will be the aluminum
variant of the galaxy s5 and as it turns
out the photo shows us some champers
edges and some interesting curves at the
bottom of the back now the report of the
tipsters say that this phone will have a
replaceable battery as well we're trying
to figure out exactly how that's going
to be pulled off how samson is going to
deal with the antenna issues etc but it
seems that this project is going but you
know that leads me to the question of
the day notice the photos that notice
that this thing has sham furred edges
what what is the point of Shaffer died
just do you like champagne edges on your
phone or not because in my case they
look great once you pull the phone out
of the box but will she drop that thing
they look terrible I mean I wonder why
Samson can't adopt a more unique
approach to design when it comes to
aluminium leave us a comment down below
what do you think friends yes you know
the drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is filming she
