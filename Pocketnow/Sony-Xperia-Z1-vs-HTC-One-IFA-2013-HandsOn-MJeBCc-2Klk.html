now the Sonny booth has quieted down a
little bit here at Aoife on the first
official day of Aoife we're still
looking at the Xperia z1 we've already
compared it against the galaxy s4 now
we're going to see how it stacks up
against the HTC One very quickly let's
take a look so just taking a test drive
around the hardware here these devices
you know it's funny because the z1
doesn't really look that big until you
put it up against the HTC One which is
already a pretty tall device and as you
can see the z1 is larger in nearly every
dimension and to have a look at the
thickness on the side here HTC one of
course goes for that nice curved kind of
palm kissing approach Sony much more
brutal and it's just rectangular
sandwich also glass on the front glass
on the back and believe this is dragon
trail glass but the HTC One aluminum
here let's turn them around while we're
around back here we'll take a look at
the cameras the four megapixel or ultra
pixel low-light camera with optical
image stabilization on the HTC one vs a
20.7 megapixel camera with sony exmor RS
processing technology behind that we're
going to have a full comparison on the
cameras right now sony has showed us a
couple features which we'll get into in
a second standby power on the right hand
side here sunny still keeping their
pronounced buttons intact HTC of course
keeping that up on top along with the ir
transmitter there volume rocker size a
little bit different you knows and then
the here we have this two-stage camera
key here which I don't think we
mentioned on the galaxy s4 comparison
very important to note that we love
android phones or any phones really with
a hardware camera button absent on the
HTC One and the s4 there's our SIM tray
microSD expansion on the Sony product no
expansion available on the HTC One
you're stuck with your available storage
options there no removable battery on
either one though 3,000 milliamp hour
battery over here significantly larger
than HTC is offering let's clip on over
we've got two displays here 4.7 inches
over on the HTC One and a full 5 inches
on the sony z one HTC one needs to boot
so we'll
that and that will compare some software
so we've been an interesting surprise
when powering up the HTC one here to
find it's the google play edition HTC
one sorry folks we brought the wrong one
to the tray floor but that's okay is it
still gives us the opportunity to
compare Sony's skin against stock
Android you can see here's the launcher
here we've shown off this feature on the
other in the comparison the hands on but
it is pretty cool to be able to organize
your app launcher the way you want to
the nice the really really fun stuff
though is in the camera viewfinder which
we checked out before but as you can see
so here's the stock Android experience
you know it's very very very
minimalistic you tap on that you've got
a couple pop-up options here and you do
have a significant amount of control
over the weather what the camera does
but not it's not quite granular
obviously it's not really a focus of the
software here simplicity is the priority
for the stock Android experience now on
the z1 it is completely different we'll
give it a subject there and the HTC One
that'll be fun and meta yes you can hop
in here and you can you know manually
adjust things like exposure and settings
and whatnot but if we happen here we can
do something fun called timeshift burst
you might remember a similar feature on
the blackberry z10 we go ahead and take
a picture of our friends across the
aisle there we snap that shot and yes
that's the moment where we grabbed but
the camera was also selecting shots from
in the past and it took several shots
after the moment of capture as well so
this is very nice you go in here you
select that one to say this is the one I
want to keep bingo there that is give it
a second to process and we hop in and
there's our image and as we said before
not entirely sure we like what's going
on with some of the artifacts in the
software here but it's going to have to
wait for a full review to check that out
but we're going to go a little bit more
in depth if you would like some more
software exposure to the z1 check out
our comparison with the s4 and our
initial
hands on but right now just a very quick
look at how the Sony Xperia z1 formerly
known as the Honami performs I can see
HTC One we're still adeva Anton Gina is
still behind the camera there's only the
first day of EF oh we've got a lot more
videos coming stay tuned to pocket that
