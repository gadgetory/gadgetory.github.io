the best smartphones of the year no
question about it but now we have a
stateside model to take a look at I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is our review of the AT&amp;amp;T LG g3 back in
June our own michael fisher covered LG's
latest flagship in excruciating detail
in a nearly 10 minute long video we
could do that again with this AT&amp;amp;T
specific version but we'd be repeating
many of the same sentiments and said
we'll cut to the chase and cover the
important differences the good and the
bad of 18 t g3 and we'll be sure to fill
you in on the details we admitted with
the south korean variant first off from
the outside you won't see a ton of
visual differences on the AT&amp;amp;T variant
of the g3 like before it comes in two
color options silk white and metallic
black of course we got the black model
once again with a brushed metal
esque finish around back speaking of the
back side the designs are identical but
the branding has been swapped out a TN
t--'s globe is positioned just below the
rear mounted buttons and LG's insignia
has been traded for the g3 implement
other than that these phones are tit for
tat even on the inside we were surprised
to learn the AT&amp;amp;T variant would also
come with 32 gigabytes of storage and
three gigabytes of RAM instead of two
and all the rest of the innards are the
same as well the Snapdragon 801 SOC with
a quad-core Krait 400 CPU clocked at 2.5
gigahertz and Adreno 330 GPU a 3000
milliamp hour removable battery microSD
card slot with support for up to 128
gigabytes Wi-Fi 802 a Levin AC NFC etc
it's all there except one thing and this
sort of gets under our skin the AT&amp;amp;T
model does not come with Qi wireless
charging we know it seems ridiculous but
AT&amp;amp;T support for the PMA standard means
that unlike other g3s who can't simply
plop this phone down on a chi or PMA
charging plate to charge it no need to
call up the extra cash for a quick
circle folio with PMA embedded yet
another $60 and it's only available
through AT&amp;amp;T and no research tells us
you cannot simply buy a Qi replacement
battery door for your AT&amp;amp;T g3 to
magically get cheap back it's gone and
that's truly unfortunate safer wireless
charging and proper band support for
AT&amp;amp;T here in the States there are no
major Hardware change
and that's a very very good thing this
is before we're super pleased with the
g3 hardware and don't be alarmed about
the complaints about the display there
petty at best contrast and saturation
can be tweaked in the accessibility
settings and the lower than usual
brightness may fix some users but it's
not drastically dimmer than your
run-of-the-mill smartphone display the
software situation is also much of the
same it's a solid balance of simplicity
and user customizability things like the
customizable navigation buttons and NOC
code give it just enough personality to
separate it from the rest and somehow LG
manages to pack a ton of options and
features into its software without
bogging anything down or making the UI
difficult to navigate and tweak that is
if you don't use the task switching menu
on the flip side AT&amp;amp;T has made some very
subtle changes were not exactly fond of
first and foremost bloat AT&amp;amp;T branded
applications are in abundance
approximately 22 come pre-installed and
long pressing and dragging any of these
over to the remove function doesn't
uninstall set apps but rather disables
them worse than that two changes have
been made in the notification shade and
we're torn over the change no longer are
the brightness and volume sliders
permanently displayed below the quick
settings toggles instead you get to
toggle buttons for the brightness
settings and sound profile this helps
reduce the clutter in the shade but also
makes accessing brightness and sound
settings or cumbersome especially
considering where the volume buttons are
located fortunately everything else is
still intact and this carrier version
comes running Android 4.4.2 just like
the South Korean edition like before
performance is a buttery smooth no
matter whether you're pushing the phone
to its limits with an intense game like
the new modern combat 5 or browsing the
web and Chrome and playing a YouTube
video at the same time the Snapdragon
801 keeps trucking along without issue
as expected these findings are
corroborated by synthetic benchmarks and
it's impressive scores all you need to
know in terms of performance is the LG
g3 is a beast
last time we emitted call quality and
network performance call quality this
time was remarkably clear we had no
trouble hearing those on the other end
earpiece and speakerphone were plenty
loud even in noisy environments and
callers reported no trouble hearing us
in the same conditions network speeds
have been awesome even in weak HSPA+
coverage areas we mustered speeds
upwards of 5 megabits per second down
and 1 megabit per second up peak
downlink speeds were
over 40 megabits per second and our peak
uplink speed was over 16 megabits per
second better life is also something we
were concerned about considering the 5.5
inch 1440p display in Snapdragon 801
through our usage the removable 3000
milliamp hour battery managed to powers
through a full day on a single charge
which is saying something the battery
did tend to plummet and to specific and
obvious scenarios with the display
brightness at 100% and or in heavy
gaming in such cases the phone would
heat up and you could physically see the
battery wilt way before your eyes but in
typical usage the g3 stamina is
impressive the camera performance like
before is hit or miss and great lighting
you won't find much better but the
optical image stabilization at least for
low-light shots doesn't appear to have
any effect on the light intake low-light
shots are washed out blurry and filled
with noise
but as far as we can tell there are no
differences in this area so no surprise
this version of the g3 is just as
awesome as the first one we looked at
AT&amp;amp;T made some changes some we don't
exactly agree with but the core and
highlights of the phone are still intact
the display is still just as gorgeous
the performance is top-notch
and the software is dare I say enjoyable
and we can't argue with its pricing
either one $99.99 on a two-year
agreement or five $79.99 without 18 G's
added touch that is if you don't count
the bloatware is also nice theta speeds
and call quality have been fantastic
still we wish they'd left the Qi
wireless charging alone and hadn't
needlessly tweaked the software if
you're on AT&amp;amp;T you want to taste at the
best of the best the LG g3 is the real
deal and totally worth the Buy
