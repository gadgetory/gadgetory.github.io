today we're gonna unbox the Verizon
droid Eris it's my first Android phone
but first I thought it'd be interesting
to take a look at some of the other
Verizon devices that I've had and look
at the boxes and the progression of the
packaging so this is what seems to be a
pretty old box
it was the SMT 5800 smartphone which was
a Windows Mobile standard phone then I
had the HTC ozone which was the first
global smartphone I tried which was very
good as well and now we've got the
Android operating system and the Verizon
HTC Droid yearís and you can see the
boxes have gotten progressively smaller
which is good from ecological standpoint
but let's get to the matter at hand here
which is to take a look at what's inside
the box here the Droid yearís so it's
nice nice color scheme that's bright
here it's a little smaller than then I'd
say what an iPhone looks like but it
looks very good that off
take a look at what's up in the box got
the battery here that slides out how it
comes out you've got manuals see any TVs
so that's interesting no CDs just
manuals see how that works from a
sinking standpoint then you've got your
USB cable and what seems to be the
standard HTC power brick like those
aside take a look at the battery here I
was looking at the specs I think this is
a 1300 milliamp battery which for these
kinds of devices seems to be on the
light side but we'll just have to wait
and see there's a little clip here take
off the cover battery goes right here
looks like on the side that's where the
micro SD card is and you've got an 8
gigabyte micro SD card
cameras on the back so this is a 5
megapixel camera great to have the
headphone adapter no need for that weird
cable from HTC then you've got the
volume controls on the side the mini USB
connector which I like you see the
microphones right above it here got a
you know I guess in Europe they really
like this idea of being able to have
straps around their phones and
a little hook that HTC seems to put on
all our phones so that you can actually
have a strap and in the front of the
device this is obviously a touchscreen
device and I've gotten used to
touchscreens with the iPhone and for my
use I see no real need to go back to a
device that has a keyboard touchscreen
works quite well for me so that's about
it for the unboxing I will charge this
unit up and we'll go to the hardware
tour next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
