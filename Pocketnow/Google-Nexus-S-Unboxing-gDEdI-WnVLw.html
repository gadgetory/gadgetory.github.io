pocketnow.com and in this video we're
really excited to unbox the Google Nexus
S a samsung phone that is supposed to
represent the best Android experience
and let's get to the unboxing now as
mentioned the Nexus series of devices is
supposed to represent the best Android
experience possible Google partners with
an OEM in a previous case it was HTC
with the Nexus One in this case it's
Samsung with the Nexus S to create a
device that is really the benchmark
Android phone and you know what the
Nexus One really lived up to that claim
the Nexus One even today about a year
after it's released
it's still a really good phone it's fast
it's light it has great battery life and
there's an extremely robust development
community that supports this device so
we get constant ROM upgrades not only
from Google this device will get at
Gingerbread 2.3 but from sites like XDA
who produce roms for this device more
than any other Android phone of course
some people are disappointed with the
Nexus S saying that it's very much
similar to a Galaxy S smartphone that is
true but there are some exceptions and
we're going to talk about that and
compare the Nexus S to a Galaxy S
smartphone in a minute but thought it
might be interesting to compare the
unboxing experience of the Nexus One
with the Nexus S as you can see the box
has shrunk a lot it's much smaller we
can look on the side it says Nexus S we
flip it the other way blank sides on the
top it's blank on the back very clean
backs back here it just says Google
Samsung over here just says Nexus One
the unboxing experiences are very much
similar so we've got a liftoff top and a
vacuum-sealed here and we get cool
Google colors blue red green and yellow
around the outside and with the Nexus S
it's kind of similar but everything's
compacted you see so we've got the same
red at the top green on the bottom
actually they shifted the colors around
a little bit but really cool unboxing
experience to make it memorable for
those that have gone out and bought the
Google Nexus S
made by Samsung now this is a t-mobile
phone I'll be using it over AT&amp;amp;T meaning
I'll only be getting EDG data there's a
tiny possibility that like the Samsung
Vibrant the Nexus S has sleeping AT&amp;amp;T 3G
bands that can be unlocked via software
it's not likely don't count it on
happening but it's something that we're
definitely gonna watch out for so we'll
take a look at the device in a minute
see what else we get on the box
so here's a t-mobile SIM card in case
you want to activate it and use it over
t-mobile's network although you're not
going to be able to get there HSPA+ 4g
like speeds so of course the model
number for this phone for those keeping
track is the GTI 90 22 boring stuff here
got a nice little spelt Samsung charger
they get smaller and smaller and if you
take off the plastic this this area
probably glows a little bit when you
plug in the charger to the wall and we
get some headphones some really nice
headphones actually they are just
earbuds with little chrome pieces we'll
talk about that later and of course this
battery and people are claiming that the
Nexus S has good battery life just like
the Nexus One is rated at 1500 million
of hours in fact this is the same exact
battery most likely we're going to test
this in a minute
that goes inside of the the galaxy s
smartphones like the captivate so let's
push all this aside and take a look at
the glorious Nexus S so the big claim to
fame here from an aesthetic point of
view is the curved glass screen although
it's not as curved as you might think so
it is curved really on the top and the
bottom and if you look at the screen
it's mostly flat it's hard to really see
this on video and and we're gonna talk
more about this in upcoming videos so
I'm gonna take off the back here it's a
lightweight device like the other Galaxy
S smartphones so it's not using a lot of
metal to make it feel heavy or high
quality in in the case of some phones so
we got this big predominant screen on
the front how is this different than a
Galaxy S well let's take out a galaxy
yes here here's the AT&amp;amp;T captivate a
great phone but it's a little bit
weighed down by
samsung's touchwiz interface the Nexus S
is running on Google's lightweight
interface free installation of Android
2.3 which a lot of people are going to
appreciate of course we also have the
addition of the front-facing camera on
the Google Nexus S and we also have the
NFC function which will allow the Nexus
S to do Near Field Communication stuff
when and if that becomes big so let's go
to the side here to see how the Galaxy S
with captivate compares to the Nexus S
it's very weird holding up the Nexus S
to another device because it's got this
curved screen and on the back we've got
a camera although the Nexus S adds a
flash five megapixel camera over there
and we have this nice little hump here
which actually should go a long way in
making the device feel very steady in
hand when you're typing because you're
wrapping your fingers or your middle
finger is resting on that hump so you
can type that plus an improved on-screen
keyboard and Gingerbread should make for
a pretty good typing experience so let's
compare the Nexus S to some other
devices you may know and love the Galaxy
S version of Windows Phone 7 yeah the
the Samsung Focus which has the same
four inch Super AMOLED display we don't
have the battery in on this particular
device so it should have a similar kind
of feel to the Samsung Focus because it
has that same screen and in fact if you
tilt the screen in the light you kind of
see the blue color associated with that
Super AMOLED dudo on the focus if you
can get it in the light you just right
kind of difficult to do that let's go
there at next to the iPhone the iPhone
these days is made to look to have a
small screen 3.5 inches compared to the
large 4-inch display it seems that four
inches is really sweet spot nowadays of
course you want to go a lot bigger
you've got more HD HD - with a 4.3 inch
display and it's probably actually
thinner than the Nexus S actually so
that's quite interesting now I want to
take a look at this battery and see if
this battery is indeed the same battery
that is found on the galaxy s so pop off
the back on this take this out and no
actually it's not my mistake it is they
are both 1500 milliamp hours but
got a thicker battery here in a thinner
one for the galaxy yes so a lot more
coming up on the Google Nexus S really
excited to see how this next benchmark
Android device performs in daily use
curious to see how it works on the AT&amp;amp;T
network although I'm sure we know edge
speeds are pretty slow but maybe we'll
be surprised with a software hack in the
future that will bring the the Nexus S
to 18 t 3G no dedicated camera button
just noticing that now so a lot more on
this if you like the Google Nexus S
please give me give the video a thumbs
up leave a comment below on what you
want to see next that's it for now
