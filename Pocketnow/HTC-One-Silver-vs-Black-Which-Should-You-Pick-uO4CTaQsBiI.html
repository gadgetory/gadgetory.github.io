pocketnow.com wrapping up the HTC One
event in New York City by checking out
two different colors of HTC's new one
black and white or silver really you can
notice here these are very very very
different looking devices even on their
face you can tell that this kind of mid
waist is is called out this this edge to
edge black zone is much more apparent on
the silver version here and the
chamfered edge which was talked about a
whole lot this morning which you saw in
our hands on video is much much more
evident on the right hand side device
which is the aluminum version go ahead
and flip these on to their sides and you
can see there's a white band traveling
the circumference of the aluminum
version we continued that movement come
on back here you can see that the black
version I'm not sure if you can see it
because these tethers not sure if we've
complained about these yet on video but
they are really tight cheese so these
the black one here picks up fingerprints
a whole lot more the aluminum version is
a whole lot better at hiding those skin
oils and sweaty palms from being in a
hot room with too many clothes on it's
all going to depend on your personal
preference of course but this one the
aluminum version is going to stand out a
whole lot more in public you can see
those interesting design elements around
the camera called out a whole lot more
on mention it on to the thong if you if
you are Brandon minimun and you know we
come back around to the front and of
course you can you can just see I mean
eat this this is definitely the aluminum
version here is going to be the one that
you're going to want to bring out if
you're looking to catch some more
eyeballs not sure if you can catch any
of the Glens of the lights off that
chamfered edge we're not really sure
which one of these is going to chip
better which one's going to endure drops
better we'll have to see in our
long-term
but for now that is just a quick look at
the black and the white or aluminum HTC
One 2013 edition Michael pitcher will
talk it now stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
