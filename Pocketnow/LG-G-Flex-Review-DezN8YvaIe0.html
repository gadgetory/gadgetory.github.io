be thankful for this past Thanksgiving
the North American holiday was made a
little brighter this year with the
arrival of a South Korean product the LG
G flex we continue to be thankful not so
much just for the arrival of the device
itself but for what it represents
finally a major manufacturer has made a
bold move away from the sea of flat
slabs into something a little more
distinctive but while most good products
are distinctive not every distinctive
product is good so is the LG G flex a
smartphone you should consider buying
let's find out I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is our video
review of the LG G flex fair warning if
you're anything like us by the end of
this video you might want a G flex of
your own if you feel compelled to snap
one up do what we did visit Negri
Electronics who provided us with one of
our two demo units and while you're at
it
follow pocket now at the various online
watercoolers and here on youtube so you
don't miss future reviews more than
anything else the G flex is defined by
the shape that gives it its name a
gentle continuous curve from top to
bottom in daily use this curve does four
things first and probably most
importantly it makes the phone's massive
size easier to handle as it physically
brings the screen closer to your thumb
in one-handed operation second it makes
talking on the phone more comfortable
more akin to the old banana phones of
your third it gives watching video a
slightly more cinematic feel and finally
the G flexes gentle angle causes it to
conform much better to the buttock for
all you back pocket phone bearers out
there the G flex isn't just about the
curve though LG has also made the back
cover out of a urethane like material
which gives it the ability to heal
itself when scratched this finish is
incredibly slippery it feels like no
other phone material out there which is
fun in its futuristic tactility despite
its tendency to attract dust
we put the coating under stress in a
rare torture test here in the PocketNow
labs and while that coating didn't do
anything for deeper gouges it did indeed
eliminate light scratches given enough
time we'll drop a link to that torture
test at the end of this video so you can
refer to it for more detail like the
rest of the phone the 6-inch display is
curved it's P OLED panel rated at 720p
resolution you don't really notice the
step down from the 1080p resolution
standard on most flagships these days
the screens colors rich and beautiful
with high contrast and user controllable
saturation our only disappointment B
comes from the displays whites which are
gray murky and reminding us of the wet
newspaper look of earlier OLED displays
powering it on requires either a double
tap on the glass cover or a press of the
rear mounted power standby volume
collective which you'll either love or
hate we tend to like it though it does
make adjusting speaker volume tough when
the phone's sitting on a table under the
flexes Titan silver fuselage sits a spec
sheet familiar from LG's more
conventional g2 the extendable DMB TV
antenna is useless here in the States
but the rest of the guts certainly are
not the Flex is powered by the muscly
Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor backed
up by the now-familiar 2 gigs of ram and
the usual array of radios and interfaces
with 32 gigs of non-expandable storage
and a curved embedded lipo battery rated
at a whopping 13.3 watt hours it's
probably why the G flex sits a little
heavy in the hand at 177 grams but
somehow it doesn't seem as massive as it
is likely due to the hardware shape and
the space age back cover material
manufacturers take note it's amazing
what a little boldness in design can do
that's somewhat true for the phones
software as well LG's skin feels better
suited to the G flex than to the g2
slide aside multitasking it's still
pretty clumsy but the qslide mini apps
are more useful now that we have a
larger display to work with more
importantly LG's new dual window feature
allows you to use two apps side-by-side
it's not quite as mature as Samsung's
multi window offering you can't use as
many apps with LG's incarnation but
we're very glad to see it just the same
a big screen means very little if it
can't be used intelligently and with
this mix of multitasking options LG
passes that test
there are enhancements here even if
you're a one app at a time kind of
person - there's still the option to
install a little toggle in the HOME key
Road to deploy the notification shade
which makes up for that shade being so
far out of reach and quite overcrowded
out of the box the new flex theme is no
more subtle than its predecessors but we
like the new neon accents better than we
did the old cartoony bubbles little
touches like the animations when you
plug in a cable are quite nice and
almost every animation and scroll effect
can be tweaked if you're the tinkering
type you'll find an awful lot to keep
you busy here we tested the G flex
between rural New York suburban Greater
Boston and urban San Francisco over the
course of 14 days on AT&amp;amp;T HSPA Network
we haven't found any reception trouble
over cellular or Wi-Fi and neither we
nor the people we call have any
complaints about sound quality during a
voice call while we miss LTE speeds are
usually manageable over 3G depending on
what market we're testing it speed on
the software side is brilliant with
almost no lag even when playing games
like sky gamblers air supremacy or
asphalt 8 and even with high strain
action like this battery life is
outstanding wrapping up our first day
with the G flex saw has hit the 10% mark
only after 21 hours of heavy use and
nearly six hours of screen on time
that's awesome endure
it's the camera suite is just as well
developed here as on previous LG
smartphones and the company again uses
the rear notification light to good
effect tying it into the self-timer and
face detection features the 13 megapixel
camera module isn't the same one as used
in the g2 this one features faster
shutter speed and it does very well in
broad daylight especially when shooting
in dynamic mode making some very nice
photos possible even if the saturation
might be a little high for some folks we
like it
indoor shots get a little dodgy err once
you take the sunlight away noise starts
to crop into even well-lit scenes and
photos with sharp differences in
lighting reveal that purple blotting we
remember from the g2 there's also no
optical stabilization here we're not
going to lie that was pretty
disappointing but you can still get some
really nice stills from the G flexes
camera given the right combination of
lighting and patience all that holds
true in video performance as well
outdoor videos are sharp crisp and
soaked in beautiful color with audio
capture holding up pretty well even in a
gale-force wind
while indoors more noise creeps into the
image and brighter areas tend to appear
washed out we're hoping that can be
corrected via software update even
without it the camcorder is passable
it's just not outstanding
in this age of buzzwords and prosaic ism
you'll probably hear some people say
that the G flex is just a curved version
of the g2 that is not the case the G
flex flouts convention in a way its
predecessor never did it's curved
construction and self-healing coating
might seem like gimmicks but they work
to solve problems we've been complaining
about for a long time namely the
awkwardness and fragility of modern
large screen phones
aside from display resolution and OAS
the G flex makes almost no compromises
to achieve its unique form factor it's a
long lasting powerful smartphone with
software smart enough to justify the
hardware's bulk all that adds up to a
comfortable useful and truly beautiful
product one we'd love to see made
available in the United States we give
the LG G flex an eight point nine out of
ten we'd like to extend our thanks once
again to Negri electronics for our first
demo unit and two LG for the second
review device you can see our written
review on the LG G flex at pocketnow.com

said about this device until next time
this has been michael fisher with
PocketNow thank you so much for watching
and we'll see you soon
but while all yeah but while most here
but while most distinctive products are
good not all good products no that's not
right while not every good product is
most the LG G flex I need better Vanna
