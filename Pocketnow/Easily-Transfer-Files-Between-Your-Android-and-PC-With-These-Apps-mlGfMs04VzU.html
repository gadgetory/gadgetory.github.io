from your phone to your computer with
ease it's simple I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow
and this is how you transfer files from
your android phone to your computer
being an integral part of our lives we
all store mini files on our smartphones
and we store just as many if not many
more on our computers and if you're
anything like me you find yourself
constantly needing to share files
between the two fortunately if you're an
Android user that's a very simple task
you can always revert to the age-old
plug in your phone method and share
files that way however Google recently
changed this method Android now uses a
different protocol and it means that
your computer may not immediately see
your device as a storage drive so you'll
need to do a couple things to make sure
that works first if you go into the
storage settings on your device and tap
the action overflow button you can alter
your USB connection type and you can
either choose between media device or
camera which changes how your computer
recognizes your device MTP or PTP if
you're using OS X however you will need
to download Android file transfer once
you do simply plug in your device make
sure it's using MTP and you have a file
browser from your phone on your desktop
it's pretty simple and it's probably the
quickest way to get a file on your
device however it is not 2007 anymore
and plugging your device in to transfer
files is old school there are many ways
to transfer files between your computer
and your Android device wirelessly the
first of which is called AirDroid it's a
free application you can get from the
Play Store that allows you to transfer
files and control your smartphone from
your computer within a web browser any
web browser any computer is hardware and
operating system agnostic anything that
has a full web browser will do simply
open the application up on your phone
and follow the instructions it will give
you a unique IP address that you should
enter into the address bar in your
computer's web browser and it will also
give you a password so you can log in
this is a secure connection and as long
as you keep that password private and
select HTTPS you should be safe once you
log in you can immediately see all the
information on your phone you get
real-time stats on your phone such as
battery life and storage and you can
also see what all is on your device
pictures music movies you can access all
of this information directly from the
web browser you can also add or delete
file
from your phone install new applications
delete applications take screenshots and
pretty much everything of course there
are many applications such as AirDroid
one of the premium options that I've
been using for a long time is called
Wi-Fi File Explorer it is basically just
a file explorer for your phone and your
web browser such as AirDroid offers but
this one is a little more bare-bones and
straight to the point I prefer it for
transferring files as AirDroid is a
little more for controlling everything
if I only need to transfer a file I
usually fire up Wi-Fi file explorer when
you first open Wi-Fi file explorer like
AirDroid it will give you a unique IP
address navigate to that using your
computer's web browser choose the files
that you either want to download or
upload and wait I typically use Wi-Fi
file explorer for large files if you
have your phone charging across the room
or the house you simply start the
transfer and forget about it you don't
have to worry about anything it just
runs in the background and once it
completes you're good to go a
tried-and-true method that I've been
using for much longer than any of the
other methods is called Dropbox it's
nothing new many of you probably already
use it or know what it is basically it's
a cloud storage service that allows you
to store your files remotely and access
them from pretty much any device you may
own you can install Dropbox on your
computer or any of your mobile devices
and sync files between them it's
literally as easy as dragging and
dropping a file into the Dropbox folder
on your computer or simply choosing a
file to upload to Dropbox from your
phone once the upload finishes the file
is accessible on any of your Dropbox
capable devices the problem with Dropbox
however is that the transfer is a little
slower the reason why file explorer is a
little faster and better is because it
is a direct connection over your local
Wi-Fi network Dropbox sends a file to a
remote server and then you have to
download it there are a few steps in the
background that slowed this process down
but it's great if you need one file on
multiple devices there are of course
many other ways that you can share files
between your Android device and your
computer feel free to share any methods
