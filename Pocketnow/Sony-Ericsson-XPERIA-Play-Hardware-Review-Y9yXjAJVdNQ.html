calm and this is the hardwood review of
the sony ericsson xperia play and this
is the unlocked european version so it
may be a little bit different when it
comes out to verizon and to other
carriers in the near future so let's get
started so some preliminary specs to the
xperia play as it's running at a 1
gigahertz processing speed and that's
using a qualcomm snapdragon MSM 8255
processor we also have a 1 gigabyte rom
with 400 megabytes that are accessible
to onboard memory and applications the
dimensions of the play is 62 millimeters
across 119 millimetres high and 16
millimeters in depth so it's a pretty
thick device but it feels pretty good
while playing it feels exactly the same
thickness as the PSP go so we'll compare
that at the end we also have a 4 inch
LCD plastic capacitive multi-touch
screen and this is fwvga resolution so
that's 480 across x 854 pixels down so
it seems kind of odd that sony ericsson
would choose to use a plastic coating on
a high-end android device this is
running android 2.3 and it just seems
weird because most high-end androids are
not using a plastic screen because
plastic is really prone to scratches and
it doesn't seem as precise when i've
been typing on the screen so on the top
we also have our front facing camera our
headset speaker our earphone speaker i
should say we also have our proximity
and light sensor underneath this little
bar or sony ericsson emblem on the
bottom we have our back button our home
button our menu button and our search
button on the top of the device we have
our power standby button which also has
a little tiny notification LED inside
there that I believe turns on when
you're charging it on the bottom we have
our primary microphone we also have this
little tab from the battery cover the
Xperia Play does come in two colors it
comes in this black which has sort of a
blue metallic and it's very fingerprint
prone as you can see so it does have
this blue metallic gown or if you can
see that on camera may be right there
but and then also
in the white which is similar to this
PSP go has all saw that that silvery
coating inside of it so if we go to this
side of the device we have our trigger
toggles are right and left trigger
buttons we also have our volume rocker
on this side we have our 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and our micro USB 2.0
port we also have the best speakers I've
ever heard on any mobile device this is
true stereo we have our let's see our
right and our left speaker right here
it's probably the best sound that I've
ever heard from any mobile device so on
the back we have our secondary speaker
which is good for a noise cancellation
speaker phone we have our LED for our 5
megapixel camera camera which is also
capable of recording up to 720p we have
our exterior emblem right here and our
little sony ericsson decal so we can
take off the battery cover the battery
is a 1500 ml amp hour battery which sony
ericsson claims to supply enough power
for five and a half hours of gameplay
and around eight and a half hours of
talk time we have a microSD card right
here which is expandable up to 32
gigabytes and it does come with an eight
gigabyte card pre-installed so let's see
we have a gigabyte and it comes with a
class 2 so not the best we also have our
standard sim card slot I will just pop
this back on so if we slide open the
device we have our controls for these
xperia play games unfortunately the
games are a little bit different than
they are on the PSP go hopefully sony
ericsson decides to launch more games
right now there's not very many games
let's see here we only have a few there
on this device it came with five games
the controls are really easy to use the
directional pads are a little bit
different and they are not too many
games that utilize this right now
hopefully in the future it's a optimized
for better gameplay we also have our
menu button down here and our select and
start button so all in all the xperia
play is a great device for anyone that
wants to play games we just wish that
there are better games available at this
time hopefully when the
release comes to the state's on verizon
that the games will be better optimized
and hopefully they integrate some of the
PSP games to compare this to a PSP go
you can see that the device is very
similar in size of course the screen on
the Xperia Play is much better much
higher resolution than it is on the PSP
go the controls are very similar we can
open this up and you can see the
controls are very similar to one another
the only differences we have gotten rid
of this joystick and replaced it with
these directional pads here so the
Xperia Play is great all-around device
it's nice that it has all the required
hardware for android 2.3 so we have an
accelerometer a digital compass and
assisted gps this device also has Wi-Fi
b/g/n bluetooth 2.1 + edr so it keeps
everything connected it's nice to be
able to download games nao you know a
Wi-Fi n band opposed to the PSP which is
running at be banned so if you like our
videos make sure you give us a thumbs up
and also leave some comments down below
