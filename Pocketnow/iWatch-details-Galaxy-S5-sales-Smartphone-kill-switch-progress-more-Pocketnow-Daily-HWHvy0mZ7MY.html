the size variance manufacturers and
other details the Samsung Galaxy s5 is
already surpassing the company's sales
expectations and Google's modular
project r gets an estimated time of
arrival I'm high metal iveta and by the
time of the recording of this video the
game had not finished yet so you can
imagine why I'm rushing to get it done
this is pocketnow daily let's actually
off with some official news that's
actually kind of legal as we all know
the legislation that's been passing up
the smartphone Killswitch the idea of
actually killing your smartphone meaning
you will pretty much make it unusable if
it gets stolen it's a really interesting
legislation and just to confirm
companies have already committed to this
project HTC Samsung Apple Google among
other companies like to the scripture
for a full list of details and this will
happen as of jun 2015 and apparently it
will not be optional so let us know what
do you think will you think that this
will help the whole theft issue i
believe so and speaking of one of the
companies that's behind this legislation
google has just confirmed when we can
expect project are apparently the device
will be ready for anybody to purchase as
of January 2015 and probably the most
interesting features of this project is
that even though that modular phone is
actually ugly apparently it'll start
selling for 50 bucks we've already
talked about this previously but yeah
apparently the price tag will remain at
fifty dollars for the base unit which is
apparently a Wi-Fi only device that
you'll have to pay a cellular rater for
if you want to opt in for more things
but 50 bucks I mean that's really cool
to start with an mp3 player like this
and then just build a smartphone out of
it as your kid grows older or whatever
let us know what you think now a very
interesting feature that we discovered
yesterday as of what you can do with
Windows Phone 8.1 is the fact that it
now supports Apple's passbook protocol
for cards we already know that there is
a Microsoft wallet application and
apparently if you get any application
like for example United Airlines gives
you a card for your boarding pass like
you get on Apple's passbook this will
also work on your Windows Phone and
pretty much the same fashion it's really
cool sally passbook hasn't really been
like the biggest protocol out there it
hasn't really made a big boom but the
more companies that support this the
better and hate
break that Microsoft is supporting it
and speaking of Apple we get more
details on the iWatch we were hearing
that this device would have an ammo let
display from some company that I forget
its name right now but they get bigger
rumors from a more credible source that
says that this will be an oled display
from LG and that LG will be the only
manufacturer of the displace for this i
watch it will be a flexible OLED display
and apparently it'll be the one point
three inch and 1.5 inch rumors that we
heard different price points at
everything different sizes and
apparently it will launch by the fall of
this year which is really interesting
since I don't know how iOS 8 will
actually integrate with your health and
fitness if there is no wearable and
finally for the very interesting news of
the day those of you that are wondering
how hot is the galaxy s5 well it's very
hot it's pretty much selling almost in
every country in the world right now and
according to a company vice president it
is selling more than the company was
expecting and it will sell one in the
galaxy s4 which is a trend that they say
is logical for different reasons that
are in the lakes of the description and
I guess the question of the day would be
that you get a galaxy s5 is this device
that you're getting are you getting the
HTC One m8 are you waiting for the
iphone 6 and right particular case i'll
be honest with you i had the s4 i had
the s3 i'm carrying a note 3 I just
don't know that I behind the galaxy s5
hot enough and I do want the m8 more
though I do like the fact that this
phone is water resistant not waterproof
water resistant but leave us a comment

the news earlier before this video was
