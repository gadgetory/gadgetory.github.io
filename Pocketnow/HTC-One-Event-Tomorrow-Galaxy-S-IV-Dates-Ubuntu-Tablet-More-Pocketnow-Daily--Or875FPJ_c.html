we'll be all over it Ubuntu goes to the
tablet space as tomorrow apparently and
the Galaxy Note 8 seems closer than
expected I'm high Meadow me better and
yeah you're right I need to learn a new
language this is out daily now
one thing that's got me really bored is
all these rumors and teasers of a galaxy
no date without a device rumors have
Sammy working on releasing this device
around mid or late March apparently the
device will retail for four hundred and
eighty bucks at its entry level which is
kind of pricey for a tablet at this
price Ranger at this size at least but
we'll see now there is something very
special about Marsh so let's talk about
it in the next segment yes the galaxy s3
is what's special about March remember
recent rumors have the company launching
the device on march 22nd new other
rumors have the device being launched on
much 15 but apparently new very trusted
sources say that the device will be
announced on March 14th or probably be
announced even earlier but think about
this Galaxy Note 8 gaelic cs4 everything
being launched in march could it be that
these two devices are part of project j
and yes the galaxy s4 could probably get
the s-pen functionality now speaking of
more android now that the LG optimus g
pro is pretty much official aka samsung
galaxy note 2 rip off well there's a new
processor in town the snapdragon 600
which apparently is twenty-five percent
better meaning more efficient and faster
than the s4 pro that was on the optimus
g but stay tuned for that was a device
reaches the pocket now labs will test
the hell out of it and you'll know if it
is really as good as on paper now let's
talk about nokia mwc 2013 will be there
show floor but we've got some good and
some bad rumors apparently there will be
four devices being launched but wait a
second we know that the lumia 1001 of
those rumors and we'd love to see how
that device will be better than lumia
920 but sadly on the bad side of the
rumors we've got apparently of the nokia
tablet will not be launched we heard
earlier that apparently the device
wasn't ready but we knew that there were
three phones that were ruined and
apparently the fourth of us would be the
tablet so mwc 2013 our guys will be
there and they'll give you the news stay
tuned and finally for the interesting
news of the day we're
after me Ubuntu you bunt to your nuts
but anyways aside from HTC's big
announcement tomorrow apparently you
boom two will bring a new tablet
operating system to the market as of
tomorrow to mingle with their new
smartphone operating system that's not
even released yet but the problem is we
still don't know what to expect of the
operating system sadly the news are
quite scarce but it would be interesting
to see a lot of additional swiping and a
lot of additional paradigms the lock
screen that a boon to is brought to the
market but that leads you to the
question of the day are you holding off
whatever buying choices you have right
now with Windows Phone 8 Android and iOS
or blackberry 10 for example and trying
to get ubuntu in my case I have my
galaxy nexus right there just waiting
just in case but I don't know about you
do you want the operating system leave
us a comment down below and if you want
to lure a scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
old machine you follow us on target.com
and subscribe to our youtube channel as
well please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I'm hi never
leave it up thanks for watching and see
you tomorrow get your clocks 10 a.m.

pocket our life covering everything
that's going to happen at the HTC event
