galaxy s4 link suggests the verizon will
drop the droid DNA soon for the HTC One
and LG plans to make the optimus g pro
as hot as the galaxy s4 i'm high
marietta now if you see me a little buzz
that is not because of beer but really
about the second gallon of coffee this
is pocket out daily with all the galaxy
s4 bus today you'd think that their
competition would be with their arms
crossed but seriously it didn't happen
that way first of all HTC employees were
handing out water and chips to the press
at the New York City Music Hall and then
in Times Square LG had taller higher ads
of the optimus g pro on top of the
galaxy s4 ads so just to give you an
idea LG has just confirmed that they'll
be also shipping a new feature pack for
their lg optimus g pro with the idea of
bringing the eye control technology that
you also see in the galaxy s4 so it's
just a matter of time before HTC figure
something out as well stay tuned and
speaking of HTC for those of you
wondering when the HTC One will reach
verizon well it'll probably reach the
carrier earlier than you thought it was
plan to reach AT&amp;amp;T in March at some
point within the month and now
apparently the same document was leaked
recently mentioning that the HTC One
will also make it to verizon to replace
the droid DNA with them the same month
of March could it be the fact that
Verizon has just figured out the fact
that the DNA was not as hot as the HTC
One this could be the case though stay
tuned we'll keep you posted if these
rumors are actually true now let's move
away from Android for a bit for those of
you having issues with the live tiles on
windows phone 7.8 well microsoft is
already pushing the update in order to
be able to fix the live top issues along
with other complaints from windows phone
7.8 obviously it's kind of hard to tell
if you'll get it at this moment so
please leave us a comment down below if
you already got the update to Windows
Phone 7.8 and if you don't have any more
data issues with the live tiles that you
currently had and for those of you
interested in the blackberry z10 in the
United States well you think that
blackberry had enough with just one
event in New York City but they're now
going to have another one on march
twenty first to market of the price
again because it's being launched an
AT&amp;amp;T the next
a-and even though we still don't know
what's going to happen with Verizon and
t-mobile we do know that it's going to
reach sprint by March 28 so stay tuned
and finally for the news that all of you
have been either waiting for or dreading
for samsung is just unpacked their new
galaxy s4 and well it's pretty much the
same device that was already leased so
you pretty much already knew everything
about it or mostly everything from our
website but well we have a sleeker
design which is actually the good thing
but sadly in both happily TouchWiz is
almost exactly the same and even though
Samsung aspects some new features like I
control and also finger hovering and
next to wonder if this device will be
enough to pack as much buzz as the
galaxy s3 so that leads me to the
question of the day is the galaxy s4
your next daily driver with the HTC One
the blackberry z10 with the current
generation iphone 5 and almost every
other device out there do you think that
the galaxy s4 has everything for you to
want it in my particular case I do want
the galaxy s4 and the reason why is
because it's the only smartphone out
there that'll give you everything you
want without a compromise even though
the design is kind of question but leave
us a comment down below I know tastes
are different for everybody so let me
know what you think and of course for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
vote mushy followers on Parker now
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well basically this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary
venom thanks for watching see you
tomorrow of course if you wanted others
who the device will reach and in the
United States well it seems that the and
for those of you interested in the
blackberry z10 in the United States
those of you clicker but it still looks
a lot like the galaxy s3 that's pretty
much the unpause ative side
on positive is not a word</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
