Android wear smartwatches but also to do
so in a very bold way I'm hi Mary better
with pocket now here at Aoife 2016 and
let's have a look at the Q Marshall and
Q wonder all of pocket now Ziva 2016
coverage is brought to you by XCOM
global
now when I say bold were actually not
just talking about the legacy left by
the cue founder I'd highly suggest you
watch one separate video on the new
Michael Kors Android wear offerings as
these are actually made by fossil if you
didn't know now going back to fossil
smart watches the cue Marshall and Q
Lander are the company's latest
offerings under its own brand and are
essential if you're looking to take
advantage of almost everything Android
wear can do I say almost everything
because sadly essentials like the heart
rate monitor are not included but the
rest is pretty much here the cube
Marshall is the male ish more rugged
variant with a textured ring which
protects the glass display this is a 45
millimeter case that uses standard 22
millimeter watch bands with easy to
remove pins for the occasional swap the
q and er with the available dark option
is actually more of the female variant
with options for rose gold even if the
casing and the watch bands are pretty
much the same size and we're telling
them apart is more about the curved
display and the lack of the ruggedness
that you'll see on the Q Marshall inside
we have the latest Snapdragon wear 2100
processor details of RAM and glass
quality are sadly not provided but we do
know that we have four gigs of storage
and that we have ip67 water and dust
resistance both watches are of the few
that sported speaker bringing the latest
of what Android wear can do and even
though the demo software didn't really
allow us to go deeper into the operating
system to see what personalized watch
faces we have or what Android wear it
looks like here the experience is pretty
much standard and everything else sales
for these devices began two days ago at
$295 and we cannot wait to get them at
the pocket now labs for review instead
of paying horrible roaming fees when
traveling abroad or the hassle of buying
another sim why not try a smarter
