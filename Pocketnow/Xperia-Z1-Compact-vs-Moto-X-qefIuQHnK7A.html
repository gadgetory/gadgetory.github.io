Android smartphone but you're not
interested in stretching your pockets
with one of the Jumbo phones that are
quickly becoming the norm Sony and
Motorola are each heading into 2014 with
a nice option but which is the better
fit for you
let's find out i'm michael fisher with
pocket now and this is sony xperia z1
compact vs. motorola moto x from a
practical standpoint this choice is a
question of availability the Moto X has
historically been limited in its global
rollout with its most compelling
offerings confined to the US while the
z1 compact is currently only officially
available outside of the States so it's
likely that where you live is going to
have a big say in which of these you
favor but say availability isn't a
concern say you can get either of these
unlocked which you can and which we did
with our z1 compact from clove
technology well then the question
becomes one of philosophy because while
these are both mid-sized smartphones
with powerful capabilities they really
couldn't be more different in terms of
how they derive that power and what they
use it for take the z1 compact for
instance a Snapdragon 800 SOC lives
under it's casing nearly the most
powerful mobile processor you can find
today it's camera is an impressive 20
point 7 megapixels it offers a microSD
card slot for your storage needs and
it's all encased in a water and dust
resistant chassis like most Xperia Pro
duct the display is small at 4.3 inches
but sharp with great colors and
respectable viewing angles as we made
clear in our full review it's a very
powerful Android flagship shoehorned
into an extremely pocketable very pretty
casing it comes in a few different
colors but it's also in many ways quite
conventional the Moto X on the other
hand is anything but
Motorola's custom x8 mobile computing
system doesn't have the raw horsepower
of the Snapdragon 800 but it was built
with a handful of very specific features
in mind features that make using the
Moto X more can
and enjoyable than almost any other
Android smartphone the display is larger
at 4.7 inches and blacks are deeper
thanks to the AMOLED technology but
power users may be put off
there's no expandable storage here the
camera is a ho-hum 10 megapixel unit and
while the internals feature Motorola's
water-repellent nano coating it's not
actually rated for immersion or dust
resistance
the battle between conventional and
novel continues in the virtual world the
z1 compact features a heavily skinned
version of android jelly bean while the
Moto X thanks to Motorola's time as a
Google property runs an ear stock
version of Android KitKat Sony's UI is
quite responsive owing to the compact
powerful processor but it includes the
sort of add-ons we've come to expect and
frankly loathe from major manufacturers
namely a lot of portals to Sony branded
content that in most cases can be more
cheaply or easily had through the Google
Play Store
by contrast the editions Motorola has
brought actually deserved to be here
touch less control has only gotten
better since launch active notifications
are much smarter than Sony's more
traditional blinking LED and Motorola
assist has matured into a very handy
accessory for drivers and none of these
features impair the software's overall
performance the Moto X is as responsive
on 4.4 as it was when it launched with
4.2 it's a software cocktail that's
pretty tough to beat and thanks to many
of its features being Hardware dependent
it makes the whole Moto X package itself
pretty hard to beat as well but then
there's the matter of the camera though
we demonstrated with the pocket now
smart phone guessing game that the Moto
X is capable of surprisingly good photos
given the right conditions on the hole
we prefer shooting with Sony's excellent
camera on the z1 compact it's not so
much the end results in regular settings
it's the usual case of some shots look
better on this phone
others look better on that one
but Sony's viewfinder software just
offers so many fun and useful options
and they're all laid out wonderfully
plus the software stabilization makes
framing a photo such a smooth experience
and of course you've got that hardware
shutter key as well it all feels so
premium and Sony's intelligent auto mode
delivers much more true to life results
than Motorola's Auto HDR which often
produces ghostly halos around subjects
tied in with the compacts much higher
available resolution and better
low-light performance
it makes Sony's device the clear winner
for the photographically inclined
if you're going to be sharing media more
often than creating it though the Moto X
will be a better fit not only is the
screen more impressive but Motorola's
speakerphone just blows Sony's out of
the water
that'll matter more to gamers maybe than
anyone else but which one is best for
playing your favorite title will depend
on how much you're able to detect
framedrops Motorola's chipset doesn't
have the Brawn of Sony's but it's never
stopped us from playing any of the
graphically intense games we enjoy and
it also has an impacted performance of
those titles at least not enough for us
to stop playing as for voice calls a
direct comparison wasn't possible here
because we're using two different
networks but on the whole we prefer
talking on the Moto X after decades in
the business motorola has the
fundamentals down pat and the hardware
of the Moto X is also more comfortable
to hold up to an ear and finally
speaking of fundamentals battery life
between these devices is about
comparable or at least it was over the
course of our week of testing going back
to that notion of comfort that might be
the heart of this comparison because
while the Xperia z1 compact might pack
more power its Motorola's device we'd
recommend to those looking for a better
all-around Android experience it's a
close shave but to borrow a phrase from
Samsung the Motorola product just seems
designed for humans
more so than does the Sony product still
not everyone's made the same way and if
you're a power user with a real need for
expandable storage a super-fast
processor or a high-resolution camera
the Xperia z1 compact will be the better
fit just be prepared to pay a premium
for it
and our thanks one more time to the
folks at clove technology clove co uk if
you want a z1 contact of your own or
even a Moto X we thank them for the z1
