device running stock Android but with
the Chromebooks branding and design with
an expensive accessory a must buy if you
want to get the most of it it won't be
on everyone's shopping list this holiday
season but 24 hours in we're still stuck
in the honeymoon phase so let's enjoy it
while it lasts
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is a first impressions look at the
google pixel see you'll forgive me for
fawning a little bit folks my
expectations were so low going into this
having read the first wave of reviews
then i was surprised to discover how
much I actually liked the hardware here
the 7 millimeter thick casing is
anodized aluminum with precision cut
ports for speakers buttons and the
single USB port and there's no
traditional branding whatsoever here
just a thin ribbon LED that shows
Google's colors when it's in use and
shows you the battery charge with a
knock knock on the casing the Bluetooth
keyboard keeps the futuristic field
going also with aluminum construction a
minimal but spacious set of keys and
magnets super-strong ones that have fix
it to the tablet with a hinge that
allows for almost any angle you want
when you're done for the day you flip it
around in the pixel see turns into a
little karya balot book with the display
protected and the keyboard recharging
automatically via induction the
futuristic feel starts to fall apart a
little when you fire up the display not
because of the screen itself it's a very
nice IPS panel just over 10 inches with
over 300 PPI resolution but the software
running on it just isn't very well
suited for tablets its Android
marshmallow which means it's quite
pretty and actually pretty responsive
Google seems to have already fixed the
performance issues that plagued the
first wave of review units but many of
androids third-party apps still aren't
optimized for tablets an issue we've
complained about ever since the very
first Android tablet at the market about
five years ago
and the lack of multi screen or window
taps isn't just a missing checkmark on a
list of items we'd like to have it's a
big impediment to using the screen to
its fullest for example I just sold a
bunch of stuff on eBay trying to add up
all the profits using the onboard
calculator hopping back and forth
between the multitasking
eBay and it was just madness same for
trying to keep a video running while
keeping an eye on your Twitter feed or
really any other kind of true
multitasking in this way the pixel see
is a victim of its own very cool
illusion because of the excellent
keyboard and beautiful hardware it feels
a lot like an expensive notebook
computer but the software doesn't pull
its weight in this respect Android n
can't come soon enough keep in mind
that's what the keyboard attached folks
and as we mentioned in our iPad pro
review there are people out there who
don't need such an accessory people who
just want a sleek slim and good-looking
Android tablet so in our full review
we'll cover that angle too as well as
battery life which seems promising so
far
audio output which is loud but a little
tinny at first listen audio input the
four microphones have no trouble hearing
us a KO Google a and camera performance
which is important for video calls if
nothing else for now all I can say for
sure is if you're watching this as a
newly minted pixel C owner odds are
you're pretty satisfied even with the
handicaps that might be due to a
combination of the honeymoon phase and
reduced expectations but that's fine I
always relish the chance to live in the
future and that's what using the pixel C
feels like 24 hours in we've got much
more on deck for our pixel C coverage
folks stay tuned for our full review and
check out our coverage on the
competition both here on YouTube and at
pocketnow.com till next time this has
been michael fisher captain two phones
on twitter thanks for watching we'll see
you next time
