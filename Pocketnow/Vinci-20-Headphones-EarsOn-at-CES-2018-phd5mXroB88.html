truly smart headphones version 1.5
brought brains to over the Year design
and now it's time for the next chapter
with Jules Wang I'm Jaime better with
pocket now taking you to a visit of the
Vinci booth at CES 2018 what is Vinci
you ask well back in 2016 it ran a
successful Kickstarter campaign for its
first Bluetooth headset concept called
the Vinci 1.5 it had large screens to
put out neat visualizations while
playing music and users could touch the
display to control their music well that
may be a little too high-profile for
some people so instead of big screens
the new Vinci 2.0 has small screens on
either end of the wide neck band the
surface that comes into contact with
skin is made of elastomer Wow the
outside is made of sweat resistant steel
placed through vapor deposition
something the pebble steel had da Vinci
- still doesn't use buttons for music or
volume controls instead each earbud is
equipped with motion sensors that detect
up and down back and forth movements to
change loudness and track selection
while fully funded the Kickstarter
campaign is still on for the next few
days as of this post so you'll be able
to find options for on-board storage of
8 or 32 gigabytes noise cancellation and
even 3G antennas though all variants
will work with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to
connect to your major music services
like Amazon SoundCloud and Spotify
speaking of Amazon Alexa is also on
board for over 15,000 skills for your
service and it can pass along
notifications to I mean we're living in
