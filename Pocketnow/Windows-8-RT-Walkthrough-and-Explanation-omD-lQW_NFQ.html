pocketnow.com if you're confused about
Windows 8 RT and exactly what it does
and who it's for I don't blame you in
this video we're going to review Windows
8 RT so let's get to it now you might be
wondering why Windows RT why didn't
Microsoft just make a version of their
Windows 8 operating system to work on
tablets well that's exactly what they
did with art - you see Windows 8 works
with x86 processors and not ARM
processors ARM processors are the
low-power CPUs we find in smartphones
and tablets that would be like the
Snapdragon on the Exynos and the Tegra 3
which is what powers the surface for
example so by making a new version of
the operating system Microsoft is
creating a platform that can run on the
Snapdragon and the Tegra 3 and have much
better battery life than for example an
Intel Ivy Bridge notebook or desktop PC
so we get the power savings at the
expense of performance although these
arm processors are getting more and more
on par with what we can get on a desktop
CP like the s4 pro the Exynos the new
Tegra 3 that's coming out all have
desktop like performance of course the
big downside to RT is that you cannot
run applications pick any application
off the Internet Pandora Spotify aim
that is made to work on x86 chips it
will just not run on Windows 8 RT apps
need to be re-written to work in this
new environment which is a downside that
we're gonna see in a sec so Windows 8 RT
is the tale of two different worlds
neither of which are really that good or
or complete so the two worlds are here
the Windows 8 Metro environment
Microsoft doesn't like using more in
Metro anymore I thought that was awesome
now it's just called Windows 8 style so
that's the Live Tiles that's the 2d
typography like navigation UI that a lot
of people love it's refreshing it's fast
it looks awesome and it makes sense the
second world is the desktop and when you
install or when you turn on your Windows
8 RT tablet you will have a desktop icon
like I do here and it will dump you in
appears to be the windows 7 or 8 or
whatever version of Windows you're
thinking about desktop environment but
it's it's not it's totally different
it's kind of like a phantom desktop
experience and I'll show you why so when
you get this going on desktop you'll
have five icons to start you'll have
Internet Explorer which is version 10
which is interesting because there's an
Internet if we go back to the Windows 8
style apps there's an Internet here but
they're different browsers they work a
little bit differently which is strange
in addition to Internet Explorer you
also get file explorer Word PowerPoint
and Excel and I've added these three
just because I was kind of experimenting
trying to see if there's any other apps
I could install in this desktop
environment the answer is no for example
let's go into Internet Explorer 10 which
by the way has fantastic performance
very smooth performance and let's go to
Spotify let's say you get your RT tablet
and you think to yourself there's no
Spotify app in the market place the
Windows 8 app marketplace maybe you can
just download it and put it right onto
your desktop environment so Spotify
dot-com great on-screen keyboard by the
way if you ever wanted to know what a
Windows Phone keyboard would feel like
on a tablet this is it and it's
especially apparent and landscape
actually let me show you that real quick
let's open that again go into the
landscape
select delay there and we open the
keyboard this looks just like Windows
Phone II and it works very very well I
should add so let's go back into the
other orientation
let's close the keyboard okay so here e
on Spotify and where is the download
link let's click get Spotify ok and
where's the download button here just
download the Spotify client ok download
now watch what happens down here so far
so good do you want to run or save
Spotify Installer I'm gonna click run
running security scan and this app can't
run on your PC no apps can run here
because these are designed for x86
processors not ARM processors will there
be a Spotify version for example for ARM
processors maybe and it's likely to
show up in the Windows 8 app store so
you will be using it in the other
environment which is okay as long as it
happens right now there are just so few
apps that you can run especially on the
desktop now there are some cool things
about having the desktop on your tablet
even though it's not the full desktop
for example USB support so here we've
got my desktop Mouse here and a wireless
USB adaptor I'm gonna plug it in and
just like Windows does on a desktop it
detects and within seconds I've got a
mouse pointer and to be honest when you
use the desktop on Windows 8 RT a mouse
pointer makes a lot more sense because
menus are small and not touch friendly a
lot of the old Windows 7 UI is still
there which isn't a bad thing but the
checkboxes are tiny and the tabs are
just impossibly difficult to press so
having a mouse in this desktop
environment is just fantastic and the
great thing about the touch cover that
comes with the surface is that you get
the mouse you get the touch pad right
there at your disposal now let's plug in
something else to this USB Drive I've
got a camera over here just a digital
camera I'm gonna plug it in if I get it
in the right way there we go and let's
see what happens
tap to choose what happens with this
device great USB plug and play support
you can plug in printers and scanners
and it works well not scanners but
printers and mice and USB hard drives
and so forth and it works just like you
would imagine so here we can import
photos and videos open device to view to
view files or take no actions so really
cool having USB support on a tablet now
let's talk about these other things we
get here we get file explorer which
really isn't of much use unless you have
a ton of music and a ton of videos and
so forth that you want to manage with a
more advanced file explorer on your
tablet and then we've got these preview
versions of Word and PowerPoint and
Excel and the reason it's a preview is
because it's not complete yet you can
see right here it says preview edition
you're using a preview of Microsoft
Office 2002 thousand thirteen RT which
means in the near future there will be a
final version so this is not feature
complete but this is this is
word exactly as you would expect it you
can do everything you can do in in
regular word you can highlight like so
and then you can go over here to home
and you can make it bold italics and
underline and so forth you know how to
use word it's it's more touch friendly
but it's still not very touch friendly
again this is a UI that you want to use
with a mouse and by the way when you
save the default save option is actually
now to SkyDrive which is kind of cool so
if we go over to file and save as you
can see it saves by default the SkyDrive
instead of to your device so if you want
to save it to your device you can click
computer have it safe to your desktop to
your documents and so forth but we're
not going to save here so here on the
desktop we can do some other windows
like stuff we can go to control panel
but this is a different control panel
than the main control panel so down here
I'm gonna click on system if I can get
to it there we go
and this looks familiar right this is
kind of Windows 7 issues in Windows
Vista and all the previous versions
shows that we're running on an Nvidia
tegra3 quad-core CPU with two cucas gigs
of ram it's a 32-bit operating system
and so forth so again there's familiar
parts but it doesn't work very well
touch friendliness nor isn't real
desktop that's only in Windows 8 Pro so
that is the first world of the Windows 8
RT operating system and then the second
world which is really the primary way
you're going to be using Windows 8 RT
tablets it's the Windows 8 style Metro
look if you ever wanted there to be a
Windows Phone tablet UI this is it and
instead of scrolling up and down like
the live tiles on Windows Phone you
scroll side to side and these live tiles
have information in them some of them
you can turn it on and off for example
let's say you don't want to see this
these these news headlines be updated so
you take the tile you drag it down a
little bit there are a lot of gestures
you have to learn and you turn live tile
off and now it just says news and I kind
of like that cleaner look here and now
we can scroll to the right and scroll to
the left we can actually zoom out if you
have a ton of these and we can rearrange
our groups here so you can group
and again there's some gestures you have
to get used to we can move entertainment
over here we can move web over here or
we can rename things so we take the
group we drag it down and what we can do
is change the name group right there and
we can make new name groups so you can
really organize things the way that you
want and you can also kind of have more
symmetry or less symmetry depending on
what kind of look you like so for
example over here I've got these white
aisles and then I've got these kind of
small tiles so two and then one and I
kind of like the look of that now the
way you get apps to this is only one way
you go to the store here and the store
really doesn't have that much stuff
right now you're not gonna find chrome
you're not gonna find Instagram you're
not gonna find Facebook or Twitter it's
a matter of time hopefully until the
Windows 8 app store has all the apps
that you use but you never know maybe
there will never be a Chrome or a
Facebook there probably be a Facebook
but there's no guarantee that there will
ever be apps that you actually want to
use in the Windows 8 RT Store and as of
today we're in late October 2012 there
are not enough apps to make this usable
but let me show you some cool apps that
I have downloaded so here I've got I've
got productivity listed here here's my
mail app which for some reason does not
have unified inbox but it's got a really
great interface it it's it's fast it has
gestures where you can swipe to the side
to check off certain different things
and multiple actions at one time some
other apps we've got here we've got
calendar we've got weather and these
metro-style apps I'm going to call the
metro are quite beautiful you swipe to
the side we get all kinds of information
it's a little bit laggy here this is a
has has some performance issues on the
surface RT but just beautiful style apps
there's an advertisement and you can do
some really cool stuff with this in
terms of multitasking so if I do a swipe
from the left and then back I sweat to
the right and then back left I get a
list we'll go there in a second I get a
list of all my recently used apps and I
can actually open two at a time so I
take this well you actually have to have
an app open so if I go like this and I
open up the tray here and I take
Internet Explorer and I kind of bring it
over to the side this app moves over and
now
supercool I get a little little
web-browser over here while I have my
email on the right it's super helpful
this divider doesn't really allow you to
precisely divide the screen it's kind of
one out of two but it's still really
cool to have and it becomes very usable
when you are using two apps at one time
and so here I am looking at an email I
can actually read it and I'm browsing
the web and the responsiveness is just
is just fantastic now another thing you
have to keep in mind about Windows 8 RT
is all of these gestures so there are
besides the gestures I just showed you
for multitasking you can swipe all the
way back to bring up your previously
used apps and this is super helpful and
it looks great and it's a great way to
multitask unfortunately you can't go
back to the other ways so you can go
back to the previous app but you can't
go forward to the one that you just used
which is kind of weird if you swipe from
the right you will get the charms so at
any point you can go back to the Start
screen with the charms you've got
sharing options you can access devices
settings and Universal search which
actually works quite well and searches a
wide variety of things so down here we
can search being we can search all of
the built-in apps that we have here and
of course we can search the web now
let's take a look at some of the
third-party apps that I've downloaded
and by the way Facebook and Twitter
these are just web shortcuts they're not
actually apps so it's going to
twitter.com there and this Facebook icon
goes to facebook.com and it seems that
Facebook and Twitter have Windows 8
style icons that push you down whereas
pocket now we haven't yet Donal Windows
8 style icon so we get that little fav
icon in that small little frame now
let's talk about some of these built-in
apps Hulu Plus Netflix they all work
great this is the best game that I found
for Windows 8 RT it was ten bucks and
you know ten bucks isn't that bad of a
price to pay for an app if it's console
quality if it provides hours and hours
of gameplay this is an app that probably
gives me about five hours of gameplay
and the graphics aren't even
good so this is like I said a little
blurry right now this is the best app
that I found in the Windows 8 app store
that works with Windows 8 RT and so
we're gonna go single-player
let's do race let's take a look at the
graphics here we get the kind of quality
of games that we get here in the the
Microsoft Windows 8 app store big names
for these things alright so here we are
and it's not accelerometer control it's
controlled with this little joystick and
you know the I love the texture of the
water it looks good but what you're
gonna notice is a lot of lag and
hesitation and again we paid 10 bucks
for this game keep that in mind I feel
like if you bought this an iOS or an
Android it would be half the price or
less that's a bad precedent that Windows
8 apps see that lag the Windows 8 apps
are going to be more expensive just
because they're Windows apps that that
that's an old model from the past so
this looks pretty good when you're not
doing something with a lot of action and
the frames drop down but this is an
example of one of the best games that I
could find in the Windows 8 app that's
of Turbo Booster now my Windows 8 app
store which they need to give a better
angle Oh got a whole the same all right
let's go back to the Start screen music
is an awesome feature of Windows 8 and
Windows 8 RT and what it allows you to
do is listen to music for free with ads
but you get to listen to any song you
want so it's like Pandora that's ad
supported but unlike Pandora you can
dial in any artist that you want and we
can use that handy charms bar to bring
up the search here and let's search for
say Lady gaga if I can't type I've got
Lady Gaga and let's bring that away just
swipe it off to the side found Lady Gaga
Explorer artist we can do smart DJ
really awesome music experience
something you don't get built into
Android and iOS in those operating
systems you got to buy music where you
download a third-party app like Spotify
or our do that allows you to pay a low
monthly fee and so we've got Lady Gaga
beautiful
Metro look we've got songs we've got
albums just an awesome awesome awesome
music experience and it's around ten
bucks if you want the unlimited service
with no advertisements so two thumbs up
for the music experience here in Windows
8 RT n in Windows 8
another cool part of this is the video
experience which is very much like
Google Play very much like the iTunes
store where you can rent movies for
$4.99
sometimes a little bit more you can
download videos and TV shows the
selection isn't as good as the other
stores that's probably only a matter of
time Microsoft has been building up
their catalog a lot because Zune and all
those music and movies and TV shows
so again quality is really good that I
found this is a high def screen it'll
play 720p it won't play a full 1080p
you'll have to get the surface 8 Pro or
other higher-end tablets in order to do
so now let's say you want to add some
apps to the Start screen here the way
you do that is you flick up from the
bottom and that's how you access
settings in any apps so let me actually
go back to music and you can see if I
flick up from the bottom I get to see my
recently played music and my play
controls and open file and so forth so
that is a universal gesture so if I do
that and I click all apps I will get
every single app that is on the device
here including the ones from the desktop
interestingly so let's say we want to
get a note pad for some reason and you
kind of drag it down and you can pin it
to the taskbar or unpin it in the
desktop which is weird kind of going
back and forth we can pin it to the
Start screen which is what we're going
to do let's go back and see where it
went all the way to the end and then
this is weird you're dumped into the
desktop environment that really is
strange speaking of the dichotomy
between the desktop and the Start
experience let's go into the web browser
and this is the touch friendly web
browser and it's actually quite
impressive so if we press on the address
bar we get recently used big tiles of
apps that we've or websites we've
recently gone to and if we bring that
away and we swipe up from the bottom we
get all of our open tabs right now on
these be
touch-friendly tiles and something that
you can actually do here is you can
choose to open this on the desktop so
this is kind of strange it'll load the
page in the other Internet Explorer 10
which is strange and I don't understand
the purpose for that I would understand
a purpose for a similar button and by
the way it logged me out here almost as
if the desktop and the windows 8
experience were totally different I
would find it more useful if there is a
button to move this page into the more
touch friendly environment of the
Windows 8 Internet Explorer so again
this is very confusing it doesn't really
make that much sense and then if we flip
back we can open up this browser and I
guess if you really wanted to you could
you could open up both browsers at one
time we could stretch this a little bit
and now what we have is a browser and a
browser but they're the same and yet
they're different ones has me logged in
and one doesn't it's confusing tonight I
can't claim to really understand why
there are two browsers so we can
probably spend another 20 minutes
talking about Windows 8 RT and all the
different apps but I wanted to spend
some time explaining the differences
between RT and helping you to understand
what it is Windows 8 RT is two different
worlds a desktop world which really
isn't a desktop world because you can't
run desktop apps and it's a tale of a
world where there are windows 8
beautiful metro-style apps that look as
awesome as you think they do that feel
as nice as they as they do but there are
so few to choose from right now in the
store and we don't know if that's going
to change it took Windows Phone a very
long time to reach the point where most
major apps are there finally Windows
Phone is there what Windows 8 take a
year two years to get there will it ever
get there because it's unproven and
because it's got such competition from
iOS and Android the developers want to
create apps for yet another touch
platform we'll have to see but if I were
to offer a recommendation it would be to
wait on Windows 8 RT apps wait until the
apps catch up and then go in and look at
the hard
we're out there because right now it's
just not a pretty picture so let us know
what you think about Windows 8 RT leave
a comment down below and of course soon
we will have our full review of the
Microsoft Surface which is actually some
pretty impressive hardware Microsoft did
a great job with it if you like this
video please give a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
