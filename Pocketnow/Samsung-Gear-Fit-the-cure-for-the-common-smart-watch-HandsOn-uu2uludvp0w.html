handed the galaxy gear to even and even
the Galaxy gear 2 neo we didn't
necessarily expect this time sorry
galaxy fits a new small business focus
wearable from Samsung let's check it out
so the fit plays along with the galaxy
s5 is also compatible with 20 additional
Galaxy devices so it's not confined to
the s5 but you can use it with the s5 as
you can see a much much spelter take on
the wearable concept than the the galaxy
gear which I actually have on my wrist
right now you can see the size
difference there Samsung is claiming
this to be the perfect first for the
AMOLED display on a wearable as you can
see the display itself is curved not
just over anything this device is very
very light it weighs 27 grams where you
are this with the straps are and Samsung
informed us the strap is also
hypoallergenic so you're not going to
get a weird skin reaction or look at
this thing I mean you know whether you
like the look of this or not is it's
gonna be up to you but the appearance
it's just worlds above I think anything
else in Samsung's wearable line there of
course it is a touchscreen you get all
the same notification support as you do
on the existing gear line but in a much
much smaller package you know there is
also around back as we saw in the new
year's still heart rate sensor not quite
sure if you can see that in there
measures your measures your heart rate
with
and you come back around here see
actually if you hop into the heart rate
applications you have to be wearing the
device for it to be for that sensor to
be reading your your heart rate so
hitting start won't do anything right
now but zero that's green very very
responsive here's some of the features
obviously a very very fitness focused
device but you know I can see these
being used by people who are not
necessarily it's I would wear this and
I'm not necessarily you know a runner so
and then you up in any case this is a
quick look we'll get back to this no
word on battery life no word on pricing
at the moment but we will get back to
this because I like it a lot and I
really really want to snap one up for a
review Michael Fisher with pocket now
