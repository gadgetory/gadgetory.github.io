Pacquiao calm and in this video we're
taking a look at opera mobile 10 beta 3
with previous versions of opera mobile
10 we mainly saw bug fixes and slight
performance enhancements but with this
latest beta opera has actually included
flashlight support this allows us to
watch embedded YouTube videos and other
content we typically wouldn't be able to
see otherwise so let's take a look at
this early implementation and how well
it works on a device like the touch pro
2 so here we are on the pocket now
homepage after enabling plugins in the
settings and if you pan around the site
you'll notice that there are some
placeholders for certain pieces of
content many of these are simply to
disable ads to help speed up page
loading but if we go to the side bar
where we normally feature our latest
video we can actually access and play
enough so let's zoom in by tapping once
and we'll tap again to access the
content and now we wait while the
familiar YouTube player loads
there it is so let's press play and it
should take a moment to load and then
hopefully begin to play there we go as
you just heard the audio chops a bit in
the beginning but eventually it
straightens out the video footage isn't
the best but we can still recognize
what's going on if we double tap on it
while it's playing it'll actually expand
to fit the screen you can also rotate to
landscape I should note that performance
depends highly on device hardware so
while playback is average to pour on a
device like this it's probably quite
nice on a powerful device like the hd2
okay so let's take a look at one more
video example okay so now we're at the
youtube com and i've loaded the latest
episode of the console wars from
TechnoBuffalo calm so it should load in
a second
so let's go ahead man who acts as a
screen where's once again and tied up in
the later round will be comparing the
gaming performance before we get to that
in this round will be taking an in-depth
look at the media playback features so
once again hold onto your hats and get
ready for some heavyweight game console
action it's LP from techno bubble and
welcome to the next installment of the
console
you
okay I think you get the point so this
was a look at opera mobile 10 with flash
while performance wasn't great having
flash support is definitely a step in
the right direction to enhance the user
experience and functionality of the
browser and although it's not full flash
last night 3.1 still enables us to view
some flash content on the web now opera
states that this is only in its alpha
stages and should be considered
experimental so we're excited to see how
this pans out by the time opera mobile
10 comes out of beta that's it for now
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
