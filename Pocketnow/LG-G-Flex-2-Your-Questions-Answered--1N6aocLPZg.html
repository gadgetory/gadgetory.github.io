everything you wanted to know about the
LG G flex 2
well I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
here with your answers quick note folks
our full video and text reviews are live
now here on YouTube and at pocketnow.com
so feel free to check them out for more
in-depth coverage also if your question
isn't answered by this video tune in for
our special G flex 2 episode of the
pocket now weekly podcast going live
Friday February 20th at midday Eastern
we'll be taking your questions live on
the air follow us on social media so you
don't miss it and look it up here on
YouTube or on your podcasting app of
choice if you already have that being
said let's get down to your most
relevant and upvoted questions lunatic
fringe asks does it overheat this is
probably the most common question
concerning the G flex 2 and the short
answer is no it doesn't overheat but
that's not necessarily good news from
what we can determine the Snapdragon 810
inside the G flex 2 does indeed tend to
run hot and because of that it's
throttled often and heavily by the
software that tends to make for more lag
stutter and hesitation than we like to
see on flagship smartphones well it's
not always a problem it's very
frustrating when it does crop up the
good news is LG is aware of this issue
and has released a statement regarding
it which you can read in our full review
or our video review and we've also
pasted it in the video description below
petrus B asks is it easier to pocket
than similarly sized phones specifically
the LG g2 I don't have a g2 on hand to
test against the G flex 2 but it's
definitely an easy phone to pocket
obviously that's true for the back
pocket where the Flex can more closely
conform to your posterior but front
pocket carriage is actually pretty
comfortable too it's important to keep
in mind that a 700 radius curve isn't
actually that dramatic so it doesn't
feel as awkward in the front pocket as
many might think the only time it
actually does feel a little funky is
when it's placed in the pocket with the
curve facing out so yet don't do that
SG console wants to know how does Peola
look out in the sunlight by which he
means the people LED display and the
answer is it looks great when you can
see it despite using a totally different
display technology than the g3 the G
flex has its same problem it just can't
get bright enough to overcome really
bright sunlight those you can see on an
overcast day like when we have here
today it does just fine in the Sun
though you do have to squint a lot and
if you're using your phone heavily
expect the brightness to go even dimmer
as the thermal throttling kicks in and
dis allows the brightest screen settings
boaty wants to know among other things
what the front camera quality and angle
is like in brief the G flex 2 has a
serviceable selfie camera it's pretty
low res at 2.1 megapixels and it's got
the same digital artifacting problem as
the main shooter in low-light but it's
got a wide angle and a very dramatic
beauty mode for covering up skin
blemishes so assuming you don't take
yourself too seriously
which you shouldn't if you take a lot of
selfies it's a pretty solid selfie
shooter buyo Ncube asks if we can
address the average screen on time and
battery life and the answer is both are
really struggling on our f5 10's demo
unit with moderate use i've never gotten
past 3.5 hours of screen on time over 16
hours uptime this is directly tied to
the performance issues mentioned before
and we're hoping LG is able to correct
all of it with software updates because
for now it's not a great experience
and finally McDow ski asks what he calls
the only question that matters is it
worth getting and not just in a it's
pretty good if you want to be different
kind of way is it good enough to get
over other flagships the answer is
contained in our full review but in the
spirit of not copping out I'll preview
it here in brief I would consider the G
flex 2 in its current state if I really
really wanted to be different but even
then I'd wait to buy it until LG fixed
some of the issues discussed in this
video for more on that yep you guessed
it check out our text and video G flex 2
reviews if we missed your question in
either this video or our review once
again tune in to
PocketNow weekly episode 136 where we'll
be talking even more about the LG G flex
2 also be sure to subscribe here on
YouTube and as always thanks for
