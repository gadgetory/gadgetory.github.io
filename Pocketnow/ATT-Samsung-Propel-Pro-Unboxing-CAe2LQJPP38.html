pocketnow.com
and this is the unboxing video of the
samsung propelled pro now in the AT&amp;amp;T
network now this device should have been
called the blackjack slider and you'll
see why in a second this is the first
Windows Mobile non touchscreen device
ever to have a 320 by 320 display most
other devices of this kind of a 240 by
320 display so having the extra pixels
should allow for better web viewing and
better email viewing that sort of thing
so let's get to the unboxing typical
AT&amp;amp;T style box propelled pro Wi-Fi GPS
alright let's get inside so I've got
some software and some documentation
wrapped up in plastic we'll put the
device to the side for a second and
let's see what we have in terms of
battery size the battery size is 1440
milliamp hours that is quite large
almost as large as the epics then we
have Samsung's proprietary charger same
charger used for the blackjack and other
Samsung devices and then we have a USB
cable for sending data over okay so
let's take a look at the device it's a
very short device of course because the
keyboard slides up and has a nice amount
of spring assist with that let's take
off the piece of plastic here very
Cromie shiny screen here basically just
it's just a screen in your hand you
could probably use this as a mirror if
you wanted to feels nice in hand it
feels very light right now because the
batteries out of course so let me tell
you why this is kind of like the Black
Jack slider so I'm gonna take out the
keyboard and I'm gonna bring out the old
black jack the first black jack and you
probably remember that
then came the blackjack - and then came
the epochs which brought a touchscreen
but some people thought this should be
called the blackjack three and now we
have the propel Pro so all these devices
together are similar form factor where
there's a keyboard out in the front but
Samsung actually changed the keyboard
for the propelled Pro it's no longer the
keyboard where there are these big
spaces between the buttons now we have
kind of a more motorola q9h like
keyboard and remember the q9h looks like
this so that may mean that the keyboard
of the propelled pro is really fantastic
anyway let's take a look at how this
compares to other similar devices so we
just saw the q9h let's look at thickness
the propelled pro is much thicker but it
can't be any thicker than the pantech
matrix Pro which is the thickest device
I think has ever been released in the
world probably not but close to it and
let's see how it compares to the epics
it's taller of course when you slide out
the slider and it is actually about the
same thickness I'd say a little bit
thicker then next to the blackjack -
which was a very popular device of
course it'll be taller
although the screen has more pixels on
it and this is an interesting d-pad
anyway so a lot more coming up on the
propel Pro I think this is the potential
to be a really fantastic windows mobile
device we're gonna talk about hardware
coming up next - that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
