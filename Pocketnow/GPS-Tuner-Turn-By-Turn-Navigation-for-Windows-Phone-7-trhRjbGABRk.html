and there's a new turn by turn GPS
navigation Program out for windows phone
7 so let's check it out this is from GPS
tuner and every time you open it there's
this got accepted disclaimer and it
loads up the interface and it picks up
right where you left off if you had a
navigation route set up so let's take a
look Thea to face a little bit up here
we have distance to your next turn the
speed and also text describing what
you're supposed to do next turn right
onto rocks be drive and then blah blah
blah and we have an estimated time of
arrival and the distance to the
destination that I picked then here's
your little menu tray so i can switch to
the roadmap and i can access favorites
so if there's a location that i want to
say if I can see it as a favorite and
there's settings
so running under lock screen that's good
if it shuts off or goes to sleep mode
you'll still have it going units voices
enable voice navigation that's on and
there's little info and here's our
search button so there's your search
field and you can just type in whatever
and find a location
see little dots up there it's searching
and there's some pizza places nearby
let's see if we can get that one and so
there's that and I can either add as a
favorite call them or just go there and
it's hard recalculate keep straight 175
yards and turn left so there's the voice
here's a mute button in case you get
annoyed by that voice here's the zoom
buttons however you can multi touch but
that might be something you don't want
to do while driving so maybe there's one
buttons are easier and you see if I pan
away I can press this to go back to
where I am alright and let's see how
this does while driving okay let's see
if that'll hold up hopefully nothing
falls over
yeah 100 yards turn left 100 yards turn
left okay turn left
okay so far so good oh well that's about
it you see the voice prompts go pretty
nicely
but my Stan doesn't work too well so
hope you enjoy this video looks like a
pretty cool gps navigation program its
cost five dollars in the windows phone
marketplace there's a free trial that
will only work for distances of about 20
miles or so replanting if I remember
correctly that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
