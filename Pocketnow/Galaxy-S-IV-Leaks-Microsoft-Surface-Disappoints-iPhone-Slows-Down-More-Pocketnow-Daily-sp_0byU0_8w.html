display Microsoft Surface disappoint
when it comes to sales and Apple scales
back their iphone 5 production I'm hi
meri beta definitely battling with Las
Vegas cold and this is sparking out
daily Samsung has just begun 2013 with
their usual teasing and this time with a
slide presentation that shows us the
screen resolutions and screen sizes of
all their galaxy s lineup now the
interesting part is that this slide
presentation does include a four point
nine nine inch call at five inch 1080p
display device coming in q1 2013 and q1
2013 doesn't include may that would be
sometime probably at mwc so hopefully we
will see a galaxy s4 being launched
before expected now speaking of the
galaxy s line of Samsung is now
celebrating that they sold their 100
millionth galaxy s unit that would mean
that from the first galaxy s device that
was launched three years ago up to the
current galaxy s3 they launched and sold
a hundred million units and if you think
of it Apple celebrated that same number
a couple of months after they launched
the iphone 4 which would mean for
generations and that could really mean a
lot in the fact that while the iphone is
currently the most so device in the
world but samsung is really catching up
that's nice now speaking of Apple and
their iphone 5 reports have the company
scaling back production on the current
generation iphone 5 when it comes to
manufacturing and also in orders of
supplies could this be that the company
isn't selling or having the same demand
that they had originally well usually
that's the case but it could also be so
many other things now if you think of it
the iphone 5s always has been Apple's
most selling iphone ever s would happen
with previous generation iphones but as
we saw at CES 2013 everybody was
carrying a galaxy note 2 and yes i'm
going to pull it out of a pocket because
yeah that includes me now speaking of
low sales reports have the microsoft
surface falling short of expectations i
guess that didn't only happened in the
review arena microsoft was speculated to
sell 2 million units by the end of 2012
and sadly they only sold a million units
now if you think of it though Apple's
first generation
ipad barely reached 1 million units
after three months in the market so it
could just be that this is not a bad
number but nobody that I know actually
likes the Microsoft Surface I was you
can tell me otherwise in the comments
down below obviously and finally for the
man whatever news of the day Huawei has
just proven to the world that they can
sell a quad-core smartphone for cheap
which is the case of their new g520
smartphone it comes to certain markets
for twenty to twenty-five dollars apiece
if you think of it I mean Huawei has
tried so hard to surprise everybody and
as we saw at CES 2013 their devices look
good but they didn't perform great at
all so that leads you to the question of
the day even if it's this cheap I mean
what do you think about Huawei in their
strategy in our particular case we are
disappointed that the company talks a
lot about competition but they don't
really deliver so leave us a comment
down below and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on Parker now calm
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm Hyneman
ravenna again apologizing for the cold
see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
