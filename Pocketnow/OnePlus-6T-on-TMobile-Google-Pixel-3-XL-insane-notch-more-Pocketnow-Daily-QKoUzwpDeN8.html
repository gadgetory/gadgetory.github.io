sixty coming to the United States this
fall with a killer price tag and even a
US carrier the pixel 3 Excel was just
stopped in the wild and we really hope
that Google is just playing with us and
we also get some interesting rumors of
the Apple watch series for that reveal
specifications and the price I am high
in metal Iveta
my cold is getting better and I
seriously am so sick I didn't even know
that it was Friday now I'm just forced
to celebrate this is pocket out daily
the official news today began with deals
as specify has just launched their
two-day anniversary and they've got a
ton of good options some of them are up
to $600 off when it comes to MacBooks
which is rather weird but actually
happening so you can learn more about
everything in the description it depends
on really what you're looking for now
let's talk about the affordable MacBook
Air as we hear rumors this product was
actually ready since last year but the
chips were not ready and so we're now
gonna get it until the next couple of
weeks and apparently the problem with
this whole rumor is affordable MacBook
Air for $1,200 what is we were hearing
anything below a thousand not 1200 so
we'll see what we get and speaking of
Apple we've got rumors of the Apple
watch series for a possible September
12th announcement we hear that the price
tag is going to remain the same around
three hundred and fifty two hundred
three hundred and ninety something
dollars we also hear that the display
bezels are getting smaller better
sensors for fitness better battery life
and apparently the buttons are now going
to be capacitive sort of like what we
have with the iPhones iPhone 8 iphone 8
plus so that's gonna be interesting
we'll see and Holy Mary Mother of
notches something just happened right
now in Canada where the Google pixel 3
Excel apparently was spotted and there's
a photo and wow that not really
according to the recap the surges of
tsypko that thing is huge it looks
completely asymmetrical to the bottom it
seems that this is probably the final
design we're hoping that this is a joke
that this is again to speak rumors
oh but seeing it in the wild running
Android pee that's a tough one
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the oneplus 60
yes the rumors have begun and the source
is apparently getting information from
t-mobile that this phone is coming to
the United States to t-mobile and it's
going to be dubbed the flagship killer
as part of the company's whole uncarrier
plan five hundred and fifty dollars
changes in the design we hear that the
notch on this display is gonna look a
lot like the Oppo f9 that I have here
which I know it looks it looks so cool
the Dodge is seriously very small and
let me know what you want to know about
this phone in the comments but yeah
apparently the price is $450 obviously
great specifications and this is gonna
be the time when oneplus finally nails a
US carrier let us know in the comments
what do you think do you think that this
is a great strategy $450 a US carrier
and the new design because in my case I
I like this display definitely we'll
have to see what they're bringing to the
back and the specification but I trust
oneplus in that part leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
