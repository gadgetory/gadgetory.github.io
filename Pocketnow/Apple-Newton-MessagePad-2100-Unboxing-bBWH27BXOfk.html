pocketnow.com and today we're unboxing
the Apple Newton message pad 2100 and no
it's not 1997 but if it was I would have
just paid $1,000 for a device that
doesn't have a color display so why is
pocketnow.com covering a device that has
been extinct for 11 years well I'll tell
you why the Apple Newton was Apple's
first attempt at a handheld device it
wasn't terribly successful there were
many iterations this was the last
iteration of the message pad form factor
so you could consider this to be the
most refined of the Apple Newton devices
the Apple Newton did a lot of
interesting things it had a virtual
QWERTY keypad it had word suggest
suggestions via a pop-up menu it did
shape recognition it had handwriting
technology that's actually been
integrated into OS X version 10.2
and this really started the wave of
handheld devices the Palm Pilot came out
during the year that this became that
this was on sale for its last year so
the Palm Pilot was kind of the answer to
the the Apple Newton and of course
Windows Mobile or Windows CE II came a
little bit a little bit later so let's
talk specs this thing has 162 megahertz
processor it's a strong arm processor it
has eight megabytes of ROM four
megabytes of RAM and four megabytes of
flash memory so you're not gonna be able
to store too much music on this thing
the screen is surprising the kind of
high resolution it's 480 by 320 that's
the same resolution as the iPhone but of
course it can only display 16 shades of
grey so you won't be able to see your
pictures very well on there
it's got two PCMCIA slots which is
pretty amazing so you can use laptop
expansion cards with this if you have
the right drivers for it which may be
difficult to find today for me and it's
powered with four double A batteries
which is good because getting a device
that this old would mean that the
battery doesn't work at all but I can
just pop in for double-a batteries okay
let's get to the unboxing and obviously
this is a use device I do not have a
time machine but it should be in good
condition so let's unbox it now
okay I've got something here it looks
like a charging cable and I'm sure this
isn't the original packaging I can't
wait to see this thing Wow
it is it is huge it's a nothing else in
there here is the device I can tell you
that it feels about as heavy as a brick
and what do we have here is this a
stylus or is it yes it's a stylus that's
in the shape of a pen let's see it's a
non collapsible stylus just kidding
obviously it's not going to be
collapsible so let's let's actually open
the the packaging here
without scratching the screen hopefully
it feels it feels high-quality maybe
that's because it's actually quite heavy
so this is the Apple Newton message pad
2100 and it looks like there is some
sort of pop open screen protector this
thing is absolutely massive up here it
says Newton technology apples spun off a
there division of that was making the
Newton into its own division so that's
why it says Newton technology up there
but let's take a look at this thing it's
huge I can't wait to turn it on and
actually see what the software looks
like here are the PCMCIA slots along the
side I guess this is where you put in
the battery I don't think an instruction
manual came with this so I have to
figure this out and let's take a look at
how it looks next to the HTC Touch bro
and of course I'm doing this as a joke
but it's just it's really amazing how
far we've come in handheld technology
the Apple Newton doesn't have phone
functionality or a color screen or HSDPA
or a radio or Wi-Fi or even enough
to hold two pieces of music and so the
reason that pocketnow.com is covering a
device that is 11 years old is because
it's going to be an interesting and
fascinating comparison on how far we've
come in handheld devices and where we
kind of all started back in the 90s with
this idea of a personal mobile computer
that you could take anywhere with you
and I think this is just going to be a
really interesting experiment so a lot
more to come that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
