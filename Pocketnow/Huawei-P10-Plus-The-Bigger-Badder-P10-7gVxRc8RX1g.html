2017 flagship we finally have a p10
pleasant house to play with overall it
shouldn't be a surprise how similar this
is to the regular p10 we recently
reviewed as you would expect the screen
size and resolution grow we get 64 and
128 gigabyte storage options the latter
with 6 gigabytes of RAM the battery gets
a sizable bump and the IR blaster found
on the honor 8 and mate 9 makes a
triumphant return I really love that
feature now a 2 phone release strategy
often counts on a smaller phone and a
medium phone which means we should
expect a larger mate in the second half
of the year the design language doesn't
change one iota from the smaller p10
front-mounted fingerprint sensor flush
rear cameras and we're happy to see
another phone with this hyper cut rear
metal housing it's a playful shimmery
effect and our smaller blue p10 hasn't
shown off anywhere or egregious smudges
in the weeks we've used it we're also
really happy to see a proper splash
resistant certification for the plus IP
x3 isn't the most exciting but rated
protection from lifestyle damage should
always be pointed out looking at
economics the increase in size does
introduce more of a reach for folks with
smaller hands unlocking or navigating
from the front sensor I've gotten my
muscle memory down pat for the smaller
p10 but swiping the home button to pull
up multitasking cards is proving more
difficult to nail consistently still one
advantage the mate 9 has with its rear
fingerprint sensor it's a much bigger
phone but I don't have to reposition it
in my hand to get it to unlock we're
watching phones start packing more
screen into smaller form factors but a
5.5 inch 16 by 9 display Huawei has done
a respectable job of not wasting too
much space overall dimensions ever so
slightly smaller than a pixel XL with
better use of that front chin bezel and
overall performance remains high the
keren 960 chipset is still currently the
top dog in all of our testing and will
likely remain so until the Galaxy s8
drops with one of its respective 10
nanometer chipsets the increase in
screen resolution seems to have had only
a small detrimental effect in
benchmarking which has been almost
completely imperceptible in daily use a
happily the plus designation does
represent a small
boost to the audio capabilities over the
smaller p10 we adopt the same stereo
speaker solution as the mate 9 in
portrait the top speaker and bottom
divide high in low-frequency audio in
landscape the duties are split a bit
more left channel and right channel it
should be mentioned though that like the
mate 9 the top speaker is significantly
weaker and tinnier than the bottom so
consumers should not expect a true
stereo split
headphone performances subtly but nicely
improved over the p10 signal-to-noise
ratio is increased with a reduction in
the overall noise floor and while the
plus still isn't going to be a top
delivery system for output gain the amp
onboard is a little louder than the
smaller p10 it all adds up to a nicer
overall system especially for folks
looking to drive nicer cans but one
small issue in conducting our battery
bench this phone refused to dial in our
specific testing brightness landing
significantly brighter or dimmer in a
pretty sudden jump or posting numbers
here while running the phone almost 50
percent brighter than we normally would
so this result isn't directly comparable
against our other reviews still
considering the powerful chipset
increase in resolution and brightness
the plus still manages healthy video
streaming numbers against competing flag
ships and in considering daily use it's
not difficult running the plus for a
full day night and an additional day
with light use auto on tap is huawei
super charger fast charging system even
with the larger battery expect a short
stint on the charger to deliver hours of
additional runtime lastly checking out
the camera we felt it was important to
address some of the replies we'd
received on our P 10 coverage several
people have comments that seemed to
indicate that the plus somehow had a
newer or better camera system well we've
got the same image sensors same sensor
sizes and same pairing of resolutions
the difference is increasing the
aperture from F 2.2 to F 1 point 8 now
we'll be releasing a real camera review
later this week but we can make a few
predictions here we're not expecting
radically different camera performance
at macro distances the natural
background vocabulary from the lens
should be a bit softer though that might
make macro focus a little trickier in
low-light situations we should expect to
see slightly faster shutter speeds or
slightly lower ISO s for similar
exposures but what do we know about
Leica and Huawei in terms of image
processing they're not afraid of keeping
noise in images that grain can add to
the texture or feel of a photograph
we've been digging deep into these
cameras with the p9 and the mate 9 and
the plus should be another step on the
evolution of this dual camera system
evolution not revolution but we'll save
conclusions for that real camera review
so let's wrap this up where's that leave
us with the p10 plus what we have here
is a small philosophical question should
a regular + + phone release be separate
screen sizes or should they include
different features for the changes in
the size of the phone take a Galaxy s8
and an s8 plus the major differences are
screen size and battery size now looking
at Apple Apple will change the
resolution as it climbs up to the larger
phone and Huawei takes that a step
further with different storage and RAM
options improved audio and the inclusion
of the IR blaster creating an even wider
spread between these P tens we look
forward to your thoughts in the comments
down below and you can vote in the
viewer poll which just popped up on your
screen but outside of that philosophical
discussion the p10 plus is a killer
handset one of the most powerful Android
phones available today a terrific
feature set premium options and Huawei's
first foray into lifestyle durability
with rated splash protection while we're
starting to see more devices arrived
with taller screens the P series from
Huawei feels like a great way to send
off phones with 16 by 9 displays as
always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to the channel for
more reviews like these and be on the
lookout for our p10 + real camera review
so you can see what this Leica is really
capable of and help us out with some
sharing on your favorite social networks
for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag now
some gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram
and I will catch you all on the next
