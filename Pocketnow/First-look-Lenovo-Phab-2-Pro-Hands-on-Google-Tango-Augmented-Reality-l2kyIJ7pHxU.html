tablet phones like the Z ultra lumia
1520 lenovo has a bleeding edge twist on
the large form factor we're looking at
the fab pro 2 at Lenovo tech world and
this phone is a monster
no joke halfway through trying to shoot
video of this beast a tiny asian woman
who barely spoke any English saw I was
in distress and offered to help use the
phone on camera if you have Hobbit hands
like mine this might be a three hander
all joking aside this is a fascinating
push into the North American market for
an actual lenovo branded product during
the press conference we got word that
this phone would show up in Best Buy's
around the country and Lowe's is already
a partner to showcase the camera tech
and more on that in just a bit the six
point four inch display is rocking a
quad HD LCD with a subtle curve to the
glass four gigabytes of RAM paired with
64 gigabytes of storage and a 4050
milliamp hour battery we've got some big
specs to go along with the big size I
will say that the fingerprint sensor is
in a handy spot considering the width
and girth of this phone and side mounted
controls are easily reached even if the
opposite side of the phone screen isn't
the Qualcomm 65 to mid Ranger processor
was an interesting choice for this
platform but we can't really comment on
the performance of pre-release software
but for the most part the demos included
on the phones ran smooth during the show
oh hey look an app drawer on a Lenovo
phone I like that it's an audacious
expanse of metal and glass but what
we're really interested in is this multi
camera module on the back not only do we
get a main 16 megapixel camera its
partnered with a depth sensor and motion
tracking hardware to power Google's
tango no longer project tango this is
Google's initial push into the consumer
facing world of augmented reality and it
works surprisingly well we went hands-on
with several demos looking up some of
our favorite dinosaurs for example or
playing with virtual Domino's in real
space this phone was handily able to
track our movement and pin objects to
the location they were dropped so long
as there was some contextual information
for the camera to latch on to we found a
few teething pains with the softbox
glowing tables Lenovo
used for displays but that's not a super
likely usage scenario for most people
know placing sensors around your room or
depending on special codes or objects
the phone will largely find its own way
through scanning a location and it
understands where it is in relation to
objects around you as mentioned earlier
Lowe's is already a launch partner and
will be delivering an app designed
around internal decorating you can see
what your place would look like with
hardware floors or when you want to buy
a new chair and when looking to buy new
furniture tango is a handy tool for
measuring objects in space without
having to grab a tape measure you can
calculate surface area and volume on the
fly and what would a new technology be
without some kind of gaming application
and while VR is cool today augmented
reality will be epic a Qualcomm
alien-hunting demo on the show floor was
crazy fun it's a forward thinking
technology featured on a phone from a
company really looking at what services
they can offer consumers not just
hardware and we'll definitely have more
to say once we can get our hands on one
to give it a proper review like all of
our hands at once on one phone the fab
tube pro will be available unlocked
starting in September with a retail
price of $4.99 as always thanks so much
for watching be sure to subscribe to
this channel for more videos like these
and hit that thumbs up button for a
little extra positive reinforcement for
pocket now I'm Juan Carlos back now some
gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram I
will catch you all on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
