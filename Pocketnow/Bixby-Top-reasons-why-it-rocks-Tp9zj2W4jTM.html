it's 65 clouds throughout the day all
right
we're loading it now hi everyone I'm hi
Mary better with pocket now and I've
been testing bixby voice for a greater
part of a month already and it turns out
that there are a ton of reasons why you
should to see victory voices a lot
smarter than your standard voice
assistant and we decided to put a video
together just to show you why actually
is actually for services there's fix be
voice fix be vision fix me home and
reminders and given the fact that each
of these services has its own complex
array of things that it can do we
decided to focus this video mainly on
bixby voice over time I've learned that
Bixby is a lot smarter and more capable
than your standard voice command service
surely it can connect to a server and
respond things from the server but it's
also capable of understanding what's on
your screen meaning it helps you control
commands from the simplest of things to
very complex strings of commands where
you can actually combine more than one
application to do one or more things at
a time
there are two ways to call on Vic's fee
you can either say hi Bixby even when
the phone is on standby and if the phone
is locked it'll prompt you for the voice
password that only you and Bixby
understand the other option is for you
to press and hold the Bixby key either
on your Galaxy s8 or Galaxy Note 8 and
this is genius because pressing and
holding is like using a two-way radio
Bixby will only listen as you're
pressing the button and will respond
whenever you let go you can aspects be
the usual tasks like for the weather or
flight information etc or specific tests
like for example setting your alarm
tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. you can also have
it to set appointments for a specific
time and date and with a specific name
there are cases where you just don't
want to fumble with various steps to
operate your phone like for example
asking it to turn on your flashlight
turn on your mobile hotspot for example
leave the screen on for 10 minutes
whenever you want to watch a movie if
your hands are busy
you can ask Bixby to also control your
screen like have it scrolled down on a
webpage or take a screenshot now where
Bixby gets really cool is when you ask
it to perform specific tasks between
applications all at the same time like
for example send your latest photo to
your son through a messaging application
and notice how it automates it opens the
gallery finds the photo enables sharing
features opens messaging searches for my
son within my contacts shares the photo
all in a second this is really cool I
have never seen any service do this the
service also supports third-party
applications like for example having it
call my son through whatsapp and again
it opens whatsapp searches for my son
and activates the phone call
you could also ask it to search for
specific things within an application
like for example open the YouTube app
and find pocketnow.com an aside from
finding the channel notice that the
bixby icon now adopts the YouTube logo
which means that whatever it'll continue
searching it will do so within the
YouTube app now the use of bixby and
third-party applications works through
something called Bixby labs meaning it's
still a work in progress there are
certain services then work immediately
when I started testing it but after
about a week the command was available
so Bixby continues learning over time
but by far my favorite thing to do with
Bixby is quick commands where you can
actually instruct big speed to
understand the specific phrase and have
it respond with a specific string of
different things that it'll do all these
are programmable like for example I said
good morning at the beginning of the
video Bixby responded with the time of
day turning off do not disturb and
launching for example the weather and
also launching the news again all things
that I programmed in just one simple
command so for example when I go to bed
I just say goodnight to activate do not
disturb create my alarm for 8:00 a.m.
and activate Wi-Fi to make sure that my
apps update overnight if you're into
specific types of photography like for
example food photos there is a mode
within the samsung camera that will do
that i love black and white photos so
all i do is simply tell bigsby that i'm
taking a black and white photo and it'll
automatically activate that mode within
the camera application and allow me to
take my photo in cases where i'm about
to drive i just tell Bixby that I'm
about to drive it'll deactivate Wi-Fi
activate bluetooth launch my favorite
music app and open Maps
best of all of the command is not on the
list just teach Bixby the command and
then find it in your recent history
overall I think that there is no more
complete service than Bixby
it controls Samsung applications
third-party apps and controls your phone
it could even be taught to do new things
and it continues learning through Bixby
labs I feel that the main purpose of a
digital assistant is for it to be
capable of assisting you and the simple
fact that Bixby is so flexible just has
it really ahead of the curve let us know
