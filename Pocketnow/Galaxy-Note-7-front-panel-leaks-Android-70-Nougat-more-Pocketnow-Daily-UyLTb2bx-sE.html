that there are more changes galore we
get the final details of what Android n
is going to be and NBC has decided to
make VR a thing of the present with the
Olympics I'm Jaime Rivera and today my
daughter turns 10 years old so join me
in saying happy birthday to Sofia this
is parking out daily official news today
begin again with deals just like we saw
TMO Tuesday's I TNT's Thank You
application sorry ATT thanks is now
available and even though the scheme of
this application is pretty much the same
as Teemo Tuesday's the difference here
is that for example you get free tickets
to the movies today but the problem is
you're forced to take a friend like if
they were forced to be able to pick up
your pizza on t-mo if you take a friend
it's kind of weird but it's there
another interesting official news if
you're currently holding a galaxy is
something in addition to a gear VR NBC
has just decided to make the Olympics
cool and kind of futuristic as there are
85 hours of availability of the our
content that will be streamed for you
again if you've got the right gear this
rather interesting as VR has taken
forever to take off facebook has
launched 360 photos but there's the
other options and it still doesn't maybe
this will be the deal see how will the
spotlight over to blackberry we have
been covering the rumors of the company
working on a more affordable couple of
devices to launch with its version of
Android the prev was definitely not the
cheapest one and now we hear about the
blackberry neon and what's cool about
this device is number one the link back
doesn't look so bad number two it's made
by TCL for those of you that don't know
alcatel is pretty much owned by TCL so
we do love that hardware meaning this
phone is pretty much gonna be hot if
it's designed that way let's continue
with the rumors of the galaxy note 7 we
have been covering a ton of these and
there are more to come now we've got
some leaked fronts and it's actually
being compared with the galaxy s7 edge
we noticed that number one we've got a
curve display number two there is an
extra slot for what we assumed to be the
iris scanner number three the
fingerprint scanner is oval so those
rumors of the patent for the circular
your friend scanner are definitely not
going to happen this is pretty much just
a larger or a newer version of the
galaxy note lineup that's not going to
bring much innovation and design but
still it served that's gonna be hot and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with Google the company has finally
announced the final name for Android and
this is interesting they actually use
snapchat just to tell you how much
Google doesn't really use its own
streaming services so yeah it's gonna be
called Android nougat because the whole
tradition of pastries continues for some
reason I don't understand why Google
just doesn't continue with Android an
Android in on its own was cool but
nougat is decent it leads me to the
question of the day which is obvious
what do you think about the name nougat
do you think that it's cool enough or do
you think that Google should finally
move away from pastries I don't know
call it cats mountains or whatever you
can think of leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
because mine is kind of mixed I'd call
it dear friends you know the way it goes
