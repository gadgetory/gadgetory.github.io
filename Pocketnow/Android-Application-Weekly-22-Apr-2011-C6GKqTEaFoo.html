now and this is another episode of the
android application weekly in which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it Cordy is a free
adventure puzzle game build on the
android market and it does come with 12
levels that are free and then you can
also purchase other levels in the game
itself so the way that it works is here
we have our little robot guy and we need
to position items in order to collect
these various cog and I need to go over
here and select the button to release
these barrels and unlock this door by
clicking this little button right here
and now I can go back down and so now I
kill here and i can plug in my blood and
unlock a door how stuff works is a free
application available on android market
it'll practically show you almost
anything on how it works so let's they
don't want to do search for lightning or
something like that okay so here i have
a bunch of articles on lightning and
we'll go to introduction on how
lightning works and it gives me a very
long article on how lightning works we
can also read popular adventurer animals
and many other articles you can go back
and also few facts and quotes and we can
also view shows from the howstuffworks
network push role is a pregame with on
the android market that is brought to us
by the same people that created bubble
blast so this is a very addictive game
and this level is a little difficult so
let's try it oh it looks like we're not
doing too great so the object of the
game is to push these little guys over
one at a time here and oh looks as
though a lost so at any time I can go up
here and also get the solution but
unfortunately you can only get one
solution an hour if you can remember all
that you can just go back and reset to
view the level again robot unicorn
attack is a very popular game on iOS and
is now available on the android platform
so the options the game is to move your
unicorn up and you also want to avoid
hitting stars so you double jump there
so if I approach a star let's see if one
comes up any time soon there's one so
now i have to do dash to destroy the
star and game keys on like this dogs
with the games to get the highest score
possible without dying if i crash into
something like that i lose a light and
then i have to move on to my next wish
stubhub is a free application of it on
the android market this application
allows you to purchase high demand
tickets directly from your android
device so i have sports concerts and
theaters so right here I have a concert
let's say I want to choose this rod
Stewart and Stevie Nicks concert I can
click on there and I can also go here to
be where the seats would be so looked at
those is the lure AAA seats available
with 219 dollars less they wanted to
choose a floor seat for 219 dollars
click on their weight can go down here
click Next and I can purchase them
directly from my device so this has been
another episode of the android
application weekly and if you like our
