lot of us here at mwc 2014 Tony behind
the camera hime every bit of a pocket
now let's go through a little comparison
with the ipad air so after that one of
the things you'll notice about these two
tablets is the differences in display
we've got the 9.7 inch retina display of
the ipad here and then we've got the
10.1 inch display from the sony tablet
that's only 1920 x 1200 this is wuxga
obviously we won't have the better
resolution on the sony tablet but then
again there are some benefits this
tablet then you will not find on the
iPad like first of all you can make
phone calls with the sony tablet there
is an accessory that serves as a media
remote and also as a Bluetooth headset
whereas on the iPad if you have LTE
connectivity like I do on this iPad of
mine that's it you won't be able to make
phone calls with it aside from the fact
that you have an IR blaster on this one
you don't on the iPad you have
expandable storage here you don't on the
iPad and there are a lot of other
options for example II have a 5
megapixel camera on the iPad you have an
8 megapixel camera here and even though
it's really hard to go through
specifications and tell you for example
but this Snapdragon 801 processor is
better than the a7 64-bit chip it's
really hard to compare that yet because
the ipad is not really taking advantage
of that feature now one thing I will
tell you is this is submergible in water
this is not this is ip55 IV 58 so
certified whereas on the iPad you cannot
submerge the tablet so the question is
what exactly is best for you android iOS
it really depends on you I'll tell you
this much this is one of the best build
quality tablets that we've seen yet for
Android even though this is plastic
compared to class last year it feels
great in the hand both tablets way
exactly one pound so if you want to get
the best of the best when it comes to an
Android tablet yeah this is probably one
of the ones we will recommend but that
will depend on our full video review
that should be coming very soon to
cycling our reel comparison it's only
behind the camera hi man here at Pocket
now we are at mwc 2014 we're not
sweating it's much cooler here but I
took the leather jacket off see you soon
for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
