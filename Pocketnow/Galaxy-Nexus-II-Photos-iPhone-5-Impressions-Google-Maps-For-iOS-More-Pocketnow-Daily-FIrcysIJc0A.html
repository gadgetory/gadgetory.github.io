iPhone 5 is both a love and hate story
and Google talks about maps on iOS I'm
hi Mary vetta thanking you all for your
kind wishes yesterday and this is
plucking out daily now if there's one
device that all of us in the tech world
are waiting for us Google's next Nexus
device you get the pure version of
Android on great hardware it should be
being launched in the next couple of
weeks and last week we had rumors of a
990 to 60 smartphone being built by
Samsung which should be the successor to
the i9250 Galaxy Nexus this time we've
got photos of the device and even though
we don't have information on the
megapixels rumors have it that it's
better than the galaxy s3 and that's
something i'd like to see that's right
our iPhone 5 review is now live and it
got a good score of a 9 out of 10 we
love the in hand feel we love the
features and we love the fact that it's
probably one of the fastest phones we
ever tested aside from having a great
camera but obviously I know a lot of you
are on the ropes trying to think of you
want to get a galaxy s3 or 1x or
probably even a Galaxy Nexus running
Android 4.1 jelly bean aside from even
the iphone 4s so make sure you follow
the links for all the comparison videos
that we film with this phone but sadly
not everything with the iPhone 5 is fun
and games it then get a perfect 10 out
of 10 for a reason so watch the next
segment yes that's right the iPhone 5 is
getting a frenzy of that publicity from
the internet even though almost every
iphone does after release but this time
we have two complaints after our review
first of all iOS 6 is definitely stale
old we already know what the maps
problem is but some people are now
complaining about getting these weird
scratch marks on the keyboard we know
it's a software issue that will most
probably be fixed eventually but just
look out for that second of our second
biggest complaint was that the aluminum
even though making the phone quite
sturdy is very easily scratch abul so
buyers beware once we unboxed our phone
and had a little nick at the top it's
very easily scratch evil so just make
sure that everything came well buy a
case and just make sure you look at
everything before your return period
ends now rim just made the news today
because they just confirmed their
blackberry 10 devices are reaching
carrier testing and
CEO even came on record to state that
they're on track with their times which
I find really stupid because they're
probably already two years late with
blackberry 10 but wait it gets funnier
blackberry just launched this song to
serenade developers to come back to
their platform because they've all
deserted the song is I'll keep on loving
you as if this can be the worst most
desperate measure that any company could
make to try to bring developers to come
back sorry and finally for the terrible
news of the day Google's chairman Eric
Schmidt just came on record to confirm
the very sad news that they're not
working on a Google Maps version for iOS
he even stated that they don't
understand why Apple left their Google
Maps ecosystem it's kind of
understandable for Apple to do something
on their own turf because well google
has been bringing google maps with
navigation on android ever since froyo
years ago and obviously apple was left
behind most probably google wasn't doing
this out of a conflict of interest it
makes sense but sadly Apple did a
terrible job with iOS 6 so that leads me
to the question of the day what
substitutes servers are you using for
navigation because you're obviously not
getting lost with iOS 6 or you're
probably lost right now aren't you it
was a comment down below now if you want
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in a smartphone and tablet
world don't forget to follow us on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
high metairie better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
