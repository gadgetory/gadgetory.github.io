every platform has its works now the
biggest challenge that these companies
currently face is being able to give you
a SmartWatch that lasts for days or even
months charging these can also be a
challenges not all mechanisms are either
practical or durable Hong kong-based
cachito is one of the few companies with
a solution to that problem but you bet
there's a catch I'm hi I'm Eddie Vetter
with PocketNow here with a quick review
of the ejido classic even though
kazuto's offerings have been around for
a couple of years and even some winning
CES Innovation Awards in 2014 it wasn't
until we flew to Barcelona that I had a
chance to give its products a try for me
the idea of having a SmartWatch that I
wouldn't have to recharge was cool
enough and after testing it for a few
days these are our impressions for
starters let's be clear Vegeta was
really focused on designing of watch
first SmartWatch second if you're still
debating if you need a SmartWatch this
is probably a good way to start a
disclaimer is important though it would
be more fair to compare the cachito with
a fossil regular watch or a Marcin
notifier than with the Moto 360 for
example this particular stainless steel
model that I had a chance to review is
gorgeous from the dark packaging to
casinos acclamation of this product
being a work of French designer Xavier
hoy it's clear that cachito was focused
on selling you a timepiece that's not
necessarily a gadget I'm particularly in
love with this watch band which is by
far one of the most elegant that I've
used in years and those properties
extend to the polished bezel and
multiple buttons this watch works
differently to every other watch and to
every other SmartWatch as well you can
fully submerge the cachito classic up to
100 meters deep in water like you can
with most watches for example but things
dramatically change once you look
further within the bezel you'll find the
liquid crystal display that resembles
the old dot-matrix Nokia feature phones
of back in the day and this display
actually lights something blue when you
press the buttons like you did with the
old Motorola phones as well
it gives you indications for your
current time and date and this switches
to a small notification panel that
compliments the small icons at the
bottom the watch's hands work like a
regular watch where you can control
these with the center knob and this
module has a separate battery that lasts
for years the SmartWatch features like
Bluetooth connectivity notifications and
vibrations are powered by a cr2032
battery that can last up to 6 to 9
months without recharging depending on
your usage once the battery is depleted
simply open the hatch with a coin and
replace the battery yourself the
SmartWatch molecule uses Bluetooth Low
Energy to connect to any iPhone running
iOS 7 or higher or any Android 4.3
device or higher from here it'll send
you notifications through the connected
device application to your watch and
depending on what notifications these
are you'll either get just icons or a
number and an icon or sometimes some
minor text on the panel the buttons at
the bottom serve to flip pages on the
display one at the tops turns on the
SmartWatch module or off and the other
surfs to dismiss notifications or pair
the watch but Gugino classic gives you a
small beep like alarms on an old Casio
watch when you get notifications but you
can also have the watch vibrate if you
want or serve both as well the watch
will also alert you when you've moved
away from the phone by default and the
application can even help you find your
phone by long pressing a user-defined
button so long as the watch is connected
obviously now the experience of using
the cachito classic as a SmartWatch is
sadly not what I'd call positive first
of all the point of using a SmartWatch
for notifications is being able to act
on the ones you care about it ignores
the ones you don't sadly here all
notifications will buzz your wrist
regardless of what they are and this
even applies to whatsapp notifications
that you purposely mute it and you sadly
can't tell what these notifications are
unless you pull out your phone the app
is also extremely archaic for both iOS
and Android wear your options are fairly
limited
it does include its own fitness tracker
for example but it doesn't sync with any
service like google fit or
Apple's iOS health services and have you
enable it the battery drains much faster
and things like vibrations and
notifications are disabled you also get
music controls you can even remotely
take photographs using the application
but again in a very archaic way this
could be either good or bad for most of
you I do value the idea that I could
turn off the SmartWatch module and just
use it as a regular elegant watch on my
wrist I also value that I don't have to
worry about charging it every single
night or every couple of days at a time
when public etiquette is being
threatened by rude people constantly
looking at their SmartWatch this is
definitely a good solution for a lot of
people as well this is a very elegant
watch in every way but at $299 for this
stainless steel unit it just has to be
the problem is that once you match it
against the Moto 360 that is just as
elegant and far more useful things start
feeling like if it's a little too late
for the cachito to exist your priority
should define what the best route to
take is and again this is a really good
way to start if you just want to try out
a SmartWatch but then again not if you
want to use this and complement with
other watches that are already in the
market as well I sadly can't say that I
use the cachito Classic as my daily
driver mainly because of the other
watches that I own but I know that in
your case things might be a lot
different that depends on you for more
coverage of every single SmartWatch that
the world has to offer make sure you
