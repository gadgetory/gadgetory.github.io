will be making it to the galaxy s 10
according to a trusted source make she
co had to cut down his predictions on
the iPhone 10 ourselves because it
apparently isn't appealing enough and if
you thought the LG G and V series were
merging it seems that the V isn't going
anywhere I'm Jaime Rivera and Taipei has
some really nice views and hotel rooms
not so good lighting but you know the
trill this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with product
launches not deals necessarily for those
of you that want to get yourself a razor
phone to AT&amp;amp;T just picked up the phone
and this is probably one of our favorite
games being phones so far I will have a
review for you guys very soon but well
the price tag is 800 bucks it narrows
down to around $27 when you look at
installments which is not necessarily
that bad you can learn more about it in
the description now let's talk about
Samsung and their variant of the galaxy
s 9 plus called
ice blue that just launched in China for
those of you that like the whole
Twilight design of the p20 series and
made twenty series from Huawei this is
pretty much that same appeal which I
love I love the fact that Samsung is
willing to experiment with new color
options and it follows on the rumors
that the Galaxy S 10 might also adopt
this we'll see now for those of you that
have been skeptical over the death of
the LGV line AB or whatever is gonna
happen with the G according to rumors it
seems that the G is the one that's going
to die as LG has just trademarked pretty
much every LG v up until v9d from b-52
v90 yes it seems that they are betting
everything on this lineup which I mean
the v40 was good well not necessarily my
favorite phone it was a good promising
device feels great in the hand so yeah
expect more B's in the future now let's
move the spotlight over to Apple and the
iPhone 10 R we were hoping that this
device was going to be a top seller and
so was Mexico he was predicting a
hundred million units to be sold
well that's changed now to 70 million
apparently people aren't going crazy
over the 10 R and it seems that people
are actually
thing more than devices like the iPhone
8 and 8 plus which we actually
recommended as the best bang for your
buck that was a separate video from
Taylor so yeah I mean well it seems that
the iPhone 10 hour wasn't as Apple
predicted and we weren't expecting much
anyway and finally the hot news that
they have to do with famous tipster Evan
blast and the Galaxy S 10 once Evan gets
his hands on something I trust it and
well he talked about specifications that
we are expecting triple cameras and the
whole one UI that's coming from Samsung
but the most interesting part is what
infinity display are we getting I mean
we saw all the Infinity knotch options
and it seems that the one that's going
to stick at least to one of these phones
is the Infinity Oh which means just to
cut out for the camera but then it's all
displayed no knotch
except for the cutout of the camera
which I find to be cool I mean if I have
to pay for that price I'd rather that
over the knotch but in the comments down
below let us know what you think do you
like this idea of the Infinity Oh
display instead of something like a
sliding mechanism or I don't know
because in my case I feel that this is
gonna be great in addition to that on
display fingerprint scanner leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion runs again if you want to
get the news earlier follow us on
parking no doubt comment subscribe to
