didn't say thank you or anything of the
sort this is the company's new approach
to AI on their phones
we saw it begin with the lgb 30s thank
you that we covered at MWC and now it's
time to meet the new kid on the block
reporting from New York City I'm hi I'm
Eddie Vetter with pocket now and let's
go hands-on I know what you're thinking
we heard a lot of buzz from LG deciding
to wait things out go back to the
drawing board about its whole smartphone
strategy but just like the name g7
follows the name g6 so does this phone
at least in visuals because features are
a different story at first glance the
new g7 thinkyou looks a lot like the V
30 with its curved glass surrounding the
aluminum and I like that the finish
follows on its predecessors and not
being a reflective smudge magnet
probably the purpose of waiting it out
is to fit it with better specifications
we have the brand-new kwaka mep dragon
845 4 gigabytes of RAM 64 gigs of
expandable storage with options for more
RAM and storage only available in Korea
apparently there's ip68 water and dust
resistance milspec drop resistance and
it brings wireless charging back in
addition to a 3000 milliamp hour battery
power up the display and you'll see new
but familiar terra-tory yes there is a
notch and LG has decided to separate the
G series from the V series by sticking
to LCD on the G and OLED displays on the
V this is actually a taller and very
vibrant full vision display at 6.1
inches diagonal an aspect ratio of 18.9
by 9 and quad HD plus resolution those
of you who don't like the notch get the
option to cover it up with what LG dubs
its secondary display and while I don't
see any additional functionality it does
seem to do a better job at hiding the
knotch than competitors says the g3 LG
has been famous for its Lau single
firing speaker and yes this one is loud
and
yes it's also single firing LG call set
its boombox speaker that uses the water
resistance sealed to create this
resonance chamber that definitely is
very loud so long as you don't cover it
up
the company claims DTS X 3d virtual
surround sound but this is something
that we'll have to test in our review as
we even hear that the effect extends to
whatever servers you place the phone on
for the audiophile in you there's also a
headphone jack with the high 5 32-bit
watt deck that we like from the lead 30
so yes content consumption is definitely
this phone stronghold as for AI LG
brings two important features it has
what it dubs it's super Fairfield voice
recognition which is an increase in
sensitivity by 35 percent compared to
other models there's also a dedicated AI
key included here but no worries the
company is not trying to reinvent the
wheel all it is is to call for the
Google assistant and LG is only tweaking
it in the fact that you can call it by
different names like on old Motorola
phones and there are also custom
commands to operate different features
in the phone but we'll leave those for
the full review and as for the software
you would think because of all the
collaboration between LG and Google that
this phone would be more stock after all
the time they've taken but no this is
the standard LG skin on top of Android 8
Oreo not the latest version though we're
waiting for our review unit to tell you
more about this as with previous LG
phones we look forward to most is the
camera and the company doesn't seem to
disappoint we have two 16 megapixel
cameras one of 71 degrees of field of
view at F 1.6 aperture and the other is
a wide-angle camera at 107 degrees of
field of view and F 1.9 aperture yes the
field of view of the super wide angle
camera is less than before but it's all
of the purpose of avoiding Distortion
LG claims and proof sensors and camera
lenses super-bright features and object
detection AI the company claims true
bouquet in its portrait mode by creating
a grayscale death map around the subject
but again these things are things that
we'll have to test the company also
claims a redesign from facing 8
megapixel camera finally we
portrait capabilities and 90 degrees of
field of view as well so yes this is the
LG G 7 thank you it comes in four color
options platinum gray Aurora black
Moroccan blue and raspberry rose and
it's set to launch very soon let us know
what you think about this phone in the
comments down below so far after a
couple of hours of playing with it I
will say that I am looking forward to
what this phone can bring order at that
