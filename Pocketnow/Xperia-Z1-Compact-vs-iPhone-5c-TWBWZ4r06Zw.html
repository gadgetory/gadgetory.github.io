phone in fact each goes out of its way
to specifically avoid being painted with
that particular brush but they're both
devices that cater to a customer looking
for something just shy of full flagship
status so for that customer we're
comparing them I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is Sony Xperia z1
compact versus Apple iPhone 5c our
Xperia z1 compact test unit comes to us
from clove electronics folks and we
thank them for the loan if you want a z1
compact of your own do what we did visit
clove code at UK and unbox your very own
Sony and Apple are two companies with
very well-established visual identities
which makes this an especially
interesting comparison because Sony with
the z1 compact has continued the glassy
glass sandwich construction it's favored
for a while while Apple has departed
from that approach with the so called
unapologetically plastic iPhone 5c
they're both shiny though and both are
unfortunately quite good at picking up
skin oil on the bright side there each
offered in a variety of colors which
should help cover up the smudges and
streaks if you decide not to use a case
either way it's hard to escape the
conclusion that the z1 compact though a
bit heavier and half a millimeter
thicker is the better looking better
feeling device here and it's waterproof
to boot Sony's device is packing a
Snapdragon 800 backed up by the usual 2
gigs of RAM while Apple's a6 chip powers
the iPhone and it gets by with a single
gig of ram for storage each comes with a
16 gig option with the iphone offered in
a non expandable 32 gig model and the z1
compact packing a microSD card slot for
up to 64 gigs additional space and
finally the displays normally this is
where Sony takes a beating but the
company has solved its side visibility
problems with the z1 compact offering a
4.3 inch TFT panel that's vibrant and
beautiful from just as many angles as
the four inch IPS screen on the iPhone
and the Sony screen has a slight edge in
pixel density as well we like the added
size
of Sony's slightly wider screen which
offers a less cramped keyboard and a
more comfortable experience overall when
it comes to software we're looking at a
very modern OS in either case and which
you prefer will more likely than not
come down to one personal taste do you
like apples splashing neons and
ultra-modern thin fonts or Sony's dark
and distinguished jewel-like approach
and to ecosystem lock-in yes google has
released a ton of native apps for iOS
but if you're a heavy user of Gmail
Google Drive Google Calendar and
particularly Google now an Android phone
is still going to be your best option
conversely if most your life is on
iTunes iCloud on the App Store or you
can't live without iMessage or FaceTime
the iPhone is the better call it's all a
matter of where you're coming from
whichever one you opt for you can expect
a smooth experience out in the real
world both phones offer remarkable
fluidity and responsiveness that said
Apple has the edge here in reliability
while hiccups on the z1 compact are rare
things like app crashes and the
occasional bug like the zoom problem in
Chrome do crop up more often than
similar problems on the iPhone a good
example is the hardware camera key which
sometimes launches the z1 compacts
camera and sometimes doesn't this is a
problem we saw on the z1 s as well so
it's almost certainly a problem with
Sony's software and we hope it gets
fixed with an update
there's no comparable bug on the iPhone
but of course that's because the iPhone
doesn't have a physical shutter key and
that makes shooting pictures with it a
little less enjoyable the viewfinder is
also much less fun on the iPhone than on
the z1 compact with Sony's various
shooting modes and the 20 point seven
megapixel resolution of the Sony camera
is more than double the eight megapixel
iSight shooter on the iPhone in terms of
the end results well it can be really
hard to tell the difference sony's
superior auto shooting mode is good and
sometimes it brings out more vibrance in
shots than the iPhone delivers we were
also surprised to see the iPhone photos
suffering from
a bit of noise where the Sony cam didn't
the huge reversal compared to previous
tests indoors it was the Apple camera
delivering more vibrant colors but both
did quite well in drawing out the detail
of close range in low-light
the iPhones dim result is pretty
unimpressive while the z1 compacts
superior auto mode really lights up the
scene it does so at the expense of more
noise in the shot but it certainly makes
things clearer and of course the z1
compact is capable of underwater
photography while the iPhone can't do
that without a case as far as the
fundamentals each phone lends some
winning points we like talking on the z1
compact more because of the richer
louder side tones for the earpiece and
we also like the Sony phone better for
gaming thanks to the larger screen but
we like blasting music or movies more on
the iPhone because it's speakerphone
blows away the tinny soft one on the
Sony device
finally we'd rather have the Sony phone
with us in a power pinch with four to
five hours of screen on time per charge
it generally lasts longer in our testing
than does the iphone 5c these phones are
priced almost identically in their
unlocked form which makes our comparison
a little easier on the one hand with the
iPhone you're getting a rock-solid
performer with a sterling track record
in the most mature ecosystem of hardware
and software it kind of does everything
well but it's also stuck in a reheated
version of 2012's top-of-the-line
hardware on the other hand with the z1
compact you're getting a style-conscious
spec beast with the latest and greatest
including a better camera bigger screen
more versatile hardware and software and
better battery life
oh and again it's waterproof if you can
live with the mediocre speakerphone in
the occasional bug we think you'd get
more bang for your buck from the Sony
product in this particular contest we'd
like to thank our friends from clove for
providing us with a z1 compact demo unit
