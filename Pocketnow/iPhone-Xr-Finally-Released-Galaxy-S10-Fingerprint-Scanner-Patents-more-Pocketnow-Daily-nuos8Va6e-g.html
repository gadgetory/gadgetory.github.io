register for the live stream of the
oneplus 60 follow the first link in the
description pocketnow.com / 1 + 60 to
learn more the iPhone 10 R was released
at midnight and let's see how well it
does with sales we get some pens for
Samsung that point to a galaxy s 10
having an optical on display a
fingerprint scanner and we also get
invitations for Xiaomi but for two
different events in madness October I'm
Jaime Ravenna and tech topper continues
as I pre record this because I need to
cross the pond for the next 14 hours for
more work this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with product
teasers obviously Huawei just took all
the spotlight where they're made 20
launches a lot more than we expected and
now the company CEO has teased that
there will be a foldable smartphone with
5g capabilities as early as next year a
company has surprised so far with their
chips at the care 980 so obviously this
has a lot to do with how we're gonna get
5g not this chipset but the evolution of
that chip into whatever is coming and
that would make this possible in
addition to a foldable whatever we'll
see now let's talk about Xiaomi as the
company has just sent out press
invitations for two events on October
23rd we have the Black Shark phone
apparently Black Shark - and then on
October 25th we have the Xiaomi me mix 3
according to what we see in the teaser
and sadly I won't be able to be part of
both but we've already got planned
something for coverage so stay tuned for
that oh yeah it's China now now let's
talk about the Samsung Galaxy S 10 as
we've got some patents that are rather
interesting the company has had pretty
much this optical heart rate sensor on
the back of its phones and since like
the galaxy s5 I believe and now we hear
that the new optical fingerprint scanner
that will have on the display of the
galaxy s 10 is going to bring that
functionality at least we see it on the
possible patents it's just really hard
to tell for what phone the patents are
could be as 10 it could be no 10 stay
tuned for that it's gonna be interesting
because you're gonna use it once and
they're going to
forget about it now let's talk about
Samsung as we've got another official
launch from the company we see the
Samsung Galaxy book 2 and what makes
this product special is we were really
big fans of the book 1 we already have
our review unit of the book 2 where we
noticed that it has the new clock of
Snapdragon 850 processor so it's a
mobile-first chip set of in addition so
obviously you get crazy battery life and
other perks it's very thin very
practical but you get full-blown Windows
10 November 2nd is the launch price tag
yeah it's a thousand bucks so it looks
gorgeous I'll let you know what I think
of it once I get my hands on it and
finally the hottest new said I have to
do with the iPhone 10 honor the product
was released at midnight Pacific
obviously we're waiting to see how this
device is going to perform but an
interesting indicator is that US
carriers are already clogged with deals
where you can get it for free with
installments for 18 months and then
we've got Verizon even offering iPads
there's a full list of deals in the
description let us know in the comments

you're enticed for because in my case
