the 4k screen on the Xperia z5 premium
some people stood behind Sony's decision
some others did not but that is I think
mostly because of the fact that we do
not fully comprehend how 4k behaves on
the Xperia z5 premium I'm Anton denied
this is PocketNow and in this video
we're going to try to explain what 4k is
and what 4k isn't on the sony xperia z5
premium let's dive into it
first of all props to Sony for doing
this
props to Sony for managing to
manufacture a 4k display in a 5.5 inch
form factor and slapping that onto a
smartphone and the same way perhaps go
to HTC and Oppo for the Jade butterfly
on the 5/5 which were at their
respective times the first 1080p
smartphones and 2 LG and vivo for the
first quad HD smartphones with the g3
and the X play is for yes so yes Sony
managed to have the world's first 4k
smartphone with this Xperia z5 premium
3840 by 2160 that's what the 4k display
on the Xperia z5 premium is that results
on a 5.5 inch screen in a PPI resolution
of 806 now we could go into debates
whether that's something you will
actually see or discern and the good old
Steve Jobs quote comes to mind when he
took the stage I believe it was for the
iPhone 4 presentation when he talked
about Retina display and the Retina
display according to Jobs was beyond 300
PPI something which the human eye could
not discern well of course that was a
marketing trick because that is not true
recent studies have shown that depending
on your eyesight on the quality of your
eyes visual acuity and vision in general
the human eye could discern up to 7 or
even 800 dpi everything is clear up to
this point this is where things are
becoming a little bit more calm
placated Sony has a blog post explaining
how 4k works and some of the decisions
behind 4k and its implementation on the
z5 premium I'll link it in the
description below what Sony does with
this panel is that they constantly run
it at Full HD with a couple of
exceptions Sony says that this is mostly
a decision oriented towards better
battery life and so far the battery life
on the z5 premium has turned out to be
exceptional up to two days which is the
norm with most recent Z smartphones Z 2
Z 3 Z 3 plus so that is something they
are putting out there but there's
another aspect Android lollipop 5.1
which is running on the z5 premium does
not support 4k resolution it does
however support quad HD resolution and
we're going to get to this in a moment
but as of now it's easier for Sony to
just lower the resolution basically cut
it in half because 4 HD is half of 4k
and run it constantly in this mode even
so on a 5.5 inch display Full HD
results in 400 PPI which is a great
pixel per inch density 4k kicks in in
this particular scenario and on this
phone and we're not talking about future
future use it scenarios with VR and
everything because I've been reading
your comments and yes some of you make a
lot of sense we're talking about this
phone in particular 4k will kick in once
you start for instance the L beam
application and play back a 4k video now
there are two ways you can get 4k video
onto this smart phone number one is to
either shoot your own video with the
camera on the smart phone which is
capable of recording 4k video and the
other one is to sideload 4k videos from
your library or from your computer onto
the smartphone itself through the SD
card internal storage and a small 4k
overlay will pop up on the thumbnail and
that's when 4k video is played back in
its
native resolution now most of the
streaming applications which support 4k
resolution are not optimized for mobile
and this is where I will return to my
quad HD reference because we have the s6
or the v10 which we'll use in this
particular example which are phones
running in their native resolution quad
HD on Android lollipop same as the z5
premium so what Sony does is let's take
an example we fired up YouTube on both
the z5 premium and the LG v10 we search
for a 4k video and try to play it back
of course you can change the resolution
of the stream by clicking on the COG and
selecting the resolution and the z5
premiums example we were limited so the
highest resolution we could choose was
1080p that's because the YouTube
application sees the z5 premium as a
1080p phone rightfully because it runs
in 1080p opposed to the v10 where the
highest resolution you could use was
1440 because the v10 and the s6 and
other quad HD phones run natively in
this resolution so playing them
side-by-side fullscreen is pretty
interesting sony explains it that for
these scenarios where there is 4k
content and it's not optimized for
mobile they're using an upscale and
Galgo rhythm so what basically is
happening on the z5 premium is that Sony
is taking the 1080p video and it's
upscaling it basically it's pixel
doubling again Full HD is have a 4k they
are upscaling the video to 4k opposed to
what's happening on the v10 or on the s6
where you see that quad HD video in its
native resolution now of course I have
not seen the difference you might be
able to see it what we have is a smaller
resolution on a quad HD display running
natively and we have a higher resolution
resulting in a upscaling or doubling of
a lower resolution
video source so that's interesting maybe
some of you can see it some of you
cannot but this is what 4k is when it
comes to streaming media from YouTube or
Netflix or any other source which is not
yet optimized for mobile now when it
comes to what the 4k display on the z5
premium is not well that's easy it's not
a 4k smartphone running and 4k
constantly so it's not a 4k smart phone
per se
the best example coming to mind is when
you buy a sports car advertised you have
500 horsepower but limited to only 250
horsepower because of fuel consumption
reasons of course you are able to access
the rest of 250 horsepower by pushing a
button for a short period of time but
99% of the time your 500 horsepower
sports car will only run at 250 so
that's probably the best example I could
come up with and I can understand the
reasons behind battery life this would
make less sense if you would actually
see the difference between full HD and
4k on this particular phone and don't
get me wrong probably some of you might
be able to see it I am personally not so
there you have it we talked about what
4k is and what four key isn't now we
very much wanted to make that clear and
to put it out there because we want you
to make an educated decision when going
out and either deciding to buy or to
pass on the Xperia Z if I bring them
especially with the holiday season
coming so if you think you will benefit
from this 4k implementation of Sony and
you want an exceptional smartphone at a
higher price tag then absolutely go
ahead and purchase this and this will
serve probably as a short teaser on what
our full review conclusion will be on
the other hand if you think that the
technology is in its infancy its
implementation is still not there there
are other options both Sony options
because the z5 premium
has the exact same internals as the z5
and the z3 plus before it aka z4 give or
take 1 or 2 specs so you can get another
Z smartphone from Sony
if waterproofing or great build quality
are your thing or you can opt for other
flagships well that being said we hope
we managed to shed some light on this
controversy and we hope we manage to
make you understand better how Sony does
4k on the z5 premium and what really is
and isn't as the title suggests if you'd
like this video please give us a thumbs
up don't forget to follow PocketNow on
all social media channels Eibon Antonina
you can also follow me in the links
above I'm not sure where I'm going to
put them that's it for now until next
time everybody
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
