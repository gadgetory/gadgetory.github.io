making phablets feel small in the hand
recently but let's not forget that the
pioneering achieving this is LG this is
high medieval front pocket now here at
MWC in barcelona and this is LG g 6 vs
samsung galaxy s7 edge all this more of
a tradeshow comparison folks as the
spacer very different and unfair on one
hand we have the Samsung flagship from
last year since we won't know about the
new one until March 29 and on the other
hand we have the LG G 6 with non-final
software it's most important here to
compare is the amazing achievements from
both companies when it comes to
ergonomics at least in paper
side-by-side each device is almost the
same in dimensions and we have both
aluminium and glass designs on each the
galaxy s7 edge is 2 millimetres taller
and one millimeter wider while the d6 is
actually 2 millimeters thicker in 5
grams heavier than the galaxy and that's
actually quite evident the g6 does feel
rather heavier in the hand which
greatest of both devices impress and how
they fit phablet displays on less of a
footprint - 5.5 inch AMOLED display on
the galaxy is gorgeous and feels quite
manageable when you hold it for the
first time thanks to its curves on the
display on each side LG on the other
hand takes a step further by fitting a
5.7 inch screen on a smaller footprint
leading to a crazy 80 percent screen to
body ratio it doesn't only shrink the
size vessels but also the top and the
bottom with its 18 by 9 or 2x1 fold
vision IPS panel it's also quite HD plus
resolution of 28 80 by 1440 versus
standard quad HD at 2560 by 1440 so the
Galaxy compensates with the inclusion of
hardware buttons leave display quality
comparisons for when the LG G 6 is final
but I will tell you is that both devices
have pros and cons the Galaxy s7 edge
isn't the best at palm rejection so
using it with one hand can be a
nightmare and in the case of the LG G 6
even though the device claims to be
designed with one-handed usability in
mind
and those hamburger menus at the top of
Android user interfaces are a nightmare
to use as well as for content
consumption the d6 will do a better job
with movies thanks to the 18 by 9 or
again 2x1 aspect ratio but the pillar
boxes are kind of annoying for YouTube
content but the galaxy doesn't fumble
with that and yeah both devices do a
terrible job with speakers mainly
because these are single firing and easy
to muffle like what year is this for
single firing speakers on flagship
seriously spec wise differences aren't
significant I'm targeting two one on the
g6 versus a 20 on the galaxy s of an
edge Ram is the same at 4 gigabytes
storage is the same at 32 gigabytes
expandable and even if the battery on
the Galaxy is larger there is faster
charging on the LG and USBC on the newer
LG that is quite future-proof and
another specification that shared is
ip68 water in this resistance the
software story is still not final for LG
what I will tell you is that both
devices have Android 7.0 nougat and are
now eligible to use the Google
assistance something has finally updated
this phone to its latest UI tweaks that
I've come to enjoy in the case of LG it
seems like if you're using it b20 with a
couple of different tweaks and
improvements I also notice improvements
in the LG's always-on display
and Samsung has finally brought the
always-on display features from the
front note 7 the real story I cannot
wait to compare when the software is
final on the LG is the improvements to
the camera
LG really kills it with its camera
quality but so does Samsung with its
Galaxy S of an edge I do notice some
differences in the added wide-angle
display on the g6 mainly because the
company has finally removed a barrel
distortion or at least improved it on a
secondary lens and we also have the same
sensor on its secondary lens now so you
do have that added kick over the galaxy
s7
overall the stakes are rather high on
both devices and I will admit that I
love that both of these are great
beautiful and both pull some punches on
how they approach organ ah mcc's we will
come back later for a final comparison
