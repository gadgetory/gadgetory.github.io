Phone 8 operating system may not be the
best one out there when it comes to
sales there is no denial that a lot of
us at PocketNow do love the UI and do
love the whole Windows Phone ecosystem
precisely because of its minimalism
great camera quality and lots of
features that we do love still there are
a ton of things that we wish we saw in
2014 so I'm hi mera neta this is pocket
now these are the wishes that we have
for Windows Phone in 2014 number 5 is
actually two things the list was kind of
big so bear with me here first of all we
need more players and we mean top
players Samsung and HTC did a fabulous
job in pushing Windows Phone even before
Nokia came to the bandwagon and now
Nokia is everything related to Windows
Phone these companies don't really care
about the platform anymore and that is
really unfortunate as we do need a
bigger push when it comes to the
platform and aside from that we do need
some better tablet integration one of
the biggest issues with Windows Phone
it's not really an issue but it is more
of a wish is the fact that there is no
benefit in owning a windows phone and an
owning a windows tablet and that should
be the other way around they should talk
to each other the applications that i
buy for Windows Phone should work on
Windows RT are there should be a variant
on Windows RT that talks to this
application and a way for me not to buy
two things at the same time so i guess
you understand where i'm going with the
fact of better tablet integration as
well number four is better commitment to
legacy devices a lot of you that bought
the original windows phone 7 devices are
not getting any more software updates
even features like xbox music are not
working on your phones and this is
really unfortunate people can't really
buy a phone every year and there are 10
of people out there that are trying to
buy phones at a very affordable price
and if you think about the fact that
windows phone is more targeted to the
budget audience then you get to
understand that these people are the
ones that most need a platform that will
support their old legacy bones but as it
turns out I have a beautiful dell venue
pro that can't get any updates anymore I
have a great HTC Titan as well that
can't get any updates as well and a lot
of people said that of course this had
to do with the platform evolving into
you know dual-core processor is
everything but whatever happened to
Windows Phone 7.8 and again it's just
the fact that Microsoft is not really
commit
to legacy customers and what this is
doing is killing the platform going
forward as people lose trust in windows
phone number three is timely launches
can anybody tell me where is Windows
Phone 8.1 we've got Kit Kat in the
market we have iOS 7 where is Windows
Phone 8.1 a lot of people are asking for
this end a second that it's the fact
that we get announcements for Windows
Phone in January for them to be launched
in the fall these are the things we can
understand why Microsoft is so sluggish
and actually bringing support and grow
to their own platform they're doing a
good job when those filled is a great
operating system but we do have the
problem that people are not going to
wait eight months for an update people
are not going to be waiting 11 10 months
for phone it doesn't work that way
competition is too fierce for Microsoft
to be so sluggish number two has to do
with applications but not really what
you think I do believe that Microsoft
and its partners have done a fabulous
job in getting the applications that we
need on the platform but then there is
another problem for example if you're
looking for Instagram you will find
Instagram but then there are a ton of
alternatives out there then if you look
for Spotify there is Spotify beta but
then there are a ton of alternative out
there and you're looking for a game in
the game of stop there you get the
alternatives but that doesn't really
tell you that the game is not there so
there is a lot of clutter in the app
store but ton of applications that don't
really serve any purpose it tells you
that there is no control in the app
store there is even some weird porn in
the app store at times and again there
just needs to be a real clean up on the
app store and this would actually make
the app store more prestigious you don't
really need a hundred thousand
applications you don't really need the
volume you needed the key applications
and they are now there and the top
number one feature that we wish would
have offer Windows Phone in 2014 is the
UI a lot of people don't really like
Windows Phone or Windows 8 for that
matter all of us at pocket now do but
then when I show it to a friend and most
of my friends consider it to be too
stale for some reason yeah they see all
the flashiness of galaxy phones all that
lighting there then they see all the
crazy colors in iOS and they do consider
Windows Phone to be stale and I don't
feel that I don't agree with that but
obviously I'm not part of general
population if you get what I mean and as
I think that there are a ton of UI
elements that need to evolve for example
the People Hub it is completely obsolete
there are a ton of these hubs that are
great
they're great concepts and they worked
really great for windows phone 7 3 years
ago but now they are completely obsolete
compared to where you could really do
with facebook right now for example so
there does need to be a dramatic
overhaul in the UI and the services and
we're hoping that that's the reason why
there is so much delay in Windows Phone
8.1 but that leads me to the question of
this top 5 what would you personally
change from Windows Phone what would you
like because in my particular case I
would like the option to at least have a
wallpaper behind the life tiles i want
the lifetimes to stay I just want there
to be some sort of you know glass some
sort of design elements that make it
look more elegant but leave us a comment
down below what do you think that's it
for a top five thank you very much for
