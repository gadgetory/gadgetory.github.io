for the world's largest handset vendor
maybe that's not a surprise but a big
part of yesterday's London event was
also tablets and we'll cover those we've
also got a ton of reviews from Nokia
blackberry and of course samsung to talk
over and a pretty concrete looking leak
of the iphone 5s all that plus some
delightfully unscheduled segues into the
weeds and a thought thread from a very
unbranded minimum on episode 0 for 9 of
the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocket now where we discuss
smartphones tablets and the state of
mobile technology in 2013 I'm your host
Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now and today I'm joined by
editor in chief Brandon drum solo
minimun good morning at you I do a drum
solo to start us off oh you can you can
underscore Taylor's introduction if you
like yes go ahead okay when Taylor comes
on tell tell me when you can and senior
editor Taylor the hater marched good
morning to you hello guvnah what good
morning both of you gentlemen yeah okay
this marks an historic point in history
first time Taylor using a new dialect
first time Brandon not asking if I if he
has made his father proud one second one
second can we all do our best hello
gotta no no I know I do I will not I'm
ello govna all right that your best let
me let me do mine it might max out the
mic I'll got that Oh Deary god I can
watch you can just watch the listener
count just just do plummeting into the
base that sounded like a grandma yeah
was it okay it makes more sense Michael
I really think you should participate do
do you ya know it's funny isn't it funny
how like thoughts can diverge and
different stuff maybe I'll do what I did
on the pocket out live and I'll just
keep I'll just keep telling you know
until the end of the season and then
I'll do it on the last episode of the
season just like it now the right you
are now officially buzz killington of
this podcast who wants to hear a good
store
worried about a bridge let's go let's
talk let's go that's it kick it off the
thought thread here and because we have
a lot to talk about in the way of
Samsung news because God they had a lot
of stuff to come out yesterday and I
entendi Nagy has died of exhaustion
somewhere on the Thames unfortunately so
no God he did a lot of videos yesterday
I want I want to jump to him I want to
cover him but at first I want to hear
what Brandon is thinking for his thought
thread as yes so the it's interesting
because in the smartphone industry we've
had all sorts of conversations over the
years we've had conversations about
specs and and cpu speed an amount of ram
we pet conversations about screen
resolution and how high it really needs
to be and what is what is really good
and screen types and varieties we've had
conversations about Hardware about metal
versus plastic versus soft touch thin
versus thick but there's really a
conversation that we're just starting to
have now and I think it's very exciting
and it is because we had all those
conversations and we're at a point where
screen resolution is good hardware
design is good materials materials yes
materials and design quality is just
good and the conversation we are having
now and I think Apple started the
conversation is UI design where we're
starting to talk about color palettes
and sizes of icons and flat designs and
rounded edges versus squared-off edges
and what I think's going to happen is
next year is going to be the year of UI
design and I think Samsung's gonna kill
TouchWiz next year and they're probably
working on something feverishly now that
is as innovative to UI design as you
know the galaxy s3 was 22 Android
devices and uh you know I think HTC is
going to be further modifying sense and
this is so exciting because we've got
these devices that are so capable and
powerful and they're good in every other
way they're all very well rounded but
the UI's are kind of the same that
they've been since the beginning they're
about the same and I think I think that
also key lime pie the next version of
android is also going to be a part of
this conversation because
it's been a while since android release
changed it has and I think we're
starting to hear rumors have some some
fundamental underpinnings of Android
changing in key lime pie as well which
will dictate further evolution of the UI
of course gandra Android his user
experience is headed by the UI guy I
matias duarte and I wouldn't be
surprised at all to see some that's not
necessarily massive changes but
definitely some further refinements to
that platform I would be very pleased if
2014 was the year of the UI I think it's
overdue I think we're a lot of you know
software designers are sitting on a
resting on their laurels and I don't
think it's time for that I don't think
anything is quite good enough to be sat
on yet and kind of you know codified and
locked in um I really hope it is the
year that we see some some contextual
changes in in UI development what some
people are calling undesigned I posted
an article about this on or not an
article it was opposed to shared
something on Google+ about it but it was
um looking at the changes of Android
side by side from version 12 the most
recent version and the biggest changes
are that things are being taken out so
all these graphical elements that have
been put into the operating system like
gradients and all these useless things
have been taken out and it's flat it's
it's basic and they're going back to
basics but now it's a point where we can
go back to or not go back progress
forward because people understand how
touchscreens work when smartphones first
came out they were kind of new to this
thing and they didn't know how to
navigate how to do certain things on a
touchscreen and now we've been trained
over the course of five or six years too
long press if we want to see more you
know long press to swipe with two
fingers right to swipe up to swipe down
to swipe from the edge of the screen and
that gives it that gives the designers a
lot more flexibility as a basic example
just because I have the apple website up
here
you know it the iOS 6 and below when you
go into Safari there that bar on the
bottom of back forward bookmarks and
tabs is persistent but in iOS 7 they're
hiding it which if they did that three
or four years ago people would be like
holy crap where is the bookmark where's
all the stuff but now people like go
back yeah people will kind of have
figured it out yeah people are cashing
up to advance do i concepts like people
are I think more apt today to be able to
slide pains back and forth to be like if
there's no back button well what if I
just tap and drag oh look I can move the
screen over oh okay I don't need a
button yeah I think people are getting
caught up to two smarter you eyes and
that's a good thing because now we don't
have to deal with you I that says boring
yes yeah and and end is impeding as
current ones are right like the my
biggest problem with blackberry 10 so
far I mean this is a first time go to
Taylor Martin and I have blackberry q10
s in hand by the way yeah yeah that's
why they sound so morose I'm so glum
today um no um it's not true so much
there it is not true there's so much
it's a dystopia that I'm looking for in
the operating system i'm looking for a
dissociation i think now that's not the
right word it's inconsistency well well
i just want to say disjointed pneus it's
like it's like two completely different
people designed it yeah and you know
sometimes you'll get a back button on
the screen sometimes you swipe yes why
not just make everything swipe back
there is a lot of inconsistency and
actually I want to say that I am going
to be talking to the i believe the vp of
user experience at blackberry next week
and I'm you know it's not going to be
this like hard-hitting thing where it's
like wires in this consistent but I'm
very interested in finding out how some
of these cues came to be and also what
elements like what they're going to
continue to do with the astonishing
tribe people because remember blackberry
assimilated the astonishing tribe and
you can see that in like the compass and
the clock apps those are just so
gorgeous on blackberry 10 described is
awesome awesome but easy it's it seems
like that that was squandered I mean
besides the clock app which no one
really cares about well
what else has been brought forth from
from this company that that's gonna be
one of my ears that's gonna be one of my
questions I wanted to see I want to see
what other elements actually came from
the assignor try but you gotta remember
there's a lot of brain drain as well
when blackberry acquired the astonishing
tribe they they lost some some pretty
pivotal people there who kind of left
after the acquisition so also um to to
counter your point about screens kind of
hitting their peak Brandon phone screens
that is I was reading a piece that
Stefan content constantan ask you
because I got a constant in SQ friend
I'll show Stefan cast yes he was on here
a couple weeks ago he shared a piece on
his site that said that in 2014 we can
expect to surpass the 500 PPI point with
wqxga displays that's 2560 by 1600
that's the resolution you have on the
Nexus 10 squeeze down into a 5-inch
phone six inch phone why I don't know i
mean what work before you know I think
50 2015 about 4k displays and you know
that's like in the 700 PP I think but
that's an interesting step in between I
don't really get it I mean it i get it
for um for phones like the Galaxy mega
or this yeah Rupert 6 inch phone but
what are the odds that it will also go
down to smaller phones that's oh it's
not a question yeah well since we're
talking about you I a little bit we
should talk about this event that
happened yesterday where every device in
the room basically ran the same UI the
emails were tired of my hardware look
the same everything everyone has
mastered making it computers look like
smartphones mm-hmm that's yeah yeah I I
think you are fantastic it segues and I
just want to try out on something I want
to do a segue from one topic to another
and I'm going to tell you what they are
and you have to think of a segue so
we're talking about a nice sushi
restaurant in New York City and you need
to talk about the galaxy s4 zoom so what
would you say to segue from yes well you
know what here's the thing i mean wasabi
is awesome
and it's one of my favorite things to
eat and when I when I get it right in
that nose there when you you know you
did get a good snuff load of it it's
like zoom you know I and which which of
course brings us to to Samsung's bizarre
device is something about zooming in to
take a picture so i can instagram my
sushi and HD you know what Taylor you
know what that tells us that 90-day mr.
granite you are not ready to be a
podcast host yet um no I crushed segways
for a reason segue crusher let's talk
about this friggin zoom because this
thing confuses the bejesus out of me now
we talked about this at what a week ago
whenever the bus it was last one was the
15th yes whenever this whenever the sing
leaked I don't know I i I'm I'm I'm
brain is still hurting because of there
was a Vishal last week was it yeah they
launched it last or announce the last
week right so at the premiere this is
what we should talk about it's ramiro
vent the Samsung kind of split its focus
between devices that we had already seen
and devices we hadn't and most of the
devices we'd already seen where Galaxy
devices and the achieve line is was the
the kind of surprise of the day or a
tiff or at him depending on what region
you're in its creative yeah creative
originated which I'm it I was I didn't
know that was a real world paranoids
innovative yeah into the tube right yeah
oh man they're trying real hard with it
so Samsung's event itself I think we can
all agree gents was uh was weird right
as usual do you think that they they
thought about these words before they
came up with the brand atif relative and
do you think they came up with these
words or one day somebody walked in the
office things like those letters are in
creative someone is innovative someone
must have sneeze at ease well it's well
like it's vita backwards rights okay so
that's so there's that's weird oh and
everyone thinks about how words sound
backwards right Dom yeah right job roll
roll Jana really aggressive yeah I don't
owe you a trance I don't know why I do
it your name backwards is actually
pretty awesome you could be a Superman
villain yo why why is the galaxy s4 zoom
called galaxy s4 how does it have any
thing to do with the galaxy s4 how does
the galaxy s4 mini have anything to do
with it I wrote it all you know but I
feel like Taylor Martin wrote an article
about this yeah I did about every night
children three months one of us has to
read an article about how Samsung is
just destroying the galaxy brand yeah
there is no like no resemblance nothing
between these two owns other than that
the fact that they had the same metal
band around the outside or plastic band
around the outside and the same and the
same TouchWiz UI like basically so the
galaxy s4 zoom listeners if you don't
remember is basically the modern
incarnation of the galaxy camera except
it's a phone it's a galaxy camera with a
phone tacked on and it looks like
somebody took like a wet sander to the
corners right it's just a little more
grounded but there is one interesting
thing about it as this extendable ends
with what is it 20 times optical zoom 10
times optical zoom Tim ok send times
optical zoom tail Anton got a sweet
hands on with it he did a cool
cross-table optical zoom and took a
picture of another galaxy s4 zoom which
was very meta but the the coolest part
about it i think is this rotating ring
so you know that is cool yeah like on
attachable camera lenses you have this
focus ring and you have the zoom ring on
the galaxy s4 zoom the ring not only
controls the zoom but it also Samsung
has built some kind of software
interface for it so that there's a ring
displayed on the screen and you
manipulate the UI elements on that ring
with the ring in your hand so it's
what's kind of interesting yet did you
see that it's a shortcut like it's a
shortcut hardware shortcut is what it is
yeah but what I don't get is okay so it
extends the zoom but how when you you
spin it for shortcuts how does it not
extend the zoom is it it does assume
only pop out when you have the camera
app open yeah I think right so that the
when the donut is on the screen that's
when you're using the the ring to
control the UI elements and when your
listen via Twitter well no it's not
because the that ring only shows up
every so often I wish tony was on the
air but he's six hours ahead of us and
he was up all night shooting like 40
videos so we can't ask them to be on
there but anyways I don't know the zoom
it's so strange to me because they
positioned it as like I wrote a note to
myself while I was watching the live
stream
like ah finally maybe we get to find out
who the zoom is targeted at and not real
buddy right all we heard was already
this is someone who cares a little bit
more about camera quality and once
optical zoom and optical image
stabilization but they didn't even they
didn't even go so far as to try and
justify the added size and weight they
were just like you just for somebody who
cares a little more about a camera I'm
like yeah but it's huge you never
responded to my message yesterday what
you said where is it come on what on
Twitter oh no I sent you a message today
a BBM did your BBM me bro no and talk
and talk oh and google hang out yeah
bullets talk because we haven't upgraded
our google apps account well what did
you say Taylor I'm pulling it up I just
quoted part of my stop calling every new
phone a galaxy s4 article um so or maybe
you like taking pictures of far away
objects and simply walking closers just
too hard and I scratched it out and I
said or maybe you prefer a great camera
a decent phone and don't like carrying
more than one device but it's not really
even a decent phone it's it's a low-end
mid-range phone so they're calling it a
galaxy s4 and its specifications are not
top quality but if you've paid attention
to Samsung branding the S after the the
brand so galaxy s the atif s s means
flagship s Men's top in high specs it's
supposed to a top of the line yeah
that's one in this go and brand the
galaxy s4 mini the galaxy s what we're
about to talk about no right we're about
to actually we're gonna hit the mini in
a second I want to talk about the the
active here because I think that's the
closest thing it gets the closest to the
original Galaxy s4 of these devices that
we saw yesterday wait a sec yes there
was here there was your sexy you're
wasted you're sick can I can I can we do
do a little bit of a tangent here and
talk about something that I don't think
we've ever talked about a podcast which
is the butterfly s what wait a minute
how are you just gonna launch that
torpedo in my samsung vote you told me
that we could see things
you know yeah I know I'd all right yeah
sure I mean deficit like talk about
coffee but hey what ya you know what's
gonna happen Brent it's gonna hit 1130
Brandon's gonna leave and Taylor you and
I are gonna be stuck on topic 3 go ahead
read it this butterfly s uh you know the
the the original droid DNA is based on
the butterfly and it has a s4 pro chip
which is it provides a little bit of lag
but it's got the 1080p screen 5 inch
which is a nice size it's got this nice
big glass panel on the front but this
butterfly s has the Qualcomm Snapdragon
600 at 1.9 gigahertz which is the same
chip that's in the galaxy s4 and it has
boom sound and it looks really badass I
mean this is gonna be a cool phone it's
just it's huge it's very big it's also
running since so that's awesome I don't
like sense yeah but if it's running new
sense that I'm okay with it um I can't
tell it does look like the nuisance it
looks like it has the clock widget from
blinkfeed phones on lockscreen do you
guys think this is coming to the US uh
no not anything with a butterfly
branding I don't think that's coming to
the u.s. no I mean literally don't you
it might come as the the dnas or DNA to
or right so that's an interesting
question I don't know if Verizon is
going to want to preserve that DNA brand
once they get the one in I mean you know
variety even made a good point in one of
his articles he's like you know verizon
tends to be very prima donna asked and
you know they like their exclusives and
whatever so it's possible they might
want to keep that DNA brand afloat that
may be what they're doing with this new
sort of droid resurgence have you
noticed that some of they read they woke
up their old droid brand on Twitter it
was like droid landing or something like
yes all day yep yeah so I don't know I I
kind of don't know i mended giving away
phones again yeah that'd be awesome it's
getting a little bit late for them to do
the HTC One so it's very maybe they have
a change of plan they're going to do the
DNA to kind of differentiate a little
bit it would be interest on Asteria see
this then the HTC one on verizon and i
know that we make some people mad
because I
even me in a sense it would kind of
upset me because I want to see the same
form launched worldwide on every carrier
but this is basically the one but i like
the DNA's design a little better not not
not not necessarily the build quality
but the design I like the colors and
everything the red I like the black of
red accent so nice and well I guess the
only downside is that the back is shiny
very plastic not soft touch it's not
soft touch no well that is weak not that
just ruined it that completely ruined
the phone for me yeah there's some
speculation also that the galaxy excuse
me that the HTC One mini might be
plastic in another piece here at
regulation can we actually can we talk
about the mini phone because I don't
have anything to say about the galaxy s4
active other than I'm excited about it
because it's rugged and waterproof and
second point I'm getting one today some
yeah panel TFT panel does it now hold on
a second now somebody on Twitter told me
or in the comments I don't remember
suggested that AMOLED actually also uses
TFT technology and TFT stands for
thin-film transistor and it just means
that every pixel has a dedicated
transistor controlling it I believe so
is that true can it are the terms AMOLED
and TFT exclusive or are they not
because I don't know I've always only
heard TFT LCD me too yeah I never i
don't think i've ever heard of TFT Emlyn
yes it doesn't even roll the tongue no
no no no no TFT backplane technology is
crucial in the fabrication of AMOLED
displays okay okay so yeah all right the
thing is though I generally when we talk
TFT versus AMOLED we are talking LCD
versus analyt anyway the galaxy s4
active will be in my office today I
believe in the afternoon if UPS is to be
believed and I will have an unboxing and
I'm going to use it for a weekend I'm
gonna get active with it and that's
going to be fun looking a swimming I
might go swimming tony has already
thrown it in the tank of water though so
that we've got that you guys didn't tell
me that these waterproof phones cannot
be operated when they're submerged in
water usually know that
yeah passive display goes haywire under
water because water it's it doesn't go
hey way it goes haywire at the at the
water air interface so if half the half
the screen is and what the f it is not
it'll go nuts but once it's underwater
it just doesn't do anything it just say
so you can't use it because it using the
shower literally you can is that you can
you just got to get it out of the water
stream brah yeah it can't be like fully
submerged store it okay it'd be like
touching the phone with ten digits at
the same time like the phone doesn't
really know what to do yeah and so does
the water conducts electricity so it
reads water as basically as input yeah
although pure water doesn't really
conduct electricity all that well oh
your water who has pure water very few
people but uh what was the thing I was
going to say I bathe in distilled water
yeah I generally only I get ya
demineralized water all the time in my
bathtub but no here's the thing I this
is further proof that physical hardware
keys are great in the case of a galaxy
s4 active it makes a lot of sense now
that those are not capacitive keys at
the bottom their physical and also a
physical camera button this makes a
physical camera button much more crucial
the kids are totally which i reviewed
you has a physical camera button and i
was able to take some underwater
pictures and that was great does the
active have a camera button I don't
think it does it has because when they
were doing the demonstration he said
press the volume button to exactly take
a picture right and that's what I think
that shortcut was built specifically for
that because the galaxy s4 you can't
shoot at the volume rocker can you I
don't think so but you can you can root
it it's always the UH whatever let's
talk about you can root it you can root
it let's talk about the galaxy s4 mini
which i think which we've hated on like
what four shows in a row but then I saw
Tony's hands on and I good thing looks
cute dudes does anybody like it I think
I think it looks cute I like I looked a
little the hardware I like the belt it I
don't think it's mini enough I mean it's
like a it's like the regular size phone
of last year but have you like no have
you watched Tony's video though well
Tony's got hands the size
right no so he starts with the s4 mini
in his hand and I'm like okay whatever
and then he brings the s4 into the frame
and the s4 looks like a note too i got
like God the small I'd like to put the
s4 mini beside the mega just to see the
mega because because the note 2 to me
feel small now because I carried the
mecca for a week that's a no do it was
like an s4 like it feels so small now
you want to just you know they weren't
showing the mega at this thing probably
cuz it wasn't a new product but I was
actually a little surprised that the
mega didn't factor into their lineup
here but I guess they were just keeping
it to the s stuff I'm is the ugly
duckling of their brand like it it's it
what I said in my review it's a beta
test it is a public beta test that you
have to buy into is exactly what the
mega is mm-hmm we is well we we I was I
have your review kind of attacked in the
rundown I want to talk about that long
but I know you had to send your review
back but I decided not to keep it Julie
wanted it you have to know to buy it
yeah chuckling no I wanted it and then
and then I thought about a couple things
I like the size and I the lag really
didn't bother me because really the only
lag the NYE experience was in the app
drawer which if I had used my own
launcher which I would have installed
monster action launcher on it it would
have been fine there would probably been
no lag whatsoever but what really turned
me away is one no LTE and I knew if I
bought it then a couple weeks down the
road they're probably gonna be 14 18
tears gonna learn exactly time you not
see oh really yeah there's one with LTE
coming exclusively to eighteen t um and
being are trying to resell that only try
to buy phones that I know that I could
resell in a couple months because yeah
well I by so many phones that I can't
afford to just to buy every phone and
keep them all so I do you think Rhys
help the resale value is gonna crash on
that thing it'll it'll crash and then
nobody will buy it because nobody knows
what it is yeah be like is that a note
to know it's a mega what's that you know
just have an Espeon no it does not like
that every buyer of taylor martin
smartphones is is a Carolinian it's
office and they've got cowboy hats on
what saying what
uh well I wish you look I'm gonna take
that pixie right slow down folks I have
a question what's requested well when
Taylor was talking about the galaxy mega
6.3 and potentially keeping it as a
daily driver I thought that pop it's
possible that that Taylor discovered
something new which is that there's a
huge marginal benefit to be had from
having a giant foam and I kind of
considered Taylor you're here on your
change of heart out to be a vote of
confidence against that but oh I totally
like besides it sounds like um it's just
it's just the LT issue the results the
resale issue yeah I haven't had an LTE
phone on AT&amp;amp;T in since the 1x mmm I'm
ready for LTE against I mean LT yes well
I mean I've had one review phone with
LTE and that was a galaxy s4 no to know
now you have to get the blackberry q10
has LT ok 30 all right go hang out of
out of like 8 devices I've been stuck
with their we've been having any of them
that are like two or three of them with
edge yeah it's janna had to review that
is ridiculous so I carried a second
phone just so I could actually have data
swinging from the absolute basement and
bottom of the barrel as far as specs to
every spec you could possibly imagine
are we ready to talk about our our
tablet dream device yes I know you're
online you're buying one I'm fine what
are you daddy warbucks over how much
money you got we're talking about the
samsung achieve q how much is it they
didn't know how surprised well the
comment thread on my my fanboy post is
somebody was saying that the netherlands
price has been fixed at 17 hundred euro
and then somebody else came in to back
them up on that yeah i know they know
but you know things are always it's not
a direct translation like you can't say
right now because I phones cost a
thousand dollars elsewhere and yeah
i knowi don't know what it's going to be
stateside really don't but DT of Q
listeners is just this ridiculous thing
I love how they presented it they it's
like the one thing in the presentation
yesterday that they did right where they
were like hey check it out we got this
tablet okay what is it Oh to Windows
tablet oh wait it also runs in
additional windows 8 Android and also
it's a 13 inch screen and also that
screen is very high resolution and also
it has an S Pen oh it also it has a
keyboard oh and also you can flip the
screen around like they just kept
bringing stuff out and it's like my god
this thing has everything you could
possibly want and as how the first thing
that has ever made me want another
windows machine since I left windows
over four years ago yeah this can you
kid what can can you walk me through
this desire to have a dual booting
device yeah so it's it's this thing
where you know when you choose a
platform you sacrifice some you you come
into it knowing that if you're getting a
say a windows phone you know you're
going to sacrifice Google integration if
you get a blackberry you know you're
going to sacrifice like a lot of
everything if you get a ir s device you
know you're not going to have a great
multitasking thing so having 20 s 2 0 SS
on the same device gives you allows you
the opportunity to give the best of both
worlds and usually you can find to this
environment where your dual booting
you're like okay I'd like to go to
android now and then you have to like
turn it off and back on and select a
different but you know once i got but
this device lets you just do it with the
swipe of a finger through some good
information all right side by side yeah
okay so so in actual use and in terms of
practicality when would give me a
scenario when you would be thankful for
this anything that windows 8 does that
that goog android does better like
here's one that I people jump down my
throat for before I'm done with my point
I windows 8 Twitter client okay it's
prettier than the Android one but it's
also in my opinion less it doesn't work
as well for me so I would use the
android client even though it would look
awful on a 13 inch screen and you know
yes you can go into the browser on
Windows but I don't want to do that I
just want to use a touch front
anything I want to swipe over there so
that's what I would do I would pin the
Android twitter client to the Windows 8
desktop or I would pin a better-looking
Android twitter client to the Windows 8
desktop but I would what where I would
really enjoy this is having all my
computer functions on Windows and then
having dedicated apps for things yeah
dedicated google+ dedicated you to
dedicated google play movies yeah oh I'd
have a goal like music google section of
Google Apps of Android M sitting on my
Windows 8 Start screen that's what I've
wanted is a long time the performance
look not so good on the in the Android
environment right no it looked fine
window do not look good I am I lag meter
where I went to about a 7.2 and I what
do you mean when tony was playing with
it or was in the demo um I haven't seen
Tony's yet but some of the other demos
I've seen it just it was yeah we should
make this clear we didn't mention that
the Android build that is running on at
least the versions they have in London
right now is a stock Android bill 24
dot-to-dot to it there's no TouchWiz
there's no anything going on they need
to leave it that way yeah but they'd
also need to make the s-pen work and
they need they need some customization
because they have a digitizer in there
as well the same with the same thousand
plus levels of sensitivity to so i don't
know i think they hound or something i
started noticing s-pen support for
third-party apps I got you really yeah I
use photoshop touch a lot i love that
app it's so awesome people always ask me
how do you blur out things in your image
and i'll take a picture and i'll just
show what i want and blur everything
else else out beyond recognition so it i
get some pretty cool effects using it
and i was using it the other day to
trace my the loop that i was making in
my car i was taking some back roads and
i was taking some very curvy back roads
and driving my car around and I got home
and I'm like I want to share you know
where I drove and I was tracing and when
I did it said s-pen your nice pen but
but stylus support if you don't have a
stylist I don't think that comes up but
it follows your ex being around it turns
on like the air view yeah yeah so it
turns on air view when you're going to
draw cool they were demoing that and
in berlin at Aoife when they were
talking about the note 10 dot one and
they were like hey you want to get your
picture taken on this moped and I'm like
sure I do and then they kind of used an
S pendant to cut out my stuff but yeah
this thing is cool so it's big it's it's
heavy it's a what at one point three
kilograms or something to know how much
it's gonna cost no no II just went over
that we just tied where were you at the
inn i'm watching tony's video right now
and i said same lucky that's I I am
watching Tony's videos that's where I've
been cuz i want to see see if he see if
there's any lag in his demonstration but
there's anything in it no no it's it's
pretty fluid in his didn't have any it's
got a has mold process i would love this
thing i would love this thing in a
7-inch form factor so oh okay dude i
would love this thing in a 5-inch form
factor for the Tavor yeah you know but
and now as i said yesterday what is this
like 2004 and the the HTC HD CDF's the
tilt the tilt 10 the shift the windows
pc it was pocket-sized yeah i don't care
about that but here's my thing Adams
line will punch you in the throat I was
gonna make animal so Adam Lane also
bdubs yet slain Adam Lane offline Adam
Lane Lane was at a event yesterday as
well he was at a New York City pep com
event and he got some hands-on time with
the a at Eve tab 3 which I don't care
about and don't want to talk about but
here's a point that it listen it's a
thin Windows 8 tablet the array it ruins
ruins Windows RT it's a what do you mean
oh it runs windows 8 pro yeah I know so
yeah when a when they announced it on
stage yesterday was fun they just
completely eviscerated when there's RT
in front of everybody samsung was just
like it runs the full version of Windows
8 not arty windows the size of an
Android tablet yeah yeah so that's
impressive I don't mean to sell it short
but i forgot to mention one thing about
the achieve q the possibly the most epic
tablet ever constructed somebody was
bringing up a point in the comments i'm
one of these pieces where it's like why
is this any different than the ax Seuss
playbook
trio and then I admittedly had to go
look that up because I missed I wasn't
like in the office for the asuste
release so I just don't know about any
that stuff was like oh okay it's the
same basic thing except in a transformer
form factor it is a detachable screen
and keyboard and it runs Android and
Windows 8 side by side so why am I more
impressed with the achieve Q and I want
to hear y'all's answer but for me it's
the fact that it's it's coming from
Samsung it has the S Pen support it is
an integrated product that is not
separable so I don't feel like I'm
detaching an accessory it's all blended
together as one product that i can carry
around that that's what makes it more
exciting to me but what do you guys
think I can't find it what's the name of
this thing the issues playbook trio I
don't think it's out I don't think it's
I don't think it's playbook I'm sorry
sorry what it was I calling I'm sorry um
it's the something book a sous trio
transformer book sorry playbook I've
really been thinking about blackberry a
lot this week I'm sorry remember the
playbooks it was funny yes the PlayBook
actually ran well I was disappointed it
didn't do had this this doesn't do it
for me because the difference is being
able to hide that keyboard away not not
have to not fold it up all the exposure
all the time exactly you just hide the
keyboard when you don't want it and when
you want it you pop it out yep yeah so
that's the difference yeah what about
you Brandon are you would you get a
transformer book trio or a writer Suh's
of what is it called a team qtq either I
just don't see the point well for me I'd
like it I like it a lot and and the
price is um is really the only thing
that would turn me away but uh I don't
think I'm not too worried about the
price because you got to think about it
it is not an Android tablet so you can't
think about it as in it needs to be 600
700 dollars it's a windows 8 machine and
i would pay I think my cutoff would be
like fifteen sixteen hundred dollars so
that high yeah i mean i like the morning
but boy I don't want
no that's like that's where I draw the
line I don't know that I would yeah I it
there but if it's any more than that
absolutely would not it's but I mean
ideally ideally i'd say i would guess
this will be around a thousand or twelve
hundred dollars that's my guess yeah it
is they've got something there they've
got the attention of everyone with this
they definitely do a 3200 by 1800 screen
that is ridiculous so at 13 inches and
this is another thing we were talking
about jumbo tablet remember this time
last year we were like oh we got all
these jumbo tablets on the horizon who's
gonna be the first to do a 13 inch
tablet and then like Toshiba did one and
kind of nobody really cared you know so
the thing I was I was walking by their
booth at CES and the guys like don't you
want to look at this tablet I was like I
can see it from here yeah it's too big
and i walked awful i can't wait till we
can talk about them I can't wait to I
remember we snaked our way through that
booth too and we were like anything new
you guys got anything new no nothing new
ok we gotta go but they had that they
had that really nice thing that I saw it
Aoife that tiny little Nexus 7 aping
thing which was made out of metal and
which was great the xt 370 or something
like that or 270 anyway um it doesn't
matter let's move on from the UT of Q
even though I don't want to pricing is
still not announced and we will find out
about this I don't know who's me it will
be looming rate if we could get one I
don't know if we can because this is
kind of a Samsung Electronics thing not
a samsung mobile thing but we are gonna
try our best so it'd be great if Samsung
will learn to announce price at their
launch or announcement events I'm sure
they're still debating it you know they
don't want price to cloud people's
desire to to get the products yeah ok
but right let's let's compare this to
Apple because we always do they
announced everything all their new
products are the new computers at WWDC
right everything came with a price and a
long how to launch to everything I most
of more like it's available right now
right and the crazy thing about this is
that there are people who are still
going to fight you in the comments about
that and don't know why would you do
that but that's so that see this is
stupid this is the thing where I cannot
I cannot go with anybody who would argue
against you on this there is a conch
satisfying a incredibly rewarding thing
to come away from an event knowing what
every product costs and when it's going
to launch and if you can and do that
today you shouldn't have announcements
and nobody else does it that way yeah my
friend Anthony on Twitter said yeah but
what about the the new Mac Pro and I
said that wasn't an announcement that
was something everybody knew was coming
but even Apple said they made it very
clear this is a sneak peak in something
we didn't want to announce today right
we're not announcing it we're announcing
it but we're just saying this isn't
ready and you know what you're allowed
to do that when you may get a beer can
computer you're doing when you announce
like six new products and they're
available right this minute yeah you can
say hey we're working on this and it'll
be available in a couple months we don't
know price I wanna not just we've got
this awesome thing and here it is it's
official have a nice day like I thank
you i think you know it's funny even the
live event dissolve that way the
announcement was like now will we be
giving you one more surprise before the
night is out come join us in product
experience and then the video ends it's
like Oh what was the surprise yeah on
Twitter like he turned around he's like
we've got one more thing and i was at
tweeted one more thing and he's like
we're gonna have live music later yeah
yeah oh sounds like a buddy bears are so
funny they're so long as the jokes that
had no response whatsoever Reza did you
did what I sing live as well were you or
you run a phone call for half of it
right I was not watching oh my god you
missed out on some well you know what in
the first five minutes I think I treated
him like this already has way too many
shades of Radio City Music Hall I hate
this already and new temp dance and
Tommy I was so upset yeah there was no
tap dancing kid it actually was better
than the galaxy s4 event but not by much
it was still grandiose they had this
enormous enormous stage for two people
to stand on it it was like it was bigger
than my apartment building not my my
actual apartment but the entire building
that I live in yeah yeah it was long too
big for the event
guys like I'm gonna walk over here and
do this demonstration and three minutes
later he got to the other side of the
stage yeah and then it tried to be a
water tank that it can drop you guys
kiss for active and it's like oh I've
seen that before whoa well Brandon is
prisoners quick at your location what No
did you just have like a paper avalanche
on your desk I just I just changed I
just changed position sorry guys my get
off look we were to say you changed
outfits haha gonna say that was
impressive because that was quick those
are you were supposed to stay in the
same position the whole frigging bad boy
what do you why do you why don't you use
your cuff button brother this was before
maybe maybe you guys can stay totally
stationary for 90 minutes could I just
you know what I do you know what I do on
the podcast oh you sent up see I'm into
my swiveling chair and I'm just
swiveling back and forth the whole time
I look like a six-year-old on the
podcast have a kind of saw a jog in
place and you never know hmm this guys
are really sophisticated and I I wish to
learn from you hey why won't the galaxy
NX be a big seller Taylor tell us about
what the galaxy NX is and tell us why
you don't think it'll sell because it
has two features that really make it the
galaxy NX what it has LTE and TouchWiz
what is it what is it over it is for the
later she's paying attent it is a
mirrorless camera so it's like a what we
use on on most of our videos and we use
the sony nex-5 in and you use the f3 i
believe correct i'm jaime uses a five in
as well and that is a mirrorless camera
so it's like almost a DSLR but it's more
pocketable um well I can't put it in my
pockets but uh the galaxy mega or Wow no
cow jenks the galaxy and X which is mega
it is very mega um it's a mirrorless
camera so it's supposed to be kind of in
the same class as what we use but it's
the size of the the nx20 which is
another samsung camera which is like a
bar yeah I feel like it's this it's a
big ol it's a big camera right it is
huge it's bigger than the nx20 so its
bigger than their official DSLR but it's
actually got more specs along the lines
of a mirrorless camera so that this
hurts this is an android-powered camera
that's much bigger than out galaxy
camera and thankfully it doesn't have a
phone built into it but it doesn't LTE
and it's got its got android so if I
tazewell have a phone has a 1.5 or 1.6
gigahertz quad-core processor right but
it's kinda like a galaxy camera than it
than any of the phones yeah but but it's
huge and it is enormous I personally
really really like it and I'd like to
have it yeah I'd like to really have one
because for us for people like us my
point in this article was for people
like us who go to trade shows and need
cameras with connectivity yeah there's
nothing more awesome than having a
camera with LTE built in like I feel
like this camera was built for the press
and kenshin else we've had we've had
some interesting uses for the galaxy
camera at trade shows where we can can
shoot back photos very quickly to the
guys that are in front of their
computers and posting news and so forth
so but did this this goes really to the
next level I guess I'm image quality me
up the galaxy camera kind of takes crap
pictures for a dedicated camera it takes
crap pictures what's the sensor size on
the nx20 um 20.3 yeah and you have
interchangeable lenses now proud I'm
interested because Brandon was making a
good point there I'm interested in how
much more efficiency though did that
galaxy camera bring us at events because
we can't we can't use the instant upload
for video we can't because we have to
edit our video first and then upload it
so we need a computer for that so really
it's only good for uploading still shots
to like Dropbox for the like you save
the team at home cell well what it does
is it is it saves it saves time maybe
not exactly at that moment because we're
sitting in the chair and we're taking
pictures of the event but you know if we
didn't have that capability at some
point during that day maybe later in the
hotel room or whatever we have to sit
down and trans it's not the longest
process ever but if the hotel Wi-Fi
sucks or something this way that the
photos can simmer on the Galaxy camera
and if there's poor LTE or whatever
it'll eventually upload when it has a
good signal
say sometime yeah well in theory it
would have worked a lot better when you
guys went to a New York event and we
were sitting here and I was getting
pictures on dropbox if we had enabled
Dropbox before you got to the event
because through the entire event I was
getting pictures of Brandon's family and
stuff no I thought it was mine so what
happened listen is I don't remember what
the event was but I was bringing my
galaxy camera along and when I enabled
Dropbox functionality yeah I enabled it
from the event and yeah I think Taylor
you guys got like 300 pictures of not
feelin at all yeah so when the event was
almost over I got like the pictures of
you guys sitting down in the crowd and
the event was over and i finally got
pictures of jason mackenzie on stage who
was an HTC event it was just like
awesome this is great that was the one
announcement that sort of us yeah but no
what what's so great about this camera
is the quality improvements so it will
take DSLR quality images or at least
close to it and it uses all of the
samsung NX camera lenses so if you've
already got a samsung DSLR which very
very very few people do this works
perfectly you can sell the body of your
camera you have by this thing and you've
got a better camera or at least the same
quality camera with more features but
why is that this is not going to be a
big seller is because there are several
reasons so most of these cameras with
Android built on them are built for
consumers basic users who want a better
camera experience who want more features
in a plain old point-and-shoot camera
enter galaxy camera right it's a phone
with a camera built-in and well it's
easier to use well okay not a phone but
it is a phone yeah but it doesn't have
phone capabilities but this this isn't
going to carry a lightweight price like
a component shoot camera like the Galaxy
camera or the yes it doesn't have a home
is what you're saying cuz pros aren't
going to buy it because it dumps it down
too much and consumers aren't gonna have
enough money to buy it yeah you don't
have enough buttons pro
was like hardware buttons on their
camera they like toggles and switches
because they can quickly access this
stuff with analog buttons yeah this you
have just as many features but you've
gotta dig through interface settings so
to change your aperture you're gonna
have to go through site for pages just
to get to your aperture settings if ray
um you know so pros are going to look at
this and say this is ridiculous why
would I ever use this and then you have
those consumers who are like I'm not
going to spend ten there are a thousand
dollars 1,200 bucks on a camera because
it has android and LTE like that doesn't
suit my needs I'll just get a basic DSLR
a micro four thirds or I'll just get a
point and shoot camera and be happy it's
so good this is it's a product that's
good for marketing it makes Samsung look
good and innovative and bald hot so from
a point was that this appeals to a very
very very very small demographic right
us no not really but what why does well
but yeah no no no no i agree with you i
know it's not us is sort of it but but
here's the thing why look at what
samsung is doing look at it in context
of what their efforts were with the
galaxy camera and where are they going
with it because we add the galaxy camera
we were like well where'd this come from
okay guys we know you made a little
cameras in the butt but now you're
making a big deal out of this and now
with this NX and it's in you know at the
event they kept showing close-ups of
samsung lens and they really want to
trend you know their positioning
themselves to know just well they've
already broken into the camera segments
but their position themselves to try to
dominate it in damage I'm getting there
I'm getting there oh don't really like
you oh yeah I'm getting there eventually
it's good because we have like we have
like four hours for this podcast so it's
good that we take your time so it
appeals to people in our industry
because we need great camera quality and
connectivity but the other people that
it appeals to is like like four people
people who want that LTE connectivity
nobody really cares that this camera has
an android on it nobody I if if I had my
in nex-5n with LTE I would be completely
happy but I don't so really this only
appeals to somebody who wants to take a
camera out shoot images and share them
immediately
but that's it who's going to want to do
that that's not the point though this
point is they're upping the ante in in
the camera space not two pros pros don't
care but they're putting android on
things that we never thought was
possible with android refrigerators yes
um what do you think the net emissions
they're putting TouchWiz on every one of
their products are they gonna make a TV
with TouchWiz like I hope not but LG is
making webos TVs so why not um but yeah
oh yes when that's why they bought up
rights to the web West okay all right
second Hut of stupid but yeah what
they're doing is saying hey we can do
this we've always thought Android his
pretty ass with camera quality okay
because the galaxy camera really only
you know solidified that in that it
really wasn't that great right so where
are we going ultimately with this cuz I
do we get out of it good how do we get
out of this camera discussion I'm sorry
brother um it's not gonna be a big
seller yeah that's good yeah yeah the
Galaxy NX interesting products and it
still to anyone there that's the
moralist or no I have one question what
does NX mean that was a good question so
I think you they wanted to steal from
the branding from Sony for any X the
dropping damn oh I have no idea that was
just a I just pulled that matter my rear
end Wow can you stop pulling things out
here but mr. day what does nccn NX mean
yeah so if you look up what does an ax
me and you get a lot of Star Trek links
444 hilarious reasons so whenever
there's an NX product with a specific
number after it I'm like oh hey my Star
Trek brain is going weird i don't know i
don't know it's probably a sony
emulation thing like you suggest we
talked about the samsung galaxy mega i'm
ready to jump platforms guys unless you
want to talk about anything else from
samsung because I'm so burned out on
talking Samsung that is a sound of
exhaustion yeah that was it was a lot of
stuff yesterday and you know who I think
was all covered pretty well Tony did a
really good job and Samsung brought out
some cool products they just I just wish
they wouldn't try so hard at there
actual events because it's so hilarious
and I wish they would just go back to
their their branding from before we're
galaxy s4 is a galaxy s4 and anything
that's not is not a galaxy s4 yeah yeah
I need to go back to Utah so we can we
briefly touch on this iphone 5s smoking
of things called s nope is this look at
do we think the cyllage it now yes
didn't even looked at it so it's
actually because when I saw this posted
yeah Brandon what I mean this is from
macrumors and from engadget via Engadget
from macrumors so it's got a taller LED
flash yeah that seems reasonable I mean
I think it's gonna have a higher
resolution camera it's bigger battery
and faster processor it's gonna look
exactly the same except for the back and
it's gonna have iOS 7 that's that it's
you know it's it's it's an it's an
in-between yeah it's at yeah the iphone
6 is the one to get well maybe actually
the eight i think is i heard is gonna be
good yeah that's what I heard I sources
say sources say you're right yes so you
know I i think it was interesting
because we normally don't post iphone
leaks but that's because not a lot of
them are terribly reliable usually their
renders or whatever but this one looks
like it could be legit and was this one
left in a bar yeah yeah they found has a
funny thing is that guy was a NC State
grad is that right friend knew him yeah
my friend that I worked with for several
years knew the guy guys I just gotta
just got an awesome thing on my
blackberry hub so blackberry hub you
know aggregates all your notifications I
just got my first bit of spam on
blackberry hub and I'm not talking about
an email spam the skype app just spammed
me in the blackberry hub oh my in a
skype offer for your blackberry 10 you
know skype to skype for free terms and
conditions apply this message was sent
by or on behalf of blackberry i'm glad
the microsoft bought skype at the same
time skype I used to enjoy enjoy skype
when there weren't advertisements in my
freaking chat window yeah this that's or
when you go to share your screen it's
like you must upgrade to share your
screen or continue without up
so or continue sharing your screen
without upgrading it's like what yeah
every time I get on a call with Jaime
he's like I've got upgrade I already
have a premium I don't need to upgrade
I'm like I don't know but I can click
right through this and share my screen
he's like I don't know this is
ridiculous every time we jump back into
using skype it's it's some software
update has happened and every time they
update skype they got to change the UI
like they gotta move the buttons around
they got it's amazing the using skype
after an upgrade is like visiting the
cereal aisle in your grocery store after
a week because everything has been
changed around how long until they put
Metro UI on it I wish they would because
those buttons are so small and bubbly
and stupid anyway let's talk about
Microsoft a little bit because Microsoft
apparently tried to make a little bit of
a purchase recently but they weren't
able to do it what do we think about
that I'd like to see huawei purchase
them but hey that's just me we're
talking about nokia and descended oh oh
yeah that is yeah it's like ihop buying
applebees it just makes no sense but it
still happened this is this was kind of
amazing to me because we had been
speculating about a podcast after
podcast is micah's you know was
Microsoft gonna buy Nokia at some point
if things get bad enough but we didn't
have any concrete info and I think this
was from The Wall Street Journal yeah
apparently there were negotiations that
were happening in over the past couple
months discussing the deal but
everything fell through rumored rumors
say because nokia was asking for too
much money and it seems as if Microsoft
walked away from the sinking ship you're
not worth twenty billion dollars man I
see ah it's so hard though is when you
look at all the metrics I don't know if
it's fair to call them a sinking ship
anywhere I feel like they've stemmed a
lot of the bleeding I feel like they're
at least nobody's sinking any lower they
might be sitting pretty low in the water
they put a bandaid on a 30 stitch gap
mmm so well and then you make a good
point about mean you made a good point
about what way though now and then while
way apparently came calling when they
when deals were happening and i think i
read somewhere else that huawei was
concerned about the investing in nokia
because they considered Windows Phone
quote week
which was an interesting quote to see in
a headline I didn't even bother going to
the comments it seems pretty pretty
blunt yeah it does done that number
Brandon what's your.what are your what
are your thoughts on this I I'm just
curious as to do you think it would have
been a good idea for Microsoft Word by
Nokia I well I I'm kind of curious why
the talks fell apart and the only reason
that I can think of the talks fall
artist because of disagreement and
usually it's about price so my guess is
that Nokia wanted a ton like a ton and
Microsoft just didn't think it was worth
it because they Microsoft has already
sunken so much money into Windows Phone
and it really hasn't paid off yet and
their investors are not gonna be happy
if they pay like what's the market cap
of Nokia anyone no no no let's say
you're that out are they public company
I think so and ok another corporation is
trading at cheese is trading at three
dollars and eighty-six sense right now
so so someone so the market cap is 15
billion so they'd have to pay probably
slight premium to that they wouldn't
have to pay all cash they could use some
stock so they'd have to probably pay
like half of that in cash like 70 I mean
that would be a mega acquisition and
yeah I think they need to buy Nokia so
that they can help drive more of their
their direction and and but that's my
question you know why would they why
would they have to buy nokia nokia is
already in their pocket and ok already
builds only windows phones basically
except for the ashes stuff so why bother
investing in in buying the company if
they've already got from Nokia what they
need to do exactly what they want with
the company to have their way with them
right but what could they what could
Microsoft you better Microsoft who can't
really sell the surface who or the
service pros doing okay but it can't
really sell the surface RT who's new to
hardware what could Microsoft do better
than no kit that Nokia is not doing well
right now I don't know yeah in like
three months from now we're going to be
able to answer this question a lot
better because the same question could
be asked about Google by motorola and we
don't know the answer to that yet uh the
patents yeah
that actually that that might be the
answer there nokia has so many patents
yeah mm-hmm but Microsoft's not really
Microsoft's not really getting attacked
with patents so I don't know and when I
because they're not running a huge
handset hardware play right now we
haven't seen a surface phone out of them
yet we've seen a tablet but but
microsoft hasn't really sunk in a lot of
money into Windows Phone because they're
getting just as much back from from
Android he's are getting more from
Android yeah yeah so that's that was a
point I made in an article a long time
ago is that Microsoft could do this as
long as Android is around so if
Microsoft lives it one percent two
percent market share for the rest of
Windows Phones life then it doesn't
matter because they've already made all
their money through Android so they
could try and try and try and throw
money around all they want because
they're getting money for nothing
advocates um yeah at the moment crazy
yeah for now yeah for now but I don't
know I you know I just think it's
interesting I like thinking about what's
what's happening okay but you know and
this is something I that makes me a
little sad it seems like and this is
something coming from somebody who's not
a business who is never a business
student and you know who's never really
in in business at a deciding factor a
deciding level but it seems that
whenever there are talks about a merger
or a buyout the actual event of the
merger were buyout is really not that
far away even if it's stuff like this
where it's like talks broke down so well
then somebody else is going to be
talking to him real soon if they're not
already so Google's gonna swoop in and
buy them that would be absolutely
hilarious I I don't think that would be
legal even I that would be hilarious but
what is huawei if Huawei were to buy
Nokia would that be the worst case
scenario why do I feel like that would
be horrible for now we've never seen
okay again they would market low-end
prepaid phones on a war dance straight
talk that's that that would be like
dating a really hot chick and then
putting a bag over head when you took
her out in public
I love your analogy thank you for going
that route uh yeah i I just I just you
always been trying so hard to get into
the US market nokia has a presence in
the US market I can understand why they
would be interested but the fact that
they were quoted as saying I i I'm sorry
I can't source this so maybe it's not
accurate the fact that they may have
been quoted as saying that Windows they
find Windows Phone week well then you're
kind of missing the point while you're
gonna buy Nokia and then use them to
make Android hardware like so many like
you know 14 million fanboys want no oh
while we calls Windows Phone week
because they can't do the exact same
thing they do with Android with Windows
Phone they can't build a twenty-dollar
phone to sell on straight talk or some
prepaid carrier here in the states and
and yeah well they build with marvins
for overseas they but they've yeah
edison and overseas yeah but but they're
not getting that same traction that yet
they are with with android phones that's
why they call it week they don't they
don't make compelling hardware to sell a
very standardized standardized software
that that's the thing with Windows Phone
you can't just slap Windows Phone on any
old hardware in itself you have to do
something compelling with the hardware
and that's something while he's not
particularly awesome at yeah I'm sorry I
I just found my favorite headline of the
day from network world it's a Windows
Phone week huawei sneers windows phones
are weak but still require a license
fees as Richard you see of Huawei's
consumer division according to an
interview in the Financial Times that's
not good android is free apparently was
speaking before the launch today of a
new yway smartphone or the other day the
Ascend p6 yeah yeah ten years ago not
even that in two thousand so 13 years
ago Nokia's market cap was just shy up
250 billion Wow
wow that is Ray that ish is cray and
they're not a sinking ship they're like
ten percent not even that of what they
were yeah what they were I just took
issue with your verb like it's like if
you're if you're low in the water and
your you've been mostly dead than yeah
but if you're sinking it says to me that
you're actually actively still dying
harder okay you know I feel like they
were plummeting to the bottom of the
Grand Canyon and they they were they
landed on a pterodactyl but the chair
now in China on a week branch yeah yeah
but you know they're still not falling
as quickly they're holding on they're
not dying as quickly I think so maybe
the COS will help to you know aid in
that recovery and we saw that maybe the
international version was possibly
revealed by this leak of this snow Kia
RM 875 I didn't crush your segway makes
me said it wasn't exactly as it was
happening I wanted to hit a bell and
mark the occasion hey I don't know at
this yose thing I I know I know it makes
Tony feel unnaturally towards a mobile
device and yeah make sure it gets me a
little good suit gets me a little
excited as well I get beads of sweat on
my forehead okay well that's good I'm
nice but like I kind of I kind of I kind
of don't get it I've never actually used
a peer review and you know I've seen
some sample images and I think a lot of
other people aren't gonna get it but I
think what's going to get people is the
41-megapixel thing that's exactly right
it's going to be such a headline and
people are going to like it's kind of
like it's it's kind of like going to a
cell phone store and getting a phone
with a 10 inch screen I mean just that
alone is enough to get you to pay
attention to it I need more mega pickles
Yeah right and this is what haha pickles
I still know it's funny I still remember
the morning I woke up and rolled over
and read the news and tony was at mwc
and our first headline our biggest
headline of the day his mwc 2012 was
nokia like something nokia wow
was crowd with 41 megapixel camera and I
had to look at it three times to make
sure I wasn't missing a decimal point I
almost emailed you brand and I was like
Tony made up with you to 4.1 right can
you or can you remind me what what that
actually means cuz it's not literally 41
mega I Taylor will be able to describe
it in detail first but but here's the
thing but few probably oh no I well
there's pixel doubling and stuff that
goes on but the point is none of that
matters because as much as i like to say
and as much as we all like to believe
that specs don't matter they still
matter if you advertise them properly
and it's being able to advertise and
truthfully a 41-megapixel sensor is
nobody else can match that you know i
was standing in line with my HTC one
when it was brand-new the review unit
and some guy asked me is like what's
that oh my god let's see HTC One he's
like ah how many megapixels are got like
that was the second question the guy
asked me what a jerk right but this is
what people do they want to do and have
doesn't have megapixels it has ultra
pixel right and I didn't even bother
trying to explain like it's just more
but it's a good camera but this is the
thing imagine if you told somebody that
same guy imagine if I was like 41 he's
like are you serious that gets
conversation going that gets buzzed and
it when you can back that up with
excellent performance like all the Lumia
devices can that's that's a game changer
that's why it's so exciting to me
personally yeah my grandpa obsessed over
megapixels and cameras he didn't care
about anything else justjust megapixels
and every time I would come to his house
with a new phone he'd be how many mega
pickles it has first first of all you
should correct your father time that
they're not mega pickles their megapixel
never true never correctly it's what do
you mention that Taylor because I've had
that happen like my parents or something
no no my dad he um he got his his um his
girlfriend got him a DSLR camera and
which I thought was crazy because he is
an iphone 5 that should be good enough
he's never gonna figure out how to use a
DSLR it's bulky for the things he takes
pictures with he's gonna forget it and
it's gonna be a waste of money
the one thing he knew about it was how
many megapixels it had and it really
surprised me that people still thinking
about that and because the regular
consumer space lags behind the tech
press and the and the actual state of
things because people want to be able to
classify cameras they want to be there's
so many smartphones out there's a what
do you got the galaxy oh I got the droid
I got the iphone how many mega pickles
you got you know it's like it's the same
saying I'm saying megapixel but it's
that thing where people are like Oh what
do you mean megapixels and people like
to be able to educate each other in the
regular consumer space and say oh well a
mega the more megapixels you got the
better it is and regardless of how wrong
that is millions upon millions of people
believe that is the case yeah so that's
why I had an important I had a tiger Wow
um I have a photography friends try
again trike I have a friend who's a
professional photography nose and she
took pictures she's a she was a
wonderful photographer she is awesome I
love her pictures and one of her clients
came up to her after the shoot and was
looking at the pictures and she said you
need to buy some more mega pencils to
put in your camera can see cheese a mega
pencils mega pencils and she said she
just about fell out on the floor and
told the woman to just leave mega
pencils what's important so every time I
see her and she's talking about cameras
and stuff I'm like how many mega pencils
i have and she looks back at me and
always says mega pickles and so my
grandpa would always ask me that how
many megapixels that have after he would
ask me if I still work at the internets
you still work at those internets yeah
you work at the internet still some
supplements that man sometimes Michael
emails me and he says can I has more
interwebs and I'm like yeah I can I do
not provide the interwebs I need more
tiny dinner webs okay Brandon since me
emails that are completely like yeah
that was fine and odom I can't decode a
metal like wife's can you want to get
hair together can you carefully I send
it to Michael I'm like do can you
understand that when he did say hold on
i'll read it it was the most a salir
exchanger because i'm in the middle of
writing at eve q stuff and then Taylor's
like can you decode this brand
an email yes and samsung pieces with the
subject I said got anything yet and then
I gave you two suggestions something
about an android-powered DSLR with LTE
something about how Samsung is ruining
the galaxy brand and your response that
was my email your response was looks
like two things one Android and my
response back to that was uh what no
idea what you mean by that I was trying
to say I as kind of say that the you
know not that many things were announced
but one is Android the win and so and so
that you should expect an email and
figuring out what we're gonna write
about haha see you just gotta know ya
just gotta fill in the gaps it's that
easy that is it was a qwerty feel I had
to fill in like 40 words it was great
yeah I'd laughed about that for quite
some time did you guys know Steven just
put up an article because a friend sent
to me an email with this if it HTC is an
offer if you type in your serial number
on an HTC website you get 25 bucks in
google play credit you're kidding me i
didn't know about that i wonder if i can
do that with my international yes you
can gotta pocketnow.com oh yeah the deal
the if you bought an HTC One starting on
jun 14th you could be eligible for
receiving a twig free $25 google play
credit that is awesome and sorry gonna
try you international pocket now readers
this deal is strictly for one handset
sold and activated in the US we know
lame hmm that's too bad starting on jun
14th you had this way before June
fourteenth so it doesn't work mmm even
so honest mmm he tells it like it is we
like that in our news in our news team
news team alright we anchor man 2 is
coming out that's going to be great
let's pin I want to see it so bad I want
to see a bit ly sheets on each minutes
left so let's make these its count we
good we're gonna yeah we're gonna talk
about really head Ron Burgundy don't we
have one burger you don't we have
listener males that were you gonna ask
well we only have two subjects left do
you know rond who's the the the the
adult film brand around Jeremy yes I met
him
it was kind of funny um you didn't shake
his hand it was just a rest of you yeah
it's important to shake a hand i Jeremy
probably washes his hands I would I
would bump his elbow big bump elbows
high I did you meet him Brandon I was in
Las Vegas for my bachelor party and I I
really do not remember much about it
except that we happen to be in town the
same time that the adult film convention
or something was in town and so like
here's a bunch of like you know the 25
year old guys you know away from their
girlfriends and wives and and and like
just like a cab ride away is this porn
convention is a week after CES wasn't it
may be an adult entertainment expo as
well no it was not it wasn't near CES
actually it was a different time of the
year it's a different kind of it was a
different thing the thing you're talking
about taylor i think is like the movie
expo or something but this was just like
a general adult thing and and we walk in
and there he was with his mustache and
it if this was a video podcast i pull up
a picture on my phone because we got
some pictures with them but anyway this
is totally inappropriate you know what
no you know we are gonna move on but i
found it very fascinating too by the way
I if you read any autobiographies or
biographies of people in the adult film
industry it is wow I mean it's like
really depressing reading but it is also
fascinating and when I was in the middle
of reading some story about some suicide
or something really really sad stuff I
it would day mention CES and was like
wait what are you guys talking about I
didn't know that for years the adult the
adult film expo coincided with CD CES in
Las Vegas same time they had just quit
no idea they had to move the the movie
porn convention whatever a week back
because they were it was crushing the
infrastructure of Las Vegas because the
normal population of Las Vegas is just
over 200,000 and it Quint tuples during
these things right yeah so for CES alone
it triples yeah and then with with the
porn convention there it was like five
times the normal population in the city
and every hotel was every hotels booked
every cab was taken I mean there was
literally there's a line out the door
the in and out burger yeah the train was
completely packed 24-7 that you know
they was just like this can't happen we
can't do this anymore so they moved it a
week back and there were a lot of people
that uh I went to see yes you were upset
they were like what no what do I do when
the show floor closes all those outlets
that cover tech news and adult film news
all those heroes dual dual mode outlets
hey the Nokia Lumia 925 got a review you
should check better and Tony did that
and you know what I've been watching the
metrics as compared to the blackberry
q10 review and do you guys know without
looking at the metrics and listeners you
can have your own little guessing game
in here if you want do you guys know
which device is currently more popular
in terms of views on this since you
asked the question it's probably the
unexpected one which means it's the q10
isn't that crazy yeah it must be a fluke
in the data it can't possibly be well
the noise it I wanted it like I saw it
before and I'm like man they try my one
channel yeah I'm no doubt good stuff
sure and I'm not saying the q10 is a bad
device and if you read my review you can
tell that I'm not saying it's a bad
device but the thing is people were
asking us people were banging down our
door in the comments like got a 925 yet
you have Lumia 925 do a review the 925
your comparison the 925 like it was this
amazing maelstrom you know how many
people were asking for the q10 review
none like nobody do people still don't
come to us for blackberry news first
because we were still new to covering
blackberry which I guess is the thing
it's just stunning to me that the
blackberry q10 is outperforming the
Lumia 925 on our metrics it's
interesting but hopefully it might be a
little different globally though it
might be SEO maybe I don't know it could
be it could well be I don't know but in
any case both those reviews were up
alongside your mega one we had a heck of
a week in reviews which was cool Mary go
Mary go and so it's nice Taylor I have
both me using the q10 we've been looping
hi Mei into BBM chats because Jaime has
my old z10 and hi Otto and hi Otto yes I
got door is
so now we like the elgato though that's
a fun device but also say oh yes st.
really my ogata was is useless is a
really wet Brendan oh never mind so you
just gotta power through and Taylor
interrupts you just gotta keep talking
huh I was told when I started on this
podcast I was told if in doubt or when
in doubt just in a space that's right
because we hate dead space and that's
why i hate i hate interrupting people
and i'm just like they just do it all
the time created a monster in the last
in the last three minutes i can be here
i want to go back to something that we
were talking about we're talking about
pickles and i was wondering if you guys
like the sweet gherkins you know this
you know the smaller ones or if you like
the ones that are more classic vinegary
pickles I hate Michaels the old pickles
are delicious um what are they sweet uh
it's like an olive pickle or something I
can't remember what it is grape leaf
greatly pickles those can you send me a
jar Taylor I have no idea retirement my
grandma can zhem so yeah continued or
really yeah I would love some homemade
pickles from your grandmother yeah she
makes them out of the cucumbers in our
garden um but yes great bleep pickles
are are not that great I don't like
sweet pickles but but dill pickles the
vinegary ones are delicious if we were
doing a video podcast you would see me
you'd see me like bashing my head
against the foam in my booth cuz it's
really really nice to do and here when
you guys talk about pickles I hate pics
so i just have nothing to contribute him
so i'm afraid you know circus boy yeah
you know I just don't like crispy briny
things in in green liquid not my thing
Brandon are you getting any new device
reason for yourself because you people
you know I still get the occasional
where's Brandon minimun and I comment my
video i post i get where's Joe Levi and
where's Brenda mmmm mmmmmm I can't
people be satisfied with who's there at
the moment I know people never matters
is oh we don't like me like they like
Joe no they're starting to like you a
lot better see I told you is just
because you were new and then now now
people like you better now people like
me but they do get upset in this podcast
like in in the posts and stuff if I
don't interrupt people if I don't crush
that way
and don't interrupt people don't like I
got up something to either and I'm like
I already did it uh ya know but Brendan
are you getting a sweet sweet new toy
soon hell am I I don't know you tell me
bro well is if we were going to get so
listeners you get to this is the last
point we make before Brennan has to go
you get to see take a peek behind the
curtain because we were going to get the
NEC terrain but then we kind of looked
at and we looked at the other devices
where we're coming in and we were like
you know what we don't have time to to
do this right now that was the decision
right Brennan yes yes yeah so if the NEC
terrain is the first NEC device to hit
American shores in a very long time but
it's also it's ruggedized which is the
only cool thing about it really it's an
android device with a physical qwerty
and it looks like at in the words of
Adam Lane when I asked him because he
saw it last night he was like it looks
like an old windows mobile device that
might still need a stylist it doesn't
feel that great in the hand like yeah I
was like her 640 by 480 resolution yeah
Brandon would love that like what yeah
referre I mean what was the point in
bringing that up the question was it was
not a rhetorical question I'm not
sending you a surprise device for
anything like that but I it's just that
we we do get people occasionally asking
if they could see you more often on the
tubes and now with pocket now alive
taking the summer off I just wondered if
we would see your face sure he has a
device so i can send you my ouya i think
people are missing my might squinty
brown eyes and mine well when when the
wind when the wind blows and there's
something amazing to be reviewed I will
review it however a lot of the time in
the next few weeks I will probably be
changing poopy diapers so right right I
can't wait I'm gonna send you a cigar I
can't wait I'm gonna road trip up there
and and say hello that'll let you test
driving my car so that'll be your for
big i do want to test drive your car
every time you post a picture on
facebook i get i get very excited mmm
you little sweat on the brow
I finally got rid of my 30 day tags
which is so nice but so so so so are you
are you happy with the color choice
Taylor got a scion what are the letters
FRS front-engine rear-wheel-drive sports
car my goodness I can't believe they
made a rear-wheel drive car that's
amazing yes sir so are you enjoying the
color that it's like an Archie Brown of
it nice no it's not actually a burnt
orange it's like a bright just it when
the Sun shines on it it looks like it's
on fire it's just really really bright
and if it's like an overcast day it's a
burnt orange so it's metallic it's
really cool I like it a lot at is
awesome that's a and I get a lot of
questions about it like somebody asked
me the other day they didn't see the
front of it they saw the top and they
looked at me and they were like is that
a Ferrari I'm like no it's a scion it's
not that expensive and someone I get a
lot of questions asking if it's a
through the 370 like a new 370 or even
like an older model on 272 whatever that
number is 27 easy yeah so I get a lot of
questions nobody really knows what it is
and I drove back home for fathers day
and there are none of them up there John
and I mean so rare right now it's
something zero there are a lot of them
in in Charlotte I see them probably two
or three times a week but back home I
drove around I drove 200 miles back home
I saw nothing you know nobody had ever
seen one before i went to a lotus lot
and the the salesman walked up means
like you could have had a lotus and he
was explaining the price and everything
i said you're a little about out of my
price range i don't have sixty eight
thousand dollars to put down on a car
and he's like yeah but it's all about
the satisfaction of having a hand-built
car and it being you know rare there are
only six hundred of them in the states
every year and then he looked over at my
car and he's like come to think of it
I've never even seen one of these you
have a nice car sir I was like we thank
you are you gonna quit trying to sell me
a lotus now sweet but yeah it was a hey
it's awesome uh yeah hi Otto makes a
good point in a recent tweet he says my
biggest sister sorry totally awesome so
my
biggest appointment the blackberry q10
is that dual wielding with another
smartphone is an absolute must zero app
selection yep wow that's the problem and
importing apps from android just isn't
that great yeah but it's a terrible
experience and the apps after you get
them on there or pretty bad new
excitement though and we android for dot
two apps are going to be supported in
blackberry runtime it already supported
in beta before the before the tide
carries carries me away I do have to
jump off now gentlemen but all right
brother good to have you on the show sir
keep it clean don't forget the mouthwash
good that we should go we should go you
wanna let you want answer it you want to
answer a piece of listener mail or two
we can do one or two yeah alright let's
do that let's do that we weren't going
to do it but you know what we're already
over time and I feel like we owe people
stuff after talking about porn stars and
mega pencils and cars for and pickles
are too long yeah and pickles hello
guvnah i show my god i do it's so so bad
we're not making a timestamp edit that
out or you know I'm actually just going
getting into the listener mail all right
God cast I would open sale all right
here we go listener melon we haven't
prescreened these so this will be fun
and Taylor has no idea which ones were
gonna do so in read them so hey cool
David Bullock had interesting
interesting so this came in seven days
ago well before samsung's at eve q but
it almost directly addresses this from
David Bullock hi I've been thinking
about how Windows 8 has opened the
floodgates for tons of tablet laptop
crossovers I've been coming into the
Ultrabook space how excuse me however
none have really taken off in terms of
sales I personally don't think that any
OEM has got the whole concept right as
of yet I also think that there's a lot
of potential in the market for a tablet
laptop cross over and around the 500 to
900 dollar price point I think this is a
perfect opportunity for apple or someone
else to step in and follow that concept
but get it right have everything worked
just right in a way that isn't at all
uncomfortable for the user maybe even
with wacom stylus support I think
there's Johnny that could be made if
there was done properly yeah exactly as
for David Bell you should go into a
line of business I don't know what you
do but you should be a fortune teller in
Salem Massachusetts or somewhere else
that's really cool way to email us seven
days before a big of a big device that
meets some of these requirements and of
course of them only things in question
really is the price exactly and that's
if it's at nine hundred dollars I will
be their own launch day to pick it up
yeah if it's as low as 900 hours that
would be pretty pretty amazing but yes
the only thing I'm worried about is if
the s pen works like it does on the note
to where it shuts off capacitive input
when your type or tighten when you're
trying when you're using yes Ben because
that's one of the biggest problems with
an S Pen if it doesn't you're going to
write with your hand still so I imagine
they would but if you talk about palm
rejection or what it's called palm
rejection but what it does is it
switches to inductive input only instead
of capacitive and inductive oh yeah
right so so there there might have been
some complications with the the screen
resolution or you know the display type
or whatever because yeah I don't think
they've gone back on that but if they do
that will completely ruin it for me yeah
so David I mean this is a really good
point I I think that wasn't a question
it was a question it was okay it was it
was basically a question about Jesus I'm
sorry I just got to strike at Brandon
just sent me a gizmodo article on some
kind of woven graphite bathtub I don't
know what the foots coming up I love
Brandon brenda has a hard stop so that
he can go and look at design articles
about soda cans no the the question was
basically what are our thoughts about
you know about David's thoughts which
are that hey the convertible space is an
intriguing one and nobody's really done
it right yet why do we think they aren't
taking off you know and uh I i hope the
atif Hugh does and I really do because
it is it would be the first Windows
tablet that's really just hit the nail
on the head I think right but I put it
to also i have no confidence that it
will i recall being so so very taken
with the HP Envy x2 at Aoife before it
was released and now that i have 1 i'm
like wow this thing just is just a
basket of compromises and it's horrible
so like this one doesn't
seemed to be I mean it's got the same
it's got a Haswell processor on the spec
sheet you're right it doesn't but yeah
the I don't think the user experience is
going to be not only do I don't think
it's going to be for everybody I don't
think it's going to be for many people
but I 88 windows 8 isn't for many people
it was windows 8 and Android so while it
offers listen for geeks like us and this
is why I wrote that piece yesterday for
tablet nerds it's the epitome of an
amazing device and we all want it for
the regular consumer I you know so many
this is why so many people buy iPads
this is why so many people buy devices
that are because they're simple and
they're relatively cheap the convertible
market is inherently more complex
because it is they're physically more
involved devices they have many
components and it requires the user to
be able to switch contexts on the fly
exactly be able to switch between the
Android experience and the windows
experience and the testament
simultaneous experience as well which is
another thing that Windows Phone don't
think people have really gotten over
this gorilla arm thing with windows 8
alarm yeah look it up it's a it was a
problem they ran into in the 80s when
touchscreens first became sort of semi
popular people's arms got tired because
the screen was positioned like a
computer screen oh yeah you're yeah
you're like reaching your arm up and
it's not a very fun user experience but
never heard it referred to as that but
you could lean the screen back you can
flip the keyboard underneath or the
keyboards facing back and you flip the
screen over in it acts as a stand you
can lay it back n so that wasn't even
what are you doing like are you typing
and then getting up and walking around
to see the screen then walking back
around two types of more like what I
don't understand how that how they
handle helps in this context because it
doesn't know you can flip the computer
around but if you don't need the
keyboard if you don't need the keyboard
yeah but weren't we just talking about
needing the keyboard right this is this
is the core of the problem with
convertibles right because they're
inherently more complex and that's what
people don't like that's what regular
consumers don't like I've heard very few
negative um I guess complaints instead
of negative just complaints about the
yoga I'm switching from using the
keyboard to just a tablet
you can do what you want with your
physical fitness but we're talking about
computers hey hey now David is an
interesting point I think it's a
complicated question and thank you for
you know if you have a look at that a
team Q and if you have some further
thoughts on this right in again and
we'll we'll catch back up with you
because you know i don't think the
achieve cube is going to change the
market but it's certainly one of the
more intriguing devices in this category
and let us know if you want to buy one
thanks for the next for the mail let's
uh let's keep having I'm gonna look here
also um just to say I was born with
gorilla arms so I don't know if this
sack um I don't know if this really
affects my my take on touchscreen so I'm
just gonna leave that i'm going to give
you that and you take it for what it's
worth i was born with grill arms and
tree trunk legs so it's nice that's good
it's good I i have great email here that
might be well-suited to you Taylor
because you have one of these devices hi
I'm kalium I'm 14 years old and I live
in Maryland I've been listening to your
podcast for a long time now and I listen
to it while mowing the lawn and I
actually wish it was longer because it
is so good well well welcome to with the
episode 41 what episode 49 the longest
ever episode with the most off-topic
stuff and his sorry to break our streak
it was hey I have but one humble
question for you says kalian and it is
this if google says you don't need
expandable SD card storage and
smartphones because it's not as
effective as just having more built-in
internal storage then why do they offer
an 8 gigabyte nexus 4 in their google
play store that's a very it's a valid
question if they don't it seems to me
that based on what google has said about
expandable and internal storage they
would actually offer larger storage
options like 32 and 64 gigs thank you
for your time and keep up the great work
Taylor all right there are two answers
to this question the eight gigabyte
nexus 4 is a bit of a different story
because it is a device that is sold at
cost or below cost depending on on what
you're looking at um so yes there is a
reason that that device is 8 gigabytes
only but they could have made a 32
gigabyte or 64 gigabyte model and just
sold it for a little more they were
trying to hit a certain price point
which is 300 bucks
which is abnormally low for a phone so
that I understand does it is it a an
excuse for not offering bigger devices
no and basically the way I see it is if
you do not support micro SD card slot
you need to make a minimum storage
requirement and it so we no lower than
16 certainly 06 10 is ideally it should
be 32 16 is pushing it and and most
people like I don't even use 16
gigabytes when I say that 16 gigabytes
is not enough yeah who cares who cares
if you don't use 16 gigabytes jumping up
to 32 gigabytes is not that much more
expensive on any manufacturer side now
it's on the retail side it's like fifty
to a hundred dollars you can't
ridiculous cost them like 18 bucks or
something like that on them matricide
it's like why why why are we still the
galaxy mega that's one reason I didn't
keep it the one I had had eight
gigabytes of built-in storage which of
course they had a microSD card slot but
that doesn't matter I can't put my apps
on the SD card without rooting it yeah
and the problem is it had TouchWiz and 8
gigabytes of storage which means the
user like the space available with user
was under 5 gigabytes which is not and
that should never be the case and this
perv yeah yeah it's not worth the
trade-off in in costs as those our
experience is so temperate the good user
experience is so temporary because once
you download enough apps are getting
enough media on that thing you start
running out of memory and then Wow seven
months later you have a useless device
yeah and people get this wrong all the
time they say why do you hate micro SD
cards I don't I like them I enjoy them
they're they're useful for when i switch
phones or things and i need to take the
stuff i've downloaded to one phone to
another phone yeah i got a SD card in my
note I put it in my mega and there was a
lot of stuff already there like backups
for apps and all kinds of stuff so I
just restored everything to my phone and
you know it was good but other than that
like for apps and stuff i buy from
google play my google play music my
spotify music all this stuff it's
useless to have an SD card and very
little built-in space the built-in space
needs to be at
East this is 2013 it needs to be at
least thirty two gigabytes and with 128
gigabyte chips on the way from Samsung
we can hope that the smallest option
soon will be 32 gigabytes because
Samsung is building e MC and 128
gigabyte chips for internal storage all
right I've run out of run out of RAM for
this memory discussion but uh thank you
very much for that for the mail and
we're going to move on to the last one I
hope that made your lawn mowing a little
bit more enjoyable calyon although you
may have mowed your lawn like four times
over by the time yes definitely give
give the thing a rest cuz man is the
final piece of listener mail and it is
from someone who encourages me just to
call him Steven because he knows i wrote
i don't really like prancing names
that's awesome second the show is
awesome i really like the timing of the
podcast as it usually comes out during
my two hour train trip home so thanks
for it well we're going to get you all
the way home on this one oh yeah yeah
and my dilemma says steven is related to
google reader this has to be answered by
taylor because i never used it it'll be
shut down in a couple weeks and I've yet
to find a good alternative I see
everyone recommends feedly but there's
something about it that I don't like I
was thinking of using Google+ or Twitter
as my RSS feed as nowadays everything is
posted in every possible site what do
you guys think ok so when google
announced that they were shutting down
reader my world shrunk to this little
itty-bitty little ball and then poof it
was gone oh noes on old TV yes and I
felt awful because i've been using
google reader for six years I don't know
since they launched it I'd started using
it the day that launched it and yeah I
was upset because you know what am I
going to do to to set this off to get my
news after it's gone and on july first
it will be shut down one thing I did is
I went to Twitter and Google+ and I
added all the sites that I follow and I
don't strictly rely on those but I see
them throughout the day as I'm on
google+ and twitter so I supplement the
holes the gap
with with social media so I catch stuff
as it as it's going by but but the thing
with feedly is that they're not just
using their own service so they they
switch to their own their own feed
service so you sign up for feedly and
you download the app and you can sync
stuff between all your devices your
computers and everything and it works
just like Google Reader the problem is
that the interface doesn't look all that
great if you want to quickly flip
through everything like a like a list
okay because you get pictures it's like
Flipboard this is kind of how it is so
it it looks nice but it's not great for
a quick efficient reading like google
currents or something like that CMU see
what you think about some of these
because actually I was just looking at
the Twitter feed which by the way I use
Twitter as my as my informal RSS reader
like that's basically how I get all my
news is twitter because I follow all the
new sources that I care about and I'm
always in the feed so I'm like okay cool
look at this look at this look at this
and as I was looking at Twitter just now
while you were talking Taylor I noticed
that BGR has a story on this google
reader died on two weeks here that all
the best alternatives hold on just to
give you a little bit of a list that we
have newsblur feedly feed bin feed
wrangler and feeder which it tells us
that not only that there are
alternatives but that people need to get
more creative with their app names yes i
right but the point I was making is that
feedly has effectively replaced google
reader and that is in the back end so if
you use another RSS feed the chances are
they've either switched to tap two or
feedly and with feedly you can import
your google reader account before july
first so you can import all the feeds
you followed and then you download an
app like press press s what i use mainly
from our RSS feeds now it looks just
like google reader but it's it's
prettier it's really really nice if
you've used reader on iOS press is an
android version of that gap basically
and you import your feedly so you sign
in to feedly in the press app and it
works just like Google Reader and it is
actually ten times better so that's how
I supplement or how I've found an
alternative I've basically started you
zing press and feet lee side by side and
Twitter and Google+ so I'm always
getting everything all the time valuable
advice and and Taylor I'm glad you were
here to answer it because as I say I was
not experienced in it so I hope that was
a little bit of a help to you Steven and
thank you for writing in and it seems
though as though we've we've cleared at
the inbox for now we still have some
