from pocketnow.com we got Christian here
who's gonna give us a demo of the lumia
900 from Nokia that's here for a demo so
let me zoom into the device this is a
you if you're if you're already familiar
with the lumia 800 and 900 it's it's
pretty much the same sorry the Lumia 800
it's pretty much the same device and
designed but obviously the internals are
very different it's actually a larger
phone so tell me about it sure this is a
beautiful new kia lumia 900
this is our first 4g LTE device which
was recently announced yes for it
changing this beautiful device has a 4.3
inch display a polycarbonate back so
unlike many of the other devices that
you might see in the market it has a
smooth unibody a smooth back surface
which stands out is it eclis from
nuclear devices that you see
it is as I mentioned an 8-megapixel
Karzai's camera here so it's really good
optics it has a front-facing camera for
video chat
and it has 16 gigs of internal memory
right now the Lumia 900 runs the
Microsoft Windows Phone operating system
yes so Microsoft Windows Phone operating
system is meant to be fast it is meant
for fast multitasking fast movement
between applications and integrated
seamless experiences between your social
networking mapping so right
show me that show me that one point 4
gigahertz processor in action ok let's
go to the People Hub in my People Hub I
have all my contacts ok I'll tell you
that it runs the people have a lot
faster than my Dell Venue Pro so we're
good there show me some more all right
it has all these integrated social
networking feeds from Twitter and okay
let's try launching other sections see
how fast the phone launches everything
with the processor let's see let's go to
the pictures quickly launches yes
transitions let's go to different albums
oh and the pictures launched out there
yeah
see how quickly consume that's a very
ugly picture but that's a very good demo
of how faster that's so let's go to some
big choice you know it's very fast okay
do you have any video that I could demo
probably not in this one okay let's go
to a CNN happen sure sure sounds good
let me yeah that'll be a good way to
show how the LTE works yeah this ceiling
app is exclusive to the nuclear industry
all right this app lets you get the
latest news latest videos news analysis
in a beautiful dy format the interesting
thing about this app is that it lets you
do citizen journalists and more output
okay so if you have if you have a PD of
an event which you notice while you're
going about your daily business you can
send it up to Siena okay that's what
citizen Charles let's go onto the videos
don't worry there are about a million
people in this place yeah it's crazy
it's crazy well sadly we're not able
gonna we're not gonna be able to demo
the 4G LTE on AT&amp;amp;T today but but show me
more of the device you have the CNN
application which just lose it for Nokia
show me which other applications are
exclusive for this device sure we have
the ESPN app for Nokia okay lets you get
the latest sports scores follow your
favorite teams they schedule religious
reporting videos and the latest analysis
yes but let's also go on to some other
exclusive Nokia Maps
we have something called as a nuclear
trial yes it's our voice assisted
turn-by-turn navigation yes we've we've
demoed it it's very very look at maps
but ok Maps has let you search for
restaurants such as let you search for
coffee shops anything that you want
anywhere you want it also lets you do
search for public transport and lets you
quickly find metros cabs buses exit
route to get from place to place right
well very nice you know the device looks
hey it's it's the first option of 4G LTE
on a Windows Phone that's going to be
available on well it depends if it gets
released before the HTC Titan 2 but
hopefully this will this will get
released a lot of people are waiting for
this Lumia design to come to the United
States everybody's waiting for it so a
lot of us are really excited to see the
phone sadly we couldn't test the 4G LTE
but so far the device looks very very
compelling it looked the design is
extremely you know it's high quality
this is an iconic design I that that's
probably the best way to describe it
it's your TV it's your typical Lumia 800
design on a bigger device so thank you
very much Christian for the demo I know
you can't let us touch the phone or
anything do you have any pricing or
availability yet no the pricing has not
be locked on it it'd be reason you
taking the spring time frame the spring
time frame okay well I appreciate it
very much Christian thank you very much
