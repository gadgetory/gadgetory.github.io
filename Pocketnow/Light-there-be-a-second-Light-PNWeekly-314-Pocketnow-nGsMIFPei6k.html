what a busy week for things that don't
have to do with smartphones
well at least directly for example
Apple's laptops they try and fix one
problem here and then make everything
else better the catch you don't get
there without breaking a few eggs and
then scrambling them on a MacBook Pro
it's hot too hot for its own good
also our iPhone owners snobs well know
you judge everyone on an individual
basis especially the people that you
would go out with on a date but there's
a survey this week that got stuck in my
craw and I got a tweezer down later also
much more in concluding a final Britta
verdict or two on the blackberry key -
and a piece of carry-on luggage that
rolls out with your punches if you're at
the airport we're bringing in a couple
of old friends that's about to be a
great time on this episode pi that's
three 1/4 of the pocket now weekly
recorded at 3 p.m. Eastern on Friday the
20th of July 2018 this is the shift from
pocket now in conjunction with
xda-developers that delves into
everything that moves and in it's pretty
much technology from smartphones to
tablets and wearables it's the stuff you
probably couldn't even make up in your
wildest imaginations as a kid
I'm Jules Wong news editor at pocket now
joined by pocket now daily and Pocket
Nell Odierno
host Jaime Rivera hello to you sir hello
to you sir
coffee is set we're ready to
you didn't say well caffeinated during
this show because we need to cover a
whole lot in just one hour's time
joining us also is ex DA's chief
operating officer Brendon minimum hey
you hi hey I am today was a really good
day because I got to take possession of
this massive collection of old phones
and claimed almost two dozen of them
right there yeah and that's not even all
of them there's still more of them out
in California to use but they're not as
interesting as the ones that I opened up
so they're just going through them and
just getting just keeping tabs and
getting that inventory stacked up man
you I'm jealous I just I'm gonna use
like ten phones as we can I say one
thing real quick um a forgotten phone
really the oneplus X I know I don't know
if you guys ever touched this phone but
like I totally forgot that it is as thin
as a razor blade like look at this it's
crazy it's so nice and so it's glossy
got that glass back and just this week
we were talking about the CEO people out
kind of them you know at the oneplus one
plots as I used to say in the typos of
my posts at pocket now long as wedding
news about it let's go on though to
another privileged guest here that we
have our pleasure of hosting our
favorite tea sipper formerly of android
authority what's going on
hey what's going on everybody thank you
so much for having me by the way and
speaking of caffeine yes I do have a cup
of tea as always by the way exactly it's
been uh it's been a bit and I'm really
happy to be back on for the past week
I've been rearranging my office creating
the set that you're seeing you guys are
the first ones seeing this set actually
I haven't used it for any videos I
haven't use it for anything yet this is
the first time I'm using the set you
know that camera looks sharp the bouquet
is nice and then you got all the you
know underdressed
I have one please since we brought it up
I have one quick I have one quick story
or rather just one thing like the
oneplus X I remember being a great phone
for what it was it did it was missing a
couple of radios I remember that was the
biggest problem with it but the reason
why I'll always remember that phone is
because the day after I did the hands-on
I flew up to SF came back down to LA the
day after I did the hands-on I went
through my most I went through my last
really horrible breakup so the homepless
x is a triggering phone for me you
really don't want to talk too much about
that so that's why we're not talking
about it officially in the music for
this episode but if you have anything
that you want to talk about you the
listener the viewer please do so we have
our hashtag up on Twitter hashtag P and
weekly so that you can chime in with
your comments the questions perhaps you
might want to ask a couple questions
about what phones brand and minimum has
right now and on time we have a lot to
get to though so if you do want to ask
your questions do so or go to your email
podcast at pocketnow.com
is the dress that you want send your
thoughts to all right in the meantime we
got hot news so let's get to it
Microsoft is reportedly considering
working on a few Android phones for
release we don't know the specifics of
how involved they will be in terms of
doing the Android thing but they have
been selling galaxy s 9s as well as the
razor phone of note so they do have that
involvement there I was wondering what
all of you and I'm going to start on the
left with Brandon what do you think in a
post Nokia phone will be has Android
from Microsoft I would love to see
Microsoft use all of their innovation
and software expertise to create and
end-to-end really good Android phone you
know they have the Microsoft launcher
which is pretty good they've got Skype
they've got office they've got all of
these different ass
they've got Bing and it would be just
really cool to see them maybe it's a
surface phone you know to kill or
kick-ass hardware and just like stitch
together all these Microsoft services
and products for like something actually
different and better because it's
Microsoft and I'm afraid that that's
just not going to do that so you think
it's mostly just the services game for
Microsoft at this point hi May I know
that you have had a little bit more time
with some of the Lumias back in the day
I was wondering if you had any thoughts
on hardware I don't have any
expectations because all the Lumia
patents went back to Nokia like hmd
already has them so I probably that's my
biggest question like what exactly can
Microsoft bring if everything belongs to
hmd now I'm not expecting much like even
there their lead of photography went
awawa we have to thank him for what we
see on the p20 Pro so I don't know man
it would be cool to get a phone from
Microsoft let's just hope it's not just
the phone with Microsoft services I mean
you can do that with an iPhone right now
just load it with a ton of Microsoft
apps and then it becomes a Microsoft
phone my biggest concern is what's gonna
happen with Android they're gonna are
they gonna fork Android or are they
going to embrace Android and just load
their launcher and allow people to do
whatever they want with it phone which
is what I would recommend the Play Store
has to come into play at some point here
so it'll be interesting to see again
those phones that they already sell
Galaxy we already have the Play Store on
there so it's a question see if they
keep it on Joshua I'm not sure what sort
of angle you're coming from in terms of
approaching Windows Phone or Android in
conjunction with Microsoft but I wonder
what your take is I think I think I
agree with Jaime to be honest because
what could you possibly do at this point
Android has so many phones that have
addressed that have iterated and
innovated in so many different ways what
could Microsoft possibly do aside from
some sort of let's say integration with
Xbox or something like that that could
make it that much different from Android
phones that already exist so probably
the only
I can think of is yes make an Android
phone that is solid that has some good
features try to do something that's
different from everybody else but
otherwise embrace Android put the
windows launcher on there because I
actually really like that about Windows
Phones back in the day the tile I forgot
what they used to call it was it did a
live tiles so the live tiles were
awesome and I remember one time back in
the day I would get a phone and actually
look for launchers that emulated the
live tiles and I think that that that
launcher would give it some identity but
as far as hardware and as far as just
the general requirement of what an
Android phone is supposed to be I don't
really see a Microsoft Android phone
being radically different from anything
else and that's gonna be its biggest
pitfall I'll tell you something when you
say that I think about the oxygen OS on
on oneplus where I think they've taken
Android and they forked it to a truly
better version of Android with theming
gesture control it's optimized for speed
and animations fluidity there's so many
goodies in oxygen OS because oneplus
spent the time and looked at every
setting in every menu and every option
and I think that's kind of like what
Microsoft might be able to do yeah I
think I agree I think that is a hundred
percent what they should be doing with
it and if yeah like I said if there's
some sort of inter I'm not a Xbox fan I
mean I'm clearly wearing a PlayStation
have but if there's some sort of if
there's some sort of integration with
Xbox and they're able to like synergize
those two things together I think that
might be it's one defining different
feature but otherwise it's an Android
phone it's just what it's gonna be but
haven't they tried that with Windows
Phone I mean they they launched an Xbox
hub yeah like if you go right now into
the X on a Windows PC to the Xbox hub it
literally has a ton of those Windows
Phone games that were literally just
Forks of whatever they did for Windows
Phone and they they all just suck like
for me it's I don't know man I feel that
they've killed they if anything they
tarnished the brand with their efforts
of trying to make one thing work
everywhere and it's well if you heard
the rumors it's one of the reasons why
they even push back the project of
Andromeda just because they didn't want
to tarnish the surface brand
with another product that doesn't
necessarily you know achieve what the
surface has achieved that probably
doesn't sell the best but I love my
surface like they've made some really
cool products and I wish that they I
don't know they followed on that what do
you guys think I think that makes I
think that's pretty true I mean
Microsoft has tried to do a lot of
different things that are like really
branded on like Cortana for example and
yeah it just hasn't really gotten
anywhere
Cortana could have been the fourth in
the many different assistant voice
assistant apparatuses that we have heard
a basketball team with all the ones we
have right now exactly but the thing is
Cortana is not is it's hardly even in
the conversation that's the problem is
because they haven't put enough
development behind it you know if I'm
thinking if I'm thinking outside the box
and I just want to get that Xbox
imaginative with it then you know get
the phone put it next to a wall it
projects Cortana onto the wall you talk
to Cortana that way interesting so
Brandon any thoughts to wrap up
including your holographic takes you
guys have to admit something though if
you look at the last five or six years
Microsoft has been killing it with
hardware actually that they're just like
all these surface devices are so cool
they're so innovative they're so like
you wouldn't wouldn't have thought of it
and they're futuristic and I could see
them applying that ingenuity to a phone
I mean you know phones don't always have
to look the same and there's still room
for innovation so a surface phone could
be just awesome
if the surface team were to design a
phone I think bringing back metal is it
for all of its advantages and
disadvantages would be an interesting
move so angry perhaps perhaps that might
be something to look forward to or is
about kickstand of course as long as
they don't bring in an Alcantara phone
I'll be happy with that
clothes leathery kind of things
interesting interesting all have to say
let us move on to something that has
been
kind of a left-field kind of development
and that is lights you might know it
from the L 16 phone that they delivered
back in 2015 where 16 cameras would look
like some sort of cyborg that got
conjoined with a whole bunch of other
cyborgs it was really weird but it had
different focal lengths in one eye
whatever I was on the past and so is the
$1,700 price tag they just got a new
round of funding from two interesting
sources either Lika and soft thing now
we already know Lika they have a
partnership with Huawei and they're
tuning up their cameras you solve a p20
probe that excellent three camera
implementation and then you have
Softbank which owns carriers around the
world including in the u.s. sprint and
as well in Japan so I was wondering how
you guys will see a second smartphone
that they've announced if perhaps fewer
cameras than the 16 they've had in the
past especially since they've taken an
approach to computational photography
Joshua I want to start with you what do
you see in the future for light okay I
my question here is this this first
picture you have on the article is that
a concept or is that what it might look
like there's a concept listed on their
site it doesn't I mean it could be a
potential candidate for a future release
I like the way that looks way better
than the L 16 I'll tell you that much
but okay from what I heard
not too many people got the opportunity
to review the L 16 I myself did not but
from what I heard it was hardware that
was it's it's the age-old problem it's
great hardware crippled by bad software
implementation and there's so many
phones out there that have that problem
and of course now we have like the
pixels of the world showing off that
software can be king so if they're able
to implement the software in such a way
that makes all of this power actually
makes sense and create great photos and
great video I'm hoping it's I don't know
I'm always gonna be excited for
something like this but how many how
many cameras do we really need
on the phone I was about the second
question I was about to say Josh like I
loved your p20 Pro video of the trip
that we did to Milan and like for me it
was just shocking that you film are you
fool most of it on the b-24 right not
all of it and so that I have to like so
by the way shameless plug the news today
on the daily will include this but I you
know when we were sitting down here with
salmon with vo I was like do I really
need to cover this yes you know Fridays
are slow days it's just like alright
we're gonna have to do with all right
fine it's gonna have to be this but it's
just like 16 cameras seventeen hundred
dollars like even if they charge $1000
like photography on the p20 Pro it's
just so good photography on the pixel to
excel is just so good I don't think we
need more camera lenses like of anything
like if anything I would love the triple
camera approach where we have a
wide-angle and we have a telephoto and
then people can choose and if they could
high bay they can figure out a way like
so I was having this conversation I had
the conversation with you Josh and with
other people where I love your video
because it portrays the best example of
how mobile cameras and cameras have
evolved I was in the Vatican I had the
p20 Pro I had the pixel to excel and I
had my Panasonic g85 and you know I
started taking photos and at some point
I was like crap like this camera doesn't
have HDR this this phone does and so it
just comes to the point where smartphone
cameras have become smarter at certain
scenarios than a regular camera and I'm
like I don't have time to be metering
this and just flipping all the manual
controls when a smartphone could just do
everything for me so why do I have to
put up with this so this this is my
perspective right now where I've come to
the point where I trust the smartphone
in certain scenarios more than a regular
camera I don't know about you guys what
about you random it's funny I first saw
the elf 16 on Instagram in an Instagram
ad because they might they must have
like determined with an algorithm that
I'll I would be interested in a phone
with 16 cameras and I was because every
time I saw my timeline I would look at
it I would click on the website and read
about
and I thought that it was just
absolutely ridiculous and I can't
believe it actually like became a
product and that's why that that's why
they had to charge so much for the
phones because they spent all the money
on marketing that might be it but uh I
think and a few people reviewed it like
michael fisher reviewed it and I think
his conclusion and from the other
reviews I saw were that it's just it's
not as good as like a pixel and so
what's the point that's it's almost like
taking a perfectly good phone and
sticking a keyboard on the bottom fourth
I mean it's just we're not on that story
yet why don't we segue into it I mean
that's like the perfect example of why
we talk about it yes well I do have one
more point about this like okay it's
it's it's very it's very likely this is
not going to happen but if it did it
would effectively kill phones like the L
16 if Google were to open up the
database that they use for the pixels
for all cameras across Android if they
were to open that up in all cameras
across Android were able to access that
boom we don't have to worry about
anything from like and you I mean you've
been more of an expert in Android than I
am like and Brandon as well like isn't
the whole pixel core expansion doesn't
it have that purpose to history in a way
yeah but what I mean is it's not opened
up to every other phone it's still sort
of like a pixel exclusive type of thing
what I'm saying is the way that I
thought Google assistant would be a
pixel only feature and then it became an
everything feature if the camera API and
the camera database could become you
know that a computational data could
become available to all Android phones
phones like this one need to exist
well and isn't it really just an app I
mean I remember the essential phone had
such a terrible camera but then if you
loaded the pixel of photo app you know
if you imported it just it made the
essential phone camera actually usable
yeah usable as the turn
it may not be extraordinary the way that
the pixel two is but that's because the
the processing of the app itself is
better than the one that essential put
into the camera or put into their app
but the copy is the computational stuff
it's the it's the millions and millions
of photos that they derive the data from
that that matters in this case yeah so
just adding more camera sensors doesn't
do the same thing that's my point here
you can't just brute force the situation
there at the end
I shouldn't we shouldn't be leaving any
misleading notions here because this
company's light has been talking about
upping their computational and software
based game here so again and we'll have
to see what happens but it sounds like
we're getting way fewer in our next
consumer release here going on let us
move forward here with going on to the
Huawei topic in terms of this all right
what do you believe about a whole a poll
that will do away with notches that will
just basically not really matter anymore
that that these bezels are our thing so
Huawei apparently has a patent here that
allows them to stick a camera or put the
camera behind this hole and then all of
a sudden that will just obviate the need
for a bezel up on top where's everything
else the huawei essential phone
basically
where's everything else though so
apparently the the the ear speaker the
earpiece is gonna be like the aside like
it's literally an essential phone
without the drop down of the notch like
the camera would be on its own in the
middle and it seems that there will be
some sort of screen around that and then
you'll have the the top bezel will have
the like the cutout for the speaker if
you've used an essential phone it's
pretty much that so you're gonna get
like 11 pixels back in that story oh
yeah like I totally don't get it I mean
I like hey so I love what Huawei is
while we had Samsung or two companies
that I love just because of how much
they're willing to just launch their R&amp;amp;D
to the market just here and if people
buy it that's good and if people don't
that's great as well so anything I don't
know what you're you get your thoughts
are on the notch like Brandon made a
video or like T's that he wants to make
a video about the notch and how much the
notch is important and the
implementations are not necessarily good
I really don't mind notches and it
depends on the implementation of Huawei
like if they can pull it off and why not
mmm okay I think I don't think notches
are okay I one day when it first started
to happen I was very against it but then
it made me realize that as has not just
become more proliferated in the in the
space companies are going to have to
find more creative ways of either hiding
it or making it look better or to just
use it so I was like okay you know what
then we now have things like the vivo
necks and the Oppo find 10 and yeah I
mean if we have to go through a short
period of just this terrible design
choice that makes no sense to me that
cuts into your content when you're
trying to watch a YouTube video or play
video game then fine if it leads us to
really fun things like the opal fine
tendon you alright have at it but here's
a thing like I feel that the company
that does the notch implementation best
is one plus if you notice if you're
playing a video and you maximize the
video on the 1 plus 6 it won't have the
notch cover part of the video it will
only maximize it it becomes like a 1
plus 5t pretty much where it's still a
wide display but it doesn't have the
water then not protrude if anything I
feel it the worst notch implementation
is the iPhone 10 if you guys have
noticed so why it's it's and it's not
just that like if you maximize any video
the notch will cover part of the video
so I totally get I totally get Josh's
perspective but I just I guys I don't
know about you but I've been really
loving the 1 plus 6 I've started using
it the last few days and and yeah I have
noticed that that content goes around it
rather than through it yeah and I like
that a lot that that's really how it
should be and which kind of led me to an
idea like well if you are going to put
like the camera behind a piece of glass
well how come we can't put the display
over it and then it only cuts down to
not cover up the camera when you're
using the camera
for all other applications turn to the
pixels off when you use the camera right
exactly if you haven't know that that's
how she that's possible yeah yeah yeah
if you have a display fingerprint sensor
I think it should make sense to put a
camera behind the screen I mean there's
always the component size issue to go on
but we can talk about that but Jules you
remember that that phone that we saw the
the vivo phone that we saw at CES and
yeah and if you angled the the light of
over the display you could actually see
the fingerprint module like Doug between
and even if you had the screen on you
could see it if you had to warm the
light and you reflected it so that would
actually be a cool idea like if the
camera is there but it doesn't have to
be visible whenever you don't need it
yeah as annoying is like a matrix of you
know the touch sensor matrix is from
years ago when you had LCP like little
games and it was just horrible and
actually brought your review or just
made it horrible like this is useful
technology and I mean who knows if we'll
be able to make it all visible at some
point in the future wait a second wait a
second Brandon you have a vivo next what
what's been your perspective on that
I've been really curious I've been
waiting for your video
I've been barely using it because you
have to like do 15 to 25 steps to get a
third-party launcher on it but what's da
right yeah go to your own forums it
feels like I don't know IRA I'm not sure
it's so big I mean the screens like six
point six inches which not too long ago
was the size of a tablet and it's just
so big and I look at like the one plus
six with a six point three inch screen
and it's just with because of the notch
it just fills up the entire front of the
phone and I just I like the notch
approach better in that case but the
under the screen fingerprint sensor I
can't see it at all like ever I've tried
but it's very inaccurate like you got to
really try like four times to get it to
work its interest rate
I mean it all comes down to the hands
because I totally get the fact that you
know we all are different humans with
different sizes and that perhaps making
the top part a little less useful than
the bottom part of the phone makes a big
difference in people's lives so it's all
those little details that really matter
here
yeah just do two things there's like
okay I I miss okay when I used the
iPhone 10 for a little while I did you
know big controversy when I unboxed it
on my channel but everyone was like you
really use okay someone asked me how do
you like it and I said well I had to
give it back because it technically
wasn't mine hopefully it will be but I
said no I didn't say this in that in
that IG questions thing but one of my
biggest gripe so that is that it didn't
have a fingerprint reader because the
putting so much emphasis on what happens
in that notch with the face ID and the
face tracking and all that stuff
I get why that's important but if it
doesn't when it doesn't work I want to
throw that phone because I could be
scratching my nose and it won't
recognize my face there have been so
many times where I get a message and I
pick up the phone and I and I rely on
that to unlock the phone I'm brushing my
teeth and I need to talk to my
girlfriend and it doesn't unlock and I
get really mad anyway so that's that
that's just one thing I wanted to say on
that point but in terms of the vivo
necks and the Oppo fine X or 10 I forget
which it's supposed to be but having
those motorized bits that are at the top
I prescribe I love that that's happening
and it's great but there's one big
caveat I prescribe to what my brother
says who's a big car person all motors
eventually die yeah that's a good one
yeah so that's that's my one problem
with that that implementation is that
probably with the vivo next we're
private and I end up finding people out
in Asia who say that the camera won't
come out anymore
and then your soo I mean what are you
gonna do after that for something you
just have to replace a few bills that's
alright we have to call Zack definitely
that's gonna be a favor of ours
I need those belts are too like my
goodness oh god I love this video man
that was so cool it was crazy
I know that you guys referring to Jaime
and Brandon might not be too interested
in this next topic but I know this hit a
chord or it's hitting chord with me and
sending according with Joshua behind
this so so we lucky those don't like
this stuff all right but fine go for it
drill so a new survey it's one of these
stupid surveys that don't really mean
anything because a group that just has
happens to do something on the side
de-clutter is like a used tech
marketplace thing and they just asked a
bunch of singles hey what do you think
about your dating partners and whether
or not they have an iPhone or an Android
and it turns out that they like those
iPhones pretty nicely so right here it
says more than a third of men stated
that a phone with a cracked screen
reflects negatively a product or a state
by demonstrating lack of personal care
or and financial security actually that
is so true and seven out of ten would
prefer to date an iPhone user over an
Android user while nearly two in five
users were to feel that their phone type
impacts an initial positive impression
of a date and there are a few quotes
here that I could bring out but I feel
like you should take a look at them
yourselves I feel like they've between
vitriolic to put it into the discussion
right here but I'm wondering what you
think Joshua in terms of I think one is
impersonal but oh no this is thing one
of the reasons why I thought this story
was still hilarious is because I'm a
victim I'm a victim of this God God
bless God bless God bless my girlfriend
but when I first
her she thought I was the weirdest
person for using a key one and I was so
lucky that I I still got with her but I
broached this topic on previous pieces
of content on the old podcast that I
used to host and I I thought about okay
so because of the job we're in right now
don't you find yourself always noticing
what people use it's just a second it's
a sixth sense now but and just the job
that we have I think that it's I don't
know in the United States I don't notice
that to be much of a thing at least in
New York I've seen an iPhone 4s
everywhere but it's just in Latin
America where I'm originally from it's
like people treat you the way they see
you and they treat you depending on what
you have if you're not driving a 4x4
pickup truck or an SUV you're broke if
you're not using an iPhone or a galaxy
phone you're broke and so yeah no I so I
felt I found the topic hilarious but you
know it's it's for me it's it I haven't
noticed that much at least in the United
States you're from LA and that's a very
different that's a very different market
of people that's the reason why your
opinion is probably like the most
educated in this topic because like in
New York that doesn't matter but in on
notice in that America oh man like if
it's it's huge
still yeah I mean I know that I'm a it
used to be like you had an iPhone in
Honduras and we used to talk about this
you were like considered to be baller
yeah it's 2018 like everyone has an
iPhone isn't that true like everyone has
an iPhone but you have to think about it
like over here minimum wage is really
low it's like in Romania Tony can give
you more examples of this in Romania if
you're not using an iPhone in an Apple
watch you are not you're not up there
you're not cool but here's the thing
like the demographic of the amount of
people that can actually afford
something like an iPhone 10 is very low
it's funny actually how much companies
like huawei have been gearing a lot of
popularity in Latin
because they've come out with really
cool products that people can actually
afford them and so I you know it's funny
just how many people actually know what
a peeps when he is a p20 pros or how
many people want to make ten or made ten
throws so I think it's changing but I
have to agree on things of this survey
on things like people with a crackphone
like if you're still carrying a
crackphone
you're broke some something's up yeah
yeah some things up that's that's that's
that's that I'd have to agree with the
crowd it's like going on a date with a
stain shirt there's a little bit of that
III will defend the iPhone people for a
second having used one for a little bit
and then talked to a lot of people who
have used iPhones all their lives man
don't say that iPhone user is not
committed because the moment the moment
I started to give some opinions on why I
wasn't really feeling the iPhone 10 they
went off and they were just like no see
this is that it I mean they're so
committed
so oh let me let me just say commitment
issues on iPhones I questioned yourself
during the day while you go on about the
iPhone tenant how it's not good it's
just like hey get me out of here we
would have so much mileage out of this
topic but it turns out we are coming
over wrong fuels I was wrong fine we'll
talk about topics sooner or later I in
the meantime I do want to get to a break
here coming up we have discussion on the
key to and some very divergent opinions
as well as the MacBook Pro the Refresh
and more controversy as a we're
accustomed to these days from Apple stay
tuned
the PocketNow weekly is brought to you
by Jeff Maehl we understand that a lot
of you are listening to our show on your
Android or iPhone in you basically have
it under control but if you're going
into business and plan on deploying say
a whole bunch of Apple devices with your
employees you need to keep track of
where
everything goes especially if you're
running a remote workplace with Jeff now
you can check your digital inventory
distributing Wi-Fi and email settings
deploy apps protect company data and
even walk or wipe a device anywhere you
are you don't even need to have IT
experience to use Jim for now and see
what a difference it will make
and as listeners to the weekly you can
start off by setting up three devices
for free with no monthly costs every
devices after that is just two dollars a
month head to JAMF comm slash pocket now
to set up your free account that's Jim
common slash pocket now to start
securing your devices today and we are
back with you for more discussion and
debate I think the hottest topic here in
terms of what brandon has to say because
I know this is going to be a little
firestorm going on between you and
Joshua is the key to the BlackBerry key
to just launched what was it last month
and it's got that new speed key it's got
snapdragon 660 it's got maybe less of a
battery endurance than we thought it
would have I mean let's see what your
opinion is in this thought thread
Brandon okay so I was like oh you're
wrong I'm just kidding well there are
certain things I have a list here
problems I have with the key to I use
the key to all this entire week
I'm a sent me a key to thank you Jaime
actually his sister did and it arrived
on like what Monday or Tuesday and there
are three specific problems I have with
the key - some of which you might not be
able to defend okay first first of all
let's talk about the keyboard
shall we I really I committed myself to
this keyboard for an entire week every
text every email I didn't cheat the
single time by using the on-screen
keyboard I forced my thumb's to do what
they do
10-15 years ago and like no I can't I
can't type fast on this keyboard I I
don't get it what am I doing wrong
my fingers are pressing the keys on my
you know software keyboard like on my
one plus six I use the swipe thing and I
know you can swipe on the keyboard on
the on the key - but it doesn't work
very well or at all so so that's that's
my first problem my second problem is
that by putting a keyboard on the bottom
what is just the bottom fifth of the
phone you're you're losing this entire
space to screen so like if you're
watching a video you're watching a video
in this size but you're not using the
keyboard for anything why do you need
the keyboard this area should be used
for screen like a full screen like a
proper full screen phone like the 1 plus
6 for example so I just like if the if
the keyboard actually made me type
faster I would be like okay I'm looking
at a video in a tiny little crappy
window but it's okay because I can type
so much faster it's fine it's okay those
are the two things and the number 3
problem I have with this phone is that
the camera is so bad it gets trash it
just can't even use it so like that
morons trash so like I can't use this
phone I just can't there's no there's no
way for me to defend the camera I'm
sorry I just can't and yeah that's the
one thing I think the key one had a
better camera I think it might have it
might have yeah and ok so the camera is
really hard to defend I agree with that
but when it comes to the other the other
caveats there okay viewing videos on the
side with the whole keyboard on the side
I totally get that if you're looking for
a media consumption type of phone then
that is not what you're going to get
here but that's not what you get the key
to or the key one for do you get it for
productivity now I understand we live in
a world right now where smart phones are
supposed to be able to do literally
everything well the key to is trying to
provide that same level of capability
but adding something on top of it and
that is the keyboard I'm a buttons guy
that's really just all it comes down to
I mean I'm using a rebel right now and
yes I called it rebel not pebble so I am
all about the buttons and just being
able to do something on a phone or on a
piece of tech where I know exactly
what's going to happen when I press here
is really important to me because there
are going to be times when I just need
that to happen and with the keyboard if
I'm responding to emails first thing in
the morning or messaging people like you
guys or if I'm just I do like
honestly I do more typing and listening
to music on my phone than I do
watching videos and playing video games
and once I had those expectations
aligned the the key to and the key one
even just aligns properly with what I
need it can you actually are you mention
productivity I think two times can you
just walk me through like how
specifically this phone makes you more
productive well it just feels a lot
better to be honest like it's not
necessarily that the phone is that much
better than others at maybe getting your
calendar right or getting anything else
going in a faster method but just being
able to jump between applications using
the speed key so if I was to go into an
email and I needed to double check when
an event is coming up speed kisi go
straight into it go back to the e mo
speed key e right back into the email
that I was typing you already and then
if I wanted to copy some text over I
would copy that text over currency key a
currency key C for copy and then speed
key I to go to Instagram and then
currency kavita to you know it's just
there's a level of there's a level of
confidence yeah you make the phone yours
yes exactly so I have an idea for next
da Brandon what's that you ready for
this so one of the reasons why I like
the key too is because it because
because particularly about that have you
guys done the math of how to send the
message to somebody or to make a phone
call and for me honestly what I liked
the most about the t2 is those shortcuts
and the fact that these shortcuts are
really to a certain degree you can
customize them to your heart's content
but I've never really understood why
companies don't take advantage of a lock
screen more so I wish that somebody
would
come up with like three where you raise
your phone the phone turns on and then I
could set on this lock screen as many
shortcuts to the things that I care
about is that I want and so I've got 52
keys here 52 I don't know how many keys
there but if you could come if somebody
could come up with like a lock screen
where I could set as many shortcuts as I
want and it could be one of these
shortcuts could be called my girlfriend
or it could be do this or do that
they're not i hate on an iphone having
to launch the can't unlock the phone
then launch the phone app then go into
my recents then look for somebody to
call then open the contact then choose
the phone number to dial those amount of
steps are stupid that for me is if i if
somebody could come up with a useful
lock screen that it helps me customize
that that would help me be more
productive i think and there are ways to
do that with some third-party launchers
but I get your point right yeah that you
can't do it on an iPhone for example so
that's really that's my reason to use
the key - other than that I you know you
and I had a conversation Brandon where
you hated the bezels like there's no
reason why they couldn't have put a
sixteen by nine screen on this phone if
they just got rid of the bezels so I
have to agree with that they got rid of
the bezels and gave me the keyboard that
I'd be fine with fair there are there
are refinements that can be made to the
design of the key - absolutely and if
there's if there's one piece of the
experience that I just can't get over I
just really love it it's the fact that
typing I've said this in my review of
both the key one and the key to typing
is not about speed on these devices
it's about accuracy and confidence and
confidence is a weird way of putting it
but that's really how I feel about it
like if I was going to type an entire
script on a phone because I had to if
I'm on a plane or if I'm gonna train
something like that I would prefer it on
the keyboard like this because I it just
feels better like actually having
because technically when you're typing
on a full screen device like a lump
six you just tight you're just pressing
the same exact thing it just happens to
be a virtualized you know feeling so
when you're on an actual keyboard you
actually know where you're going with it
and your your muscle memory actually
adjusts to it in such a way that makes
the typing experience not only easier
but more accurate and it's a the way
that I put it in a debate one that I had
was somebody was if you use a mechanical
keyboard at home you owe it to yourself
to try the keyboard of the key - it's
the same exact reason why you would pick
a mechanical keyboard for your desktop
compared to some chitlin keyboard
otherwise oh I thought for a second I
thought you just said I miss the
mechanical part and I thought you were
comparing a like a you know keyboard
with oh my god thousand a thousand years
old and the the difference like when you
are typing on a traditional keyboard and
you're touch typing you can type almost
so fast as to be able to type multiple
letters at the same letters at the same
time if you really like slow it down
you're just going that fast when you're
typing on the BlackBerry key - or key
one it's like one at a time it's like
click the click click click click click
click and maybe I just got a get better
at it I gave it a good chance I gave it
a good chance I love that you can set
multilingual keyboards on the key -
probably that was one of my biggest
complaints about the key one when it
launched it wasn't capable of that
initially and so you had to you had to
be accurate about typing on the key one
initially and then they fixed all that
through software
I like the key - because it's software
prediction is actually really good and
so you you can miss type something and
so that's one of the reasons why I like
typing on glass because you can miss
type anything and then the phone
eventually understands context of what
you're typing and it just corrects
everything adequately and that was my
biggest concern when I got when I got
the key - because after that those
issues with the key one I just never
went back to it and then one did the
after the buzz and I just didn't care
about it but then the key to actually
did a better job at this for me honestly
like
would totally be willing to use a key to
as my daily driver if they came up with
like the key to pro and come on guys
just give me a good camera like
seriously like so my problem with the
key to and this is what I said in the
review is 625 bucks
you have no room for failure here come
on guys 625 bucks you can't screw up
things essential things like the camera
I think that that the honor 7x takes
better photos in this thing that's $200
no doubt the honors 7x takes better
photos in this phone it is inexcusable
for such a poor camera experience to be
loaded on a $625 phone and then you get
the 1 plus 6 Man which is $100 cheaper
and it literally smokes
the key to in camera performance yeah
and like and sure the other reason why
you buy the the key to is because of
battery life battery life is epic but
then you can literally end the day with
a 1 plus 6 just fine yeah so you you you
you won't get sorry started into it you
won't get as much battery performance as
the key to but you can end the day just
fine with a 1 plus 6 yeah the last word
to Josh over here yeah I totally agree
with all of that and I know I'll fall on
my own sword here you know being being
one of the most staunch blackberry
advocates this is one of two phones I
carry on the daily so that should pretty
much tell you everything that you need
to know I use this for every
correspondence every email every like
tweet every post every Instagram posts
in terms of like what I'm typing into it
and then when I want to do other stuff I
have something else so that should
pretty much tell you I'll admit I'm a
dual wielder and that's the reason why
jv2 phones
mr. Fisher where are you
and alright that's the best that's the
other mr. BlackBerry by the way yeah yes
and it was like your comma less mr.
webOS mr. who else webOS
let's just move to the MacBook Pros I
got a lot of talk about that and I don't
have well I don't have a whole lot to
say on this topic by the way so I'm
gonna be you know relying this is this
is a this was a high made topic that I
thought you had your dating topic
I gave highly so so MacBook Pro
refreshed with the 8th gen core Intel
Core processors and there's also a
couple of things that we want to point
out here so the silicon main brain has
now been placed it's a silicon will
cover that supposed to keep out debris
because last time around we were talking
about the keyboard the butterfly switch
is and there was very tiny insect legs
of a thing and they were the whole
keyboard could be just put up by a
single grain of sand so a lot of people
were complaining about that and Apple
actually had to admit it in its repair
manual guides like they told the media
that it was for just making the keyboard
quieter and well turns out there's
another case for that and then there's
also the throttle an issue because with
this new generation you have the core I
9 being included that's six cores
that's 42 Hertz turbo I believe and you
get a lot of speed and performance out
of that yes the thing is is that the
MacBook Pro so thin it's not thermally
designed properly to handle that kind of
heat sink so a lot of people if we
complain about that and you might have
seen a few freezer tests done in terms
of benchmarking and rendering what not
so Jaime take it away from here
go wherever you want this one Dave TV
you are awesome and thank you for
putting your computer in the freezer for
the purpose of science I really
appreciate it like I hope that Apple is
watching this because your Apple I
really have to say that you guys suck at
one particular thing why is it that you
always screw up first-generation
products like I bought a three
thousand dollar MacBook Pro out of my
own money the previous model I had so
many issues
you can't like how can you charge three
thousand dollars for product you clearly
don't test well I had ghosting issues on
the display I had issues with the top
case I had to have the whole battery
replaced and you know then you will you
launch the Refresh of the MacBook Pro
and you completely screw it up again
there's this awesome video from Brandon
Harvard where he just goes through all
the issues that he had with the current
with the current generation design of
the MacBook Pro which is one of the main
reasons why I decided to just hold back
and not buy the MacBook Pro until the
past generation it's then it's the one
that I'm currently using right now by
the way everybody the reason why I look
so crappy is because this $3,000
computer has the worst webcam in the
world like the worst it is trash and so
how is it possible like I even I even
talked on the daily I really want a
13-inch MacBook Pro with a quad core
processor for those of you that don't
know
exporting on Final Cut which is what I
use to export video there's a
significant it's just an abysmal
different difference between using a
dual core computer and a quad core next
four times and so it's threes like the
the experience of editing the video is
really not that bad but once you hit the
export button quad core and dual there's
a there's literally a 20 minute
difference it's a three minute export on
one end 23 minute export on a dual core
and so and so I wanted a quad core
13-inch computer that was my dream but
then everybody was dogging me on the
daily are you gonna order the new you
you've been wanting this you've been
mentioning it and I'm like no I'm gonna
wait it out because I know this company
I know they're gonna screw it up and so
what's the problem they to be gets the
15 inch six core I nine version and it
turns out that if you try to export a
video on premiere I don't know about
Final Cut but on premiere it doesn't
really matter if you max it out and
you've got the six core I 9 the computer
can't even keep up with the clock speed
let alone the turbo boost why because
the thermal envelope is terrible the
only way you can get a good 4k export on
that computer is if you buy a freezer
along with it
oh how ridiculous is that it's
ridiculous
honey look exactly how is it possible if
you've noticed if you want to max out
the minimum spec of that core I nine six
core it's a $3500 computer let alone if
you want to go for the 32 gigs of ram
you're going for thousand dollars and if
you want the four terabytes that's
another three thousand dollars tops it's
crazy
okay so I like I feel that Apple did a
great job with the iMac Pro and you know
they proved that people are willing to
put down money and if you do the math I
mean listen it in apples the fence
Sam is currently using a dell precision
Pro it's a 32 gig of ram until see not
until Xeon processor it's a beast and
it's a five thousand dollar laptop so
it's not like of Apple is really
charging too much money oh I've seen
gaming laptops that are horribly
expensive once you maxed them out so I'm
not complaining about the price I'm
complaining about the delivery what is
up like you're like really what is up so
that's the problem do I want the
computer I do I'm just not willing to
buy it because I don't trust
first-generation Apple products that's
just the way it is is this still a first
generation Apple product yeah the
processor updates every time that Apple
experiments with something new so this
is the first time that Apple pushes a 6
core processor into a laptop it's into a
15-inch laptop it's the first time that
they push a quad-core processor into a
13-inch laptop so I would consider those
to be first generation Apple products
it's like the LTE variants of the Apple
watch series 3 the watch is great but
the problem is try to connect this thing
to any carrier that's not on the Apple
list you can't and so why pay extra when
the implementation is just so terrible I
mean didn't tell I mean we have to
credit Intel with more of this
innovation in terms of bringing that
power in I was wondering if a Brandon
had anything to say to this just to wrap
things up here is it a matter of the
software getting optimized in the future
you'll just have the fans rolling more I
remember when I got that the previous
15-inch MacBook Pro it had thermal
issues that was another problem with
that computer had and sure you got the
software update but guess what the fans
never turn off they've got they make
these awesome things they look like
dinner plates and you put your laptop on
it it's got like six fans underneath of
it just it keeps it nice and cool
exactly so just keep adding up to the
price tag of this you know otherwise
like why would you buy a laptop if you
need to buy if you need to buy a fan for
it like the reason why I edit all my
videos on laptops is because I'm always
traveling I need to the computer to
perform and so you know even with the
current MacBook Pro that I have you know
they advertised six to eight hours of
battery life try editing a video on that
thing even on Final Cut I'm lucky if I
get an hour and a half of video editing
just because of how terrible the
computer performed because it's so thin
and light you know just the thermal
envelope is just so bad on these
computers and so sure so long as you're
connected that's great but then why not
just buy a PC it's almost like they
design these computers and I have the
same experience on my 12 inch macbook
you designed these computers to run like
pages and like Safari and that's it like
once you go beyond like the Apple apps
it like my 12-inch MacBook gets so hot
that it almost becomes unusable you have
to put it on another surface exactly and
so that becomes pointless and you know
it in Apple's defense I have to say and
for those for everybody in the comments
that must be hating me for you know
talking about premiere premiere is a far
superior piece of software for video
editing I get it
but we make youtube videos we're not
Francis Ford Coppola and for YouTube I
consider Final Cut to be superior
because it's just so much easier to use
that's just me anyways moving on a lot
of conversations that we could have but
I think I know which team me and Joshua
are on well here's the thing I just just
a quick point I don't I don't mean to
prolong the discussion here is just this
kind of dives that this kind of
reinforces a thought
I had a conclusion that I had in terms
of Apple products the products that
people get so upset about in this
fashion are the ones that are stifled by
the form factor like this this pedigree
of products like smartphones and laptops
that are supposed to be designed a
certain way that Apple has put
themselves in this hole where they can't
make it any other way the phone has to
look like this has to have the shape and
laptops have to be made of aluminum they
have to look like this I have to do and
it cuts them off at the knees meanwhile
when you give Apple the ability to
create a whole new product something
that is completely different they
actually put the level of thought into
it that we used to love with the
original aluminum MacBooks and with the
original iPhone and the best example in
the last year of that ingenuity are the
air pots I hate how they look I agree
that the way they look is terrible but
all the time you know that's your fault
but when you give Apple the ability to
create a product that no one else has
really created the this is the way it is
like they do when when it's not just
when it's not just accepted that there's
a form factor to that product Apple can
do some pretty amazing stuff a blank
slate yeah right yeah exactly so I think
the most important product from Apple in
the past year has been the air pods
because it shows that they have that
ability but when it comes to stuff that
we all just sort of know to be a certain
way like laptops and phones those are so
many problems that's it
this just kind of reinforces that
thought I just want to say that guys
leave it on I know that you have to do
Brandon it's been a pleasure having a
year on for the last hour thank you so

can reintroduce the hashtag FTP back
into this what is that oh that used to
be Wyatt my old podcast was called
because it was supposed to be on Fridays

is way back in the day when I was at my
former company and yeah
the problem though is that fdp happens
to stand for a very bad phrase in most
Latin American countries
[Laughter]

were called out a few times about it but
it just turned into this lovely joke it
was so funny it would actually be HTTP
