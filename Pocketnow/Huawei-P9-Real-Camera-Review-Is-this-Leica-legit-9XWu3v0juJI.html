the cameras on this phone and we're
looking at dual image sensors with a
black and white twist but does that
really improve our photography I'm Juan
Carlos bag now for pocket now and here's
our real camera review of the Huawei p9
buckle up folks we have a lot of ground
to cover and I'm gonna move pretty quick
first a little housekeeping the p9 uses
dual 12 megapixel Sony sensors paired
with 27 millimeter equivalent lenses and
F 2.2 apertures at the time this review
was shot Sony had not detailed the
sensor size publicly but given the 1.25
micron pixel size we're assuming that
each sensor is somewhere around a one
over two point six inch diagonal the
inside sensor is responsible for color
information while the outside sensor is
monochrome black and white to maximize
light and contrast in every photo taken
this video was produced at 60 frames per
second 1080p to match the best video
quality from the camera and a photo
gallery with high-res samples will be
linked in the description below this
review there's been a spot a controversy
regarding these camera sensors as
Chinese manufacturers Sonny optical is
actually responsible for producing this
hardware but according to POIs way Leica
was instrumental for optimizing the lens
design collaborated on the mechanical
construction and was heavily involved in
tuning the software processing it should
also be mentioned that Leica has a
history of utilizing hardware from other
companies and then tailoring the overall
photography experience to like standards
like using panasonic sensors in Leica
camera bodies now starting off with
exposure and saturation immediately this
camera handles light in color in a
really unique way we had a few more
overcast days in Los Angeles so some
shots here will benefit from softer
lighting than on some of our previous
camera reviews this dual sensor
arrangement achieves excellent dynamic
range a blues and greens look lush rich
output without exaggerating or over
saturating Browns and earth tones are
warm without pushing into orangish
territory on rust I'm a fan of
contrasting shots and there's a
wonderful clarity to almost every
exposure from the p9 a warmer colors are
a bit more difficult to expose for but
yellows retain terrific detail like the
crinkly
wrinkles of these flower petals a Reds
are always tough for digital sensors but
the p9 in producing a juicy saturated
shot still holds onto a fair amount of
detail we're only clipping a little on
this hibiscus now occasionally the
camera might push the exposure enough to
turn Reds into magenta but it only
requires a minor adjustment to rein that
back in white objects in direct Sun are
especially hard to meter for and the p9
largely uses spot metering which means
the camera will try to set the
brightness where you tap to focus what's
fascinating about this phone unlike many
other smartphones which try to push the
brightness and the vibrance when
producing a JPEG the p9 will regularly
dial back brightness to preserve detail
the JPEG for this Lily is darker than
the raw file originally created we have
quite a bit of room to play with the
brightness and contrast of these photos
in high contrast situations photos
straight out of the camera preserve
details pretty far into bright sections
and shadows looking at the raw files it
seems like we're able to push almost
three stops in pulling detail out of
overexposed sections of a photo this is
terrific performance for her phone and
it's a great safety net for folks who
dabble in a little editing average JPEG
vinyls are between three and six
megabytes with RAW files clocking in at
22 megabytes per exposure when shooting
raw each shot will take up a little less
than 30 megabytes of storage now the
software on the p9 borrows from previous
Huawei's and expands controls through a
series of gestures a swipe from the left
brings in your mode auctions a swipe
from the right delivers your settings
and pulling this little bar here changes
you from standard to manual controls
it's a really well laid out app and only
required a little practice before these
actions felt familiar happily at no
point does this app ever completely
remove you from your composition window
even when changing options and settings
you can still reference the scene you're
trying to capture looking at macro shots
the p9 features a competitive minimum
focusing distance you should be able to
get your subject within two inches of
the phone for some sharp close-up action
while we might be concerned to see the
smaller F 2.2 apertures over competing
phones on sensors this small the
difference in depth of field blur
between F 1.8 and F 2.2 is
fairly minimal we still achieve a nice
shallow blur to backgrounds we get some
fun bouquet balls when looking at light
filtering through leaves the p9 does
however incorporate the absolute best
software blur we've ever seen on a
smartphone using distance data in the
dual sensors you can change the amount
of blur after the shot is taken and the
effects very much resemble what we might
see from a DSLR to be sure the blur
fall-off won't look as authentic or
organic as a fast DSLR lens but the p9
absolutely crushes the hokey filters
found in editing apps like Instagram
Huawei utilizes laser focus assist which
provides some of the smoothest
performance we've seen this year the
focus rolls onto your subject in a very
short footed way though it's not the
fastest we've seen this year it's free
from the overshoots and twitches which
company many phone focusing systems
while terrifically accurate in daylight
we did run into a few low-light
situations which confused this camera
the p9 was unable to recover in the
street scene after focusing here for
example what's odd for this camera for
how terrific image processing is in
general HDR photos rarely seem much
different than standard photos perhaps a
consequence of this camera already
pushing the limits on exposure but HDR
photos only showcase subtle alterations
from regular shots happily when HDR
processing does kick in it's usually to
reduce brightness unlike most other
Android devices at treat HDR is a shadow
brightening mode the p9 stands in
opposition by trying to avoid clipping
details whenever possible Huawei does a
very good job of stitching scenes
together for panorama shots these power
lines for example are largely complete
though we have a few rough transitions
exposure for pano shots can be tricky as
rotating means having to account for
changing light conditions but if there's
one area that p9 excels it's an exposure
and this phone does a great job of
balancing the processing over a 180
degree turn and looking at selfies the
p9 has a respectable 8 megapixel
front-facing camera I'm not much of a
selfie guy but performance here is solid
and should do well capturing your
memories in a variety of lighting
conditions the beauty filters here do
produce a significant amount of detail
blur but actually
do a halfway decent job of making me
look like I'm wearing makeup as opposed
to making me look like Oh doh from deep
space 9
your mileage of course may vary now when
pushing into low light conditions the
lack of hardware image stabilization is
felt but these dual sensors are soaking
up enough light to almost completely
compensate for that absence a little
care was required in trying to hold the
camera still but it wasn't difficult
pushing this Hardware again we have to
applaud that this camera software really
doesn't seem to be trying to impress
people with brighter images exposure is
well restrained and sometimes that might
mean a darker image than competitors
might produce but more often than not
this camera lands output closer to what
these scenes actually felt like while we
were there looking at our creepy tunnel
this lens performance is absolutely
gorgeous those razor-sharp rays of light
coming from the street lamp just two
little touches of color fringing this is
the best lens we've run through this
scene ever so slightly outperforming the
Zeiss glass on the lumia 950 and by not
over exposing the shot we get terrific
detail with only minimal smearing from
noise reduction moving to our creepy
gate we see a subtle shift in white
balance performance here in low-light
conditions the camera is slightly
favoring the white of this gate over the
yellow orange light coming from the
security lamp our walkway test shows
great color accuracy between these
different colored lightbulbs and again
we're working with excellent dynamic
range the hotspots under each lamp are
well contained and we can recover more
of the wall here than on any other phone
we've tested in the past when looking at
the raw files looking at a little white
flower lit by a porch lamp again the p9
ignores the yellow tone of the porch
light to deliver accurate white for the
flower and lastly a flower in almost no
light even with laser focusing the p9
couldn't quite grab focus on the subject
and it's one of the few areas where this
camera falls behind some competitors
looking at night performance here
overall I place this huawei slightly
behind the galaxy s7 in LG g5 but ahead
of the HTC 10 in delivering sharp images
in low-light conditions and throwing the
flash can deliver some incredible detail
at night catching all of these tiny
little fibers and bristles in a really
delightful way
metering can sometimes prove a little
challenging when focusing indoors though
focusing on the ship-in-a-bottle and
throwing the flash here blew out the
highlights on this plush alien
facehugger playing with some long
exposures securing the p9 to a tripod
this is one of the best performers we've
used you have the option to shoot up to
a 30 second exposure and output is
absolutely stunning dialing in the right
settings for a streaking tail light shot
switching over to some moving images
video output isn't quite as impressive
as photos are unfortunately the highest
quality video we can shoot is 1080p at
60 frames per second we do save a fairly
high bitrate for HD video somewhere
around 35 megabits per second and this
allows us to preserve high-quality color
and contrast but the lack of image
stabilization makes all of this footage
shaky and seasick inducing all shots
suffer from some kind of twitch or shake
even when the phone is being braced
against the ground it's unpleasant when
you're trying to hold still but it's
downright earthquake inducing when you
start moving the phone in video we can
take a look at the zoom performance but
the p9 doesn't seem to use any pixel
resampling instead just blowing up the
image from the already low 1080p
resolution this is terrible output when
compared to still photos taken using the
same zoom audio capture during video is
also fairly unremarkable the sound
created is thin flat and these mics are
easily overloaded by even slight breezes
now looking at exposure transitions
moving from dark to bright and back this
huawei blooms between adjustments in a
really pleasing way white balance
adjustments are subtle and quick and the
recovery moving from bright back to dark
is handled very well it's easy to see
here the image processing which produces
terrific still photos and when you want
to slow things down the p9 shoots 120
frames per second 720p slow-motion video
but for the life of me and I couldn't
find a way to export a slow-motion video
using desktop software to slow things
down we get a respectable 1/4 speed but
this is far from class-leading
performance so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us with the camera on
the huawei p9 this is a really unique
shooter I've honestly never handled a
phone camera quite like this one and
that fact alone means Huawei should
absolutely be applauded for this
experiment regardless of branding or
certification this dual sensor brings
some fantastic benefits to still
photography and this is one of the most
fun cameras I've used this year this is
not an all-rounder though while the
omission of image stabilization doesn't
seem to negatively impact photos the p9
is a rather poor solution for shooting
video unless it's being mounted on a
tripod for every shot still this phone
certainly elevates Huawei's reputation
in the world of smart phone photography
and this hardware is very much in
keeping with Leica's imaging philosophy
there's nothing else quite like it its
unique exclusive we think folks who
opted for a p9 will be in for a treat as
always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
our full coverage of the Huawei p9 and
hit that thumbs up button for a little
extra positive reinforcement for pocket
now I'm Juan Carlos bag now you can chat
me up on Twitter and Instagram is some
gadget guide
I will catch you all on the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
