tablet space with its offerings but it
does hold a solid second place and with
apples recent slip in tablet sales there
is no better time to bring some heat
when it comes to competition I'm high
metairie better with pocket now here in
Las Vegas for CTIA with a quick look at
the Samsung Galaxy Tab s2 we've got a
hand it to Samsung for continuing to
believe in the Android tablets face at a
time when the whole market is struggling
and this Galaxy Tab s2 is actually one
of the better-looking Android tablets
that I've seen in a long time the Galaxy
Tab s2 is actually a combination of two
tablets an 8-inch variant and a nine
point seven inch variant both sporting a
Super AMOLED qxga display and an
interesting 4 by 3 aspect ratio which is
rare compared to samsung's previous 16
by 9 focus both tablets are also powered
by an X and O's 5433 octa-core processor
3 gigs of RAM and options for 32 and 64
gigs of expandable storage up to 128
gigabytes via microSD both models also
Rock an 8 megapixel camera at the back
with F 1.9 aperture the selfie shooter
is set at 2.1 megapixels
there are also LTE connectivity options
for both and yes both run Android 5.0
lollipop really their only differences
obviously the size and the fact that the
nine point seven inch model sports said
larger 5870 milliamp hour battery
compared to the four thousand milliamp
hour battery on the eight inch model
here on the show floor we had a chance
to play with the larger 9.7 inch sibling
and our first impression so far is that
it's extremely thin and light the black
finish on this metal back may not be the
favorite for many but there are also
options for gold in a white variant as
well now the Super AMOLED panel is
gorgeous though providing deep color
saturation and deep blacks but that's
actually not the coolest trick from this
tablet your TV is DLNA capable you can
quickly mirror your display to the TV
which true is nothing new to the tablet
space but if you own any samsung DLNA TV
from the last two years or so you can
actually do the opposite and project
what's on TV on a tablet which
turn to be convenient we sadly didn't
get a chance to test the feature here at
CTIA due to some technical difficulties
but we'll definitely look forward to our
review unit of this tablet to report
back on this particular feature we've
got more coverage coming from CTI in Las
Vegas so make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well you can follow me on
