of the weekly brought to you by
PocketNow and xda-developers recorded on
Hawaii time I wish I could put the
camera that way cuz you could you should
see what what is in front of us Venus in
front of us yeah
on Thursday yes Thursday the 6th of
December 2018 all of us all three of us
are here for the Qualcomm Snapdragon
Tech Summit and we've got quite the many
takeaways on mobile computing artificial
intelligence and the buzzword that won't
die
5g am I am of course your host of the
bacchanal weekly it's Josh or Vergara
what's going on everybody and we have
the host of the PocketNow daily of
course we have I made event here and
helping me flank Jaime right now with
our floral patterned Hawaiian shirts
most of the David Amell daily cuz I'm
myself every day yes yes of the year we
have David Amell of course you know I'm
from Android authority um and if you
don't already follow them on Instagram
Twitter and whatnot make sure you do so
please do use the master photography
isn't great yeah you have a lot of
photos from Hawaii or I have pictures
from the boat it's been a dope three
days already right like we today is the
last day of the tech so I mean we
finally got our final announcement today
and we're all gonna go out and go to a
luau hence why the shirts but it's yeah
I mean Hawaii you couldn't say more good
things about it honestly why don't we
get the gift today stuff out of the way
that way it cuz it's fresh in our minds
right so the Snapdragon 800 then I was
briefed on that processor I was like yo
like this is a lot like it's the largest
processor
Qualcomm has ended their whole like
they're they're like you know what we
should not follow the phone approach to
the computer let's do this backwards
let's actually create a monster enough a
mobile processor but for a computer so
there are no size constraints to
the the size of the dye and it's still 7
nanometre they've built them the biggest
GPU that they've ever made but in
addition they're also providing multi
gigabit LTE
they're providing 5g support whenever
that happens because we have to mention
5g as well of course
gggggg and it's just wow like from like
at least from everything they showed on
paper what is it the Intel Y processors
are the use that they made a comparison
was really you use them so they use are
actually better but the thing about it
is like they they share wine better than
it was and they showed that the
performance on this processor without a
fan could over like significantly
overpower these you processors from
Intel and obviously the architecture is
far beyond that 7 nanometre yeah yeah
Intel's been stuck at 14 for a long time
yeah that was the thing uh all of the
presentations this week it felt like
there was just a little bit of shade
being thrown yeah at all sigh yeah every
day they're just like yeah every day
they're just like our competitors yeah
exactly
so the looking at the specifications of
the eight CX which I mean say what you
will about the naming conventions the
eye
did you get any Envy hearing just how
much higher spec that processor has been
like you have the audrina 680 rather
than the 640 the rio 495 not the 485
which is over getting and the mobile
device the mobile processor like so did
you get a look at how big the actual
yeah platform is yeah how big was it I'm
trying to remember it's like its size of
an 850 physik physically oh really yes
okay
yeah I got that would make for it left
him we put that a tablet yo like I was
thinking about that like so I was having
a conversation with these guys and I'm
like oh my god this should power
Chromebooks like this should power
Chromebooks this should be like the
standard for like tablets going forward
because everything in paper looks very
powerful yeah yeah sure in paper it's
just funny when they made the comparison
to the 8:35 because I I reviewed the eye
so I received the HP Envy x2 and there
interview I was gonna ask the both of
you if you've used one of these always
connected so I have the HP Envy x2 which
Diego uses and I have the galaxy book to
which I haven't reviewed yet because
Adam Lane did the text review such a um
great text review by the way
and so the 8:35 was no no it was just it
was it's not laggy but there was no I
think that's the word it was just
lacking it didn't perform yeah now it
seemed like they were bottlenecks yeah
the case of the RAM in any of those
funny ups attack or gigs and the lenovo
won and like a few tabs is gonna take up
3.5 exactly but then in the case of the
of the 850 initially I was like no this
can't be just as bad but I like the
moment I unboxed it it has so many
software updates it was crazy after
those software updates were applied dude
that thing performs great nice ok
like great the only thing that it
doesn't provide is the 20 hours of
battery life but to be honest with you
I'm fine with the 12 yeah I used a
little bit I used I didn't gonna touch
any of them I mean I cuz there was a bit
of a campaign that was being done you
know just like messing with these and
and I was I was meant to be kind of a
part of it but I knew the time
constraints came in so I haven't touched
any of these so I kind of want a
snapshot of what and always connected so
I just sent the lenovo to Brandon yeah
but he would gladly send that review to
you my friend
does that one 850 it's safe okay that
was 850 yeah yeah so you've actually 835
Lenovo okay yeah yeah yeah it's uh it
was stinted by the RAM like a lot and
then obviously life I was not yeah I
mean when you just completely I think
that that was a proof of concept sure
Mike they just wanted to see like how
many developers are actually going to
port their apps right like recently they
made it so it's really easy to actually
be able to port your app to arm you can
just like a one-click
type thing if you're working in their
IDE and the problem
right now because there's not a lot of
hardware available these manufacturers
don't have well that software developers
don't have a lot of incentive to port
you know it's easy but it's like why
spend the resources because there's like
four five laptops and I'm right now but
with this chip I think they've gotten
past that they've really gotten past
that like proof of concept stage you
know they've they did all the marketing
campaigns and they had people trying to
use them and what I took away from today
especially after the presentation was
that they're aiming this at least
initially at business like when I when
they released the 8:35 and the 850
laptops they seemed like they were kind
of going after consumers especially the
campaign races were not yeah the price
yeah but but especially in the keynote
today half of it was about security and
the other half was about productivity
and like all of the apps they showed
were like working apps so no you know
and they showed like one thing of like
asphalt 9 but like I I'm a little
cynical in the fact that like whenever
they use asphalt as like a benchmark I'm
yeah it's made for mobile like that is
the game that is optimized the most
remote I made a face when I saw that as
oh yeah did they make that the first
time they showed me I am end up with
them for dinner like a few weeks before
they announced they hate thirty five
ones
yeah and they showed me like asphalt 8
on it and I was like and they're like
look at the frames and I was like yeah
but you get that on a phone - oh okay
because this is a 35 so it's the same
thing it's not much more resolution yeah
just larger but I mean I think like
taking the idea of we're physically
going to double the die size and put you
know way more transistors in there and
just really make this something that you
can actually use and now with the width
you can do nvme SSD storage yeah you can
do up to 16 gigs of ram so there's going
to be serious laptops now right but is
windows still being emulated on that is
still being yeah you can't they yeah
yeah so everything is gonna be emulated
Firefox actually runs surprisingly well
oh man I got the news right up those
natively creating it for it right yeah
yeah yeah in the case of Firefox yes but
then like for example do dice
these guys doing the demo today with
Photoshop on the reference hardware Oh
God
Photoshop is not really it wasn't bad
okay it was good and they were all doing
it while showing it on a on a screen on
a 4k TV
was it Photoshop mobile though or was it
like Photoshop it was like Windows
Windows Photoshop interesting yeah I was
like Oh Windows 10 Enterprise Photoshop
for example my experience with the 8:35
is you could move away from s mode but I
don't recommend it hmm my experience
with the 850 is don't worry move away
from my spot you'll be fine it's just
what the 835 apps like Chrome weren't
compatible like racially right
eventually they did but it was laggy AF
yeah
and so here the it's supposed to be that
the you know the 850 will still be sold
it'll be like the lower end they'll
alternate slower and then this would be
the higher tier I just I hope that they
don't lose the perspective of you know
it's great to have 20 hours but I doubt
that people will spend that much very
much time without charging their
computers it was it New York to
Australia right yeah is that the longest
flight in the world is that way to
Australia tall chair thanks I mean like
for example today I'm using a razor
blade and I had it in lowest brightness
possible no lights on the keyboard and
power saver mode yeah and it lasted one
hour in the keynote from tethering and
shooting so that's that's the thing yeah
so like battery life in my opinion is
like one of my most valued things and
like if you can get most of my stuff
done like I have a I have a pixel book
and I use that for a few things mostly
for writing and then I actually use do
some Lightroom mobile editing on it
because it has the Android app for sure
but it's so useful because the battery
life is amazing and it in like keyboard
is amazing and so like these thin and
light things can exist but like you were
saying you said that you were worried
that they would eventually like forget
about the important things I am a little
bit worried that they're going to
keep making the chip bigger and then
eventually they're just gonna become
yeah whole idea of this entire thing is
like for the last 10 years we've been
optimizing and optimizing and optimizing
because smartphones are small and you
want to get as much power out of the
smallest possible chip as you can and
they double the size obviously it's a
huge game but we don't want to get to
the point where you have a full size
like Intel sized chip in a smartphone
things correctly yeah they were like I
think so this is gonna be so always
connected pcs we're creating a dedicated
platform for always connected PCs and
this is gonna be our mobile strategy
which is the 855 and it's separate yeah
I like my glass yeah yeah you know when
they did the 835 I was like God why not
the 845 yeah you know it was weird it
was I just feel like they probably had
all the silicon already they were doing
R&amp;amp;D like crazy long time because they
had to do all the software to get it to
work yeah it's that probably took a year
yeah but just just to give you an idea
the eight CX is 200% faster than the 835
yeah it's 40% more power efficient than
the 50 yeah what could you could you
actually take these always connected pcs
and do a one-to-one transfer of
someone's daily laptop life yes so it
like you can't so how about like
creativity that's that's my main reason
why the essential point is enterprise
yeah cuz they run Excel fabulous they
run like corporate open way now is the
thing right that was like the half of
the frickin presentation was about
enterprise and office know and so
they've got it like tender got Lenovo on
mcdonough take a stand when novo owns
the office for enterprise - yeah yeah
yeah so I think that no these are not
creative computers they're not they're
capable to a certain degree
mm-hmm but the these are more for people
that really do value battery life you
know like the people that travel a lot
like you know in my case I just I guess
that what I would love to see
is like smaller form factors of the
always connected PC because I feel like
Oh 20 hours of battery life like really
just give me 12 but give me a smaller
more accessible tablet sure that I can
connect the keyboard to and that is like
because for me if you think about it
like what am i I you know insanity I was
like my favorite product of the year is
the new iPad pro it is not a computer
replacement it just it can't be yeah
huge a stress yeah one of the things
that I'm that I'm gonna say in my review
is very simple it needs an iPad OS it's
time for this it's time for an iPad oh
as if you're not gonna make mac OS run
on this thing I was gonna say because
it's pointless free that tell me how
powerful it is if the operating system
is a bottleneck whereas in the case of
Windows 10 you don't have that
bottleneck yeah the only limitation
literally is form factoring so my
priority is don't give me the battery
size and the size of a regular computer
play with the form factor give me
thinner products because you've got all
this you know give me a tablet size you
know the like this Windows sorry this
surface go should have been powered by a
Snapdragon sure yeah
oh there's a point no yeah I think it
would have performed with a lot better
than with that seller on that is
currently using yeah nope ng I'm sorry
that 28 millimeter prize I'm just
kidding think they kept putting those
numbers out there on stage yeah I mean I
get about the same time it's like you
know yeah if we if we had to compare
like the times of the Intel Atom with
just to give you an idea of like there
is no room for comparison between this
the the crap the experiences we have
yeah it was bad years ago is bad bets
lab dragon Annika yeah absolutely like
no I like if you use an 850 computer I
don't I honestly don't notice a
difference between that and my surface I
have a surface pro 4 though um I don't
notice a difference honestly but but
it's with the 850 with the 835 I was
like a mere surface like let's go ya
know still reach or something else yeah
yeah yeah and the four factors of all
the laptops I'm really
to seeing that become more common
because if these processors make it
clear that this type of form factor is
important to a lot of people and it's
gonna continue like I'm God I can't say
more good things I can't I can't say
enough good things about while we made
all of them okay yeah that row and that
form factor that particular
configuration is starting to become more
common yeah yeah we just got the stealth
the the razor blade stealth just now and
it's it's it's it's nice to see that and
you know things are getting more compact
things are get more powerful despite
being more compact and Qualcomm is is
doing their part yeah yeah you do have a
good point over like even even like why
am i why is the iPad a product that I
use a lot it's because my MacBook Pro 15
inch is so crappy when it comes to
battery life like I don't know how my
day is gonna go and so the last thing
that I want is to burn 25% of my battery
in writing a script way out right now I
feel that is such a waste and I probably
won't be able to find that person and
it's just that's bad like Intel really
needs to figure something out yeah yeah
all right so we have the the HDX out of
the way it's gonna end up being the 90s
phantom anything for you guys we're
drinking matcha tea just if anyone's
ever at all curious suggested this is
not my other podcast so I'm not gonna go
into detail but yeah I saw the HDX I'm
guessing the next iteration is gonna be
like 9 CX or something like they're
gonna keep the extreme in there what the
C stands for computing oh it was the 8
stand for computing extreme it's there
at the current 8th generation
oh yeah see it's a dumb name well let's
move on to another name that you hear a
lot about these days alright let's just
talk about the 5g again I'm sure the
viewers leaders are already just so sick
of the 5g talk but when I did my video
on the 855 I started off with a little
bit of 5g talk and this was the best way
I could describe it I want to hear your
thoughts on this what phone did you have
and what was your experience like in the
transition from three to four to LTE hmm
oh god that was citing that time was
that
what was my transition to LTE yeah uh
iPhone 4s okay
okay mine was the HTC Thunderbolt how oh
my god that was such as the first 4G LTE
phone and then was have in bed it burned
my hand while I was running to apps and
it overheated oh no I think my I was
probably the truth of the iPhone 5 was
the first one with LT there we go yeah
the true test of LTE because it was kind
of coming in like it just be a plus when
I get faster faster faster couldn't
quite get to that upper echelon until an
LTE phone came out was the Droid DNA oh
yeah I love that phone when I came out I
wanted it so bad I wanted it so bad we
didn't get a unit I was about to cry
yeah but I just remember feeling so
excited because all of a sudden the
phones were faster you didn't have to
rely you didn't have to be so patient
yeah
granted we've lost that patience in our
current generation yeah I just remember
like from the days of having a dumb
phone that like we call them now and
Google Maps became a thing on like a
Sony Ericsson and I was just so happy to
have a mapping application to guide me
right and then moving on to Android and
then gaining it Detroit DNA like that is
the type of excitement that is actually
palpable and I feel like what most
people are forgetting under all of the
low-level talk is that that's what we're
probably going to experience coming up
again yeah I think so I think especially
with 5g it's just like and I mean the
biggest problem is that it is only going
to be deployed in a few cities because
the way that it works like you have to
put nodes everywhere yeah because their
reach is so short right but the benefit
is that you can still have sub six and
then also here comes like this is why
and this is when everyone checks out you
see like sub six millimeter wave you
know and I get it you know we understand
that terminology I just barely do now
but that's what I mean like I I think
that what Qualcomm needs to do is to
actually give those use cases and what
they're doing is putting VR headsets on
people and saying look it's streaming
perfectly understand why then
I understand why they use that as a use
case right yes it makes bandwidth the
the entire reason why we haven't been
able to do wireless vr so far is because
standard Wi-Fi doesn't have enough
throughput it has too much latency and
that's why until developed like a
special Wi-Fi standard yeah to push like
that much like bandwidth over-the-air
but and so I get it I get it but the
thing is like yeah like you said who's
gonna be like standing in a park with
the VR headset on like just like
fighting zombies Ridgid took my next
question about 5g if there are more
applications of it that would be
incredibly practical let's say 8 kv or
HDR 10 all these terms that you may or
may not understand why they're cool then
that's our job that's our job to make it
clear to you that's why I was actually
kind of excited when I thought about
that I was like my first LTE phone was a
super exciting experience yeah I was
watching Netflix on that thing without
having to wait for it to buffer yeah and
then even then back then netflix became
a thing that was exciting right right
yeah so our content our what what what
our phones were capable of and the
things we did on the internet completely
changed once HSPA and LTE became a thing
and I wonder what would be or what would
be your views case scenario where 5g
actually benefits you because we can
think of the practical stuff like I need
to upload my video immediately but what
yeah I mean I mean I think a lot of the
use cases are gonna come down to
creative work yeah like it's sad that it
funnels down into that but like if you
think about it most people when they're
like oh I don't want YouTube video or
something they just watch it like even
it can be 2k and most people can stream
a 2k YouTube video and it they don't
notice a difference right the the
difference I guess is just that it's
it's like upload speeds you know that's
like the biggest thing like I'm I'm
gonna start shooting medium format
pretty soon and those files are freaking
normos which camera the Fuji 50 are Wow
yeah and those files are huge because
they're like they're just like 56
megapixels oh my goodness
and so you take like you know if I take
20 photos that's gigabytes and even now
I'm using I just started I got the Fuji
XT 3 as my video camera and it can
can shoot in two hundred megabyte or
four hundred megabit per second video
files 4k 10 bit 60fps and these are
freaking huge files like right now a two
minute file at 200 megabits 1080p 30 is
is like is like three gigs you know for
two minutes
yeah I'm even gonna I hope I don't have
any problems trying to upload this video
to Jules later
yeah the Wi-Fi is actually not bad here
sorry yeah I think it's just like for me
as it stands if I want to upload that
kind of stuff I have to find a good
Wi-Fi and like I'm not gonna upload it
from my phone because like I pay pretty
good by it data and then most a lot of
places don't have great Wi-Fi and it
could take like for example last week I
was in Lake Tahoe Nevada right and I had
to make a video well as on vacation is
for this but the Wi-Fi there so garbage
that it took nine and a half hours to
upload a one and a half gig file on me
and Wow yes I was real bad that was me
uploading last week's weekly if you
haven't seen that yeah the road trip
yeah yeah mhm and in the through player
it is so insane that you just don't have
to think about anything and just like it
just we passed this threshold of nothing
is a problem anymore
you know and I feel like we already
passed out a video streaming but this is
the point in which we passed that with
giving each other data giving each other
for me let me give it let me sense in
Spanish music the way out of what like
let me give you back the change on that
topic
okay the biggest problem is okay two
things first one enough 5g talk just
give me something to show ya yeah
everything everything here everything
that these I've said that the core
everything was to been there
years so please let's just get a city
connected yeah and boom yeah just give
it to consumers because I think like the
word is just even becoming annoying like
yeah it's like a meme at this point yeah
yeah it's a meme okay I'm sick of
hearing millimeter-wave yeah that's the
first when you go to the airport in the
the scanner it says an EM wave okay the
second thing is okay so let's assume
that 5g is everything that they say 5
gigahertz down I believe we've got IOT
fully connected we've got this insane
download speeds and yada yada at all
that's fantastic you know what the
problem is it's not free yeah it's not
free and so what's the problem like for
example I whenever I'm gonna notice I
have great LTE speeds far better than
the ones I have in the United States I
don't have like I could literally upload
anyone get to buy YouTube video into in
about two minutes no problem whatsoever
the problem is it's it's it's what it's
like ten dollars per gig mm-hmm and you
know so every single growth development
technology is fabulous and I know 5 G's
gonna be great I just want to know how
carriers are planning to play in it yeah
and because there it is pointless to
have so much amazing bandwidth if I have
to pay per gig yeah I'm praying that
carriers get into another war and start
you know upping the amount of data you
get free fertile we finally get to a
point where it's like everyone's
unlimited again yeah we might get there
and I hope so like Qualcomm made that
use case to me when they first I had a
meeting with them months ago where they
showed me the first radios when they
first would like unveiled the first
radios and they said you know in our
eyes like these the carrier because
these speeds are gonna be so insane and
everyone is gonna be pulling so much
data like it's gonna be pretty much
impossible for carriers to price it as
they're pricing it now because the the
argument when when LTE came out the
argument was that people are straight
are accessing so many more web pages
streaming so many more videos that you
have to change the pricing
games because it becomes part of their
daily life and if you price it the same
way as you price that before then people
are gonna be poor or like you can yeah
it will be picked last again this is
this is people are greedy so you never
know like I pray that it'll be that way
by me like in the case of LTE I I do
understand the constraints and I do
understand that and like everybody makes
this common like dating the United
States is stupid expensive and it is
it's the most expensive I've ever paid
for like it doesn't matter where I go
you go to Taipei and it's what seven
dollars from limited it's amazing
prepaid car you know you go to Romanian
it's like three dollars for a month
unlimited yeah I think the fastest
internet in the world mobile era in the
world is in Estonia okay yeah and it's
not that expensive no it's like yes it's
like it's like so inexpensive and it's
unlimited yep and so I understand that
in the case of US carriers like Europe
is the size of how much of the United
States
I do understand there's more territory
it requires more infrastructure there is
more population so I do understand that
it's a lot of money for these carriers
to keep these structures going I totally
understand the complexity the problem is
that like you know it doesn't it doesn't
invite me to consume mm-hmm and the
whole purpose the whole selling point of
5g is better consumption yeah and so the
case of LC I understand the restraints
the bottlenecks generated where 5g
intends to fix that the whole purpose of
5g is tell you what stop investing on
LTE we've got this new technology that's
gonna take advantage of millimeter wave
and then we're gonna have a small lower
spectrum which is sub 6 that'll be able
to penetrate buildings of far better so
you're gonna have to invest less in
infrastructure in order to be able to
connect people so that's the whole
selling point for carriers that's the
whole it's actually supposed to and tell
you what that existing LT spectrum that
you have that's gonna be the fallback
it's all gonna work simultaneous you're
not gonna have to be at five G n then it
falls into LT
it's all happening at the same same time
yeah and so be so because people are
gonna be moving to 5g that whole LT
spectrum will be to a certain degree
Alessi DNA so it allowed that it'll
allow them to no longer have to worry
about to strengthen straining consumers
because they want to protect that you
know that they don't get bottlenecks in
the spectrum yeah that's all cool yeah I
just wish I could see it in the data
plan exactly yeah I I think it was
Michael
mr. mobile himself that said last week
on our car cast that what he wanted this
tech summit to be was you arrive you get
off the plane and when you get to here
you get a moto rod better flora yeah you
get a phone you know reference device
phone that will not make it to market
it's just a proof of concept get to use
that they've already set up the island
of Maui to be a five in our game
corrector exactly but instead we've got
a bunch of demos already went in and was
just like yeah yeah and everything yeah
because what it will be I'm kind of sick
of hearing this is what you like this is
what will be like the only the only hope
that I have is the fact that is
literally supposed to roll out in March
so by next year's tech summit we should
have used it a lot yeah right but I mean
it's still only in a few cities it's in
San Francisco I'm sure people are gonna
be start flooding SF I did like that
they had carriers here like just
straight up saying oh we were on it yeah
well I was surprised actually how into
it Verizon was because they're usually
into their own thing and they're like
we're gonna do our own thing but this
time they're actually working with
Qualcomm which is their own thing has
actually always been with Qualcomm if
you think about it CDMA was the
technology that enabled Verizon it was a
walking technology LTE was the same
thing and they were pretty much the
first truck so they've always been like
direct really close partners with
Qualcomm yeah Qualcomm pretty much has
enabled their business okay fair enough
all right well that's it's a 2019 thing
I'm pretty excited for it as long as
like it's at consumption but also what
we do with the mobile Internet becomes
much more prevalent because we've we've
reached a threshold of reliability we
know how to get a reliable connection we
know where to go we know what we have to
do speed on the other hand is
like it's a relative thing because we
are tolerant beings so if all of a
sudden everything is lightning fast and
it is about what these theoretical yeah
we're gonna think there's the slowest
thing yours exactly yes until we get you
have to remember how things have evolved
over time like if you remember the
internet before LT mm-hmm it was more
efficient because it understood that
there was not much power in our phones
and there was not much bandwidth so the
the mobile internet has evolved to a
crazy way yeah
like up to the point where I know people
in New York who don't own a computer
they can do everything they want yeah
and they're fabulous yeah yeah exactly
and for me it's just shocking to meet
people that don't own a computer like
the computers are seriously becoming a
thing of the past we have a lot of
people yeah and so if you think about
that mentor HDX
LTE has enabled a lot of like mobile
YouTube man if you remember YouTube
before yeah and people are actually
formatting videos for phones now because
it's like exact percentage consumption
is on phone zactly yeah yeah yeah yeah
they said on a 720p podcast all right so
that's the 2019 thing but there is a bit
to talk about in terms of 2019 as you
talk about smart phones going forward
but before we get to that we're gonna
get into a tiny little break this
episode of the pocket now weekly is
brought to you by ops genie stuff
happens well stuff but it's a word that
starts with s and rhymes with hit and if
you're running your business right
you've got your developer and operations
team standing by ready to pounce when
stuff hits the fan but you have to know
when that stuff hits the fan well with
ABS Genie by Atlassian your teams have
the tools they need to plan for
incidents and outages whether they've
been scheduled or have come up last
minute and make sure your business is
covered through different time zones and
holidays alerts can be put out to over
200 platforms like JIRA Amazon Cloud
watch data dog New Relic
and others and if someone on the case
can't fix the problem right then in
there they have the ability to escalate
the issue to another team member here's
a free tip from me always back up
problems don't always
get solved the first time around with
opps Jeannie your next incident doesn't
stand a chance
visit abbs Jeannie calm to sign up for a
free company account for up to five team
members no credit card required that's
o-p-s ge and ie dot-com never miss an
alert again with ops Jeannie from
Atlassian dude we're doing this podcast
wrong what look at this
oh yeah we should have done it in the
pool yeah those fools Michael Fisher and
Hendra martynuk are are working from the
pool it's funny because we all brought
some work to this this whole thing right
and second I have to admit I'm not I'm
not too beat up about that because I
know I'm here for a few more days lucky
yeah I'm gonna shine you know what I'm
heading to the pool after this do it and
do all your stuff they're like do you
still have like filming and what
I'm just saying like can you film at the
pools why I meant to say what I know if
some people might get a little bit like
freaked out like there's a camera over
there okay so 20 19 20 19 I obviously
this it makes sense that tech summit is
at this time of the year because
everything that they announce is meant
to be for the upcoming yeah right it's
like it's like showing off a 2019 sedan
or something like that you're seeing
what's gonna be used throughout the next
year or so
8:55 how excited are you about what the
855 is going to offer and what that will
mean for our smartphones like the next
generation I don't know I mean you
should get kind of excited with every
generation but how excited are you about
this one this one is a pretty big jump
actually it's relatively surprising if
you'll give just the performance gains
and even the graphics gains it's a lot
and I think that says something about
what they're going to be doing with the
a CX series as we call it you know they
said in the keynote they're like they
talked about Moore's law you know and
they were like we're gonna create a new
law for smartphones or for mobile chips
where we start seeing a more exponential
gain again because like Moore's law is
really teetering out in terms of like
regular processors but for mobile we're
kind of reaching this whole new horizon
right I think for the e55
in particular I'm excited about I'm
excited about the action and this is
such a buzzword the AI capabilities as
related to camera technology because
they really they announced a ton of new
potential capabilities in the camera
most of them have to do with deep
learning depth maps so they are
basically enabling all these new things
like like bokeh mode live video because
they can sample they can sample an image
and project a depth map onto any image
it's not even just not even just a taken
with your phone you see that after the
fact that's live yeah you can take you
you could take an image from the in
and give it a bokeh effect because it
takes it uses this deep learning
algorithm to sense depth based on where
things should be after testing phones
with two cameras so it can triangulate
depth basically and every new almost
every new feature in the camera for a 55
is enabled by this ability of you know
deep learning an AI to triangulate depth
and it's it's exciting because we hit
you hit a point in physics with a sensor
a camera sensor in which you can only
get so much light you can only do this
but things that like Google are doing
things that it qualcomm are doing where
you literally it's it's like
computational photography is is the next
frontier because even Google takes
multiple frames takes the sharpest frame
stacks all the other frames on top and
then that way you get rid of any of the
noise that you would get when you
usually bump up the shadows you save the
highlights you don't get noise and that
that's the biggest thing like you're
just you're just going around physics
right you're not breaking it we're kind
of routing around it and I think we've
vacuumed yeah crazy stacking like yeah
it's taking level one and just stacking
it to make it level eight yeah but but
you know level eight it's a whole
different thing you just got really
Lading the same thing in the way yeah I
think computational photography in
general people are seeing the the future
the benefit of it Qualcomm in a 55 they
have a new ISP that can do seven
trillion operations per second and is
specifically tailored to doing to doing
imaging information no and it's insane
and I I just like part of it part of the
like you know I love using my camera
camera and so far that's like I don't
want I don't want my phone camera to be
as good as my camera camera but like if
we're gonna advance in the as humans in
the future we gotta get to the point
where we have DSLR style or not even
DSLR mirrorless style cameras on us all
the time in our pocket can you imagine
though if that one smartphone
manufacturer that takes everything this
process is doing
for camera processing the DSP the CV ISP
computer vision image image processing
and puts actually puts a bigger sensor
on the back yeah well that's what he's
supposed to do and that's the thing like
a lot so here's the thing like the 845
brought a lot of stuff like HDR like a
wider color gamut and photos all that
was great but you know the other day the
other day I was talking with a bear with
a you know from every gizmo Fergus MO
and he was like ok so all these things
are great but they look really good on
your phone yeah yeah you were talking
about this yeah he's got a point
and he's also doesn't have a point
because everyone uses their phones to
view content like they look great on
your phone but once you pull them into a
computer yeah they they don't look great
like they're sharpening there are
artifacts there's it's just not the
perfect photo he's right think about it
is you know I I feel that that we the
only way because of the convenience of
the phone people are willing to
compromise a great photo guess why
because they only look at them at their
finally can pensions them on their phone
exactly can't do that on a man I mean
we've got Instagram pundits who will
zoom into the highly processed photo
that we post on Instagram it has also
been compressed with horribly Campania
and they they judge a phone by that you
know I'm gonna say anything because I'm
gonna be amazed I I love the fact that
processors are getting to the point I
just feel that you still the only reason
like what separates a good smartphone
camera is literally physics yeah it's
the size of the sensor and unless
smartphones can figure out a way around
the size yeah you can do a lot of great
fit like if you saw the demos the you
could do a lot of bokeh sure but it
looks fake mm-hmm oh yeah of course it
looks fake yeah yeah no it's so
it's great that you can do that but I
find myself not doing it a lot
unless I'm using them 8:20 Pro because
the size of the sensor is significant
ready larger yeah so you've got the
physics being provided yeah and so
unless somebody figures out a way around
physics yeah you will still get great
opportunities to fake things out and
have them not look real right I think I
think for right now with like the tonal
depth mapping and stuff when when we get
where we're getting to a point where we
can more accurately predict depth and
the more accurately we can predict it
the more we can make it look like an
actual camera should look right right
now we kind of have like the first time
that the bokeh mode came out was like 1
plus 5t and like a couple of things it
was kind of focus area non focus area
and it just looks so fake right now
we're starting to see like you can
triangulate depth based on two objects
in a scene because we have two cameras
two focus areas focus on subject focus
on other thing and then through deep
learning machine learning we can do that
a million times and say like okay that's
about five feet away in between that
five feet how out of focus should it be
right so it's getting better and then
there's the things like the p20 Pro
which had the monochrome sensor and
monochrome sensors only get they only
get texture data right and so that had
it on top of that so actually the p20
Pro has slightly sharper images than the
may 20 Pro but it gonna kind of Miss
that too a lot of chrome since was
slightly more but the process it was
like trashy in the in the sensor is
smaller yeah and also always always sure
over sharpening is insane but no I'll
the p20 pros bet on them 820 throats not
yes it's dialed back but because they
don't have the monochromes that started
there anymore so
yeah so they traded off the monochrome
sensor for it was it the white or the
wide-angle and wide angle which I love
the white so say I mean having the three
camera like they did it right but that's
another tangent is it safe to say that
we finally the dirty work there are a
lot of people running around with me 20
pros yeah there were a ton of me I don't
do something really I had my iPhone
tennis max on the table I threw it on
the bed I was like not well the governor
of Hawaii was waving around and I found
he's like I love Qualcomm so it's safe
to say you were saying earlier already
that we're moving into a whole new era
when it comes to like the Moore's law
and everything like that your points on
that their points on that a set it's is
it safe to say now that performance
gains are no longer as important as
future gains because now we know that
just picking up this phone scrolling
through the apps opening up games
opening up videos we know that's gonna
be a good experience no matter what yeah
that is a that is a level of performance
that we've already achieved between 800
and 820 we're good now yeah 835 proved
that that could be a reliable experience
a 45 proof that it could be a powerful
experience now we have feature games in
the 850 if it's a big reason why a lot
of people say that smartphones are
stagnating because what did we use to
review smartphones based on how fast is
it yeah right and that's why we used to
use benchmarks and that's why we used to
like you know launch apps really quick
and jump back and forth between of them
and and at this point it's like and so
most smartphones now have like a
gimmicky feature that it is gonna make
or break the device or anything is I I
agree with you there but the reason why
I'm excited about the a 55 is because if
you look at the trend of smartphones
this year they knew that performance
gains were finally out of peak or at
least like we know we're good so they
start putting in those features vapor
cooling yeah
cooling for the processor like notches
and stuff like that because they don't
like fans as they said
but like talking about the cooling in
particular if you have the cooling which
made the 845 an even better gaming
device imagine what its gonna do with
the 855 right with everything that it's
gonna bring to the table because that's
an animator yeah you know an 855 with a
good vapor cooling chamber I feel like
is it's hard for me to say cuz I don't
play games on my phone so yeah I hope so
I feel that we know planes all the time
you should be so I feel that we brush
full to be defined yeah um because the
biggest problem with mobile gaming is
that mobile games are not really great
yeah the better though have you played
okay but Josh is a big mom yeah so
here's the problem the reason why
they're not great is not necessarily
because there's no capability it's just
they want to make them for the masses so
obviously not everybody has a powerful
enough phone to run all the graphics and
to run everything yeah
and they can't just tear what phone runs
what they can but it's it's complicated
and then you have to account for every
single model and it's awful it's awful
it's worse so I would really love to see
like this but like a separate gaming
store where just like in the PC market
you've got minimum specifications to be
able to run a game yeah and if no that's
true now yeah and so if you want to buy
this game you have to have a razor phone
yeah with this this this and it'll give
you the models which it's compatible for
their kind of going there because if
these computers the HDX processors and
the platforms to have things like the
adrenal 680 the you know 640 for mobile
you know this will only work on the 680
you know that kind of thing yeah yeah
that makes sense
so I would love to see that because
honestly like I hate playing certain
games where it's a first-person shooter
and then the guy that I'm supposed to
shoot just runs in a weird direction and
keeps doing it and then everybody that
I'm fighting keeps doing the same thing
yeah so the Nintendo switch is proof
that you can have really powerful gaming
experiences on mobile yeah you just need
a fan and they got a fan you need a fan
you need exhaust
the story is everyone should buy an ROG
you know it's just that's one thing then
the second thing is you know following
on the PC market we do need accessories
like the thing we need to let's let's
forget about the whole concept of thin
and light I mean these alien these
predators they literally look like
Tyrannosaurus Rex yeah they look like
the computer for Jurassic Park yeah yeah
and you know what people buy them people
that are really into the experience buy
them and then the third thing is come on
guys how difficult can it be to make a
freaking mobile controller yeah like how
but where a few people have made a good
mobile controller yeah here's got a game
bias here okay yeah but we need this so
we like come on man if you if you're
into gaming and you can't provide me a
controller you're not into games yeah
yeah you're right
yeah yeah razor still hasn't released
theirs right exactly yeah yeah yeah so
we've got this problem where people are
into this mentality where they love the
ps4 controller or they prefer the pro
controller on the switch or they some
people actually like the Xbox controller
I don't know why that's not a thing I
would have expected I'm a to say come on
guys
they're gaming companies if you want us
to take your gaming phone seriously you
we number one we need better games we do
yes yeah we do yeah and if these
processors aren't capable quote-unquote
I'd love to see that
and I would not mind paying X like right
now it's $60 for a game on this switch
I'm not asking you to pay $60 on mobile
but I wouldn't mind paying 20 bucks and
for a really good game yeah and where I
have limitations and they tell me you
can only play it on this phone and so
you can't buy it if you don't have the
phone cuz you need you have the best
possible experience they actually built
it with me is involved exactly and they
could launch a lite version for
everybody else sure you know like that's
the only way that I'm gonna take gaming
on a phone seriously the developers do
seriously need to look at mobile gaming
as a platform that's available to
everybody because you have these phones
that like I said earlier before
it's games are finally where we need
them to be and if every phone has
something like the 855 or even like de
45 then you can create games that
everyone has some sort of access to we
know it's interesting about day 55 is
it's not only a lot faster but they also
built in things like support for Vulcan
1.1 yeah which makes it a lot more
efficient to run these games so the
performance increase is not just the
performance its Creed's
its performance increase Plus how easy
it is to run the game it's more up here
than it is up here exactly you know the
problem the problem is again we're good
like I would love these gaming companies
to take advantage of all that yeah but
how many 855 s are gonna be launched
less here's my problem that's the
bottleneck the bottleneck is that
mentality that all foe should be able to
run this game yeah yeah that's not the
way it works very successful yeah
there's another mentality - one of the
main points that they kept making on
stage about gaming was how much money it
brings in and real gamers are like okay
yeah like think of think of it this way
though even even a game like Red Dead
Redemption - yeah it doesn't have
microtransactions and all that stuff
right and the mobile gaming space people
are too greedy they want the gotcha
they want all of that stuff great and we
have to yes give me a $30 yeah good game
don't give me that stupid in that
purchases man yeah yeah and I agree with
you there that that's that right now is
the Achilles heel of mobile gaming it is
the most lucrative form of gaming but we
need to have a subset of developers who
are creating triple-a title yet for
these phones yeah that you pay a premium
for and that's all you pay yeah just
like console gaming just like PC gaming
and yeah and that is something that we
did to ourselves because at the very
forefront of mobile everything was free
when when apps first became a thing app
developers made apps because ads were
lucrative as whatever and there was so
much money coming in from like oh free
version ads right and then now people
aren't even willing to pay 99 cents for
a pro version of an app that they use
every single day yeah people are like Oh
I'm gonna get my credit card 99 I'm 1990
they spent $4 on their Lots I spend 450
on my latte every morning not here in
the wild here it's $10 why and it's
subpar what but it's we did this
ourselves that evening in which Hawaii
if it has the word Kona in it doesn't
mean it's great so it's hard right it's
hard because it's going to take a
cultural shift to get people to be able
to pay that I remember way back I had a
ipod touch first generation and iPad -
yeah it was my first ever Apple product
yeah nice it was yeah it was my third
but I remember funny because I have
owned an Apple product since then but I
remember looking at the App Store and
looking at what's the most expensive app
that I can find on the App Store and it
was three hundred dollars and it was a
security software suite for enterprise
and I was like oh my god $300 for an app
that is absolutely ludicrous like who is
gonna like everything's free like you
know people don't even like rent a movie
for like $2.99 and it's like it's crazy
I don't know why there's this mentality
in society that like anything you do on
your phone should be free but it's okay
we're gonna have to get past that before
anyone's that's why I think like thirty
dollar game is anyone gonna spend that I
mean you would I would
I'm already paying $70 on switch games
yeah ya know they're expensive the thing
is that's how you create true gamers in
this space yeah I would like to see
someone like Nintendo yeah make a
full-fledged game game because
Nintendo's there's already a certain set
of games in the Play Store that do that
but the problem is their ports there's a
classic yes you could pay 25 bucks a
play to play Final Fantasy 7 again yeah
which is awesome but but let's let's
take you to the we need people pushing
it and the reason why I'm saying the
whole $30 is you know what building
these games requires talent and hard
work yeah and these developers need to
get paid the only reason why we've got
the stupid I ok this transaction the
stupid transaction thing is because
developers were
Bunnyman yeah yeah yeah it's lucrative
yeah here's the thing like we created
this like app bubble and then the app
bubble burst at the moment the companies
weren't able to monetize as you know
phones the the you know they as
smartphones start lowering an amount of
sales it's it's not productive for them
and more the which are the phones that
sell the most you know she wouldn't
submit the mid rangers and so that's the
thing I feel that gaming companies in
Mobile are doing it wrong yeah
they take the Nintendo approach yeah
low-power fun yeah yeah they're really
money yeah I feel that they're doing it
wrong I mean give me high power charge
money it's fair mm-hmm sure it's fair I
feel that it is fair yeah I would rather
that over in that experience and you
know and just make it clear if you don't
have this phone you can't play this game
yeah and I can bet you that that's the
moment that gaming phones are gonna take
off exactly it's also going to create
loyalty in the Android space yeah yeah
which I think would be great but we
finally have like camps of people you
know it's more sad right now my phone
plays for tonight better than an Android
phone does it's like it's see I'm just
like yeah this is what I mean and it's
the reason why people are like it's
funny how how many people in YouTube
think that I'm an iPhone hater I'm not I
would and what watch it by wearing what
tablet at my work it's clear that I use
them using not wearing it's not wearing
the tablet
the point being is why is building apps
for an iPhone so much better because
there are so the market don't vary yeah
it's the same damn thing
imported different capabilities and that
that is the deal and so yeah with
androids complexity the smartest thing
is for developers to forget about the
mentality that every phone is everything
should be right exactly so you know what
then I'll say this manufacturers start
getting in bed with these game companies
like I get it is doing it they get they
did they launch with the real thing not
because well Samsung did the hole for
ninth even though that doesn't even
really matter it's not the same thing
didn't optimize it yeah it was just a
marketing ploy Samsung get in with
Square Enix like I don't know maybe one
other company razor got in with marina
valor which is the biggest game in China
why boy yeah but that's the game not
necessarily like the publisher now like
publisher like make it make it like
$0.10 only works with Samsung make it so
that Razer only works with I mean so
then you start getting to exclusives
yeah it's weird but that's how we have
the console gaming anyway we have we're
talking about gaming now we were pretty
far this happened but it was a fun and
passionate one I want to make sure we do
one last thing and and let our viewers
know at least one piece of information
about the 855 that they can be happy
about
no more latency in Bluetooth so people
here's the thing I what I did that demo
mmm-hmm I was like no no it was it there
is zero latency so my biggest problem
with the whole death of the headphone
jack is that bluetooth isn't any better
it's better it's better it's it's like
latency and just the whole pairing
process and the fact that connecting my
it's not as simple as wire from
phone to wire to computer yeah no Perry
can be a nightmare and then you've got
the cases like the mark 3s from Sony
would yeah yeah a total they're the best
headphones that have the worst yeah
connected you one problem and the other
their their work it's bad and so this is
the reason why bluetooth is not
ubiquitous if price and experience does
not match the headphone jack yeah yeah
until now yeah it actually feels like it
we beat you roll latency you're
literally pressing buttons on whatever
and there is immediate reaction to audio
yeah it was fantastic and they weren't
even like using expensive headphones
haptics adaptive oh yeah yeah
so aptX already sounds great no acoustic
please no comments audio files come on
it does we know this we know that we
acknowledge your existence we
acknowledge your existence and we know
that nothing would be better than vinyl
fine pay for all this issue film some
stuff I you know I just hate that it's
an 855 thing oh yeah I would yeah or
something that would come on be better
for cheaper yeah it's not in the
processor because I wish that the next
batch of headphones would be able to do
it would be able to do it even if this
855 is not the processor that I'm using
yes it's just one of those things where
I'm like crap I use an iPhone for
running and I'm like damn it I I'm gonna
need like a small Android phone to be
able to you to be able because it's
really good yeah yeah mm-hmm you know
that I mean the fact that it can switch
like adaptively back and forth between
like resolutions this is it's great that
sound board that they had the
motherboard or whatever it was I said
SBC which is what like you know we've
heard that term and a few different
types of headphones
it was SBC and then you hit there was it
was a demo of like a phone that had a
piano key like layout and you like you
press enter press then duck press then
done but this time it was one to one
once once she hit the switch and I went
to app days
if it was awesome so anyone anyone out
there who like gets that latency in
games and videos or anything like that
at any point yeah yeah it's gonna be
mine especially at these kind of events
where literally there's a million
Bluetooth networks everywhere do you
know that's you know that's also the
thing because like they're just that's
why I like it's impossible to use
bluetooth that press events because it's
just like there's signals everywhere and
if you can oscillate and change you know
adaptively what you're gonna need it's
super useful yeah yeah yeah all right
well we we do have a luau to attend and
this is the most comfortable shirt I've
ever had in my life this is not but I
think I would I would think you know I'm
gonna wear this on the beaches in LA

girlfriend shoutout to you so she was
