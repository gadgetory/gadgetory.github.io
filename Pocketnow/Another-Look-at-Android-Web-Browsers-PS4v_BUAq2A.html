that if you don't like the stock
services or applications you can
generally find a replacement fairly
easily I'm Taylor Martin this is pocket
now and this is another look at Android
web browsers one of the awesome features
of Android is the fact that if you don't
like the stock applications you can
generally find replacements in the Play
Store third-party browsers for instance
or some of the most popular applications
out there now with the jellybean update
google changed the stock browser to
chrome which has a long list of features
that really set it apart from other
browsers however there are some features
from the old stock browser that are
missing and what are the most complained
about things and chrome is performance
when you tend to zoom quickly or scroll
quickly you get a little lag and you get
a little bit of what some people refer
to as checker boarding now with chrome
it doesn't necessarily just play a
checkerboard but you do have a lot of
white that displays when the page cannot
render quickly enough from the cache but
there are some awesome features such as
your tab sync with chrome and requesting
the desktop site and even your bookmark
sync with your google account but some
people don't feel that outweighs the
performance bugs probably the most
popular third-party browser is dolphin
it's available for iOS and Android and
it has a bevy of unique features that
really set it apart from the competition
one is performance it is extremely fast
and there is very little checkerboard or
lag when quickly zooming or scrolling
there's also a gesture navigation option
which you can slide from the left or
right side of the page and access
different panels tap in the lower corner
and you have quick access to voice
search and a quick shortcuts through
gestures you can draw a letter and open
up Google search from the right side if
you switch you can access your add-ons
which there are dozens maybe hundreds
maybe even thousands of different
plugins that you can install that really
add to the experience I for one use
LastPass religiously and there is a
LastPass add-on which is awesome and
backing out of the application you can
also clear cache in history quickly and
easily
another one of the most popular Android
browsers out there is Firefox much like
its popular desktop version Mozilla
created a mobile version for Android
users like dolphin it has add ons and
plugins that really add to the
experience and like chrome it features
tab sync with the desktop version of
Firefox it also has a request desktop
site function which will get you from
the mobile version of a site to a full
version however if the site does not
support that function you are stuck with
the mobile site unless they provide a
link directly to the full site unlike
dolphin however Firefox suffers from
some serious performance issues
scrolling is inconsistent pinch-to-zoom
suffers from some serious lag and
scrolling quickly reveals some checker
boarding and some other performance
flaws I've had issues with the browser
jumping up when I'm scrolling down and
other really weird quirks the final
browser will talk about in this video is
skyfire it is definitely not the most
powerful browser out there and it's not
the most amazing it's more so a social
browser than just a web browser as the
developers built this with sharing in
mind it suffers from some performance
issues zooming is a little jumpy less so
than firefox pinch-to-zoom is not nearly
as jumpy as it is on firefox however
zooming out requires several pinches you
can't just pinch really quickly and zoom
all the way out you have to pinch about
three four maybe five times but as you
notice this application is set up more
for sharing than anything you have your
native android sharing options but you
also have one click sharing for liking
on Facebook sharing to facebook twitter
and other social accounts this browser
also has flash built in which is very
important for some users since chrome
nor android officially support flash
anymore and now for the good stuff a
head-to-head battle between all four of
these browsers I cleared the data and
headed over to the Verge's homepage to
see which one would be first chrome took
the crown by just a slight margin over
dolphin Firefox came in third and then
skyfire came in last as it's still
loading while the other three are fully
loaded it also zooms in all the way by
default so you have to pinch to zoom to
get it all the way out
after the page fully loads google also
recently launched a beta version of
Chrome which fixes some of the
performance issues and lag there is less
checker boarding when you're panning and
zooming around and it performs better
overall however it's still a beta and
there are some bugs so if you've been
thinking lately that chrome is lacking
features and the performance isn't
exactly what you need never fear there
are plenty of browsers out there and the
Play Store that performed just as well
if not better and offer a bevy of
awesome features like plugins and
add-ons as always be sure to LIKE the
