pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
review of the highly anticipated Dell
Venue Pro running Windows Phone 7 it's a
beast of a device let's get to it so the
reason I started off by saying that this
device is a beast is because it is its
commanding it's huge it's heavy its
bulky but it's also very sleek and sexy
and it really gets a lot of attention
let me give you some perspective on how
heavy it is the double menu pros 180
grams compared to say device like the
Samsung Focus one of the lightest
devices out there it's 115 grams
compared to the iPhone 4 which of course
has real glass real metal the iPhone 4
is 137 grams and then you get devices
like the Evo 4G which is 170 grams and
then the touch pro2 comes closest and
outweighing
the Dell Venue Pro it is 175 grams so
the Dell Venue Pro is no lightweight you
really need to know that if you are
considering this device again this is a
t-mobile device although it just passed
the FCC with AT&amp;amp;T 3G bans which is great
news for people that love this form
factor so let's take a look at this
device it's got impressive build quality
I think the heavyweight really lends to
a high quality feel but as we're going
to discover there's a mix of many
different materials on the Dell Venue
Pro to really make this device the seem
look and feel very high quality so let's
start off with the front we have a
commanding 4.1 inch AMOLED display this
is the largest AMOLED display by our
account obviously there's no
front-facing camera but subtly there's a
mix of materials up here so we've got
this sort of pseudo metal we're gonna
call it plastic Chrome on the sides
which makes it looks really nice from
across the room but then we have this
rubber strip at the top not really sure
what the purpose of that is but it's
actually a a soft rubber strip then
we've got this 4.3 inch curved glass
display now I haven't found any benefit
in having it curved besides it just
looks really cool and it kind of feels
nice
very slick and very smooth and it looks
like fingerprints really don't attract
to the front of the device but
fingerprints do attract to the back of
the devices we're going to see we've
capacitive touch buttons down here for
the search start screen and back and
then keeping with the theme of symmetry
we have the same rubber strip on the
bottom that we do on the top which I
think helps a lot to open up the slider
with one hand and opening up the slider
we'll unlock the device or at least turn
it on off of standby so you can swipe to
unlock the screen the screen itself is
very high quality it's not as high
quality as the Super AMOLED found on the
Samsung Focus so if we put them
side-by-side and we talked about this in
the unboxing you can kind of get a sense
that the blacks are completely black
here on the Samsung Focus whereas on the
dove and you pro it's kind of like a
milky black but still a very high
quality screen and we'll talk about sort
of performance and how this device
compares to other Windows Phone 7
devices in another video if we go on the
top the power button is in a really
weird spot usually if it's on the top
it's on the left here and it also looks
weird it's like a little tilted thing
it's hard to get used to it's it's very
different than a lot of other devices
out there so it's something to consider
if you are really sensitive to where the
power button is but you're probably not
and get used to it quite quickly so
moving on to the bottom here we have one
of these mesh covered grills is for the
speaker and one is for the microphone
then on the bottom we have the micro USB
port a little bit unconventional to have
the port on the bottom that nowadays but
not too big of a deal
and again you saw the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack kind of nuzzle to the
left side of the device here on the top
and we should also mention that the of
course obligatory dual action camera
button is here on the right side and the
volume rocker typically placed on the
left side of the phone is actually on
the right so something to keep in mind
so let's slide up here and talk about
the keyboard the keyboard is quite good
it's backlit in white and purple which
looks awesome and when the lights go off
you can see better the keys that are on
here Windows Phone 7 has a really
really good on-screen keyboard but this
keyboard probably one opposite one ups
it whatever that means um in terms of
usability because it's just such a good
keyboard and the keys are large enough
to where if you have you know big
fingers you can get by with it small
enough to where there's not that much
finger travel here so we're gonna have
some longer-term thoughts about the Dell
Venue Pro keyboard you can see that
there is an emoticon button here and
actually let's open up somewhere where
we have to put in text so you can see
what is going on here so we're gonna go
into a text message and so if I tap on
the emoticon icon it brings up an
on-screen menu choice there so I'm going
to just choose an emoticon and click the
back let's see what else we have here so
we have a function button to get to the
numbers so hold down function to get one
two three four see that's coming through
and of course there are all the
characters so standard keyboard here
with with some extra buttons and then
there's a symbol button down here which
will bring up the add the symbol list so
you can get to sort of the same things
that you could get to by doing a
function but on screen maybe that's a
faster way to enter certain certain
digits or characters so very good
keyboard so far it looks good in terms
of daily usability we're gonna have some
some follow up thoughts about that now
flipping over to the back we have some
really cool stuff it's really
interesting to see a Dell logo on a
smartphone of course they have the arrow
they have the streak but you know we
review a lot of phones on Pocket now and
it's just very interesting to see this
Dell logo that's usually associated with
computers desktops and laptops now
appear on a phone anyhow so we have the
five megapixel camera and it's got a
chrome ring around it which is nice then
we have a flash the back is covered it's
kind of hard to see on video the back is
covered with this textured surface it
looks kind of like this high-class sort
of I don't want to call it a
checkerboard because that wouldn't be
doing it justice but almost a designer
like pattern on the back that's also
functional because it has a nice texture
to it giving the venue pro a nice grip
in the hand and if we slide up the
screen and I'm getting good at doing it
with
just one hand so you don't need to use
too now that theme continues here even
behind the screen really subtle details
that make the venue Pro really stand out
as a high quality device and of course
it says Windows Phone down here on the
bottom the back comes off very easily
just pop and there it goes back here
there's not much to speak of we have the
battery which is 1400 milliamp hours
I've got an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card in there but
you're not going to want to do that
because this phone is locked to t-mobile
now so you got to use a t-mobile SIM
card although as mentioned this device
has passed the FCC with AT&amp;amp;T 3G bans now
this device comes with either eight
gigabytes or 16 gigabytes of internal
storage
there's no way to upgrade the memory as
you can see here it's just a battery and
a SIM card slot no micro SD slot has
found on the Samsung Focus and sliding
on the back battery cover is pretty easy
too so I've been touching the screen a
lot through this video and you can see
that it's fingerprint free so that is
really a great feature of the dub and
you pro so over all the hardware on the
venue Pro is outstanding in fact this
may have build quality that we've never
seen before it's just out of this world
you got a hold one in your hand to know
what I mean but it has a tremendous
amount of weight to it the materials
used are all mixed textured plastic
chrome glass curved glass pieces of
rubber and it just looks awesome and
extremely I think commanding is a very
good word to use when you drop it on a
table at a bar and someone looks at the
phone it's like wow what is that thing
is huge so the hardware for the Dell
Venue Pro has really high marks in our
book and we're gonna talk a lot about
software in an upcoming video please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
it and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
