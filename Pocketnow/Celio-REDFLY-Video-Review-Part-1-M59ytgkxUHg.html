line of the celio red fly mobile
companion video review we're going to go
through the installation process on a
verizon samsung i760 windows mobile
professional 6.0 phone the Quick Start
Guide which included with the red fly
contains everything you need to know for
the installation as well as the
operation of the unit there are two
installation method the first is to use
the CD on a pc with activesync or
windows mobile device center the second
which is the method we will use today is
by downloading the driver over the year
from the celia website using verizon's
evdo network well we'll open up pocket
internet explorer to speed up the
process I've already input the website's
URL once the download page appears you
select the device you are using in our
case the samsung i760 then a page
appears to accept the license terms we
accept those and then a pop-up will
appear to initiate the download click on
yes there and the download starts
once the download is complete the
install program starts up and asks
whether we agree to perform a reboot at
the end of the installation click on yes
and the installation process continues
and completes click on OK and the unit
starts rebooting itself I won't bore you
with the slow mode windows mobile reboot
process that we all know we will jump to
the next step which is to connect the
red fly in the i760 via the USB cable so
we need to use the i760 USB cable plug
it into the i760 then the other end goes
into the one of two ports on the red fly
we then power up the red fly it will
detect an attached USB cable and boot up
to the today screen now your windows
mobile device is usable via the red fly
unit it's pretty nice having the
keyboard in the large screen available
another very nice feature is the red
flies Bluetooth connectivity in order to
use it we need to pair the i760 and the
red fly to do this we need to go to
settings connections Bluetooth and the
mode tab and make sure that the windows
mobile device is discoverable once
you've done that you press the red
flight key which is the settings option
on the red fly authorize the pairing and
you can also select whether you want to
automate
medically connect request a connection
or deny a connection I've set it to
request the connection unplug the cable
hit the Bluetooth key on the red fly
select the device I want to connect with
and the connection process starts I had
to get a pop-up requesting a connection
to the red fly I click yes and I'm now
connected via bluetooth to the red fly
very nice the only disadvantage of this
option is the fact that I'm not charging
my windows mobile unit like I would be
at the USB cable that does it for the
installation as you can see it is very
straightforward and I'll be back with a
look at using applications in my next
installment of the red fly mobile
