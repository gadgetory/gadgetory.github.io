spotlight but the company has been
upping its game lately with its MX smart
phone line spearheading its approach the
mx4pro is an update to their flagship
and x4 and it brings upgrades all around
there are the upgrades enough to make
this phone worth your money
I'm hi out to Houston with pocket now
and let's find out in our full review of
the meizu mx4pro this review unit comes
to us courtesy of efox shop comm
aluminum sides check chamfered edges
check the design of the mx4pro is an
iterative step from the mx4 before it
and like the mx4 it's a nice design if
not a little uninspired metal sides and
a removable plastic back panel that look
and feel like metal makes a good first
impression and so does the display the
mx4pro has a 5.5 inch IPS LCD panel with
a 2560 by 1536 resolution for you pixel
junkies that's a whopping five hundred
and forty six pixels per inch the
display is bright and vibrant and has
fantastic outdoor visibility viewing
angles and color reproduction black
isn't quite as deep as on AMOLED panels
of course but that's about the only
thing we can find wrong with this
excellent display sitting alongside that
display on the front of the device is a
5 megapixel front facing camera and
earpiece speaker and a physical button
more on that later
there's a nice and clicky volume rocker
on the left hand bezel and a microUSB
port and speaker holes along the bottom
up top we've got the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and yeah the power button
on the top the back of the phone is
clean as can be with only the 20 point
seven megapixel camera LED flash and
meizu branding to be found as I said
before it's also removable though the
battery isn't so don't try removing the
back play exposes the Micro SIM tray but
there's no microSD slot so keep that in
mind before you buy the phone and be
sure to order the right size
configuration for you
powering the software experience on the
mx4 pro is Macy's proprietary fly me UI
and we'd be lying if we said it doesn't
feel a lot like iOS there's no app
drawer here but instead a rearranged
well grid of icons folders and widgets
pulling down the notification shade
reveals the same Gaussian blur effect
popularized with iOS 7 and there's even
a search function triggered with a swipe
up on the home screen it's a bit jarring
at first for the average Android user
but hey we're not saying any of this is
a bad thing there is a bit of a learning
curve for the home button though since
there are no capacitive buttons on
either side of it mazey was implemented
a few gestures in their stead swipe up
from the home button acts as the back
button and swiping up from the left or
right of the button pulls up Mizzou's
multitasking solution sure it's not the
card base UI that we're used to seeing
from Android but I actually enjoy it
it's clean and it doesn't obstruct your
view in the current app you can also
long press the home button to turn off
the display instead of having to reach
for the power button up top speaking of
the home button it's also a fingerprint
scanner just like the iPhone and the
galaxy s6 you can place a finger on the
home button to quickly unlock the mx4pro
without having to type in your PIN and
it's really responsive
you can record multiple fingers and even
use the button to authorize mobile
payments through mazes fly me service
there are a few apps here from Aisyah
for productivity like the file manager
and memos and a theming engine and App
Center that currently only feature
Chinese content but aside from that
there's really next to no bloatware on
the mx4pro although aside from the Play
Store there's also no Google Apps
pre-installed of course you can always
just download whatever Google Apps you
use and some might enjoy not having
every service forced on their phone the
camera on the mx4pro is nothing short of
excellent at least in the right lighting
photos taken in bright sunny
environments have vibrant colors that
walk the line of over saturation and
they look tax sharp even in a hundred
percent crop there are plenty of manual
controls for full rein over your shots
and plenty of different modes like HDR
and panorama and of course beauty mode
this time with individual options for
the eyes face skin
teeth for the crazy anime character in
you take the mx4pro into dimmer lighting
though and the whole experience starts
to go downhill it's extremely slow to
take a photo indoors to the point that
most the shots I take end up blurry
messes because I thought it had already
taken the photo long before it actually
did and even when you manage to get a
good enough looking shot the clarity
from before is lost in exchange for fuzz
and grain keeping with the trend of
modern flagship smartphones
there's 4k video capture to take full
advantage of the 20 point seven
megapixel sensor although without
reliable focusing or oh is I can't
really say that I'd recommend this
without a tripod
there's also a slow-motion video for 60
frames per second capture in 720p
performance is a high point of this
phone putting its octa-core processor
and high end GPU to good use I never
noticed any significant lag and
scrolling through the home screens is
buttery smooth it's quick to launch apps
and with three gigabytes of RAM and its
disposal games don't seem to trip up the
phone either though they do take a toll
on its battery the mx4pro impresses us
in a lot of ways but the battery life
always leaves us wanting more we managed
to squeeze about three hours of screen
on time on average where most of the
other top spec devices these days are
giving us upwards of four or five hours
call quality sounded good in our testing
but another disappointment we faced was
the data performance since our unit
wasn't compatible with ATT's 4G network
instead falling back on 3G at the end of
the day the mx4pro offers a compelling
package that brings together a stunning
display great camera and speedy
performance at a good price you can
order one right now for less than four
hundred US dollars online but keep in
mind its network compatibility and make
sure that it works with your carrier
before you do if you order it you're
getting the best that meizu currently
has to offer and even though the
software has a bit of a learning curve
we have no problems recommending the
mx4pro
