has a lot of what the galaxy s 8 plus
has and what the SI plus doesn't have
from the s 9 plus isn't that much but
since phones aren't just about the spec
sheets we'll talk about three big things
instead I'm high metal got a front
pocket now with joules wrong on camera
from MWC 2018 in Barcelona and this
comparison is brought to you by
invisible shield
strolling down the screen right now are
all the things these two phones share
now plenty of these things started out
as these inspects for the si+ but they
aged cur endlessly why well
memory and power management among other
things have taken their toll on that
device we have no clue about how the
s-line plus will fare say six months
after the unboxing but what we hope will
happen comes down to the first
difference will talk about the internals
the snapdragon 835 and Exynos 88-90 have
been replaced by the brand-new qualcomm
snapdragon 845 or the Exynos 98 10
depending on your region both are coming
with artificial intelligence and machine
learning capabilities with the highest
clock speeds we've seen combine that
with 50% more RAM and we only hope that
there is more leeway to let this phone
run better for longer it's a better look
for Samsung and a better look for s9 +
owners over time and speaking of looks
the camera we're not talking about the
selfie camera that's the same as the
last time around the big story here is
the primary camera instead of just one
decent camera we've got two 12 megapixel
cameras and one of them has a
mechanically adjustable aperture for
even more flexibility in shooting bright
and dark scenes that should mean that
this is true auto mode which will be
capable of keeping noise down and reduce
blur as needed but really the most
important part of the full camera
experience is the last major difference
we'll talk about here the software we're
usually non-fans or proprietary software
if it doesn't add value but this is one
of those exceptions basically it's how
all these new services and features use
the camera and the internals to bring
the user things such as intelligent scan
by combining face and iris scanning
something awesome in my opinion
Bixby's new make a visualizer previewing
how you would look with concealer or
lipstick from suffer our cover girl and
you also have links to these even though
that's not the only service there are a
ton of options that Bixby can do or can
recognize automatically and then there's
super slo-mo when 960 frames per second
at 720p and seriously if you think
you're ok with 240 frames per second
trust me you need to give this a try
it's really cool they are emoji
because being a human emoji is the
hottest thing right now among those
other people that are using iPhone tens
that have to use animals for that all of
that is what the si+ doesn't have right
now and even if some of these things
come and software updates they're likely
to be a poorer experience overall again
because this phone hasn't really aged
well
but then again the question left on the
table is that the galaxy s 9 Plus will
do better aging and that's something we
can only respond in our full review
coming very soon we have a long road of
coverage coming very soon and the galaxy
has 9 plus is just part of it for now to
make sure you have a look at a word from
