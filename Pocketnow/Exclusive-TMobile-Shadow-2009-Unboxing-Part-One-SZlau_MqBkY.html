calm and we're about to unbox one of
this stuff the device is that many of
you have been anticipating this is the
shadow 2009 just take a quick look at
the box here some nice lettering and a
picture of the device on the back ok
let's open this up as usual on the left
side we have a getting started guide
some terms and conditions discs that
probably has activesync on it another
user manual tips and tricks
ah that ourselves a sim card okay here
we have the shadow 2009 let's continue
looking in the box and then we'll clear
all this away get our adapter here USB
cable headphones our cord and the case
cool all right let's get this out of the
way okay the case is just like the
standard shadow case it came with the
other ones except it has there's one
band on this end and on this other end
of the case the band is a little bit
further down to let the phone go in
there these headphones are your standard
HTC headphones that usually have one
earpieces longer than the other some
extra pads power cord pretty standard
USB cable and this adapter just the USB
plug with that 3.5 3.5 millimeter plug
2.5 millimeter plug and then a plug for
the headphones so you can connect it to
your audio adapter in your car or your
home stereo now for some size
comparisons here's the shadow 2009 next
to the 2008 shadow next to a dash a wing
and the g1 for a thickness comparison
see that seems to be a little it's about
just as thick as the g1 and a little bit
thicker seems couple millimeters maybe
two millimeters thicker than the shadow
2008 if you don't have any of those
laying around here it is next to some
soy sauce tangerine and a boot and that
concludes part one of this unboxing be
sure to check out part 2 until then Mike
Benton for all shadow com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
