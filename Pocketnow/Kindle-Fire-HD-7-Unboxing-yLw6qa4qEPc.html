pocket now calm you know Amazon kind of
invented the low-cost tablet when the
kindle fire first came out it was only
two hundred and forty nine bucks and in
a day when i pads were five hundred
bucks and galaxy tabs for four or five
hundred bucks the kindle fire was
totally breakthrough in revolutionary in
terms of the pricing model and then
barnes and noble came out with a
competitor at the same price and then
about a year later google came out with
an even lower price tablet the nexus 7
and only 199 dollars well not standing
still amazon has just released two new
kindle fires the first of which is out
now it's the kindle fire HD 7-inch it's
got very similar specs to the nexus 7
but it has double the capacity at the
same exact price points it's a totally
content centric device it's not open
android like you get on the Nexus 7 so
it's a bit limiting although the
development community is working on
having this guy so in this video we're
going to talk about the kindle fire as
it is now and this is our unboxing the
kindle fire HD 7-inch let's get to it
all right in the kindle fire HD 7 is
available for 199 bucks for the 16
gigabyte model or 249 bucks for the 32
gigabyte model and of course that's
double the capacity that you get in
comparison to the nexus 7 but of course
you kind of get less with the kindle
fire HD because you can only consume
amazon content amazon apps amazon prime
video content amazon kindle ebooks and
so forth so you may or may not like that
so here's the charger it uses micro USB
it's good to see standards used and
we've got the device here well then
we've got some information up at the top
getting to know your kindle okay well
i'm sure i can get to know it without
the instructions so here's the kindle
fire HD 7-inch definitely better
hardware than we got in the first
generation kindle fire we've got a
higher resolution screen 1280 by 800 the
same resolution that you get on the
Nexus 7 it's kind of HD it can play 720p
video but you'll get letterbox so here's
our device on the back got a nice
rubbery texture this guy has really
thick bezels and they do that because
this is a reading device immediate
consumption device amazon wants to make
sure that you're comfortable holding
this device for long periods of time so
you have something to grab on to without
accidentally pressing on the screen I've
got a front-facing camera here it's
meant to be used in landscape obviously
or else it would have been over here or
over here very thin device it feels a
lot like the nexus 7 actually probably a
little bit more high quality in hand
actually and a little bit thinner a
little bit heavier but definitely nice
to hold we've got dual stereo speakers
here amazon claims that it has room
filling sound although i doubt that
that's going to be possible from a
tablet but hey tablet speakers are
horrible so hopefully this is a step up
let's turn on the fire HD I look at this
power button it's completely flush with
it with a device which is kind of
annoying so we'll tap and hold and there
we go kindle fire here we go let's zoom
in and get a closer look
now one of the problems with the nexus 7
was the screen color saturation is
horrible on the Nexus 7 and apparently
the Kindle Fire fixes that it has much
better color saturation so in some ways
this is better than a nexus 7 but again
you can't forget that this is not stock
Android this is Amazon's version of
Android it's very limited and again the
the developer community might hack this
thing might get android jelly bean on it
and make it feel like a nexus 7 but that
has not happened yet all right so we're
gonna put in our password here okay and
we're connecting so this is dual band
Wi-Fi apparently has fantastic Wi-Fi
performance but to be honest other
tablets out there that we've used and
tested did not have bad Wi-Fi
performance so you know maybe they
improved upon something that didn't even
need to be improved upon so we're going
to set eastern time here it should be
registered to me one of the great things
that Amazon does is right out of the box
that's registered to your Amazon account
so you don't have to do anything I'm
going to get started now let's see what
we have we're going to see the familiar
kindle interface so this is sort of a
tutorial and i don't want to see you
tutorial i guess you have to go throw
don't you so let's get through this real
quick and close good okay so interesting
so here are my books already here ready
to go right off the bat which is
fantastic and of course here's all of
the content that you can consume again
this thing is really meant to be used in
landscape very smooth performance here
moves quite quickly the original kinder
fire had really bad performance so so
far so good I kind of want to go into
the web browser because they're still
using the silk amazon silk which is
basically server-side rendering so i'm
going to go to see let's go to facebook
real quick we're gonna go to pocket now
actually and see how web browsing
performance here we're running on a
dual-core processor with a gigabyte of
ram of course the the Nexus 7 has a
quad-core processor let's see how web
browsing performances
causing performance on the original
kinder fire was literally the worst
experience on a tablet that I have ever
had and so far the screen looks great by
the way this is how Amazon sets up their
experience on Android they've got these
buttons along the side which I think
sort of hide away or eventually I guess
that you can do full screen browsing
here and they hide away when you get a
little tab here you see you can kind of
drag out that information so let's move
around on the screen yeah you know
you're not going to be buying this
device for web browsing performance
although maybe that was just a temporary
stutter let's zoom in pretty good zoom
out quickly actually I'm actually sort
of impressed let's see how it does a
flash content we've got a video here the
first load seemed kind of slow there but
let's see how things go once we give it
a chance I never found silk to be faster
than anything else really it just seemed
to be sort of a buzz word see how I'll
flash content loads it looks YouTube
videos just fine you gotta press play
again ok now we're going fullscreen ok
zoom in camera hi
well for dual band Wi-Fi this is taking
a long time so it's a load of a simple
flash or YouTube video alright that's a
little too long for me so we're going to
back out and we're going to talk a lot
about the kindle fire HD we're going to
watch the development community closely
cuz if you can run jelly bean on this
thing then yeah it's it's a no-brainer
you get this instead of the nexus 7
although it's possible the Nexus 7 has
better web browsing performance because
it's got a quad Ford quad-core Tegra 3
we'll have to see very interesting
device so far the hardware huge steps up
from what you got in the original kinder
kindle fire and it's only 199 bucks
we'll have more on this coming soon if
you left this video please give us a
thumbs up and thanks for watching and
just a real quick programming note on
