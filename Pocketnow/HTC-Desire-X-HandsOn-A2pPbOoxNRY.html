i'm here at Aoife in berlin at the HTC
booth checking out the new HTC desire x
is the same device this is the this is
the black one this is the white one here
two different colors pronounced camera
bezel the real story on this one I'm
going to shift to the white one because
I happen to like that one better doing a
hog more than one unit the real story on
the white one here which you can see
next to the HTC One X it's a much much
smaller unit but it preserves HTC's
design language and moves it forward a
little bit as you can see the pronounced
bezel has been extended even further on
this unit HTC brandings about the same
size but the unit is only about four
fifth the size feels really really nice
in the hand as you can see they've added
this brushed metal bezel to the existing
hardware when you fire it up on the
software side there's center mounted
power standby button as well which we
saw on the photon recently
as you can see we're running Android 404
with HTC sense for dot one on top of
that overall pretty much as responsive
as as sense gets in my limited
experience with the device here good
looking screen we've got a 1 gigahertz
dual-core processor under there the
screen itself is four inches across
super lcd2 and obviously there is the
Beats Audio integration here otherwise
not a whole lot different from the one
series on the software side but
definitely the real story here on this
beautiful little hardware maybe a
mid-range device but I gotta tell you it
feels so amazing to hold and the build
quality is really taking my breath away
so once again the HTC desire x hopefully
we're gonna have a lot more on this I
really want to get my hands on one maybe
that's just me but stay tuned I don't
think it is because there's been a big
crowd here all morning once again
Michael with pocketnow.com going to keep
on checking out what what else we've got
here and Aoife and stay tuned thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
