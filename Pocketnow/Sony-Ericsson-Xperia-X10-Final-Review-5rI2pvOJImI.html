now calm you've seen us put the xperia
x10 from sony ericsson through its paces
and now it's time to give you the final
review so let's get started first off
moving right into some of the pros of
the device the hardware is extremely
solid it is built like a tank the back
piece is actually coated in a soft touch
paint which gives it a great grip as
well as comfortable feel before in
screen offers plenty of real estate when
navigating through the menu system as
well as using some of the applications
such as tweet casts only kept things
consistent here by using the micro USB
port which is a great thing because
every Android device or most of the
Android devices currently are using this
port what that means is any spare AC
adapters you may have any spare USB
cords battery packs that have a USB cord
coming off of it will be compatible with
the Xperia x10 and that's always nice to
save some money the camera quality on
the Xperia x10 is actually superb it is
an 8.1 megapixel camera and typically
Sony Ericsson's devices take very good
pictures and this is no exception the
pictures are very good as you'll see
some examples in our final post keeping
on the camera note the fact that this
device implements a dedicated camera
button makes life much easier it is a
lot easier and faster minds you to pull
the phone out of your pocket very
quickly and hold down the dedicated
camera button to actually bring up the
camera when you want to have a picture
very quickly let's say you see something
that you want to show to all your
friends and it happens and you know in a
blink of an eye you can do that with
this the other thing is typically with
phones like the iPhone or the other
Android devices that do not have a
dedicated camera button you have to
actually touch the screen in order to
take the picture what happens is when
you do that a lot of the times you'll
actually shake the phone and lose focus
but by having this here you can hold the
phone very sturdy and very steady mind
you and pressed on that button and now
you can take a picture and lastly this
is a kind of general overall pro as many
know the selection of Android devices on
the 18-team network is not the greatest
therefore any edition is very welcome
this device is an addition therefore it
is very welcome now it's time to talk
about some of the negatives of the
device
or what needs work and the first we're
going to touch on is actually the
battery is a 1500 milliamp hour battery
and sony rates it at being able to get
up to eight hours of talk time however
we found that was not the case we were
just barely able to make it through a
full day with very light use and what
that means is the phone was only used to
send a few text messages a few emails
maybe browse to one website zero phone
calls so that's very very light use if
you're going to be making a lot of phone
calls on this playing games browsing the
market composing a lot of emails
browsing the web you're going to find
the battery life to be pretty abysmal
that may be specific to just our device
here in that case we hope it is but off
the wait see another issue we found was
also having to do with the camera while
the picture quality was superb the video
quality was not video clips were very
choppy very grainy overall had bad sound
and just really didn't seem to impress
especially when the picture quality was
as good as it was well the timescape and
media scape apps are a great idea we
found that they often could not connect
to our networks we constantly were
getting errors that I cannot connect to
the Twitter network as well as the
Facebook network to receive the updates
while browsing through one aggregated
central feed for all of our social
networks is a great idea in theory it
works great and actually while was
working it works great fact we weren't
able to keep up to date because it was
not able to refresh really kind of
cripples the service so if Sony can put
some work into these applications and
make sure they do connect every time it
can definitely be great to use lastly we
had some major problems with our screen
now this may be just a local issue but
the calibration of the screen quality
did not seem to be fully there typing on
the screen long length text messages was
extremely frustrating and took five or
ten minutes for a simple small email
that is because it was not accurate when
typing on the keyboard this may be
something that can be corrected in a
future software update sony has
commented that they will be releasing
android 2.1 over the 1.6 that is
currently available so we're hopeful
that will actually be bundled in that
update will have to wait and overall the
Xperia x10 from sony ericsson is a good
device as we said any addition to the 18
teen network in terms of the android
selection is very
welcome and this does bring Android to
you unfortunately it's only going to be
android 1.6 and we had those screen
issues also with 140 $99 price point you
can spend fifty dollars more and get a
great device like the samsung captivate
so that's something that definitely keep
in mind if you're a newbie to the
android operating system however you
won't be let down with this device it is
definitely a great entry to mid-level
Android device and is a major player in
that market as always thank you very
much for watching everyone be sure to
read our full review right on this page
or on pocketnow.com to get all the full
juicy details in which we weren't able
to talk about on video please give us a
thumbs up thanks for commenting and
we'll see you again soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
