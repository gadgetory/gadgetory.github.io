we've thrown that word around quite a
bit but what is it why is it there what
does it do why is it so difficult to
unlock that's what we're going to talk
about today on the very first episode of
Android power user whoa whoa whoa
Android power user what's that isn't
this supposed to be the Android guy
weakly so the evolution of that let me
tell you why we're changing things up
just a little bit okay we're changing
things up a lot but what we're doing is
we're taking what was originally kind of
an editorial with some technical roots
that a lot of you have told us was a
little bit long-winded and I'll be the
first to agree and we're turning it into
something that's going to take regular
Android users and turn them into Android
power users so where does that leave all
of you power users already well this is
going to help us get back to our roots
and establish a firm foundation teach us
a lot about stuff that we may know a
little bit about but a lot of detail
about what's there why it's there why we
have it and what we can do to get around
it at least in the case of today's video
so today's topic is what is the
bootloader before we talk about that
we've got to talk about what is booting
it's an unusual word booting in a
computer we use it every day but what
does it mean and where did it come from
well when you are getting up to do a job
whether that's in the military whether
that's a private contractor whether
that's at a desk you know like me one of
the first things you do after you get
dressed is you put your boots on that's
where the term bootstrapping comes from
bootstrapping helps you put your boots
on faster you put straps on your boots
you can pull them up quicker so when
you're booting up that means you're
putting your boots on you're getting
ready to go to work that's what that
term comes from so now that we've got
that out of the way what's the
bootloader well the bootloader is code
that runs really before any operating
system loads its purpose is essentially
like your brain telling you how to put
your boots on once you get your boots on
then
go out and build a bridge or dig a hole
or put up a fence or launch a rocket to
Mars all of those things are different
their operating system things that your
brain does but first and foremost you
got to put your boots on and you got to
load that up you got it hit the ground
and go to work that's what the boot
loader does you can have a boot loader
that boots up Android you could have a
boot loader that boots up Windows Phone
you can have a boot loader that boots up
iOS or Windows or Linux or any one of
those they all do kind of the same job
but in different ways but they all have
to start with that boot loader so it's
custom code it sits there and
essentially just waits for a kernel and
waits for an operating system so it can
boot right up and get to work boot
loaders are very Hardware specific in
fact every smartphone that you have out
there and retablos
even every desktop and laptop computer
they're all going to have different boot
loaders they're specific to the board
that they're running on that's one
reason why there's no two ways to unlock
a boot loader that's exactly the same
because all the boot loaders are
different now you're thinking wait a
minute Android is open-source I should
be able to get in there and do that
really fast really easy right androids
open-source boot loaders aren't they're
proprietary to the manufacturer that
makes the device that gets us to our
next question why our bootloader is
locked
it's a good question very frustrating
question luckily we've got really smart
members in the community who can unlock
boot loaders very quickly sometimes we
get stumbling blocks but why are they
locked in the first place well it comes
down to a couple reasons
first of all you've got carriers
carriers want to limit you to what they
tell you you can do they've done all
this demographics they've studied all
this stuff they know what's best for you
at least that's what they think they
also know they've only got a certain
amount of bandwidth on their networks so
they can't let you do everything because
then you could gobble up all of their
bandwidth and that would hurt everybody
from a manufacturer standpoint they
might lock their bootloader because they
don't
want you getting in there and messing
with it now why wouldn't they want you
doing that well they're the ones who
have to warranty these things and if you
break your device after you've had it
two days it's going to cost them money
to fix it for you now luckily they're
going to be able to say you unlock your
bootloader and did something to it and
broke it so that's not covered by
warranty but they still don't even want
the call because the call takes money
and of course that makes you frustrated
and upset you're going to tell the
Twitterverse about how terrible
manufacturer XYZ is because their phone
doesn't work anymore and you're just
going to leave out the fact that you
were trying to unlock the bootloader and
bricked it so they don't want the
negative press either so why would
someone want to unlock their bootloader
well very simply people want to be able
to do stuff with their phones that they
might not be able to and when I say
phones
I mean tablets as well you want to do
stuff maybe you want to overclock great
you've got to unlock your bootloader
probably throw on a custom kernel maybe
you want to run a custom ROM like
CyanogenMod or a okp great you got to
unlock your bootloader flash custom rom
you just got to do it maybe all you want
to do is run some apps that aren't
available on your phone Wow okay unlock
your bootloader and install them you
don't always have to do it for custom
apps but sometimes you do case in point
you want to be able to run apps that
require root permissions to get root
generally speaking you got to unlock
your bootloader and say it with me
flash your custom ROM or unlock your
bootloader and unlock access to root
install all the stuff that you need for
root that's something else we'll talk
about that in an upcoming video but
there are lots and lots of reasons you
want to tether on your device but you
don't have a tethering app on your
device
great unlock your bootloader and go
ahead and do it you want to run Google
Wallet before it was available
everywhere great unlock your bootloader
and flash that Google Wallet apk onto
your device and brick your secure
element like I did in the past but
that's a risk that you take when you're
unlocking your bootloader
and that's why it's locked so that's a
just a very quick overview about why we
have bootloaders what it is so we've got
two things to talk about in our comments
today
first thing is boot loaders questions
comments why do you unlock your
bootloader why why do you leave it
locked what do you want to do to to make
you have to unlock it and what are some
reasons why you might not ever want to
unlock it let us know down in the
comments just write down below okay go
ahead and do that of course this is
where I'm going to put in the plug if
you liked the video give it a big thumbs
up tell your friends about it the second
part of the comments this is our first
Android power user episode it's still in
its infancy and it's still growing and
developing we want to know what you want
out of this okay we've kind of evolved
from the editorial flavor of the Android
guy weekly and we were moving more and
more towards educational topics as we
were going and really found out you know
this is this is something that deserves
a different format a different show
that's why we're here we're going to do
a lot tighter coupling of the video with
the article over at pocketnow.com so
make sure you head over to the article
itself the link is going to be right
down there if you're watching this on
youtube it's right there okay click on
that go to pocket now and you can get
details that aren't in the video over at
pocketnow.com
you can also kind of talk about that in
the conversation over there in the the
comments on that article as well but we
want to know today what do you think of
the new format how do you want it to
change we're going to try and keep these
relatively short with more detail over
at the article so you want to go over
there and get that let us know what you
think and how you like it
good alright for PocketNow and the
android power user weekly I'm Joe Levi
and thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
