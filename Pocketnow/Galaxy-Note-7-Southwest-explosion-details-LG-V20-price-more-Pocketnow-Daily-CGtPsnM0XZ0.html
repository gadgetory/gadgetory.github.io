with a recent Southwest incident and
even couriers not wanting to carry it
details on pricing and availability of
the lgb 20 in the US emerged and does
anybody have enough cash to snatch up
Twitter once and for all I'm high Meadow
iveta and bear in mind i just replaced
my galaxy note 7 yesterday does this
mean that i could still play GTA 5 with
it this is fargin out daily official
news today don't begin with deals but
they might as well be the pedal to and
the pebble to standard edition are
currently on pre-order and the price
tags are crazy for the pebble to
standard edition you pay ninety nine
dollars and then if you go for the heart
rate monitor fro blown version that's
129 that is a crazy price tag and the
pebble continues to be one of our
favorite smartwatches ever i highly
recommend you give it a try another
device that became official in price tag
in the united states is the lgb 20
t-mobile announced it then provide a
price but then AT&amp;amp;T did and here this
we're talking about thirty-five dollars
a month on installment plans and if you
do the math that's eight hundred and
thirty bucks after the period is done
meaning you pretty much paying the same
amount of money that you would pay for a
128 gigabyte iphone 7 plus an
installment plans whether that is worth
it or not is hard to tell our
pre-production units that we currently
have that perform great i really like
the phone i think it's a little
expensive but then again wait for our
full review we're still waiting for
final units to be able to provide you
that and for those of you that have a
little cash extra twitter has just
poised itself for auction because the
company has tried to regain
profitability for the longest time it
just hasn't i keep telling everyone that
the 140 characters is really what's
killing it for twitter but the company
has been reluctant to change and
apparently we will learn who the buyer
is on October 27 that's going to be
rather interesting as we did here that
company like Google pretty much turned
down the offer over something that's
kind of weird we'll keep you posted now
speaking of acquisitions a very
interesting one comes from Samsung the
company
just acquired a company called viv which
is famous or sort of newly famous for
artificial intelligence now for those of
you that say what is viv it's actually
founded by the same guys that built Siri
and given the fact that Google is
pushing its assistant given the fact
that Syria has become more robust with
iOS 10 it seems that Samsung finally
wants to fix s voice we can't wait for
that one and finally for the explosive
news of the day right now the samsung
galaxy note 7 is clearly on fire a
replaced unit recently caused problems
in a southwest flight and exploded
people had to be evacuated and according
to the user this was a replacement unit
at hand the green battery icon and he
had trouble and this is extremely sad we
hear that the CPSC is investigating
Samsung has not want that pronounced
itself until the investigation is done
we even hear that the Royal Mail in the
UK is not accepting galaxy note 7 units
for shipment this is really dramatic i
don't feel just for the galaxy note 7 I
worry about the whole smartphone
industry in general mainly because of
whatever can be caused by batteries and
the fact that battery technology hasn't
really evolved much in the Yi in years
actually but anyways it leads me to the
question of the day with all this drama
are you still getting a galaxy note 7 or
is this enough to move you away in my
case I was really happy yesterday when I
got my phone but I'm powering it down
