over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it
let's dive in for another look at a
smartphone I like to call the big deal
I'm Michael Fisher with pocket now this
is the Moto X pure edition and this is
episode 54 of after the buzz there's a
lot about the Moto X that's just the
same as it was four months ago for one
the price hasn't come down it still
ranges from 399 to 525 depending on what
features and materials you choose and
the array of color and finish
combinations is still broader than
anything the competition's offering the
specs are still competitive the screen
size is still on the high side and the
74 minute charge time from empty to full
is still awesome now in some ways the
hardware aesthetic has come to feel a
little dated with newer phones still
chasing distinctions like thinnest and
sleekest the Moto X is more than ever a
chunky meatball of a phone but I really
like it and I hope that Motorola sorry
Lenovo continues this design direction
the Moto X rests very well in a palm
it's easy to hold when you're on a call
it looks different without trying too
hard and it just feels great and if you
want to go super fancy with it there are
leather and wood options and even some
custom trims from designer Jonathan
Adler given those choices does the world
really need another super slim all-metal
phone with chamfered edges
if you opt for the more conservative
silicone backing option the news is good
it holds up well to constant use this
particular unit has been my daily driver
since September and despite that the
ribbed rubber backing is almost like new
the phone's interior waterproofing is
also fared well even though I use the
phone as a Spotify boombox with
dishwashing the speakers are still
louder than any other phone I've used
recently the pure edition has benefited
from some software bumps - it got
Android 6.0 a little later than we were
expecting but still ahead of most phones
despite early fears that the update
would somehow neuter the Moto software
suite it didn't the phone can still do
all the fancy stuff it could before
except Android has just weaved in some
features that Motorola pioneered the
update also fixed some problems with the
previous lollipop build that the phone
tends to run a little cooler now on the
Snapdragon 808 and the performance lag
when shooting 4k video is much less
severe speaking of the camera that
front-facing flash has come in handy
more often than I ever would have
expected it still doesn't work with
snapchat but that's not the phone's
fault
from outdoor selfies at night to group
shots and mood lighting that little LED
has won me over as for the primary
camera it's just as reliable in daylight
and just as mediocre in low-light it's
just as slow scanning business cards and
barcodes but the fact that it does so
automatically is still just as
impressive in short the cameras up sides
still outweigh its negatives just as we
said four months ago elsewhere the phone
has aged inconsistently marshmallow may
have helped a little with the phone's
battery life but it still doesn't last
as long as it should with its large
power pack it also hasn't made the phone
as smooth or as snappy as say the Nexus
6p though admittedly I didn't do a
factory wipe and reset with the update
which might have helped both issues also
for months comparing this screen with
the competition only reinforces my
belief that Motorola should have stuck
with AMOLED
active display just isn't the same on
LCD and colors sometimes seem muted on
this panel one thing actually surprised
me though
given how common fingerprint scanners
have become I expect it to chafe at the
lack of one here but I didn't mind
because I use my SmartWatch as a trusted
device your mileage may vary how well
the Moto X pure edition is aged has a
lot to do with developments beyond the
device itself
Motorola's reputation for long-term
support has suffered with the
announcement that US carrier versions of
last year's Moto X won't get a
marshmallow update while the newer Moto
X should fare far better given its
unlocked nature that's still concerning
also the past few months have brought us
some tough competition for your dollar
the excellent Nexus 6p is just a hundred
bucks more than the Moto X while the
beautiful oneplus X comes in a hundred
and fifty bucks cheaper albeit with some
big sacrifices the Nexus 5x it doesn't
look or feel as good as either of those
but at $2.99 it will certainly factor
into your buying decision Android phones
are only getting more affordable I guess
is the point making it harder for the
Moto X to stand out
but for now my recommendation for the
motox stands in fact I bought one for a
family member this past Christmas no
other Android gives you such a
well-balanced feature set offered in so
many hardware trims for such a
competitive price and no other Android
feels quite like a moto the Moto X pure
Edition is still a big deal folks our
original review is still up at
