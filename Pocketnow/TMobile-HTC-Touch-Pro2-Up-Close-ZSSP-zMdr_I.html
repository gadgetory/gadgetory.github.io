and today we are taking a look at the
touch pro 2 first let's unbox it
now let's compare it to a few other
devices that you may be familiar with
okay here we have a dash the original
dash the winged shadow g1 um a shadow
dash 3g and the mytouch 3g i also have a
dry erase marker a three by five card
and an army guy doctor what is
noticeable about these comparisons is
that the touch pro 2 is larger than all
the other devices and heavier in fact it
weighs one hundred and eighty eight
grams or just over point four pounds
it's a lot of weight so let's go in for
a close-up and analyze what we can some
quick specs the touch pro 2 has a 528
megahertz processor GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi
and accelerometer 3.2 megapixel camera
and more but for now we're just going
over the surface first off the 480 x 800
pixel screen is beautiful picture show
up crisp just like this should the
touchflo interface is a welcome addition
while we wait for windows mobile to
catch up in digital ergonomics class
without going into too much detail there
are different tabs in the touchflo user
interface for just about all the
functions you are accustomed using on
the phone you can flick your way across
tap on tabs or use the slider bar back
to the hardware one feature missing from
the touch pro 2 is a directional pad of
any kind while it does present a
smoother appearance and allow for more
screen real estate I'm still hesitant to
call this change good the four buttons
on the front are your usual fare the
send key home key back key and end key
if you hold down the send key it will
open up voice command holding down the
home key and back key doesn't do
anything I am holding down the end key
will lock the phone the Ascend key is
configurable for opening any program and
the back key is also configurable but
only for a few functions also worth
mentioning is this zoom slide
the left side of the phone holds this
holds the volume buttons and the microSD
slot so that'll hold an sdhc card and
right now the 16 gigabyte cards are the
biggest ones on the market and soon
we'll be looking at 32 gigabytes the top
holds the power button holding this down
will turn the phone on and off pressing
it quickly will turn the screen on and
off the right side has the soft reset
button and a microphone and the bottom
has the proprietary mini USB port oh and
the wonderful stylus on the back side is
the mysterious mute button actually it's
really not that mysterious while you're
in the middle of a call if you place the
phone facedown it will instantly turn
into a high-quality speakerphone this
mute button will mute your voice or any
other sounds in the room so the other
caller can't hear it I like this feature
but what I don't like about it is
there's no indicator like telling me
that the call is being muted so if the
turn it back over to see if it is right
next to that is the 3.2 megapixel camera
the touch pro 2 is capable of recording
video apparently it records vga at 15
frames per second on to the keyboard the
slide mechanism feels smooth and solid
including the closed position the screen
has two other positions the open and the
tilt while in the open position you have
access to all the well spaced and
tactile keys in the tilt position the
screen blocks some of the upper row so a
little bit more difficult to get to one
thing worth mentioning is the placement
of the power button while holding the
phone and typing away you might
accidentally hit it and turn the screen
off also worth mentioning is the volume
keys on the bottom so you could actually
accidentally hit those and then be tied
up with this volume screen which has a
very
long delay for timing out the full
qwerty keyboard is large enough with
enough space between the keys to
actually get some work done so it's not
that hard to actually type on this and
it didn't take long to get used to as I
mentioned before the touch pro 2 has
some heft to it giving it a rich feel
the design is geared towards the
professional business person with a
serious need for some options the color
scheme is refined and you won't be
hesitant to pull this phone out at a
meeting and put it on the conference
table you know what it just might get
you promoted so overall the touch pro 2
exudes class this is the phone many
t-mobile customers have been waiting for
as we near the end of this video i just
want to mention that this isn't a
complete review and there is more to
come in future videos so stay tuned in
order to make a well-informed decision
on if the touch pro 2 is worth its cost
