note 3 event the HTC One max gets
finally leaked in photos and believe it
or not the Obama administration has
vetoed the iphone 4 ban I'm hi Mary vera
and starting today I'm going to shave my
beer every Monday as a form of complaint
against humanity this is out
daily let's start the day off with the
cool news as Samsung has begun
distributing press invitations for their
unpacked event to happen at Aoife and
Berlin set your calendars for September
fourth as we are getting the Galaxy Note
3 at this event as I've gotten every
previous galaxy note of the past couple
of years in Berlin now obviously there
is a lot of speculation on the table
here and we haven't really seen much of
this phone just yet so stay tuned our
own Anton d Nagy will be at the event
covering everything like for you now
speaking of phablets another device
that's being announced that Aoife in
berlin most probably is the HTC One max
and we finally get the first league
photograph of this device though it's
kind of hard to tell it apart because it
looks exactly like an HTC one only
bigger obviously there are some leaked
specs as well snapdragon 800 processor
and this time cantore 5.9 inch display
so let's see how these two devices stack
up at Aoife speaking of links we've got
the user manual at the LG g2 and we
learned two things first of all this
device brings a nano-sim so buyers and
Qatar on ebay and second of all this
device will apparently not bring a
fingerprint scanner which was leaked
recently or it could be that this is
just for one of the variants but anyways
our Michael Fisher will be at the event
on Wednesday August seventh at 11am
eastern time he's going to have a lot of
hands-on videos and you've been will
have a lot of live coverage so stay
tuned now let's move away from the
rumors and finally talk about the
official announcement Spotify has just
brought this new feature called browse
which is actually a curated playlists
feature meaning if you're in the mood
for slow music or if you're in the mood
for cruising your vehicle you've got a
playlist for that or if you want a
specific genre they'll give you curated
playlists of everything that you're
thinking about this will gradually be
launched for iOS and Android we don't
have any specific dates and we don't
know when it's reaching Windows Phone
but we'll keep you posted
and finally for the mixed bag news of
the day you remember that the ITC I
decided to ban the iphone 4 and iPad 2
because they infringed on a samsung
patent well as it turns out the Obama
administration has decided to veto the
sentence and Apple can continue
importing the iphone or an ipad 2 for
sales which is kind of sad because
Samsung is also confirmed that Apple is
not willing to license the pen that
they've already been sentenced to
infringe any way so that leads you to
the question of the day what do you
think about this veto from the Obama
administration in favor of a US company
this is the first time any
administration has done this since 1987
so it's kind of odd and in my particular
case honestly I do understand the United
States protecting a US company it makes
sense but then again why do they have
this patent system in the first place
and second why didn't they beat all that
sentence from you know that infringement
of so many pens from Samsung when Apple
had sued them leave us a comment down
below what do you think of course as
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and South moment you follow
us on pocketnow.com n subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well you'd also
follow me on Twitter and Heidi
underscore Rivera please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am hi Mary Vera thank you very much for
watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
