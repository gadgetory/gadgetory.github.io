attention-getting tablet launch but the
company hasn't forgotten its smartphone
nor the two part construction that makes
it so uniquely customizable I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow here with a quick
look at yola's other half the other half
was always meant to be more than just a
snap-on case but when we took our first
look at the Yolo smartphone a little
over a year ago that's basically all it
was you could buy another half in a
different color and the software would
automatically adjust its colors to match
when you snapped it on but that was
about it in the time since yola's
community has been busy a hardware
developer called funky other half showed
me a number of takes on the concept here
at MWC from the useful to the just plain
fun in the latter category a panel full
of LEDs that either react to ambient
background noise or strobe randomly
reminiscent of the flashing phone cases
of years past on the professional geek
side of the spectrum is the breadboard
setup
allowing you to plug Arduino components
directly into the phone to be controlled
by a custom app on the sailfish OS then
there's the jumper switch box which lets
you trigger any of a series of custom
scripts just by flipping a switch on a
more accessible note how about a solar
charging other half it's not the
prettiest thing in the world and it may
only give you about 3% per hour in the
Sun but hey it's solar power for your
smartphone and then of course there's
the sort of holy grail of Yola other
half development the keyboard attachment
this kickstarter-funded accessory is a
two parter actually a backlit keyboard
which attaches magnetically to a custom
backplate it comes in multiple colors
trims and finishes and passes data
through the pogo pins on the back of the
phone the idea is that it connects for
the first time downloads its drivers
automatically and is ready to work with
no software mucking necessary bring it
along when you need it leave it at home
when you don't it's not final Hardware
none of this is but as a demonstration
of yola's extensibility it's very
effective as a community-developed
accessory it's also a validation of
yola's people-powered motto and a
testament to the power of the open
platform
