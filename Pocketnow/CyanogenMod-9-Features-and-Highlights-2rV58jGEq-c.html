most of you know that my favorite custom
ROM is CyanogenMod ROM they've been
working for quite a while on cm9 which
is the Ice Cream Sandwich version of
their ROM it's almost done and I'd like
to show you what they've got in it let's
go take a look so this is my GSM Galaxy
Nexus I'm running one of the early June
Knightley's on it this is a lock screen
and you can tell up here at the top I've
got my basic information the date and
time I'm also running kind of low on
battery down here so it wants me to
connect my charger I've got a weather
widget installed and that weather widget
lets me welp see what the weather is
going to be like some people have
complained that the the weather provider
that CyanogenMod is using right now
doesn't have enough coverage especially
for their area but it's a start I've
also got the calendar widget loaded up
and I'll show you where you can do that
too it's showing me my next appointment
and then down at the bottom is my ring
unlocker which lets me drag this either
to unlock or to quick launch one of the
applications that i've pre-configured
let's go ahead and unlock now this takes
me to my face unlock and there's the
camera it's not gonna open that up so
we'll come over here and unlock this and
there's my home screen just like you
would expect now there are some things
that you'll notice here that are
different first of all these are this
text to the top it's green it's not blue
like ice cream sandwiches that's because
we finally have support for themes with
CyanogenMod 9 next you'll notice down at
the bottom I got this nice little search
button it's back again thanks to
CyanogenMod 9 as we scroll across you'll
notice see that nice little animation
there it's not just going side to side
it's kind of rotating in that also is
part of CyanogenMod but more
particularly it's part of the trebuchet
launcher which we showed you earlier
we'll have a link at the end of the
video if you want to go back and see our
thoughts on trebuchet and what it can do
we've got the same tilt up there but now
you can see it's got a nice green
instead of blue again CyanogenMod
so let's dig right into the settings the
first thing you're gonna notice just by
pulling down the shade here is I've got
all of these toggles at the top some
roms include that and when I say some
roms I mean usually that's third-party
stuff you'll see that on especially HTC
and Samsung devices stock doesn't
usually have this stuff up at the top
but I can quickly turn my Wi-Fi on or
off Bluetooth on or off etc and I can
customize these how do we do that we go
into settings so I'm here at the setting
everything looks pretty much the same
until we get down in here to interface
now launcher we showed you again in the
trebuchet video I'll have a link to that
at the end of this video so you can go
back and check that out we won't talk
too much about it here let's look at the
lock screen settings here we can change
our screen security the owner in phone
you saw kind of up at the top of that my
owner info scrolling across weather
calendar and slider shortcuts so let's
look at each one of those really quickly
screen security I'm using face unlock I
can improve face matching now this you
notice looks pretty much like you're
used to with your traditional typical
screen security and it is except for
this show widgets before unlock that's
kind of added in owner information is a
good place where you can go in and put
in your owner information I like to put
an email address and even an in case of
emergency contact in their weather you
can see it's enabled I can choose to
display weather and again this is using
Yahoo weather there is no option to
change it to a cue weather or Google
weather or what not at least not yet how
often do you want it to update I've got
it set to update every hour I can use a
custom location just in case geolocation
doesn't work or if I want to you know
force it someplace else other than where
I am now you can use metrics show
location show time stamp invert the high
and low temperatures all that fun stuff
and it's right there on your lock screen
so you don't have to launch into the
device to be able to get to it calendar
if you want to be able to show your next
event you can choose what calendars you
want to display you will want to check
that because I believe it
comes default to know calendars so you
won't see anything at all even if that's
turned on unless you go in and select
some calendars it's only gonna look
ahead one day you can select that to
look ahead of three days or a week or
just a few hours if you want it can show
events with reminders only the location
or the description or any combination of
those really kind of cool again right
there as soon as you pull out your phone
and turn it on you don't even have to
unlock it you know everything you need
to about your upcoming day and then
slider shortcuts now this is the nice
little ring unlock and the way this
works is kind of cool you can for
example will reset that back to default
and now you'll notice I have nothing
except luck and camera so what I like to
do is let's come over here and do that
and we can change this based on any of
these this is just setting the icon go
ahead and cancel out of that let's set
another one I use Waze a lot so let's go
ahead and change this over here two ways
then I accidentally tapped on the screen
sorry about that again we'll go back in
here right now it's empty
we'll choose applications that's gonna
bring up our app list does take a little
bit of time there is some lag here a lot
of lag here there we go and we scroll
all the way down to double use just
where Waze is we choose that I like the
icon if you don't like the icon you can
tap on the icon side just like that I'm
gonna say okay and now there you go I've
got a Waze sort cut you can keep adding
stuff hit save down there to save it and
you're good to go so the next time I'm
gonna have these three icons lock camera
and ways very cool move back in here
let's look at themes now themes we know
about from CyanogenMod 7 this is
essentially the same theme engine and
you can go out to the market the Play
Store and
grab anything that's a cm9 theme search
for that and you're pretty good now
anything that you find in there is
probably going to work just fine I've
got these holo themes which work really
well I like green it's very close to the
Android Ian theme that we had before got
an orange a purple a red and then the
Stockland which is your regular blue to
apply it all you got to do is hit apply
switches that over to the selected theme
and there you go now everything is in
that theme it's more a color set than
anything but there are some other things
that you can do with it and we're gonna
see more coming so just very basic but
very cool and finally included in the
latest Knightley's if we look at system
we can come in here and change the
status bar we can show the clock or not
show the clock we can change the battery
style to an icon or what I had an app
was just a percentage you can even hide
it you can change your signal status
I've got an icon and change it to text
which again this is still a work in
progress so occasionally you're gonna
notice some stuff like that and I've
been using this phone for ridiculously
long now you can see my signal strength
as well as a little icon in there as
well so really kind of cool and then of
course you can hide it if you don't care
about what that signal strength is and
then brightness control allow adjusting
the brightness by sliding across the
status bar let's go ahead and leave that
on and see what we do where ever it
where is the status bar it's up at the
top I still haven't figured out how to
get that one to work guys help me out
here leave me some comments okay
tell me how to use that because I didn't
see any difference there anyway let's
get back in here notification drawer now
this is that thing right there some of
us call it the notification shade you
can show the power widget the hide on
change yada yada yada so all of this
stuff the power widget is that thing up
at the top it's not about power per se
it's about you know it's a widget that's
powerful so now I've got all of my stuff
up there I can show it I can hide on
chain
so if I toggle something let's turn
bluetooth off it closes the drawer if I
want to hide the indicator I can do that
okay if I want to hide the scroll bar if
I've got so many of these there's a
scroll bar I can hide that scroll bar if
I want I like not having a scroll bar so
I don't really care about that enable
haptic feedback if you want to feel
something when you press on it you can
either let it use the global settings or
turn it on all the time or off all the
time I've got mine set on because I like
that tactile feedback widget buttons
these other buttons that you can choose
to put in there it's still a LED
flashlight yet they have a placeholder
for it but it's still kind of a work in
progress and then a bunch of other stuff
that you can add or remove it's up to
you ironically I can toggle WiMAX my
phone doesn't have wine egg so maybe
that's something they want to consider
only putting into specific roms but
anyway brightness modes network mode
screen timeout modes lots of modes cool
stuff that you can do and then of course
the flash mode you can either choose hi
or death ray this is grayed out right
now but you know it's cool that we have
a death ray built into cm9 just means a
really bright flash okay so that's about
it we can change the order of the
buttons very simply just by you know
moving it up and down grabbing on to it
just like that I like it in that order
so I'm gonna leave it there let's go
back here we've talked just about
everything on this I believe except the
navigation bar so we'll go ahead and do
that in just a second here
wallpaper that's just another place you
can get a wallpaper and cm9 does come
with some new wallpapers and some of the
ones that you're accustomed to with
previous builds can change the font size
to small all the way up to huge I've got
mine set at normal and then the
navigation bar that's this guy down at
the bottom go ahead and open that and
right now it's locked
I can unlock that and then make changes
now you'll notice I've got some stuff on
either side that I can do so really kind
of cool I can come in here and make some
changes let's revert back to default so
you can see so I've got the three
buttons so that's great now I've
unlocked it I can now add something
let's add the search button
and just like that we've now added a
search button to our status bar so
really really cool to keep going back
and see what else we have in here we
have advanced the inside advanced we
have this stuff I'm gonna go ahead and
change this quite a bit so if you saw
that I just changed the whole color
scheme here to defaults now let me show
you why I did that
this is what you're gonna get right
out-of-the-box not only out of the box
with a CyanogenMod ROM but also out of
the box with your own ROM so let's go
into our color multipliers tuning and
everything set to one let's do this
cm setting just tap that it kind of
scales things back okay let's do the
color gamut tuning and let's do cm
settings and it kind of scaled things
around now you'll notice my blacks are a
lot deeper my Blues are a lot crisper
there's a lot higher contrast it just
looks tons nicer and I love doing that
and all you got to do is open both of
these and hit the CM setting on both and
you're done just it's beautiful
go ahead and do that you will thank me
for for that one tip alone in general we
have something interesting this was new
in the the latest june at night lease
we've always had this little CPU setting
up at the top with nothing underneath it
and this vibrator feedback during tuning
it doesn't have much to do with the cpu
but that's all we have in there we do
have this cpu settings elsewhere though
so let me show you that profiles are new
I'm gonna show you that in just a minute
and then I'll have an upcoming video as
soon as I can get some some extra stuff
coming in it's really really quite
awesome anyway so down here under
performance will open that up yes we
know that we need to proceed with
caution
we can come in and change our CPU
governor let's use that change it to
interactive and that's just how quickly
does your CPU scale up and down in speed
we can set the minimum CPU frequency we
can set the maximum CPU frequency
overclock it a little bit and then we
can restore these setting
on boots so we'll go ahead and leave it
like that for now memory management I've
tweaked this a little bit to allow
purging of assets that essentially lets
you free up some RAM you do have to
reboot after making a change to that but
generally speaking the device runs a
little bit snappier when you do that and
then this kernel same page merging the
KSM it says quote reduces physical
memory requirements and improves
performance well okay tap that turn it
on that's great surface dithering I
leave that alone I like that the
textures the way that they are if I want
more speed I can turn on 16-bit
transparency but that loses some some
graphics quality and causes some weird
graphic artifacts sometimes so I just
leave those turn the way they are come
back here and you know what that's it's
about it so the one last thing that I
wanted to show you in CyanogenMod is
profiles now you can get two profiles
either by going to settings and profiles
or by pressing and holding the power
button let me unlock again so we press
and hold the power button and now you
can see profile and I can toggle it
right there we don't want to do that so
let me just show you profiles are really
really powerful things that you can do
to turn things on and off so for example
this is my default profile at night
let's go to work
okay should we see what I've got set up
for work at work I still want my mobile
data enabled I want my Bluetooth
disabled because I'm not in my car I
don't need it turned on my GPS I don't
need either my Wi-Fi I don't need either
so I've got both of those turned off
data synchronization is on and my
portable Wi-Fi hotspot is on because
I've got a tablet that I use at work so
I turn that on again while I'm at work
this is the June 5th
CyanogenMod nightly for the my guru the
Galaxy Nexus GSM version so very very
cool there you go that's an overview
kind of in depth a little bit of detail
some settings that you may not have
known were in there or might not have
known what they did and a couple things
that I still don't know what they do so
again if you can add feedback to this
and help us know what some of those
things that we briefed over are go ahead
and leave those in the comments over a
pocket
calm if you like seeing custom roms and
all you can do with them and make sure
you give the video a big thumbs up for
pocket now showing off CyanogenMod rom
