Daniel Webster here from Puck Metacom
and today I will show you an Android
application called metal detector and
this program allows you to find certain
metal and ferrous metals of course work
a lot better and as the name implies it
is a metal detector it uses the onboard
digital compass to activate when a metal
object is in proximity to the device and
I have a couple of metal objects right
here that we are going to test out I
have just a little bit of metal right
here we can move the device over it
and as you see it has detected the metal
so I have another piece that was
actually steel and this one is aluminum
so we can try that that works really
well and these are actually titanium
scissors and apparently it's already
detected it as you hear the sound that
means that indicated up to 10 that the
metal objects is in proximity to the
device so we income some of the settings
here and we can change something let's
see if we want to have it vibrate we can
add that when you play a sound we can
also change our sound so let's see if I
want to have it beatbox Android you can
click there ok sensitivity I have it set
to 7 which is a little more sensitive
than the default but you can have it all
the way up to 1 or down to 9 which is
the most sensitive we can change the
sampling priority so the higher means
it's more sensitive and the lower means
it's less sensitive but this little
warning right here says that the higher
it is the more responsive yet eats less
beats more battery you can also hide the
taskbar keep bone awake and customise
our text so if you saw on this device
the default says scanning but I said
where's the gold and the text found says
detected but I said there be treasure
kay so this is another Android Market
pick and the pearls called metal
detector and this is free on Android
Market thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
