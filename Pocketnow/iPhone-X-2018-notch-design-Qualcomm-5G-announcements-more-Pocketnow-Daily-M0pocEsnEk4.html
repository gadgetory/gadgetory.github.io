confirmed that the pixel doesn't really
take full advantage of the visual core
believe it or not the rumors of
Samsung's Galaxy S 10 have already begun
and it turns out that Apple might be the
one copying huawei's notch very soon I'm
Jaime meadow Iveta reporting from
Qualcomm 5g day which happened yesterday
and today again we've got a lot to cover
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals if you're in
the market for the Samsung Galaxy s8 we
actually found some deals where it's on
eBay for really cheap the only thing
about it is these are podium units
beaming these were available to
consumers to look at it to play with so
learn about it in the description again
the galaxy s 8 continues to be a great
phone regardless now let's talk about
Qualcomm and 5g day as yesterday we were
treated to a ton of information some of
it we can share with you now which is
the fact that the company has pretty
much signed up with a ton of carriers
and a ton of OEMs to ensure that 5g will
become a reality the only thing about it
is 5g will happen until early 2019 you
can learn more about the carriers and
the OEMs in the link in the description
not all of them are there it's an
interesting list now let's talk about
the Samsung Galaxy S 10 I didn't even
want to cover these news because it's so
early but well we hear things already
like for example the fact that it'll
bring an L shaped battery for more
capacity in addition to also bringing an
AI chip we hear you FS 3.0 memory it's
just so early I wonder if these rumors
actually belong to the galaxy note n you
can learn more about it in the
description as well and for those of you
that want to use the Google pixel visual
core as bragging rights to say that
that's the reason why you get better
photos from the pixel it turns out that
the company just clarified that it's not
using the visual core for photos it's
actually providing this functionality
for third-party applications being
Facebook and Instagram the first ones
that are going to use it but for those
of you that have fallen in love with the
photos from the pixel just like I have
this is pretty much what the pixel can
do through software which is insane
the hardware obviously yeah and finally
the very interesting news that they have
to do with the iPhone 10 2018 and the
fact that it's innovation is probably
going to do a little juggle many of you
are not fans of the knotch I really
don't care about the knotch because you
get rid of the bezels which for me is
great but as it turns out the rumors are
that the Huawei P 20 is going to bring a
smaller notch to a certain degree and
apparently Apple is going to follow that
ship with its iPhone 10 2018 it seems
that the changes are not just going to
be in the three models that we talked
about but also that the notch is pretty
much going away but following on the
lead of what it was started with the
essential phone and then will now with
the Huawei pede 20 according to rumours
it leads me to the question of the day I
mean have you I don't know gotten over
the topic of the notch or is it still a
reason why you wouldn't buy the iPhone
10 because in my case again it's not a
reason to not buy it but I would love to
know your opinion in the comments
