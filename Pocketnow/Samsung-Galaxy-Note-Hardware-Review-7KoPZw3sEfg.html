and today we're going to be doing the
hardware review of the Samsung Galaxy
Note one of the fastest android-powered
smartphone / tablets available so let's
get to it so the samsung galaxy note is
running Android 2.3 Gingerbread which
samsung and google state will be
upgraded to android 4.0 in 2012 so the
device is pretty big it's almost 140 6
millimeters in height 84 millimeters in
width and 9.6 five millimeters in debt
so it's a pretty big device but yeah
it's still pretty thin if I compare it
to an iPhone 4 or 4s as you can see it's
about the same thickness as the iphone 4
or iPhone 4s so it's still pretty thin
device and it feels kind of a it feels
thin in your pocket doesn't feel too big
although it is a little comical when
you're using it against your head people
think it's kind of like you're holding a
book to the side of your face so go
through the hardware features of the
galaxy note at the top we have an
earpiece we have our light sensor a
proximity sensor and our 2-megapixel
front-facing cam we also the Samsung
emblem we have a huge 5.3 inch wxga
resolution that say almost an HD
resolution screen and this is behind a
glass capacitive multi touch digitizer
which also uses the s-pen on the bottom
and it's kind of similar to those bamboo
style writing that devices that you use
on your computer it won't work on other
capacitive screens but it will only work
on the Galaxy Note so we'll just put
that back for a minute let's see what
else do we have on the bottom we have
two capacitive buttons a menu button and
a back button we also have a physical
button which one little feature that's
pretty cool is if we double tap it
brings up a voice service that we can i
use kind of like Siri on the iPhone on
this side the device we have a volume
rocker up and down nothing else we have
a multi port USB 2.0 and I believe it
also does HD out we have our primary
microphone our S Pen which is on the
back / bottom we have our power standby
button we have our 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and a secondary
microphone for no
cancellation on the back we have our 8
megapixel HD recordable camera we also
have a flash another samsung emblem and
our speakerphone or my car speaker out
volume our audio out here and let me
just pop off the battery cover the
battery cover is made of plastic as is
most of the device itself if I pop that
off we can view the micro SD card slot
it doesn't come with a micro SD card but
it does have 16 gigabytes of internal
memory of lee 2500 milliamp hour battery
which seems to last forever it actually
lasts a couple days without negatively
charged with our standard sim card slot
and we have our s-pen this is a pretty
neat pen because it does have dual
features if you can see here we have a
button that allows us to use a back
feature and many other options which
I'll show you in the software review
coming up next so we'll just pop that
back in there so some other hardware to
mention is we have a 1.4 gigahertz sexy
nose dual-core processor which is very
fast and i'll show you the benchmarks
for that in just a second we also have
one gigabyte of RAM and of course these
16 gigabytes of ROM that are built in so
this unlock galaxy note does have
quad-band GSM along with quad band UMTS
and it also has hspa+ at the 20 100
megabits per second speed the other
features about this galaxy notice we
have bluetooth 3.0 we have Wi-Fi a/b/g/n
den we have an accelerometer assisted
gps and a gyroscope built-in so let's
check out some of those benchmarks so
running quadrant standard I was able to
get 4223 which is pretty phenomenal for
a device with 1.4 gigahertz so let's
move on to the next benchmark test and
on smart bench 2011 I was able to get
4214 on the productivity index and 2378
on the games index so let's do linpack
and then we'll finish this up and on
linpack running a multi thread test I
was able to get 103.9 87 m flux in 1.6
seconds and that's a very fast test it's
probably one of the fastest for just an
oem Android device so this has been the
hardware review of the samsung galaxy
note and if you like our videos make
sure you use a thumbs up and also leave
some comments down below you can check
out the end
boxing video right about here i'll post
a link and stay tuned for the software
review coming up next to get more
information about the hardware related
to the Galaxy Note just visit the link
in the description director Park another
column where we stored the full article
and you can view all the information
about the hardware related to the
samsung galaxy note thanks for watching
