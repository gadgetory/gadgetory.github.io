apparently coming together next month
Google will reportedly bring us more
hardware very soon and rumors continue
to emerge about an HTC u 12 in you 12
plus I'm Jaime Ravenna and the
pre-recording is the way to go believe
it or not I am traveling again then I'll
be traveling once again but I did get
you the news this is PocketNow daily the
official news today began with deals yes
buy one get one free deals have begun
for the brand new Galaxy S 9 s9 plus it
even the s8 active on t-mobile you buy
one on a 24-month installment plan and
you will get 720 books and credits which
allows you obviously the whole purpose
is that you buy another phone this is
about that time and I highly recommend
any of these devices
now speaking of Samsung and apparently
this is a good time to get that deal
that I just talked about because if
you're currently rocking a galaxy s6 or
galaxy s6 edge you're no longer getting
software support as of today you are no
longer going to get any software updates
so no Oreo and probably the most
alarming part is that apparently you
won't even be getting security updates I
find that to be terrible I mean people
that use iOS devices don't deal with
that devices that are extremely old
still get updates and it's not that I'm
trying to put over a comparison or
anything it's just Wow not even security
updates that's really bad now it's will
the spotlight over to Google for those
of you that are planning to buy at
Google home or Google home many it seems
this might not be the best time
apparently we are getting another sort
of Google home this one includes a
display to compete against the Amazon
echo show because that's what companies
are doing lately they're trying to
compete against each other and
definitely Amazon has the edge on this
market whether we're getting this
product at Google i/o or a separate
Hardware event I don't know I'll keep
you posted as soon as we figure
something out
now let's talk about the HTC u 12 + u 12
plus it seems that we are getting these
phones around May somewhere around May
is the possible launch date and
well specifications are off the roof
obviously qualcomm snapdragon 845 in
addition to your typical amounts of RAM
and storage all that is great
the most important part are these quad
cameras in the rumors in addition to the
possible change in the back design the
quad cameras because we're gonna get
dual selfie cameras and then dual back
cameras and even the megapixels are
variable you can learn more details in
the description let's see what we get in
the end and finally the most interesting
news today I have to do with the 1 plus
6 hopefully well the company has just
teased something that has to do with
Avengers infinity war and the launch
date for that movie is April 27th so the
rumors are that we might be getting a 1
plus 6 on that date or that there is
something related or probably will get a
teaser of the phone
I don't know during the movie or after I
don't know exactly what to tell you here
it seems that we have something that's
related I just you know in today's
question let us know do you think that
it's good for the 1 plus 6 to launch so
early I mean think about it we're at
least three months early when comparison
to the launch of the oneplus 5 last year
and the 1 + 5 t was just launched a few
months ago so I don't know if it's great
for it to launch so early but anyways
