Android wear with the original G watch
but it wasn't until the company launched
the G watch R and denounced the watch
urbane that we began praising its design
team I'm high memory better with pocket
now here at MWC 2015 in Barcelona for a
quick hands on a luxurious watch urbane
LG has decided to launch not one but two
watch urbane models at MWC one running
LTE and webOS that you can see on a
separate hands on an Android wear
variant that we have here both the watch
urbane and watch urbane LTE support the
same 1.3 inch
320 by 320 resolution healeth display
that we saw with the G watch arm but the
differences are that these are smaller
bezels on the newer models allowing for
a more immersive experience this feel
that technology has the advantage that
it allows for certain basics of the
watch to remain visible even with the
displays on standby for a more
convenient experience this particular
non LTE variants ports a screwless
design made with stainless steel to the
top and bottom you actually have the
options to choose either a gold or
silver finish in addition to either
leather or metallic straps even though
for the case of this hands-on only
leather straps were available
this device sports a 1.2 gigahertz
bachlin Snapdragon 400 processor 512
megabytes of RAM and 4 gigs of built-in
storage that you can also use for music
it sports a smaller 410 milliamp hour
battery would compare to the 700
million-dollar unit on the watch urbane
LTE so regardless of which wearable you
choose you're only getting one day of
charge according to the company
one cool benefit remains that the
charging mechanism of the watch urbane
is magnetic providing a more durable
experience when compared to the original
G watch as opposed to the webOS LTE
counterpart watch urbane runs Android
wear version 5.0 with all the regular
bells and whistles that we've already
seen in previous reviews the same Google
now card for you that we are already
accustomed to seeing in the past is
available but with the added kick that
we have some more
watch phases here LG spent some time
showing us just how cool you could
customize these watch phases from the
time hands to just about everything but
it wasn't really clear this will be
available at the launch of the watch
urbane or if this will only be a watch
for main LTE capability now the big
story about watch her Bane is really in
its design and LG has delivered a true
gem here as the Vice feels great in the
hand and then the wrist it almost
resembles a true timepiece and it
doesn't feel that you're wearing a
gadget something that Android wear
smartwatches have really struggled to
provide so far we'll definitely need to
take it for a spin of our pocket
mountain labs to tell you more but for
now just remember I'm I'm never out of
pocket now here at MWC 2015 make sure
