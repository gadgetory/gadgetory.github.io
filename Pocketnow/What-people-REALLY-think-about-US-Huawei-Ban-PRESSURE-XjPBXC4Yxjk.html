the comments on a comments video by
commenting on this comments video should
we feature more comments this is P n
comments I love your comment one more
true that and I'm going to find you for
cultural appropriation Oh seriously you
own the phrase we're live so you're
telling me Gorilla Glass aren't made of
gorillas
oh man it's amazing what people do with
keyboards these days hey how many
comments have you read I meant yes
you know I still do not understand that
joke fine blonde moment that's right
it's that time of the week I'm hiding
that out this is PocketNow and this is
the bargain out daily recap your
comments for last week the week began
with WWDC a ton of announcements
probably one of the most tech keynotes
that I've seen from Apple yet obviously
the question was what was your favorite
announcement because I had a few we had
503 comments pro-consumer can you
explain what 6k means Apple hey Pro 6 K
means 5 K for the monitor plus 1 K for
the stand fro consumers applause oh my
god
174 likes for reason yeah true the price
tag is a little bit insane but then
again I'm not trying to defend Apple
it's just the what competes with this
monitor is the question you know we're
reaching dangerous levels when a
monitors that cost $1000 true I'm not
gonna try to defend Apple for that one I
don't understand why they're selling the
monitor stand separately it doesn't make
any sense
just charge hundred dollars more for the
monitor and just call it a day I mean
like seriously the iPad software changes
well-done Apple as far as this goes sure
it didn't bring everything I wanted but
it's a huge step towards the right
direction oh my god dude you have no
idea how much I've used iPads with that
whole concept that I would one day love
to leave my apartment without a computer
and every time that I do I always leave
with this like psychosis that I'm gonna
need a full-blown browser everything so
true not everything that I wanted on the
iPad is coming on iPad OS either but I
love
the fact that it's the first step and
that first step was actually a very bold
one I'm actually willing to put up with
it for as long as it continues to a
while from that I think that the first
step was the one that was necessary
cheese shredder on computers stovetop on
the iPhone next up the Apple kitchen
alright man fine that's that was
probably the best joke like seriously
design-wise I don't know what Apple is
trying here but let's just hope that the
whole cheese shredder design actually
serves the purpose of actually it being
this hugely powerful computer because
that's what these holes were for then on
Tuesday the Huawei topic got really
interesting particularly because the
United States is already applying
pressure to countries like Germany where
it's like oh if you don't want to join
the blacklist band then we are going to
not brief you anymore on our security
information which is a weird way to
focus and you know just force countries
to do what the United States wants I
asked you me what do you think because I
thought countries were sovereign nations
we had 1179 comments thanks a lot guys I
am still waiting for the u.s. to show
proof of Huawei being a security risk
yes exactly um this is not the first
time that the US government is doing
things like this where they don't have
proof fine probably they can't show us
proof it's just you know tomography is a
little more complicated I'm from Germany
and I definitely think that every
country should decide for themselves who
they trust other countries can give
advice from their experience but should
not pressure them exactly every country
should be a sovereign nation and here's
the thing I mean I believe that every
country's got their own intelligence
they've got their own reasons they've
got their own negotiations and it's just
yeah I mean why should one country
pressure the others the USA doesn't want
Huawei 5g because they the United States
won't have a backdoor to spy on
everybody true that's guys and and even
that speaker that's back there as well
it's I should also disconnect it guys
it's crazy what was i searching for the
other day and then i got ads served to
me about everything about this product
and i try to remember probably before
the video ends that you should do
whatever they want
not what the US wants if Trump has a
problem with Huawei it's his problem not
everybody's problem all right listen I'm
not gonna try to grab any of the sides
here every country has a right to defend
themselves from whatever they want just
as much as every country has a right to
ban whatever they want just as much as
whenever a country claims freedom it
should also be the other way around
company should have freedom so it's it's
a very difficult topic I do believe that
this is a deeper problem that needs to
be solved
meaning should we really have all the
liberties or should we allow companies
to have all liberties or can just the
United States apply certain restrictions
like in the case of China you want to
operate in China you have to follow what
the government requires why can't the
United States do this with Huawei and
then have them just comply with the
rules or not be part of it and then on
Wednesday the topic was the possibility
of a ban towards Apple
Tim Cook was recently interviewed and
when talking about this topic he was
like yeah you know I'm we're not worried
about it we had 455 comments I asked you
what do you think I think you mean Tim
Apple fine
that what we will stand for Apple if
China takes action Apple doesn't affect
us so why should we care well you know
each company can either be worried or
not I mean I know that Apple has their
leverage they have their reasons to not
be worried it's probably whatever Tim
Cook said probably not Tim Cook is still
cooking the answers for this they would
lose a lot of earnings if they lose
China and some US citizens is switching
to Android it's end game now for Apple
it could be it could not be guys I don't
you know if the CEO of a company is not
worried then I guess they shouldn't be
worried I am sure they're already
working on a back-up plan
trust me Apple doesn't care about the
tariff they just put it on top of their
price so they get ready for the two
thousand dollar iPhone dude I don't
think that companies are that I believe
that every company wants the price their
products in an aggressive way that also
caters to their costs and then you know
I know that there are certain companies
that exaggerate but then again you
understand the point I mean it's not
that they want to grow the price of the
consumer I think the
while struggling with that problem as
well on Thursday the topic was Galaxy
Note 1000 10 leagues I asked you what do
you think about the rumors we were
looking at we had 457 comments was
considering the note 10 but not anymore
since they're losing the headphone jack
oh my god yes I yep you guys have no
idea how worried I am about this because
I actually do care about the headphone
jack but we'll see why do all these
companies insist on overusing the word
Pro it's just deluding what it means now
oh my god when I did my wall way p20 Pro
review I actually refer to that the fact
that certain companies like Huawei in
the past with a peep they with the may
10 Pro we're using the word Pro for wood
just for the fact that it was a
different design so at least I love that
the p20 Pro was more of a pro device
because of the added features of the
camera the question is what is the note
going to bring and if anything I would
actually call the note the original note
the Pro because the stylus actually
provides certain functionality that
other phones don't allow and provide
some Pro feature so you know it's kind
of a hard one but I get your point I do
feel that the word should not be
overused they better hurry up with the
note 10 Pro so that I can buy me a
refurbished notate no don't buy the note
a man if anything I would recommend you
buy the note 9 that's a really good
phone the don't send pro sounds like an
s10 5g with an S Pen this is what we
believed um not exactly sure I mean it's
got the size it's got the features I'm
assuming that this pro variant is going
to bring 5g I had some opportunity to
play with the 5g very and recently in
Chicago and guys like I I can't even
begin to tell you how much this phone
feels like a Galaxy Note and absolutely
every way so true that and then finally
Friday we had an official announcement
for stadia Google told us everything we
should expect about this product I'm
looking forward to it but I asked you
guys will you think we had some really
great comments 398 to be exact
$10 a month I'll pass I'm saving money
to buy the Prost and all right yeah I
get it
I hope stadia isn't a side job from
Google and ends up like this like Google
Plus or Google do Oh true that it's a
big problem because if you get the
regular password
can buy every single game for a specific
price think about it what happens if you
buy a game like buying Kindle books
right now and then not being able to
access them 10 years from now that's not
what happens with physical games which
is something that Google really needs to
prove that they can take serious Stadium
no thank you I'm happy with my physical
games you know it's interesting but true
I know that a lot of people prefer that
it's funny but on my Nintendo switch I
actually refers well it's not streaming
you know you download the games and then
on there on your switch it's just more
convenient but true streaming makes the
challenge a little bit more complicated
stadia $60 for a game that you can only
stream no thank you you know this is an
awesome comment I was actually it's not
until I read your comment at I was like
true how would I play my games if I'm on
a plane which is one of the main reasons
why I don't mind paying $60 for games
for the Nintendo switch because I have
the versatility of being able to use
them everywhere I actually forgive
Nintendo for charging a little more
money for the convenience of the console
which I don't find the same way with
games like from the ps4 for example this
is my opinion obviously but thank you
for your comment you make an incredible
point
I wonder how Google is gonna handle that
I hope that they come up with like a
Spotify approach where you can download
the game and keep it on your I don't
know laptop or whatever for a month and
then have to sing I think that would
probably be the best solution that's it
for the pocket ads daily recap thank you
so much for watching if you want your
comments to be featured keep them short
stick to the point and try to get some
thumbs up makes it easier to spot them
