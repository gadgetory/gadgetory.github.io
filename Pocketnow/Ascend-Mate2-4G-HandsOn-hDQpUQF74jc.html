Taylor behind the camera we are here at
CES taking a look at the brand new
huawei ascend mate ooh let's see what
it's all about so what we have here is
basically a large phone but it still has
the same 6.1 inch diagonal screen which
is on the last generation who are they
ass and made from last year but they
have reduced dramatically evil vessels
as you can see the film doesn't feel
that large and the hand though it's kind
of slippery because it has that soft
back yourself that Samsung like hyper
glazed material they have all they are
also bragging about the high ratio
between the screen and the entire phone
they're saying that they are market
leaders as far as this is concerned now
under the glass there's a 1.6 it hurts
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor which is a
quad-core processor and I will try to
move in to use the cheat sheet there is
also 2 gigabytes of RAM this screen is a
6.1 inch or as I mentioned it's an e HD
screen but what's an HD screen it's
basically 720p screen and they are not
using a full HD one because they're
saying that this one reduces power
consumption now taking a look on the
side we have a standard power standby
button volume rockers there's this
little flap which you can use to take
the battery cover off on the top there's
your headphone jack frequent five
millimeter standard your microphone
nothing I'm the left side and the bottom
holds a micro USB / plus the main
microphone now this micro USB port is
also used to output power from the 4050
million power battery which is here you
can basically use the huawei assimilate
to 4g to charge another phone and the
demonstration we saw on stage was
the picture with this phone charging an
iphone take a look at mocking the
competition now as far as the software
is concerned with we have the same
Huawei emotion UI but this time it is
version 2 point 0 as you can see it
consists of home screens you do not have
the standard Android the application
launcher but if you have the
notification tray and let's hop into
settings real quick and see the about
menu we have the quad core processor 2
gigs of RAM as we mentioned in terms of
internal storage this film has 16
gigabytes out of which you can see close
to 12 gigabytes available android for
the three runs out of the box with
emotion UI on top of it living it to the
back there's a 13 megapixel camera which
is using and blowing a sony BSI sensor
but on the front we are having a 88
degree wide angle 5 megapixel webcam
which is also according to have a the
largest resolution on a webcam on the
phone so as as far as the feet in hand
feel is concerned it is a big phone it
doesn't feel that big and pan is
slippery yes is it too slippery well
thank Samson we don't have any buttons
we have course the on-screen buttons but
that aside that's a really really quick
look at the huawei ascend mate you have
an end time for pocket now theor behind
the camera we'll be back with a
comparison between this one and the
Galaxy Note 3 thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
