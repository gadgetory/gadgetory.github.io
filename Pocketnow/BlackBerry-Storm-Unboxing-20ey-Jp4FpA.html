a guest editor for pocketnow.com here
with an exclusive unboxing for you of
the new blackberry storm the first
touchscreen blackberry for Verizon
Wireless service I'm excited to see the
device my first time ever seen it so
let's get to the unboxing here it is in
the FedEx box go ahead and open this
can't wait to see this it's been much
hyped device type this much since the
release of the iPhone 3G which certainly
draws comparison to the blackberry storm
out of the box very well packaged here
alright so we got the box open and see
what's inside like we have a press kit
on the blackberry storm press and be
impressed and here is the device itself
very sleek blackberry box I can't tell
if this is gonna be the final packaging
that Brian's gonna use doesn't have in
your prize and wireless imagery on it
just blackberry let's take a look at the
box here the BlackBerry logo and black
dragon embossed on nice shiny black
cardboard some information about the
phone on the side black and not even
specs on the back of the box just a
little bit about Research In Motion in 8
different languages let's go ahead and
open this thing up break the seal here
ok turn this toward you
given an open congratulations
looks like there is an 8 gigabyte
microSD card in here which is cool some
blackberry storm tips
SanDisk global support guides this is
all Verizon branded stuff so look for
all this will be in your final package a
big book of tips hints and shortcuts
probably might be handy take a look at
that later blackberry user tools Verizon
Wireless smartphone looks like vcast
with Rhapsody install disk
here is the device itself feels very
nice go ahead and push this aside for
just a minute I'll get back to that I
promise in the sentence lift out this
tray here and here's all the rest of the
stuff some more tips they're pretty big
on the tips we've got a USB to what I
thought would be microUSB actually looks
like a blackberry proprietary port right
there wall charger adapter got stereo
headphones with a 3.5 millimeter headset
jack and this and this is hopefully a
wall charger for the device some other
adapters like that ones for the UK some
other country adapters and one for the
US which is quite nice it may actually
be microUSB at the end of that there so
to stepped away from mini and heading
over to micro and just a nice simple
wall charge let's put that aside let's
take a real quick look at the device
itself here is the BlackBerry box all
over the place blackberry storm I'm
going to be doing a full hardware and
software review for POC announced we
should I check that out device seems to
look very nice initial impressions are
feel solid and
build quality seems to be good but I
will be the judge of that after I use it
for a little while longer so guys this
is john ruetten jared guest editor for

unboxing of the new touchscreen
blackberry storm I'm very excited to dig
