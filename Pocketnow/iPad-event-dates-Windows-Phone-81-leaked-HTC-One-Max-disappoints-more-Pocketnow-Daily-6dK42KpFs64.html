next generation iPads to be announced
windows phone 8.1 gets leaked in
screenshots and the HTC One max may not
be as hot as you expect I'm Jaime Rivera
and if you see my other two videos
earlier today then yeah this is the
third shirt that I wore today this is
pocket out daily if you came here for
official news what we've got one for you
and that's google's android device
manager just got a little update and as
it turns out in the past you could only
wipe or make your phone ring and now you
can actually lock it or set a password
remotely now obviously as with
everything google this tastes a little
while to be launched for every other
device so let us know when you get it
let us know what you think these are
some basics and it's just great to
actually have them now let's talk about
no key i know a lot of you're waiting
for their Lumia 1520 witches the
first-ever windows phone tablet to hit
the market and apparently we were
expecting for it to be launched within
the month of September and more credible
sources think that it will be on October
20th with a possible launch probably
just a couple of days later nokia has
actually been doing a good job in that
department and on the other hand if you
wanted to see what Windows Phone gdr3
looks in the Nokia Lumia 920 well links
in the description for details and
notice those live tiles looking a little
more refined and closer together and
speaking of future versions of Windows
Phone we've got the first leaked
screenshots of what to expect from
Project Blue which is Windows Phone 8.1
as it turns out all we notice is really
the Notification Center at the top some
enhancements into the kit center and
everything not really something major so
far but obviously it's hard to come by
these leaks and we still don't know how
further within that project is if we can
ever expect egg point one to actually be
launched this year so stay tuned for
that now let's talk about Android and
more specifically HTC we've got some
leaked photographs of the HTC One max
they're phablet and yes we do see that
fingerprint scanner at the back in its
full glory but that's sadly all the good
news here apparently this device will
not be running the Snapdragon 800
processor and that is just something we
can't really understand I mean
apparently the device will be clocked at
a 1.7 gigahertz and that is below
Snapdragon 800 territory so again the
probably be just a specific region
device we're not really sure of that so
link to the description for details and
we'll wait for whenever HTC wants to
launch this phone and finally for the
hot news of the day those have been
waiting for new ipads set your calendars
and wallets ready for october 15th we've
got some credible sources stating that
this will be the day when they will be
announced it will probably see
pre-orders in the next 10 days and
probably shiffman's 15 days after that
announcement as well and a lot of those
are expecting this new iPad specifically
the ipad 5 because we're expecting a new
design and hopefully a new Retina
display on that ipad mini 2 apparently
this will be just an ipad event but that
leaders of the question of the day are
you holding out for a new generation
ipad probably the ipad 5 or ipad mini 2
which will it be in my particular case
it depends if the ipad mini 2 does not
bring a Retina display i'm going for the
ipad 5 but leave us a comment down below
