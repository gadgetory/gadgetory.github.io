over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it
let's take a second look at one of the
most polarizing tablets in 2015 and see
if it's still worth all of its fame I'm
high net event with pocket now this is
the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and this is
episode 53 of after the buzz Samsung's
Galaxy Note lineup took a dramatic turn
in 2015 that one product you could trust
as the power user Haven with expandable
everything in an env Abul spec sheet is
sadly no more
instead Samsung decided to make this the
larger sibling of an already aging
Galaxy s6 and is appointing many Galaxy
Note fans in the process at least the V
read the comments whether that was a
smart move is still yet to be seen in
sales figures but there is a lot of good
from an end-user standpoint for starters
this product is aged far better than all
of its predecessors combined galaxy
notes were always infamous for flimsy
plastic that was easily cracked or for
shiny champers that you couldn't avoid
scratching but that's really a thing of
the past
today the galaxy note 5 has proven that
all the sacrifices made to expandability
we're all compensated with improved
build quality and durability I think of
the word solid every time that I try to
describe how it feels in the hand
this device is both thicker and heavier
than the galaxy s6 edge+
so the choice to curve the back corners
was just genius match this with the
slimmest bezels in galaxy note history
and the very sleek aluminum trim and
you're left with one of the most
pleasant tablets to hold and one of the
most elegant designs to consider for
this year's phones
this unit provided to us by AT&amp;amp;T has
been one of my preferred daily drivers
for the past two months and it still
passes as a brand-new phone I sadly
wasn't able to save it from a horrible
scratch on the display that'll bug me
for the next few months but that's just
about it the 7000 series aluminum trim
is still scratch and dent free after two
months of minor falls and the same can
be said about the glass back white is
also the best color option to choose if
you want to avoid fingerprints all
around though it won't be as fancy as
any of the gold or silver variants out
there like a fine wine it's clear that
aging is one of the major strong points
for the galaxy note 5 now Samsung's
major selling point for the Galaxy Note
lineup has mostly depended on its unique
software the idea always was for the S
Pen to help you be more productive and
in that regard the previous models were
all packed with features that aged
terribly do too clunky implementation
and slower than average software updates
the story is rather different with the
Galaxy Note 5 samsung has finally solved
most of the basics with a fast and fluid
software experience and the promise for
Android 6 battle marshmallow before
every other 2015 flagship whether the
software is good enough to help you be
more productive is still up for grabs
but some of the new tools have proven to
be really handy over my extensive review
period quickly writing a note on an
inactive display by pulling out the S
Pen is genius and being able to sign a
PDF document and send it back it's just
flat-out cool Michaels review covers all
the other features like scroll capturing
using the S Pen as a mouse more
extensively but in my experience after
the honeymoon phase I'd say that the
rest are just nice to have
now when it comes to user experience
I've been alternating between the galaxy
note5 in the galaxy s6 edge+ for over a
month now and this actually says a lot
about how essential either phablet is in
your daily life I find using both to be
very pleasant but I can't say that the
note fives added features are good
enough to seduce me away from its curved
sibling I do feel that this is the most
refined software experience of any
galaxy note ever but I still can't say
that I could live without these
productivity features most of it has to
do with the fact that writing on a
display still feels cumbersome and also
because you'll do most of your writing
on screenshots something that's later a
nightmare to organize and the challenge
to search for it later and then you have
to consider the fact that you can no
longer swap the batteries so it's not
like if you can use this phablet for a
long meeting of reading notes since I've
rarely gotten more than four hours of
screen on time before the battery goes
dead yes fast charging and wireless
charging are cool to have but they still
defeat the purpose that you can't
replace a note pad with this phone now
all that being said if you move away
from that ideal of productivity and
judge the Galaxy Note 5 as a phablet
then you'll love everything else about
it watching video on this 5.7 inch quad
HD display is still one of the best
experiences ever
and the Exynos processor match with 4
gigs of ram makes playing graphics
intensive games of delight since heating
is never really a problem and the same
can be said about using this as a
temporary e-book reader these speeds are
top-notch and even if I find phone calls
to sound better on this device than the
Galaxy s6 edge+ you'll still have the
same issue with the speaker mainly
because of its placement
and if you followed our reviews of
pretty much every 2015 galaxy flagship
you'll know just how much we love this
camera combo the galaxy note 5 also
sports the same 16 megapixel optically
stabilized sensor with F 1.9 aperture
and the resulting photos just speak for
themselves
great color reproduction and saturation
and amazing attention to detail in
low-light scenarios this is another one
of those cases where I urge you to not
trust the viewfinder and simply take all
the photos you want as you'll see that
Samsung software pulls a lot of strings
to make the resulting photos just
gorgeous
you can also annotate these photos once
you're done since this is a galaxy note
but you'll be surprised at how little
you'll be doing that video recording is
also top-notch in both color
reproduction and stabilization you
simply will not be disappointed I wish I
could say the same about the selfie
shooter which is OK in well-lit
scenarios but again fails whenever it
comes to low-light overall the story of
the galaxy note continues to be that of
controversy and especially when launched
alongside the galaxy s6 edge+ as a
phablet the note 5 is definitely one of
the best you can buy but as a
productivity tool not so much I tend to
feel that I'd rather have those added
productivity features but if you don't
you might as well prefer to turn your
head to the galaxy s6 edge+ if anything
the note 5 would be a smarter pick after
the buzz due to the quicker promise for
software updates and if you also
consider the fact that you're getting
added features for a little less money
than its curved sibling there might be a
reason for giving this particular
phablet a priority
folks just like in the case of the
galaxy note5 every single gadget comes
of age so stay tuned for more episodes
after the buzz and while you're at it
