hands on the galaxy note 2 and Google
bring Street View to iOS some sort of
I'm hi Natalie better watching how
Google just demolishes Apple over this
maps thing and this is out daily
let's start today's show talking about
the greatest rumors having to do with
Nexus products first of all we've got
carphone warehouse mentioning the
existence of a samsung nexus 2 and
they're also talking about a 32 gigabyte
nexus 7 anybody happy with those 32 gigs
on the Nexus 7 say hallelujah because I
will I'm happy about that but my problem
with these retailers is they always come
up with these weird names for their
products even in the iPad when I went to
bestbuy recently but so far case makers
always know about products really early
on and this samsung nexus 2 was being
dubbed by invisible shield so i'll
probably believe that one t-mobile has
just announced their intention to merger
by metro pcs which is kind of funny
because pink always wanted to go orange
with ATT recently now the reason why
this is important is because if you
remember metro pcs is pretty much the
only regional carrier I think the only
u.s. carrier that ever tried voice over
LTE successfully in certain areas so now
you're understanding where i'm going
this obviously subject the US government
approval but we'll see what happens
google is literally having a blast with
Apple after they decided to leave their
map service and trust me this time it's
payback at least a search giant just did
Apple a favor of publishing Street View
for iOS though sadly it'll only work on
the browser surely it won't be as great
as you remember it to be in the native
application but trust me anything is
better than naps on iOS 6 anything
that's right our review unit of the
galaxy note 2 just arrived in Michaels
doorstep and we couldn't be more excited
the device may be one of the largest
phones to hit the face of the earth but
to be honest with you there are a lot of
really cool things with this galaxy note
2 that stand it apart from other
smartphone so expect a lot of really
great coverage coming up a lot of
comparisons and our full video review
but make sure you drop us a comment on
cific comparison that you'd like to see
or any specific test that you'd also
like Michaels perform and finally for
the mocking news of the day Nokia's just
published a new anti iphone 5 ad that
reminds me of George Orwell's 1984 book
the reason why this rings of bells
because well Apple did the same with our
1984 ad of the first mac and so did
motorola with their ad of the first zoom
and if you remember neither of these
products sold well I don't think Nokia's
approach is really good because first of
all they're mocking iphone 5 customers
is dull and well these are all potential
Nokia customers and then they're mocking
the fact that the iphone only has two
colors black or white and that leads me
to the question of the day do you need
color in your phone for it to look cool
I honestly like my phones in either
black or white so leave us a comment
down below now if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow was on Paco now calm
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm high never be
better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
