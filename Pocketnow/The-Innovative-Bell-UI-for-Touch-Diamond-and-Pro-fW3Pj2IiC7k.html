now calm and I've got something really
really awesome to show you if you're
using a touch diamond or a touch
or any of the variants that are out
there and there are a lot it's a new
user interface that's kind of like
touchflo 3d but I think it's even better
now the reason that we're getting all
these interface replacements is because
companies that are making windows mobile
devices know that the windows mobile
interface that is you know you go into
programs and you get this is kind of
drab and outdated and we all know this
in Microsoft knows this we're waiting
for windows mobile 6.5 when its mobile 7
which will hopefully improve that but
until then we have these interfaces and
here's one from Belle i'm going to show
you i'll post links on pocketnow.com on
how to get it and i think it's really
really amazing so let me show you it all
right so there's a lot of different
aspects of the bell user interface and
by the way Bell is a carrier in Canada
who has who are offering the touch
diamond and touch pro with this
interface ok let me show you the first
thing here if you take your finger and
swipe downward from the notification
area look what you get I'm getting a
text message Wow look at this so this
let me dismiss this message this is your
notification area expanded this is great
so you get your exact battery percentage
you get your network status you can see
if you're connected to a Wi-Fi network
if you click on this center area here we
can adjust the volume of the system and
the ringer which is cool we can go back
this way we can change the alarms we can
turn on bluetooth right from here we can
turn on flight mode it's just a really
cool way to to access all the
notifications and what's even greater is
that you can access this from any
screens so if I do it from the settings
area this is what it looks like you
actually get a task manager which is
super cool in any application and you're
also going to see battery life or you
can go right back home to the bell user
interface now abelian user interface has
three buttons along the bottom instead
of just 2 i'm going to cover those in
the second but what i want to show you
now is what is called bubbles and it's
kind of iphone esque if you look at the
top you can see which bubble you're on
by which dot is lit up and bubbles are
like many applications that you've run
off of your today screen it's sort of
like Sony Ericsson's panel interface but
a little more light they're more like
widgets and what you can do is you can
add and subtract panels so if I click on
that button up to the top I see all my
panels right now or or
bubbles as they call it and if I click
the edit button i can rearrange these by
moving them around on the screen like
that and you get this crate animation
also what i can do is i can delete
certain ones if i don't want them and if
i want to add a bubble i click the plus
button it shows me the bubbles that are
remaining and there are some that i
haven't added yet so i'll do sports news
it puts it in its place and then i'm
going to click done and then back and
then i will have all the extra bubbles
and right now it's flipping through its
cool animation it does any time that you
add a bubble so let me go through the
bubbles and kind of give you an idea of
what you can do so this one right here
it's the third one is headline news and
you can click on world news or do top
stories and you can have it work for
your area if we go over to the right we
get some stocks and i put in a few
stocks there and it's showing me what
they're doing right now and to the left
of that is news and we're getting kind
of a scrolling through of different news
stories that are hitting and if I tap on
one of these news stories I will be
taken into the full story and this
actually uses pocket express and and
that's a program that is free it's been
around for a long time but Bell has
decided to interface pretty much
everything with pocket Express so it
works pretty well if I go over to the
right we have music news same thing as
the news bubble entertainment news and I
think I accidentally opened something
there baseball if you're trying to keep
track of scores you can switch between
the NCAA or MLB if you set that up
here's a world clock so I have the time
in Abu Dhabi and Alaska over to the
right is next calendar appointments this
is this would be great to have on the
screen most of the time so you can just
turn on your device real quick and see
what's coming up here's a simple
slideshow tasks and sub sports news and
if we go all the way back to the
beginning we have a link to Facebook
unfortunately it's not a facebook
application on your today screen like
you would find on the sony ericsson
xperia x1 but you know if you tap on it
it'll take your right to facebook if
you're already logged in then you know
it's a it's a quick way to access
facebook so I'm get out of that now let
me show you the menu down here the menu
is really well done very beautiful we
have
last latest applications used listed
above here we can click on search to
search our device we can go to photos to
see all the different things we can do
with photos and by the way it's very
very touch sensitive i'm not using the
stylus at all as you're seeing now by
going to office mobile it shows me all
of the office applications so really the
bell you i gives me no reason to go into
the standard windows mobile interface to
leave the today screen and i think
that's what a good interface should be
and that's really what they're trying to
do if we go into games we see all the
games and you get the point from there
very very flick friendly too i'm over to
the right if we click contacts we get a
sort of a weird looking display of
context and I've got several hundred and
flicking through them will take a long
time although if you go to the side here
you get a scrollbar and you can choose
the letter which makes it a little
easier but still not very as you can see
I can't open an on-screen keyboard right
now so I can't get right to you know Bob
or something so I'm going to click back
if we click web it will take you right
to upper mobile which is good and
something that I found interesting is
touchflo 3d and landscape doesn't exist
does it exist does Bell you I have a
landscape watch what happens no
strangest thing I don't know why these
interface replacements don't work in
landscape but they don't and finally I
want to cover these buttons along the
bottom the one on the left is contacts
you can add favorite people and what's
really great is that you can have to
format one for text messaging and one
for his house and you can have a little
icon in the upper right corner so you
know which is which so it's a really
fast way to to access that the next one
over here is a text messages and you can
actually have multiple messaging
accounts in this screen so you can
actually have a consecutive list of you
know email message text message email
depending on when you actually receive
the message that's really innovative
here we have a panel for media I don't
really have that setup but you can let
see launch a radio player streaming
radio some of these things don't work in
the music player because you have to be
a bell subscriber to have them work and
finally the one to the right is favorite
applique
and you remember this from touchflo 3d
so we can press plus we can add let's
add one note to the favorite
applications and here it is down there
beautiful so that's it for the Bell user
interface it's a beautiful well done
completely different and innovative
interface for windows mobile it's got
fantastic transitions animations it's
got transparency on all of these bubbles
if you notice that you can see the stars
kind of shining through really well done
in fact this is so well done and so
interesting and fresh that I am using
the touch pro is my daily device now I
had been using the xperia x1 for a long
time since it came out and I'm just so
impressed by this user interface that I
want to use this device the touch pro or
if you have a diamond that works on that
too full time again we'll post links on
pocketnow.com on how to get this the
guys at xda-developers came up with the
the way to extract the files from the
belleville user interface so that
everyone can use this on their device
