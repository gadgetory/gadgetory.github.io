Samsung is getting a jump on Aoife 2017
showing off some new exercise oriented
wearable tech fitness trackers are still
performing well as a market trend and
the gear fit 2 is getting a new pro
version to keep the pressure on not just
a fancy name for a slightly nicer
wearable the provost's improved battery
life with up to 10 hours of continuous
GPS use packed in a more water-resistant
and rugged shell alongside automatic
workout detection the new fit 2 pro
includes true continuous heart rate
monitoring trading some battery life for
up to the second pulse tracking the
design has been refined now sporting a
more traditional watch buckle and new
watch faces are available to spruce up
the curved AMOLED face now speaking of
software Samsung is teaming up with
Under Armour speedo and Spotify to
develop customized workout and media
apps specifically for the fit platform
like offline playback for Spotify or
speedos very first swim tracking app
built specifically to work with gear fit
and sport watches Samsung is also
delivering a second generation of
wireless earbuds dubbed the gear icon X
2018 these truly wireless audio devices
get a battery bump as well now good for
seven hours of listening from the
built-in four gigabytes of storage or up
to five hours of streaming from a phone
the charge case is also redesigned to
include a larger battery allowing for
two full charges of the earbuds while on
the go capacitive touch controls work
surprisingly well for controlling music
launching a personal training coach to
detail your activity or a new lung press
gesture will fire up the voice assistant
of your choice and you can expect Bixby
is the default on your Samsung phone
we're still awaiting pricing and
availability for the icon X 2018 earbuds
but they should ship sometime this fall
before the year 2018 the gear fit 2 pro
will sell for $1.99 when it's available
for purchase in September as always
