pocket now calm we just got a question
from Kevin boss asking us to show a game
cod raging thunder light it's a free
racing game for android on the HTC
legend he actually has the hero the
predecessor to this phone and says that
there's some FPS problems in the game on
his phone meaning that the animation and
the movement isn't so smooth so let's
take a look at how well it functions on
the HTC legend so I'm going to go to
raging thunder and again this is
available in the marketplace for free
the lite version
this uses the accelerometer to steer
which is quite nice very very precise
and I don't know what these bouncing
skulls are in the air assuming you
should try to get those but very very
smooth this looks really good on the
legend super smooth got some air there
so if you have an Android phone I'd
actually recommend that you try this
game it's quite nice it's called raging
thunder light and it is it is free so
that was a look at how raging thunder
works on the HTC legend I'd say it works
very very well that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
