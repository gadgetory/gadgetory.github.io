Japanese market six months after the
introduction of the Xperia z3 in
September of 2014
making Sony stay true to its flagship
every six months policy it took the
company about a month to announce the
Xperia z4 globally with a different name
we're here to unbox the Xperia z3 plus
aka
the Xperia z4 we have absolutely no clue
why Sony decided to break its naming
convention aside from creating
unnecessary confusion after all the
Xperia z4 z3 Plus is - the z3 what the
z3 was - the z2 and so on the company
tried to explain it but to us it looks
like this could have been the case with
every Z phone the box has changed as
well not too much but it's smaller than
the box of the Xperia z3 it features the
device on the front as well as on the
back with color options here you can
find some specs called outs such as the
triluminos display 4k capabilities the
processor IP 65 and 68 ratings 20.7
megapixel camera 5 megapixel front
fascia and the 5.2 inch screen we lift
the top off to have a dish of view the
experience is the same as with previous
experiences the phone itself on the top
to the left underneath which she gets
some accessories sadly this year to Sony
decided not to bundle any headphones
just like with the z3 the z2 however had
the noise cancelling buds in the box
moving on and putting the phone to the
side we're seeing a wall plug which in
our particular case it's the UK plug a
micro USB cable for syncing and charging
as well as a USB on-the-go cable in
addition to some literature
not too much the phone itself is
surprisingly lightweight without feeling
unsubstantial though compared to last
year's 152 grams on the z3
the z4 z 3 + went on a diet at 144 grams
which is a very good weight for an old
glass and aluminum build that's rated IP
65 and IP 68 for dust and water
resistant
there are very subtle changes compared
to its predecessor like the shiny smooth
and rounded edges only one flap covering
up a shared micro SD and nano SIM card
slot and the open USB port which can be
now flooded without damaging the device
the magnetic docking port is now gone
but we won't go further into details as
we will have a full comparison up soon
between the Z for Z 3 plus and ez 3
let's pop in our sim card and storage
memory and let it boot while we're doing
all that will tell you real quick about
the specs 5.2 inch full HD triluminos
display Qualcomm Snapdragon 810
processor which according to some
reports is the second iteration Adreno
430 GPU 3 gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage
expandable 20.7 megapixel camera on the
back 5 megapixel front pacer all the
usual suspects you can think of except
the infrared port and a non-removable 29
30 million power battery we'll have a
lot more on the Xperia z4 z3 plus in the
coming days and weeks as we get to know
the device and continue to inspect it
from every angle until then this has
been anton denied you can follow me at
