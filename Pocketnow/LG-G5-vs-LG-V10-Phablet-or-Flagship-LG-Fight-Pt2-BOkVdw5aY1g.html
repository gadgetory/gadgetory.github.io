our recent comparison video but how does
it handle the monster phablet LG
released almost seven months ago I'm
Juan Carlos bag now for pocket now and
here's part two of our LG family fight
the g5 versus the v10 what we have here
are two phones vying for the future of
LG's design strategy the v10 was the
first phone to walk away from LG's
mostly glossy grey plastic catalog a
combination of silicon grippy backplate
and steel side rails was a bold
departure from the g2 g3 g4 and the Flex
Series phones the g5 does not follow in
the v10 footsteps though the frame is
supposedly a higher quality metal
skeleton the surface customers will
interact with is essentially a high
quality paint neither design is without
compromises a minor fall from two feet
onto one of my camera tripod legs has
already gouged a side of the g5 the v10
has bounced off of concrete curbs
leaving no marks on the steel rails but
the silicone is somewhat fragile when
using different mounts and cases both
phones give off positive impressions but
it's difficult to overlook some of the
build quality missteps of the g5 rough
seams around the phone and gaps on the
battery tray while it's a funky feeling
tearing off the back of the v10 this
hardware combination of materials
recalls some of our favorite metal edge
devices like Moto X's Lumia 930 s and
Note fours we are comparing a phablet
against a smaller flagship but features
like battery size and camera hardware
didn't change significantly when moving
from the g4 to the v10 Mergen AMA
creatures like the fingerprint scanner
placement and that this sensor is always
on on the g5 address issues of operating
larger phones in smaller hands though
personally I do miss having the volume
controls on this rear panel by the power
button those considerations are
well-intentioned but there's no getting
around the fact that the v10 is a big
phone we move up from a 5.3 inch screen
on the g5 to a 5.7 inch screen on the
v10 with a little extra forehead space
dedicated to dual selfie cameras and an
always-on
second screen ticker the g5 s always-on
mode is deaf
a more elegant if a bit less functional
solution for at-a-glance information
beyond the size of each screen we have
the same quad HD resolution of 2560 by
1440 and both phones use LG's IPS
quantum LCD technology anecdotally I
think the g5 might have a slightly
brighter screen than the v10 but we're
unable to devise a method of capturing
those minut differences on video there's
a hard division and how LG approaches
different consumer demographics with
these two phones the g5 is noticeably
more powerful thanks to a beefier
welcome 820 processor the v10 like the
g4 before it used the less powerful
Qualcomm 808 as with our G for
comparison basic interactions like
navigating the UI are smooth enough on
both devices
but taxing these phones the g5 is more
responsive and handles multitasking with
fewer instances of halting or lagging
but for the g5 s extra power we don't
see some of those great professional
features found on the v10 the g5 is a
consumer all-rounder you see so it
doesn't get professional-grade control
over the camera
the main 16 megapixel camera sensors on
both phones are almost identical but the
v10 assured in fantastic options for
controlling video and audio the g5 has
great options for still photography but
the main change here is the addition of
a second wide-angle camera as a fun
feature the core photo and video
experience remaining almost identical to
the g4 even though the v10 is on a less
powerful processor it's capable of
saving a significantly higher video
bitrate it brings options for changing
the aspect ratio and it has an option
for 60 frames per second video at up to
a cinema wide resolution of 2560 by 1080
all options the g5 should handily be
able to reproduce now it should also
come as no surprise that gaming
performance is better on the g5 though I
do need to find more graphics intensive
games to test as Marvel future fight is
getting a bit played out suggestions in
the comments are always welcome audio is
a split decision between these two
phones the v10 speaker is somewhat
unimpressive and while the g5 is in no
danger of unseating an HTC it is better
than its phablet counterpart
that story completely reverses on
headphone playback however the DAC in
the v10 is one of the best on the market
the amp on the v10 is punchy and loud LG
didn't include comparable audio Hardware
on the g5 in the hopes that we buy
add-on accessories unfortunately now it
seems that the hi-5 friend for the g5
might not make it to North America
making this business move from LG fairly
disappointing headphone playback from
the v10 is head and shoulders above the
standalone g5 a better clarity better
dynamic range lower noise floor and it's
better able to drive more expensive
headphones it really is no contest for
people who want higher quality audio
playback moving to battery life this is
a solid win for the g5 while the v10
shares the same 3000 milliamp hour
capacity with the g4 it has a larger
screen to illuminate and a second
display drawing more juice than the g5 s
always-on mode
mix in a little camera usage in some
gaming and the v10 is a more difficult
phone to power past dinnertime our video
test streaming 30 minutes of HD video
over Wi-Fi at 50% brightness the g5
drained 7% of its battery while the 6
month old v10 drained 10% losing to even
the year old g4 on this test that 7%
difference in battery capacity isn't
nearly enough to balance the power
efficiency of the g5 so let's wrap this
up where's that leave the LG g5 against
its own stable mate the v10 we
acknowledge that these two phones are
designed to cater to different potential
audiences so we should expect to see
some separation on various features
offered still it can be frustrating to
look at some software improvements on an
older device which don't make it into a
newer phone Samsung cameras for example
between galaxy s and galaxy note phones
regularly leapfrog each other but we
would always expect an improvement in an
S Series phone to be included on a
following note and vice versa the g5 is
more powerful and has better battery
life both our killer improvements for
people on the go yet there's a charm to
using the v10 for folks who want better
headphone audio built-in or better tools
for producing content the v10 is only
six
unsold at the time this comparison was
produced and it still stands as a viable
option for someone buying a phone today
but deciding between v10 features and g5
power that's not very fun and this now
leaves us wondering what we might see
from LG as a follow-up to the v10 we're
not too far away from when a successor
might be released as always folks thanks
