dates for pre-order a new ad tsys what
to expect for the samsung galaxy note 7
and if you weren't for us by the ZTE
exon 7 it's now time to buy I'm hi Mary
vera and what if I told you that your
world is not real yeah I watch the
matrix yesterday this is parking out
daily we are not starting the official
news today with deals but then if you
consider what you're getting with the
exon 7 you kind of are getting the deal
you are getting pretty much almost all
the same specifications of the galaxy s7
only in a 399 dollar package and for
those of you that weren't able to
preorder sales begin today and it's
actually 98 cents cheaper than the 1
plus 3 gotta love competition house will
the spotlight over to LG the company's
quarter results are out and just as much
as the company underperformed in sales
with the LG g5 so did the quarter
results the company is reporting 132
million in losses which pretty much
pulled back the 180 million in losses
from the previous quarter even before
the g5 was launched these are terrible
numbers the g5 is a really good product
sadly it was probably a little ahead of
its time according to the company we
should wait for its next smartphone
which we assumed to be the b20 b11
whatever the case may be that should be
the new premium Ranger one company that
is celebrating positive numbers and poor
results is Samsung another Korean
company here the company is claiming 45
billion dollars in revenue 7.2 billion
in profit that is the best that the
company has done in a very long time
pretty much since the galaxy s4 up to
the point where the company is
attributing these new numbers to the
Galaxy s7 though as always Sampson never
provide specific details as to how many
units were sold but it seems the Galaxy
s7 is what we could consider a
blockbuster indeed and speaking of
Samson we are waiting for the company's
new Galaxy Note 7 it should be announced
on Argus second we will be there
covering it live but if you want a very
interesting teaser that launched in
Korea sadly we won't be able to read any
of what's on the video i highly suggest
she hit the link in the description
we've got three things being teased
number one biometric capable
which are expected number two water
resistance and number three the possible
number though obviously the company
doesn't really offer more details we
cannot wait to tell you more when the
device is announced and finally the very
hot news they have to do with the iphone
7 iphone 6s II whatever that thing's
going to be called we've got some
trusted sources telling us that we
should expect pre-orders on September 9
meaning that we should probably expect
the events similar around September six
and the launch could happen 10 days
after September nine or 10 days after
September's 6 it's going to be really
hard to predict the funny part is we're
going to actually be at Aoife covering
the event in Berlin so this is going to
be a rather interesting but we can not
wait to see what we get and that leads
me to the question of the day after all
the leaks and rumors are you waiting for
the iphone 7 before you decide on
another smartphone or have you already
decided because in my case so the galaxy
note 7 is going to take a large toll on
whatever decisions I make for the fall
