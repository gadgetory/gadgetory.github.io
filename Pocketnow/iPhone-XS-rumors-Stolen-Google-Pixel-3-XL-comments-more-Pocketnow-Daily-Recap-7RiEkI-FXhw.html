on deal get it together we need some
jokes I totally get it man after so many
years trying to come up with them you
end up slipping over leave some comments
with some jokes man Hayami saying he'd
rather buy the essential phone over
drinks yeah I don't think so we all know
how much he loves Friday's fine fine
agreed
recap is really awesome if you can't
produce six videos a week please Hymas
skip the weekdays not the recap I cannot
tell you how much I loved this video but
fun fact the recap was not my idea was
actually Brandon's years ago and I thank
him for that that was an awesome idea
indeed that's right it's that time of
the week I am hi Mary that ad this is
PocketNow from Berlin this is the
PocketNow daily recap for last week your
comments
this one one day the topic was the
Samsung Galaxy Note 9 the fact that it
had already sold in pre-orders more than
the note eight more than the s9 weighed
no less than the node eight but more
than the s9 and I asked you what you
thought we had 159 comments probably not
the best idea to start a title with note
9 smokes dude you had 348 likes on that
but yeah it's just you know it's it's a
figure of speech in the United States
very common but I totally got it
the reason outsold the s9 is because a
fortnight bundle come on now
particularly with the way that the whole
exclusive went out I know that that
wasn't the reason it's sold I feel that
the s9 and s9 + were probably not
necessarily that much better than the
node eight and given the added value
proposition of the node 8 and the fact
that so many people stayed away from the
note 7 it made it a whole big reason to
invest on the node 8 and be like you
know what I'll just wait for the next
note I think that's what happened Galaxy
Note 9 is a great phone but the fact
that the s10 is coming up with
significant changes damages Note 9 sales
yes that could be the case the problem
is these are still just rumors we don't
know exactly what to expect here
particularly with all the rumors of a
flexible galaxy and stuff like that we
actually wonder what the future of the
Galaxy S Line will be so on Tuesday the
topic was the iPhone 10s or XS and you
can start with your jokes about that we
asked what do you think about the
rumored features the fact that it could
now go horizontal with a UI that it will
support the Apple pencil pre-orders on
September 14th I asked you what you
thought we had 348 comments these are
interesting things but $700 is Mac's
prices what I want to know most yes and
no the problem is iPhones have already
proven that regardless of the price tag
people will still buy them I consider
that to be disappointing but apparently
that's the way the market behaves Apple
does its own thing in their own way
faster wireless charging will help it a
lot though I really do hope it'll be
revealed earlier I want to upgrade
before October begins it all depends I
mean we've heard rumors that Cupertino
is gonna push back the launch of the
iPhone the
the nine model the one in the middle and
then launch the first ones first Apple
has been experimenting with launches so
much and you know what the problem is
again the market continues to prove that
regardless of what Apple does they will
still buy the phones at the iPhone 5c
was probably the last exception and then
ever since then people will still make
frenzies over it I don't get it but it's
the way it is by the way don't say that
I'm an iPhone hater I use an iPhone 10
as well
I wish I phones charging speed would be
as fast as its fry spikes oh my god
agree definitely yes wireless charging I
find it disappointing to only be a
feature that Samsung phones have and
don't bear in mind it's not like if it's
that much faster than typical wireless
charging but still yes we are moving in
that direction and we've wondered what's
taken company so long then on Wednesday
the topic was triple cameras we have
companies like Oppo liked Huawei
investing in this technology where the
rumors that the Galaxy S ten would also
bring this and I asked you if you had
three cameras on your phone what would
you prefer them to do we had 413
comments s10 rs+ should have a normal
regular camera a telephoto with 6x
optical zoom a wide-angle camera yeah
the case of that telephoto might be
difficult because well you know optics
and distance require a lot of glass I
think that's gonna be the case but
definitely that wide the telephoto and
the normal those make a lot of sense
another sounds crazy Jaime but how about
just one damn good camera I know this
sounds crazy Jay Fransisco but the thing
about it is it's sadly if you want to
keep a phone slim and you want to add
functionality more lenses seem to be the
way to go nobody's gonna be carrying
like portable lenses there's a market
for that but people find them annoying
as well so I feel that more cameras is
probably the best solution three cameras
dual aperture s 9 plus no 9 wide-angle
and telephoto crazy enough no definitely
not crazy enough the question is if
companies are gonna do this I feel that
the wide-angle should be the best
approach but then again a huawei has
shown us that it can do three cameras in
a really awesome way with monochrome and
this blend of you know the telephoto and
hybrid which I find to be genius well
see that on Thursday the topic was the
Mission Impossible pixel 3 accel
shipments being stolen I asked you what
you're looking forward to most of what
do you think about this hold the
buckle that has happened we had 612
comments the person is wearing a ring in
Canada that is an engineering ring so
the person is probably an engineer so
very likely it is real you know the
biggest problem with this whole mission
impossible thing and what's happened in
Canada is that again people that will
pay two thousand dollars to buy a stolen
pixel to excel three excel sorry three
excel will actually know what they're
buying into and so I really doubt that
these people would just buy it to just
use it on the metro I know that these
are you know people would be like hey
I've got the new pixels that's the
reason why the leaks for me are weird
ghoul pixel three excel the ugliest
flagship smartphone in 2018 yes
definitely the ugliest I'm really hoping
this is not the case but I could be
wrong I have a question who has a better
unibrow
Anthony Davis with the pixel three XL oh
my god I wish you guys ever saw a photo
of my older brother in high school cuz
that guy would win like the crown for
the best unibrow but then the pixel 3xl
takes a very short second and then
finally friday the topic was once again
the Google pixel 3 Excel I asked you I
mean the rumors are that the reason
we're getting that horrible unibrow is
because we're gonna get better selfie
photos and I asked you I mean how much
do you really care about selfies
I don't but we had 248 comments so now
we have to calculate not by but much to
body ratio all right you've got 165
likes dude and I have to agree with that
definitely I don't get it like but
here's the thing if you notice the pixel
to excel it is like the bezels on that
phone are significant like Google is
Oliver always had has been a step back
when it comes to design choices so I get
it that this is a possibility that's not
an ideal definitely I rarely take
selfies but I use my screen every day I
really really not a fan of the knotch
rip pixel 3 I don't think this is rip
pixel 3 I think that there is still a
market of people like me that really
like a phone that provides great
functionality and usefulness the
question is how is this phone going to
age for those of you that don't know
Android pee-wee
Android Pi is now official I've been
using it on the piccolo to excel and
there's a reason why I've stopped using
that pixel to excellence because it's
become really slow so this is not what I
would buy a made by Google product we
buy it because it is superior in the
software experience and the services
experience and yet you know it hasn't
been I say focus on better design
brother Google I watch videos I play
games on my phone every day I take
selfies once a month definitely I I
don't know where Google is pushing you
know their whole approach to design and
technology what I do want is for Google
to remember the reason why they came up
with the nexus program in the first
place
they came up with that because they
considered that they wanted to show the
world what Android what their vision of
Android was this is the way Android
phones should be and obviously the pixel
became this like you know extension of
that to a certain degree or it's like
now we're gonna officially make phones
of our own that are going to embody what
Google wants I agree on all that and I
do agree that Google is a software
company where the software the hardware
really has to disappear into the
experience the problem is when you have
a notch that big
that doesn't mean yet the notch is gonna
disappear into the solver experience
it's not gonna work that way Google so
this is the reason why the fur on the
whole idea friends thank you so much
