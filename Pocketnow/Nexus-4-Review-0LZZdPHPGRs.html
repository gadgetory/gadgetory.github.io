pocket now calm is the nexus for the
best android phone you can buy this is
our four of you just ahead let's get to
it the first thing you'll notice about
the nexus 4 is that it looks a bit like
its predecessor the Galaxy Nexus the
front of both devices offer a sleek
buttonless design but the difference is
stopped there on the back of the Nexus 4
is a smooth piece of glass that has a
brilliant light catching pattern to it
while beautiful the choice to put glass
on the back of the Nexus 4 comes at a
cost it's slippery in hand in the pocket
and even when placed on a smooth table
this matters because the nexus 4 can
slide out of a pocket or off of the
table if you're not careful you'll
definitely want to use a case another
cost of the glass on the back is that
you cannot access the battery which
isn't too big of deal because the Nexus
4 has pretty great battery life finally
two pieces of glass on a phone means
that you're twice as likely to crack
glass if you drop the phone again get a
case if you're getting the nexus 4 on
the sides of the Nexus 4 is soft touch
plastic this plastic part in contrast
with the glass actually makes the nexus
4 feel a bit cheap when you wrap your
fingers around it while relatively thick
at 9.1 millimeters the Nexus 4 is one of
the lightest phones on the market at 139
grams when you pick it up for the first
time you might wonder whether there is a
battery inside on the front of the Nexus
4 we have a single piece of extremely
smooth Gorilla Glass like the iphone 5
the nexus 4 uses in-cell touch display
technology which bonds the touch sensor
directly to the glass this allows the
screen mechanism to be thinner by
removing a layer it also brings the
screen about a millimeter closer to the
glass which is a nice effect
unfortunately it also has a negative
impact on touch responsiveness more on
that later like the Galaxy Nexus the
Nexus 4 has a multicolor notification
LED in this case it's below the screen
and it can be controlled with apps like
light flow to get a variety of colors
for different applications let's talk
about specs it's powered by Qualcomm's
new Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core cpu
running at 1.5 gigahertz
has two gigabytes of RAM and your choice
of eight or 16 gigabytes of storage hint
8 gigabytes is just not enough even if
you download a lot of content because
right off the bat you have less than six
gigabytes to work with the next is for
like a lot of Android phone these days
does not have a removable storage so
choose your storage option wisely the
non removable battery is sized at 2100
milliamp hours now let's talk about the
display it's a 4.7 inch 1280 by 768 LCD
panel which makes for a PPI of 320
versus the Galaxy Nexus you're getting
an extra 48 horizontal pixels which is
always nice so you can see a little bit
more screen content up close pixels are
small enough to where you cannot see
them so text and icons look super sharp
the screens color saturation and
contrast is as good if not better than
the 1x the viewing angles are also
impressive but the highly reflective
screen makes it difficult to see the
display off angles LG's bonding of the
touch mechanism with the glass made for
problems with touch responsiveness this
rears its head when typing and when
doing a pinch to zoom when the display
feels a bit numb and slow compared to
other Android devices it's not a deal
breaker but something you're going to
have to get used to if you get a nexus
for the s4 pro quad-core chip on the
nexus 4 combined with uncluttered
android 4.2 means that the nexus 4 is
one of the fastest android phones we've
ever come across in general day-to-day
operation but in our tests it wasn't
dramatically faster than say the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus but faster is faster
unfortunately we found the nexus for it
to be a bit laggy in one place it
shouldn't be the browser Google's choice
of including the still slower than stuck
Chrome browser is confusing while
chromosome neat features when compared
to the stock Android browser it's just
not as fast period the Nexus 4 is the
first android phone to ship of Android
4.2 which brings forth some niceties
like improvements in the notification
shade improved camera controls and
photosphere and lock screen widgets
Android 4.1 was already fantastic in the
upgrade to 4.2 just helps to round out
Android even more now on to some test
notes the Galaxy Nexus had a pretty
terrible cab
how does the nexus 4 do well you be the
judge by looking at these sample images
to our eyes the nexus 4 seems to have a
problem with color saturation it's
definitely better than the Galaxy Nexus
but it's no galaxy s3 the nexus 4 lakhs
LTE although there's an easy software
hack you can do to enable it over band 4
which is what t-mobile will be using
when their LTE is launched in the
Philadelphia area we tested the nexus 4
both on t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T / hspa+ and
clock speeds of up to 10 megabits per
second down and four megabits per second
up with the average falling around four
to five down and two up that's about a
quarter or a fifth of the speed of LTE
of course battery life is above average
with heavy use you can get through a day
in a long night with moderate use you'll
be able to stay off the charger for a
day and a half and perhaps more so
here's what we like and what we don't
like about the nexus 4 we like that the
price is so fantastic we like that
android 4.2 add some great new features
to android and we like that the display
on the nexus 4 is one of the best we've
ever seen on a smartphone we don't like
that there are touch sensitivity issues
with the screen we don't like this super
slippery design and we also just can't
get past the lack of LTE when every
high-end and most mid-range androids now
have it so we give the nexus for a 7 out
of 10 it lost some points because of
issues with the touch sensitivity of the
screen with the camera not being so
great the lack of LTE and some other
things the nexus 4 is a great phone but
it is not the best android phone in our
opinion we'll have a full review on
pocketnow.com shortly where you can read
more about benchmarks day to day
performance camera samples and more in
the meantime thanks for watching and
give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
