cheaper and fancier yeah in a way
I'm Michael Fisher with pocket now and
this might be the next little thing in
affordable smartphones let's take a
quick look at the oneplus X I know I
know
unboxings are so passe but one plus does
such a good job with presentation that
it's warranted this box is made from
thick soft-touch material that feels
more expensive than many other OEMs are
doing the phone is front and center
where it should be and the cable and
power adapter are artfully displayed
rather than just tossed in willy-nilly
the cable itself is linguini style and
covered in soft touch rubber with a nice
strap to keep it gathered together and a
micro USB 2.0 connector no fancy types
see here that's about it for the box
aside from the literature you won't read
and even this is packaged and presented
nicely again oneplus really knows how to
make an affordable phone feel but less
affordable the same goes for the device
itself which is covered in peel-off
protection that barely gives off a
whisper as it leaves the onyx black
glass on the back side and Corning
Gorilla Glass 3 on the front the mid
plate joining the glass halves is
aluminum with chamfered edges and an art
deco stripe job breaking it up with
bottom mounted speakers that seemed
pretty loud on our first listen despite
the logo they share in common the
oneplus X couldn't look less like it's
pricier sibling if it tried where the
oneplus 2 is big thick and rough with
its sandstone back the oneplus X at less
than 7 millimeters thick feels so tiny
and so fancy and so slippery like many
glass phones this one will slide off any
tabletop you've got and it picks up
fingerprints like a detective in an old
crime novel sadly it seems like a case
or at least a screen protector will be
very important for this one the software
is oxygen OS 2.1 dot 2 which is built on
android lollipop and brings all the
custom flair we covered in our oneplus 2
review it looks fantastic on this full
HD AMOLED panel
which is 5 inches quite bright on this
cloudy day we'll go into all this in
more detail and our forthcoming oneplus
x review but i'm happy to see oneplus do
the notification switch again that's
which and the buttons across from it
feel much nicer than you'd expect given
the phone's 249 price tag and that
actually goes for the device as a whole
to still that's more expensive than some
of the competition at this level so
we'll be taking a critical look at the
oneplus X in the full review in
particular I'm a little concerned about
the battery life given the smallish
power pack and it remains to be seen how
well the older Snapdragon 801 processor
will keep up with the latest build of
oxygen OS finally the lack of bands 12
and 17 will make this a non-starter for
some here in the States but my first
impressions on the hole are quite
positive it's great to see any
manufacturer we're bringing premium
builds to mid size phones and given our
largely positive experience with the
oneplus 2 I'm really excited to get to
know the oneplus X I've talked a lot
more about this phone today in a
different venue that's the pocket now
weekly podcast check it out episode 1 7
3 if you want some more and get caught
up on our earlier oneplus coverage here
on YouTube as well let us know what
questions you want answered in the
comments and on twitter pocket now is
pocket now and I am at captain 2 phones
that's it for now till next time this
has been michael fisher thanks for
watching we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
