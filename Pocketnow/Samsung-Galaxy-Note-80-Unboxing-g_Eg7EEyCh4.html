Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0
unboxing announced in February at Mobile
World Congress the Galaxy Note 8.0 is
the latest addition to Samsung's Galaxy
Note line and it's relatively popular
line of tablets now in front of us we
have the Wi-Fi version of this tablet so
it does not have the earpiece speaker
that was so controversial at the show
this year and this one is the 16
gigabyte model there there are two
versions the 32 gigabyte and 16 gigabyte
so this is the Wi-Fi 16 gigabyte and as
you can see the box here is relatively
simple plain brown and it is very
environmentally friendly see this here
printed with soy ink without any further
ado let's get inside the box and see
what this thing is all about
it's relatively open easy to open
but let's dip this tablet out of the way
we'll get to that in a minute
I may have to adjust my camera because
this thing is so big I'm used to phones
really the same I guess
recyclable stuff inside here your Quick
Start Guide other reading material
manual and stuff put that aside for a
second your standard micro USB cable a
wall adapter u.s. that's the first one
this is the first device I've gotten
with the u.s. adapter so that's that's a
nice addition for me and nothing else in
the box so relatively simple here
nothing major nothing get too excited
about least inside the box except for
the device of course reading material
and power supply so there's that let's
move the box and everything out of the
way sorry I'm probably beating and
banging the mic here so let's take a
look at the device as you can see
immediately right off the bat you see
that this device shares the exact same
design that we're gonna see on the
Galaxy s4 and a very similar design to
the note 2 and the galaxy s3 it's the
same kind of rounded fake metal trim
I don't know how to explain it but it's
got the same design that all the other
galaxy devices have as you can see down
here you've got the same button set up
to menu a physical home button which is
raised a little different than the
others and a back button
no earpiece that is a light sensor and
your front-facing camera that is I
believe 1.2 megapixels and this is an
8-inch screen of course Galaxy Note 8.0
8-inch screen that is 1280 by 800 pixels
so that is a WXGA screen around the side
on the left side here we have a micro SD
card slot a little door there on the top
there is a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
on the right side we've got a microphone
power button volume rocker and an IR
blaster which is a neat little feature
the bottom has speakers micro USB and of
course the most important part of the
note line the S Pen so nothing terribly
interesting about the design it's it's
something nothing new it's it's
something we've seen before and of
course this is the 5 megapixel camera on
the back as you can see it has a little
hump there for the camera which is a
little disturbing considering this is a
tablet why do you need such a big hump
for a camera I don't know but the device
itself is fairly weighty it's not too
heavy but it's it's it's substantial
which is which is a good thing for a
tablet it's a 338 grams I believe which
is just 2 grams heavier than the Nexus 7
which is good because the Nexus 7 is
smaller so they make good weight or I
guess good use of the weight so this is
the Galaxy Note 8.0 and before we we end
this of course almost forgot to pull the
plastic and the last two or three
devices that I've unboxed have not made
any sound with the plastic so let's see
if this one I don't think it's gonna be
nothing a little little little noise but
nothing good maybe the back will be a
little different it feels like it might
be yeah yeah this is gonna be good now
just kidding just around the edges okay
I give up I give up all right so one
more time around the device without any
plastics on it just just a quick little
rundown on the hardware or not rundown
but just a walk through I don't know
show off I don't know what you would
call it anyway this is the Galaxy Note
8.0 thanks for watching and stay tuned
for more there will be much more
coverage on this device very very soon
thanks for watching and I hope you
enjoyed the video if you did be sure to
give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the
channel stay tuned for more Galaxy Note
8.0 coverage because there's plenty more
to come I'm Taylor Martin and I will see
you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
