phone compare I'm Taylor Martin this is
pocket now and this is the google nexus
4 versus the HTC first depending on who
you ask there is simply not enough stock
android devices available for purchase
sure you can hack stock android unto
virtually any android phone and even
some non android devices but that's not
the point a very small fraction of
android phones ever hit shelves how
google and vision the platform the one
line of devices we all count on to
always deliver the latest pure stock
android experience is the nexus line the
latest nexus phone being the nexus 4 of
course running unadulterated android 42
to another device that isn't necessarily
marketed as a stock android device is
the HTC first mainly because there are
some technical alterations at play
namely the HTC first is the first device
to ship with facebook home pre-installed
the first in the nexus 4 are geared
towards starkly different consumer bases
the first was intended for those seeking
a cheap smartphone solution with an
extensive facebook experience those who
don't necessarily need or want a
powerful mobile phone the nexus 4
targets the nerdiest of android nerds
the purists who want to hack and mod
their phone to no end but these two
devices actually have more in common
than what meets the eye both the nexus 4
and the HTC first feature exceptional
build quality they're made of quality
materials glass and soft touch plastic
the first is notably smaller than the
nexus for measuring 126 millimeters tall
by 65 millimeters wide and eight point
nine millimeters thick the nexus 4 with
its 4.7 inch display is 7.9 millimeters
taller three point seven millimeters
wider and 0.2 millimeters thicker it's
also 15.1 grams heavier than the first
the design of the first is the epitome
of minimal it's a matte finish designed
with no remarkable features the sides
and back are mostly bare and the face is
also minimal with Facebook and HTC's own
take on the typical Android button
scheme three capacitive buttons a
leftward arrow for back circle for home
and a short line for menu the nexus of
course features on-screen buttons so its
face is also fairly minimal but the
plastic chrome trim around the edges
chrome buttons and speckle glass pane on
the back
make it a more flashy device it also has
chamfered edges in the soft touch trim
both fit nicely in the hand and are
easily used one handed though the nexus
4 does call for a little more stretching
to reach opposing corners as far as
design and build quality concerns go the
Nexus 4 and HTC first are evenly matched
though we have to get the first a plus
one in the durability department as the
glass on the back of the Nexus 4 has
proven problematic for some we also have
to take a point away from the HTC first
for the awkwardly placed microUSB port
smack dab in the middle of the right
edge even though the Nexus 4 is often
considered a high-end device a flagship
if you will the specifications are
fairly evenly matched as well the Nexus
4 packs a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset 2 gigabytes of
RAM either 8 or 16 gigabytes of built-in
storage an 8 megapixel camera 1.3
megapixel front-facing shooter 20 100
million power battery and HSPA+
connectivity the first comes with a 1
point 4 gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon
400 chip one gigabyte of ram 16
gigabytes of fixed storage a 5 megapixel
primary camera 1 point 6 megapixel
front-facing camera two thousand million
power battery and HSPA+ and AT&amp;amp;T LTE
connectivity they also have your
standard connections Bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi
b/g/n and NFC but the Nexus 4 also has
wireless charging built-in with the
chief standard the Nexus 4 has a leg up
in horsepower but the first comes with
LTE on board and its display is
noticeably sharper and more vibrant the
HTC first display measures 4.3 inches
diagonally and hosts a 720p resolution
the Nexus 4 has a 4.7 inch display with
a resolution of 1280 by 768 pixels the
difference in density on the first and
Nexus 4 is 342 pixels per inch 2 318
pixels per inch respectively but the
density is only a small part of the
equation the colors pop a lot more on
the first Super LCD panel and it offers
wider viewing angles that said the
blacks on the Nexus 4's true HD IPS
panel are closer to true or black though
both are more of a dark grey in terms of
specs along we give the edge to the
Nexus 4 but make no mistake the HTC
first holds its own especially for being
considered a mid-range device out of the
box the software on these two devices
is quite different the Nexus 4 comes
with completely stock Android version
for up to two it gets its updates
directly from Google and is promised to
be among the first devices to get the
latest firmware updates it comes with
the traditional launcher we're all very
used to by now seven pages of which can
be filled with application icons folders
and widgets of your choosing you can
also set the wallpaper of course the HTC
first comes equipped with Facebook home
as the default launcher instead of the
home screen being filled with
applications or widgets it's filled with
your facebook news feed meaning the
content on your home screen is in the
hands of all of your facebook friends
and the pages you have liked and follow
the wallpaper is either the picture
associated with a friend status update
or their cover photo and applications
are accessed by pressing the home button
or tapping in a blank area on the home
screen and dragging your profile photo
over the apps button from there the user
defined quick access to favorite
applications appears and the full
application drawer is to the left
beneath these light customizations
however is a mostly pure version of
stock Android not the typical since you
I found almost other HTC devices as we
explained in a video earlier this week
you can either temporarily jump into the
stock launcher by selecting the more
icon at the bottom of the full app
drawer or you can disable facebook home
either partially or entirely you can set
facebook home to appear when you take
your phone out of standby as a makeshift
lockscreen meaning the stock launcher
will appear when you press the home
button or totally disable facebook home
in the facebook home settings if you do
this the software on the nexus 4 and HTC
first is nearly identical well it would
have been prior to android for
dot-to-dot to the first runs Android for
dot one dot two meaning there are some
newer features missing such as the quick
settings page in the notification shade
lock screen widgets daydream miracast
support the new camera interface with
HDR mode and photosphere and gesture
typing in the stock keyboard fortunately
a small point update would bring the
first up to speed also keep in mind that
this difference affects some application
support as well the first for example is
not compatible with one of our favorite
widgets that works just fine on the
Nexus 4 dashclock widget and that's
where the nexus 4 truly has a software
advantage over any other non-nexus
Android phone it will always throughout
its life span beyond the most current
software
the Nexus 4 with a quad-core CPU clearly
has more power behind it but that
doesn't mean the HTC first is dead in
the water not by a long shot in fact out
of the box the HTC first scores higher
in the quadrant standard synthetic
benchmark than the nexus for a 5525 to
the nexus 4's 45 53 in the end 22 test
however the nexus 4 took the cake
consistently scoring about 14,000 to the
first 6147 outside of benchmarks and in
the real world both devices performed
notably well they power through games
and everyday tasks without breaking a
sweat but facebook home on the HTC first
has its way of biking down the phone
from time to time we spent some time
with facebook home enabled and disabled
with it enabled the device legs
especially when returning home after
spending several minutes in an app with
facebook home disabled the phone runs
just fine rarely ever sputtering battery
life on the two devices is comparable as
well the nexus 4 manages just about a
day of moderate usage it needs to be
charged every night and if you're going
to go out at night you might want to top
off the battery before leaving
especially on days of heavier usage the
HTC first with its 2,000 milliamp hour
battery is about the same if not a
little better we're still putting it
through the test so keep an eye peeled
for the full review early next week for
more on the first battery life one major
difference between these two phones is
connectivity the nexus 4 sold unlocked
or by t-mobile comes with only hspa+
connectivity the speedtest.net
application doesn't work on the Nexus 4
so we tested the speeds by tethering to
an external device and running a speed
test and in the Charlotte metro area it
managed around four megabits per second
down and one megabit per second up the
AT&amp;amp;T LTE equipped HTC first reached
staggering speeds of 56 megabits per
second down and 18 megabits per second
up speeds clearly vary based on location
network and signal strength but the
first is clearly capable of much faster
speeds than the nexus 4 finally the
cameras on these two phones are
underwhelming to say the least the Nexus
4 has an 8-megapixel camera around back
our own branded minimum scored the Nexus
4 camera below average in his full
review in November and nothing has
changed the level of detail is under par
the saturation is low images appear warm
and unnatural and the software is a tad
clunky that said the stock Android for
two at two camera
several more features than the four dot
one dot to camera app and the 5
megapixel camera on the HDC first is
even worse than the nexus for the
saturation was higher and the colors
were more accurate but there's a serious
lack of detail in most photos it's all
so quick to blow out whites and anything
but perfect lighting neither of these
cameras are worth writing home about but
they get the job done fairly well it may
be easy to discredit the HTC first
seeing as it's not the most powerful
device to hit shelves of late but
neither was the Nexus 4 even when it was
brand new it's a pretty balanced fight
between these two what the first lacks
in power and performance it makes up for
it with a better display and LTE
connectivity and the Nexus 4 has an edge
in RAM camera performance wireless
charging and speedy updates directly
from Google if you're after a stock
android phone both the first and nexus 4
should at least be on your radar if
you're not a fan of the recent trend of
ultra large smartphones the HTC first
may be your best bet the only true
sacrifices are RAM and the camera but if
you need the latest software on your
phone massive development support and a
little extra display real estate for
some larger digits the Nexus 4 is the
way to go that about does it so if you
liked the video be sure to give it a
thumbs up and subscribe and follow send
all the normal places twitter google+
and facebook at pocket now stay tuned
for more HTC first coverage including a
full review early next week I'm sailor
Martin and I'll see you next time
you
