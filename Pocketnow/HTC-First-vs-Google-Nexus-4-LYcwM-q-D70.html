phone compare I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the Google Nexus 4
versus the HTC first depending on who
you ask
there is simply not enough stock Android
devices available for purchase sure you
can hack stock Android onto virtually
any Android phone and even some non
Android devices but that's not the point
a very small fraction of Android phones
ever hit shelves how Google envisioned
the platform the one line of devices we
all count on to always deliver the
latest pure stock Android experience is
the Nexus line the latest Nexus phone
being the Nexus 4 of course running
unadulterated Android 4.2.2 another
device that isn't necessarily marketed
as a stock Android device is the HTC
first mainly because there are some
technical alterations at play namely the
HTC first is the first device to ship
with Facebook home pre-installed the
first in the Nexus 4 are geared towards
starkly different consumer bases the
first was intended for those seeking a
cheap smartphone solution with an
extensive Facebook experience those who
don't necessarily need or want a
powerful mobile phone the Nexus 4
targets the nerdiest of Android nerds
the purists who want to hack and mod
their phone to no end but these two
devices actually have more in common
than what meets the eye both the Nexus 4
and the HTC first feature exceptional
build quality they're made of quality
materials glass and soft touch plastic
the first is notably smaller than the
Nexus 4 measuring one hundred and 26
millimeters tall by 65 millimeters wide
and eight point nine millimeters thick
the Nexus 4 with its 4.7 inch display is
7.9 millimeters taller 3.7 millimeters
wider and zero point two millimeters
thicker it's also 15.1 grams heavier
than the first the design of the first
is the epitome of minimal it's a matte
finish design with no remarkable
features the sides and back are mostly
bare and the face is also minimal with
Facebook and HTC's own take on the
typical Android button scheme three
capacitive buttons a leftward arrow for
back circle for home and a short line
for menu the Nexus of course features
on-screen buttons so its face is also
fairly minimal but the plastic chrome
trim around the edges Chrome buttons and
speckle glass pane on the back
make it a more flashy device it also has
chamfered edges in the soft touch trim
both fit nicely in the hand and are
easily used one-handed though the Nexus
4 does call for a little more stretching
to reach opposing corners as far as
design and build quality concerns go the
Nexus 4 and HTC first are evenly matched
though we have to get the first a plus
one in the durability Department as the
glass on the back of the Nexus 4 has
proven problematic for some we also have
to take a point away from the HTC first
for the awkwardly placed microUSB port
smack dab in the middle of the right
edge even though the Nexus 4 is often
considered a high-end device a flagship
if you will the specifications are
fairly evenly matched as well the Nexus
4 packs a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon s4 pro chipset 2 gigabytes of
RAM either 8 or 16 gigabytes of built-in
storage an 8 megapixel camera 1.3
megapixel front facing shooter 2100
milliamp hour battery and HSPA+
connectivity the first comes with a 1.4
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon 400 chip
1 gigabyte of RAM 16 gigabytes of fixed
storage a 5 megapixel primary camera 1.6
megapixel front-facing camera 2000
million power battery and HSPA+ and AT&amp;amp;T
LTE connectivity they also have your
standard connections Bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi
b/g/n and NFC but the Nexus 4 also has
wireless charging built in with the
chief standard the Nexus 4 has a leg up
in horse power but the first comes with
LTE onboard and its display is
noticeably sharper and more vibrant the
HTC first display measures 4.3 inches
diagonally and hosts a 720p resolution
the Nexus 4 has a 4.7 inch display with
a resolution of 1280 by 768 pixels the
difference in density on the first and
Nexus 4 is 342 pixels per inch to 318
pixels per inch respectively but the
density is only a small part of the
equation the colors pop a lot more on
the first Super LCD panel and it offers
wider viewing angles that said the
blacks on the Nexus 4 is true HD IPS
plus panel are closer to true or black
though both are more of a dark gray in
terms of specs alone we give the edge to
the Nexus 4 but make no mistake the HTC
first holds its own especially for it
being considered a mid-range device out
of the box the software on these two
devices
is quite different the Nexus 4 comes
with completely stock Android version
4.2.2 it gets its updates directly from
Google and is promised to be among the
first devices to get the latest firmware
updates it comes with a traditional
launcher we're all very used to by now
seven pages of which can be filled with
application icons folders and widgets of
your choosing you can also set the
wallpaper of course the HTC first comes
equipped with Facebook home as the
default launcher instead of the home
screen being filled with applications or
widgets it's filled with your Facebook
newsfeed meaning the content on your
home screen is in the hands of all of
your Facebook friends and the pages you
have liked and follow the wallpaper is
either the picture associated with a
friend status update or their cover
photo and applications are accessed by
pressing the home button or tapping in a
blank area on the home screen and
dragging your profile photo over the
apps button from there the user to find
quick access to favorite applications
appears and the full application drawer
is to the left
beneath these Lite customizations
however is a mostly pure version of
stock Android not the typical since UI
found almost other HTC devices as we
explained in a video earlier this week
you can either temporarily jump into the
stock launcher by selecting the more
icon at the bottom of the full app
drawer or you can disable facebook home
either partially or entirely you can set
facebook home to appear when you take
your phone out of standby as a makeshift
lock screen meaning the stock launcher
will appear when you press the home
button or totally disable Facebook home
in the Facebook home settings if you do
this the software on the Nexus 4 and HTC
first is nearly identical well it would
have been prior to Android 4.2.2 the
first runs Android 4.1.2 meaning there
are some newer features missing such as
the quick settings page in the
notification shade lock screen widgets
daydream miracast support the new camera
interface with HDR mode and photosphere
and gesture typing in the stock keyboard
fortunately a small point update would
bring the first up to speed also keep in
mind that this difference affects some
application support as well the first
for example is not compatible with one
of our favorite widgets that works just
fine on the nexus 4
- clock widget and that's where the
Nexus 4 truly has a software advantage
over any other non Nexus Android phone
it will always throughout its lifespan
beyond the most current software
the Nexus 4 with a quad-core CPU clearly
has more power behind it but that
doesn't mean the HTC first is dead in
the water not by a long shot in fact out
of the box the HTC first scores higher
in the quadrant standard synthetic
benchmarks than the Nexus 4 a 55 25 -
the Nexus fours 45 53 in the end - to
test however the Nexus 4 took the cake
consistently scoring above 14,000 to the
first 60 147 outside of benchmarks and
in the real world both devices performed
notably well they power through games
and everyday tasks without breaking a
sweat
but Facebook home only HTC first has its
way of bogging down the phone from time
to time we spent some time with Facebook
home enabled and disabled with it
enabled the device legs especially when
returning home after spending several
minutes in an app when Facebook home
disabled the phone runs just fine rarely
ever sputtering battery life on the two
devices is comparable as well the Nexus
4 manages just about a day of moderate
usage it needs to be charged every night
and if you're going to go out at night
you might want to top off the battery
before leaving especially on days of
heavier usage the HTC first with its
2000 milliamp hour battery is about the
same if not a little better we're still
putting it through the test so keep an
eye peeled for the full review early
next week for more on the firsts battery
life one major difference between these
two phones is connectivity the Nexus 4
sold unlocked or by t-mobile
comes with only HSPA+ connectivity the
speedtest.net application doesn't work
on the Nexus 4 so we tested the speeds
by tethering to an external device and
running a speed test and in the
Charlotte metro area it managed around 4
megabits per second down and one megabit
per second up the AT&amp;amp;T LTE equipped HTC
first reached staggering speeds of 56
megabits per second down and 18 megabits
per second up speeds clearly vary based
on location network and signal strength
but the first is clearly capable of much
faster speeds than the Nexus 4 finally
the cameras on these two phones are
underwhelming
to say the least the Nexus 4 has an 8
megapixel camera around back our own
branded minimum scored the Nexus 4
camera below average in his full review
in November and nothing has changed the
level of detail is under par the
saturation is low images appear warm and
unnatural and the software is a tad
clunky that said the stock Android 4.2
f/2 camera
several more features than the 4.1.2
camera app and the five megapixel camera
on the HTC burst is even worse than the
Nexus 4 the saturation was higher and
the colors were more accurate but
there's a serious lack of detail in most
photos it's also quick to blow out
whites and anything but perfect lighting
neither of these cameras are worth
writing home about but they get the job
done fairly well it may be easy to
discredit the HTC first seeing as it's
not the most powerful device to hit
shelves of late but neither was the
Nexus 4 even when it was brand new it's
a pretty balanced fight between these
two what the first lacks in power and
performance it makes up for it with a
better display and LTE connectivity and
the Nexus 4 has an edge in RAM camera
performance wireless charging and speedy
updates directly from Google if you're
after a stock Android phone both the
first and Nexus 4 should at least be on
your radar if you're not a fan of the
recent trend of ultra large smartphones
the HTC first may be your best bet the
only true sacrifices are RAM and the
camera but if you need the latest
software on your phone massive
development support and a little extra
display real estate for some larger
digits the Nexus 4 is the way to go
that about does it so if you liked the
video be sure to give it a thumbs up and
subscribe and follow us in all the
normal places Twitter Google+ and
Facebook and pocket now stay tuned for
more HTC first coverage including a full
review early next week
I'm sailor Martin and I'll see you next
time
