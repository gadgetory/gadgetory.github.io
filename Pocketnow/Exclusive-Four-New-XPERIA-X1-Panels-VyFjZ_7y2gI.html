pacquiao calm and today I'm going to
show you four new panels for the sony
ericsson xperia x1 now these panels are
beta version so you won't be able to
download them for a little while but
i'll run through them real fast as you
can see what they're all about then the
first one is the CNN panel and that's of
course the CNN news corporation so it's
going to be your news and weather and
the first thing to do is actually go to
weather and the cool thing about this is
if you want to see what the weather is
like on the globe you can select any
area of the planet it will actually give
you a weather forecast so I'll just like
North America and then you can just take
your stylus and point to an area where
you want to see the weather so if one to
go here is double-click it will load the
weather and it will give you the current
forecast of the major cities in that
area that you've selected so we have
like seattle and spokane portland you
again the northwest area of the united
states so let's go back so in order to
add a city we can just click here and we
can select a major city it really
doesn't support smaller cities but
anything like if you want to say Tokyo
we can select something like that and it
gives Tokyo so there we go and if we
wanted to see what the weather is like
in Tokyo and you scroll down
double-click it'll give us a five-day
forecast as soon as it's done loading
and if we click it again it'll give us a
more in-depth forecast of each day so we
can select that you know give you the
air quality UV index all that great
stuff so let's go back so if you see
this little green square at the bottom
this is actually a news ticker so we
will periodically update and if you want
to read what it says just click read
taker and it will load that story and
the cool thing about the articles
actually supports flip scrolling so we
can mount like most HTC devices because
the X period of course is made by HTC it
does support that flick scroll and the
articles give you a picture for the most
part some do not but what can he do well
just go back to actually the main page
and this is going to give you your top
stories and will give you world news
business sports entertainment if we
click here we can get to a tab format
which we can select those as well
another feature of this panel is I
report which gives you the ability to
send a news article directly to CNN so
you can send them a photo or a video or
something that's currently occurring
that you've witnessed so we can just go
back and so all the way over gives us
our options and we can select our
article font so I / medium so I chose
that your home headlines so you can pick
which headlines you want to see on your
home page if you don't like sports or
entertainment you can delete those so
we'll just close that the unit system so
if you're inside the United States most
likely use the imperial system and your
license agreement as well as your about
information so i'm going to show you the
next panel up and that's actually going
to be the skype panel so this guy panels
pretty basic it's just the pocket pc
version of skype so if we wanted to make
a phone calls within our Wi-Fi or 3G
network we can do that you can also chat
for free but we can make a phone call
right now to the test service so you'll
see how easy it is toward
okay so that's that so there's not only
too much on this panel let's see if we
close this this is the only feature of
the panel is it gives you this cloud
scrolling animal thing but I don't
really know how useful is panel is but
we'll go back in the next panel is on
the road this one's pretty cool and the
first tab on the go panel gives us a
speedometer as well as an average miles
per hour if you're outside the US you
can change the kilometers you can track
navigation so it will automatically
launch Google Maps so that's pretty neat
if you want to use navigation now the
only thing that's kind of disappointing
about this so far is the default
navigation as always google maps so for
me person that likes garmin it's pretty
annoying to have that tab right there
you can track your history so if i want
to enable my tracking current device it
will actually give us a history of our
track so if i select this track right
here it'll actually give me the
information departure and destination as
well as average speed and distance and
time and if i click here it will
actually give me a google map image of
my trip and I can email that or send it
SMS or mms I guess it would be because
it's an image to whoever I want to see
where I've been and what I've been doing
so that's pretty neat if you want to if
you're planning a trip and you want to
show people where you're going and where
you've been ok so we'll just go back I
did you select tracking we just click
this button here so the next tab on this
panel is our media player so if we want
to select a file we can just go back
play from this folder select a folder so
a music a song here and we can state
play and it will start playing that of
course that's just one of the default
songs and windows mobile and we can
shuffle and increase volume switch
tracks all that good stuff so the next
next tab is our phone and this will give
you a call history so
can go down and see our call history go
back up and it'll also give us a dial
pad so if we wanted to call someone we
can do that as well and it's actually
very touch friendly so that's pretty
neat and if we do want to call this
number which is course faith we can just
call this but the only thing about this
panel is it's going to take us back to
our default xperia phone interface so
we'll just end that and go back ok and
the final panel is the my topia panel so
let's select that my topia is an online
game program that allows you to play
video games online and i'm actually
going to switch the screen over to
landscape mode because the games are
actually in landscape so we'll just wait
for this to load here ok there you go
and there's only two games available
right now so we can go play bingo ok so
you will actually have to set up an
online account and you can do that
through your phone or online so just
select single player here a new game
select fast you'll want to buy into play
this game you can select up to three
different three different bingo cards so
we'll just play one right now and of
course you can also play bingo and you
here free space so we'll just click this
right now and you can also play poker if
you see this right here it says more
games and you click it it gives you
options to play different games but when
you click on them it won't actually
download or play them because they're
not installed on this phone hopefully in
the future they'll actually have those
games so just go single player
and the cool thing about my topia is you
actually play against real online
players so you can add your friends if
you like and you win what is known as
gold or silver on the might w website
and so we'll just go back to our panels
and i'll show you how they work in
landscape mode as well
and so as you can see all the panels
work in landscape mode as well and we
can squish the shuffle shuffle view and
they work a desk was that way too so
that you can actually see them sideways
so thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
