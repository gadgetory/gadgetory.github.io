on a public beta microsoft plans for its
own smartphone business kind of get
revealed and t-mobile's new on carrier
plans to reimagine how international
roaming should be I'm high Meadow
Ravenna and can it be that it's already
Thursday does it mean that I can already
start celebrating this is parking out
daily the official lucid a start with
t-mobile and John leisure as well the
company has just unveiled its new
uncarrier plan and it's called mobile
without borders and it literally takes
it that way if you fly to Mexico or
Canada the idea is that you'll be able
to roam without the needs of Rome
meaning your phone will work as it
should full LTE connectivity unlimited
calls a limited text depending on
whatever plan you have but yeah it
should behave as if you were in the
United States which is a definite blow
to AT&amp;amp;T and every other carrier that
goes crazy when ever you go roaming with
the bill other official news have apple
the company has just launched its public
beta for iOS 9 + OS 10 El Capitan or
whatever you want to call that thing as
of now you'll be able to test whatever
we are currently testing with beta 3
which is great Apple music is their
apple news is there and all you have to
do is sign up the beta program is free
for everyone mixing the scripture to get
started and for those of you that are
wondering exactly what blackberry is
planning to do with the two android
offerings that we've seen on leaks well
the company has silently just registered
android secure comm that particular
domain even though the company has just
registered a partnership eagle for more
secure options for android we wonder if
the company is planning to do sort of
like a black bow and approach meaning
the two new phones that are coming or
going to be the most secured versions of
Android and this is the selling point
for these phones that'll be really
interesting and yes the news that had
everyone's skeptical yesterday for the
future of windows 10 mobile or at least
the Lumia lineup is a you know Microsoft
and a source that's close to Satya
Nadella that has to not be mentioned is
claiming that microsoft plans to
continue in its fill in business for two
years with a new strategy we already
heard with a strategy
is which is enterprise phones and
high-end phones etc and the consumer
base etc and it's easier the company is
going to try things for two years and if
things don't work for two years we
wonder if that's going to be the end of
windows 10 mobile which we doubt it'll
most likely just fully kill the Lumia
which is really sad and finally for the
hot rumors of the day once rumors hit
the wall street journal you could pretty
much say that they're going to happen
when it comes to apple and well the wall
street journal is claiming three things
number one that apple is ordering 90
million units from its suppliers because
it thinks it's going to sell that much
and well it's old 74 million iphones
with the launch of the iphone 6 so i do
believe that's going to happen the
second thing is that for such technology
is coming for the iphone success so
expect that and the third is that there
will be a fourth color option a rose
gold color option for those of you that
had all that money to spend on that
apple watch edition model i'm sure a lot
of you did yeah but yeah it seems that
these things are coming for the next
generation iphone and it does lead me to
the question of the day do you think
that for such technology and a rose gold
iphone are gonna be enough for Apple to
sell 90 million units in my case I think
it's gonna take more than that like for
example a better camera better battery
life but leave us a comment down below
what do you think and friends you know
the drill if you want to get the nose
earlier before this video was filmed
issue follow us on talking out comments
a sharp turn to channel as well you
