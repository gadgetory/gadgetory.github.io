reporting for pocket now and right now
we are looking at the sprint HTC touch
diamond ooh probably going to have to
turn off the lights so I could show you
the better main menu on the page now as
you know the HTC touch diamond on our
previous reviews shows you that you can
pretty much do a lot of touch on it
which is you know basically what it is
so we don't have to go into that
basically we're going to be looking
today on what it does for the Sprint
network so we are going to start by
scrolling through the bottom menu just
like so there you go male sprint TV
internet whether settings it's got a
whole array of things that you can you
can pretty much access from the main
menu there's also a main menu button
right below the home where if you are
anywhere doing anything you can just
press on end it'll take you back to the
home so you don't have to feel so lost
anyways as you see on the front screen
there's a big clock call history and
calendar you can actually take the clock
out of the way so it's not so big and
all you have to really do is flick up
okay we got we went to sprint music
sorry this thing is very very sensitive
that's the only thing I'm going to say
about it but you know it takes a little
bit of getting used to so let's start
there you go that totally works great
and you can also put it back if you want
to put the big clock on there but that's
basically what it is right now
okay right now we are going to look at
the people section by simply clicking on
and with our finger right now we don't
have anybody yet on the phone book but
as you can see it's very very easy to
input somebody's information on there so
you could save it on your phone book and
at the same time you could also set
pictures and all sorts of icons so you
know what that person is and just to get
out of that and just simply press the
home button and that's we're done and
then next we're going to look at the
messaging obviously we don't have any
messages because we just opened the
phone right now just do it you ladies
know by the way if any ladies are
watching this right now I'm attempting
to flick and control this screen with
the use of my fingernail which is a
little bit long and it's hard okay
there's a little bit of a learning curve
that you need to learn from this but
it's no more than the learning curve
that you would have would let's say an
iphone or a prada phone it's really not
that bad anyways that was the messaging
really really really easy stuff we're
just trying to get out of some stuff
here because I'm obviously looking at
this like you would be looking at it has
your opening the box next up we are
going to be looking at the music section
of things you go past people what I was
in videos sprint music now this comes
loaded with two songs just to be able to
test it out so we are going to try just
to see and try and test something out
okay that song really sucked so we're
going to turn it off right now there you
go then we're going to go to next icon
down on the bottom which is photos and
videos and I really really like this
section because it's where you kind of
get to practice you're flicking and just
using your your finger or in my case my
fingernail I just kind of flick flake
flake it's really nice it's um like I
said there's a little bit of a learning
curve on this one folks but once you get
used to it it's like nothing and you can
click on a particular picture if you
want here we know there you go and you
can click on the screen again now list
of options are going to come by and you
can go back and email a picture you can
do whatever you want with it and
obviously as you take more pictures and
videos they will be available for you to
see on this section next up we are going
to be looking at the sprint TV
application on the bottom so you have to
do is simply scroll over to the sprint
TV and launch it the thing I like about
sprint TV is that it's really really
fast Sprint's connections are definitely
solid very good and look at how fast
download it it's almost like watching
recorded TV really but and in annex live
feature so for this one we are going to
try and go to disney channel check that
out hum i think we have to click on it
again sometimes you know you have to
click on something twice to get it to
work there you go and let's watch hannah
montana
you know a lot of you people are fans of
Hannah Montana and let's just try and
click on one episode meet me on the
bottom or whatever um here we go and
look at that bar on the bottom go it's
very quick typically the load times are
about 30 seconds to really less than a
minute and we'll start to see an episode
and if we tilt the screen to the side
the Excel lomita on the phone will
actually make it full screen very looks
like an iphone guys and it's pretty
quick too now we're going to choke it
back to normal mode and we're going to
go to options on the bottom and all you
have to do is exit and that pretty much
gets you out of there right now we're
going to check out the internet browser
on the phone the one thing that I really
like about this touch diamond and its
partnership and spread is browsing the
internet is going to be really fast
thanks to sprint connections and as you
can see it's already built in with a
couple of things like YouTube and
Facebook which is good for a lot of
people but we'll look at YouTube right
now because apparently everybody wants
to go to youtube so there you go as you
can see it's loading up pretty quick
pretty quick it's actually very very
fast on sprint I haven't really found
any other area that loads up and just as
quick so well there's a lot of things
that you could search for there's many
options that you can do but right now
just to show everything we're going to
look at any type of video there you go
just going to turn it sideways so we can
see it full screen as you can see it is
loading up pretty darn quick and here we
go
that was just great yeah we're just
gonna turn we're gonna hit be a hit the
screen all over again and by hitting the
screen all over again there's going to
be option we have to press stop rewind
and we're going to set stop on this one
there you go that was pretty quick and
you can always just press the back arrow
which is on which is one of the hard
keys on the phone and what that does is
it's going to take you back out of
YouTube and on to the home menu another
thing that I love about this sprint
touch diamond is that it comes with a
weather feature and when you click on
the weather it's going to say what you
have immediately and there's going to be
a five-day forecast on the bottom but
you can actually flick on the screen and
it will show you different areas of the
country or whatever you set it to and
it'll show you the temperature and all
that stuff so it's really really really
helpful and if you click on the five-day
forecast on the bottom like for Chicago
it's going to show you everything that's
going to be happen in the next five days
and it actually um updates for you every
couple minutes or so so it's always a
curator right now we're going to look at
the settings section settings is pretty
much standard on most phones you'll see
data sound wallpaper communications
whatever anything you can do on it you
can pretty much look to settings for
that but we're just going to change the
wallpaper for now just to show you guys
how easy it is to do since we don't have
any pictures yet we're going to go to my
pictures go to internal storage and
we're going to check out the preloaded
pictures that they already have and
we'll pick a design
now you see the homepage with your
favorite picture of course you can
change it any way you want and that's
that for settings right now then we're
going to look at the last thing that
they have on the bottom scroll bar and
that is I do believe program this is a
little bit more complicated and I'm sure
windows mobile users will understand
exactly what I'm talking about but this
is the program screen and we can just
you can add remove programs on here this
does come with four gigabytes of memory
and storage space so you have a lot of
room both programs and that's basically
it for a little review on the sprint HTC
touch diamond if anybody is interested
any more in-depth analysis of the touch
diamond feel free to go into our website
and look up the review done by our
senior editor Adam Lane it's amazing
it's fabulous and it covers just about
every nook and cranny of this wonderful
phone just on a side note on a personal
side note I enjoyed this phone a lot and
I can't wait to see what else it can do
the touchflo is amazing the flicks and
everything is great it takes a little
bit of getting used to maybe a couple
minutes or so but once you're used to it
I don't think you'll ever go back to a
normal phone also appearance-wise it's
very sleek very comfortable totally
appealing to both men and women and it's
just a great phone overall and the fact
that the Sprint speeds and their data
connections are really really reliable
and fast makes this phone a total joy to
work with so that's that for the sprint
touch diamond edition this is Jenna
Gonzalez reporting for pocket now enjoy
your day
