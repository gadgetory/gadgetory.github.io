pocketnow.com the swype keyboard first
showed up on the samsung omnia now the
swype keyboard can be found on almost
every samsung device plus the kyocera
echo some other devices out there you
can also download it for any Android
phone if you go to swype com there's a
beta and what swipe swipe lets you do is
slide your finger across letters on the
screen to input text it's extremely fast
and now HTC on the sensation 4g has
their own version of swype call trace
let's talk about it in this video are
you okay so with a little bit of
practice you can get very very fast and
entering text with swipe and swipe is
the original so what you're about to see
from HTC is kind of a a copy of the same
idea so if we want to type this is a
test this is a test you can see how fast
you can be with swype what's great about
it is you can use it with a thumb when
you're walking down the street and you
can keep your other hand free to do
other things so you could say you know
today is Tuesday and even if you're very
inaccurate swipe has good intelligence
built in so it seems to always get it
right which is really fantastic about
swipe and if you want to use swype like
a regular keyboard you can slow down
type strange words like so now HTC has
come out with something called tres4 the
HTC Sensation 4G this is not available
on the european version of the sensation
only the u.s. t-mobile version and it
works been basically the same there are
some settings associated with it so we
slide our finger and say this is a test
I've found HTC's version 2 not to be as
responsive as intelligent as swipe it
sometimes just as you saw right there it
just doesn't get it today is Tuesday and
it's yeah it's just not as not as
accurate but with a little bit of
practice it gets pretty good now what we
can do is we can go into the settings
here and take a look at the settings
associated with what they call
trace so over here it says trace
keyboard we can tap on that and trace
color we can change green black blue
light gray so this is kind of cool you
can change that the color to maybe stand
out more white probably has a lot of
contrast and then you can turn trace on
or off there's really no reason you'd
want to turn this thing off I mean it
doesn't really use any extra ram or
resources it just sort of works in the
background if we jump back into the
email app and go to type on the keyboard
now we get the white line it's probably
best to use a darker line as you just
saw there I want to swipe across the
keys and the keyboard didn't know if I
was trying to sort of type with my
thumbs and use individual letters or if
I wanted to use the trace functionality
so you have to tap and hold it's a
little bit of a delay a little bit
slower than swype but it's pretty cool
if you're getting a sensation 4g and you
don't want to have to go and download
swype you got it built in with a version
of the keyboard called trace let us know
what you think about swipe and trace and
if you use these keyboards that don't
require you to lift your finger and just
trace letters on the keyboard pretty
cool concept some people like it some
people don't let us know in the comments
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
