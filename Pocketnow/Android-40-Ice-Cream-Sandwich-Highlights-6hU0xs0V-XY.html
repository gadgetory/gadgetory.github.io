since we've had a couple days to play
around with the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
which runs Ice Cream Sandwich or Android
4.0 what have we found that's different
we'd like to show you let's go take a
look so generally speaking the first
thing you're gonna see when you turn
your phone on is the lockscreen
how you can get in and start using your
phone well that's a little bit different
with Ice Cream Sandwich so let's start
there
first and foremost the system lock or
the screen lock can be set to none so
you push the button and you're up and
running that's probably the fastest way
slide that's similar to what we're used
to all show you that in just a minute
face unlock now face unlock is a new
feature in Ice Cream Sandwich as long as
you have a front facing camera that is
supported by ICS you can set your face
up to unlock it I'll show you a little
bit about that right now it's a little
bit slower than you might like and it's
only about 50 to 80 percent accurate and
that accuracy goes down quite a bit in
low-light scenarios which ironically I
found myself in quite a bit pattern is
what we're used to with the pattern
where you can just draw a pattern on the
screen a little bit different look to it
pin is your personal identification
number and password is your password so
not a lot changes there let's look at
slide first so we'll select that we'll
go back home and I'm going to turn the
phone off and I'll turn it back on and
now you can see I've got this little
lock with a hint telling me to go over
to the side it shows you my carriers
t-mobile the time my name email address
and the date so we'll go ahead and
unlock that now if you notice I've got
this little ring that has a couple
action items on it over here I've got my
camera so if I want to launch my camera
act right away I can just take it over
there or on the side I have my unlock to
just take me to the home screen and of
course it timed out there because I was
talking too long so I'll just drag it
there and we're unlocked to get in and
change that we're gonna skip around a
little bit here to change that you grab
your notification tray and pull it down
and you've got your little setting
sliders right there at the top tap that
you can get into it that's the fastest
way to get into settings
course you can still do it through the
app drawer but that's probably the
fastest under security that's where we
were just looking and screen lock that's
where we can set this information up so
let's go ahead and look at pattern we'll
draw a pattern here we'll do that
pattern continue that pattern confirm
great turn the phone off turn it back on
and here's my pattern just kind of small
dots not the large ones that were used
to but we can draw it up and over and
I've set it so that it vibrates on touch
and it doesn't show the pattern so if
somebody's looking over your shoulder
they won't see what your pattern is but
of course you can change that just like
with the previous versions as well let's
see if we can do face unlock a demo here
for you really quick if you want to set
up face unlock there are a few things to
keep in mind one it's not as secure as a
pattern a pin or a password a twin
brother or sister or sibling who looks
like you could potentially unlock your
phone with their face because they look
very similar to you and the data that's
used to identify your face is kept
private on your phone so it's not being
uploaded to Google to create some kind
of a huge biometric face recognition
system of all the people who use Android
you don't need to worry about that let's
go ahead and set it up now what you'll
see here is a ring of dots and you'll
see me with the camera here so it's not
going to recognize me and I've tried
this a few times before and it just
doesn't do it so I'm gonna have to do it
off camera but I'll show you what
happens maybe it would work this time it
goes around and recognizes your face and
various different components to it data
points if you will when you continue
you're asked if you want to set up a
pattern or a pin and go ahead and set up
a pattern again we'll do the same one
continue confirm it and we're good to go
now when we turn this off I got a hold
it real close here so hopefully it'll
recognize me takes a minute well there
you go usually it takes a minute to turn
on the camera in which case you've got
this kind of black rectangle right there
in the middle
that's while it's initializing the
camera but once we do that BAM right
there you're in this is actually a
little bit quicker than most so kind of
nice I'm going to turn that
because I think it might have the camera
in there and then gonna set it to none
but really kind of a cool way to do a
screen unlock let's get into more of our
notification tray now so this is the
home screen we do have our new google
search bar which is persistent across
all the screens there we've got our doc
bar on the bottom that you're familiar
with we've got our common or persistent
buttons down on the bottom I'll get to
some of that in just a minute
but up at the top we've got our
notification bar bluetooth is on Wi-Fi
is on my HSPA+ and network or my gsm
rather is on batteries hi and there is
my clock using the the new Roboto font
so very nice let me go ahead and send an
email to myself and we'll see that
notification show up right here in the
notification bar in just a moment so now
I've got a new notification I've got a
gmail up here when I pull down this
notification tray you can see I've got a
message from me it shows you that I have
three emails and if I want to dismiss
them all I can hit the X or if I want to
I can simply swipe to dismiss now what
you also saw in there was a little
Avatar if I had my own picture set up it
would have showed my face right there
which is really kind of nice if you've
got four or five emails that shows you
who they are right there if it's a Gmail
like that one it kind of consolidates
all into one if it's corporate email and
whatnot it'll stack them a little bit
better but really nice really easy to
just swipe to dismiss it's very very
fluid so next let's get to the next cool
thing and that's your app drawer which
really isn't a drawer anymore so I
tapped on that and now we've got our
apps and our widgets and our market just
right there really quick you can jump
between them apps widget market this is
now a horizontal paginate er so you can
see where you are on the screen down at
the bottom I'd like it if that persisted
a little bit more but it doesn't that's
all my apps next it switches over to
widgets and widgets are essentially the
same thing as apps now you can just tap
and drag and drop so we'll go ahead and
do that let's put feeder
out here I don't have any room on that
screen so let's come over here to this
one and I'll drop it right in place
there you go
let's do Dilbert that's always fun I can
find Dilbert or hers Dilbert he's right
down here so now I have a daily Dilbert
feeder widget on my home screen and I've
got my YouTube widget that's going out
and getting my my latest feed there so
really kind of cool now let's say I
don't want well we got to switch over to
something else let's say that I don't
want this Way's widget on the home
screen I mean I like it there but let's
say I need something else there okay
let's go ahead and go back to the home
screen yes I want to turn it off I want
that to be down here so it's accessible
all the time say with my web browser so
I'm going to tap and hold and just drop
that right down on to my browser let it
go now I have a folder that I can name
just very simply we're going to call
this blah I don't know what we want to
call it so we'll just call it blah we
can say done there we go we can also
reorder the widgets by just or excuse me
the icons by dragging and dropping them
so really kind of cool now whatever you
put first is up first and it remembers
that order you know what I decided I
really don't like that so I'm just going
to go ahead and change it back if I can
to to the home screen and it should let
me drop it right there which it does and
now I'm back so very easy way to create
folders and and move them around and
work with them the last thing we're
gonna look at is back into settings okay
so we're gonna go into settings again
dragging that down hitting settings now
the first thing you're going to notice
is this is a lot shorter than what
you're used to we had tons and tons and
tons of settings in here before now we
have them broken up Wireless and
networks has the top or most frequently
used settings we can go into more here's
our device stuff there's our personal
stuff and system just a very basic very
fun let's go into Wireless and networks
because that does have a more we can
switch into airplane mode VPN can turn
on tethering or a portable hotspot right
there turn on and off NFC Android Beam
is of course
the cool new feature that lets you tap
your phone to the back of another phone
to send stuff they don't have another
NFC phone in hand just yet so I can't
show you that feature but it's really
cool Wi-Fi direct if anybody knows what
this is please let us know in the
comment I haven't found any information
on it at all and then mobile networks
this is of course your your carrier
settings and whatnot if you want to
enable data roaming so similar to what
you've seen in the past overall very
nice very fast very fluid you can see
just how quick things are in here
there's your you've gone to the edge and
there's no more to see animation it's
really quick really nice getting back to
the Galaxy Nexus very vibrant screens
very bright very pretty very true blacks
I like it quite a bit and of course the
speed is just all over the place it's
not as fast as some of the galaxy s twos
but it's not supposed to be this is your
Google feature phone with its nice
curved screen and curved back and of
course Ice Cream Sandwich on it so a
little bit of a detailed rundown on some
of the newer things that you can see
with Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich if
you've got something that you liked
about this or that you don't like let us
know in the comments of the video down
below of course if you have not yet
subscribed to our video channel make
sure you do that so you can stay up to
date on all the other cool Nexus and
Android Ice Cream Sandwich news and
information and if you like seeing this
kind of stuff so you don't have to go
out and plunk down a big chunk of change
on the phone yourself give the video a
big thumbs up for PocketNow showing off
Ice Cream Sandwich
