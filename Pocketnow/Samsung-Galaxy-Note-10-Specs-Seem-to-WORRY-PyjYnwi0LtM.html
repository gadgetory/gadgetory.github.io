templates will bring the processor or
the accessories that we're expecting in
the box if you're in the market for the
original switch hold it because it seems
that there's something good coming soon
and Apple is telling their suppliers to
get ready for 3d sensing and their
future cameras I'm high in memory that I
end up yes I love this shirt too this is
probably my favorite those are you
interested I'll leave a link in the
first comment down below this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with deals yes I know prime day is over
there are still some deals on Amazon
Prime they're just not worth it think
about it is those of you interested
other stores everywhere had deals at the
same time one of them being eBay right
now we've got a trusted seller offering
Google chromecast for $25 which is a
good 30% off I love the chromecast you
can learn more in the description now
let's talk about Nokia as the company
continues to surprise this time with a
successor to the nokia 2.1 I guess it
would be the 2.2 and even if
specifications aren't necessarily what I
would call fantastic it's a hundred and
thirty bucks we're talking about Android
one a 5.7 inch display a removable 3000
milliamp hour battery 32 gigs of
expandable storage a headphone jack yes
I know and a rear 13 megapixel camera
surely it does include a mediatek helio
a 22 SOC and three gigs of ram so not
necessarily the most powerful but again
Amazon and Best Buy have it for a
hundred and thirty bucks that's a really
good gift you can learn more in the
description as well and how about if we
talk about Apple and some rumors from a
trusted source claiming that the five
color logo you know the rainbow roll
logo that was very popular in the 90s is
apparently coming back it's been many
years since Apple has used this logo and
we're expecting it to be some sort of a
limited edition so we're not sure if
it's going to launch with Mac's or
iPhones we've got the source claiming
that it could come with the product red
we're not sure we'll keep you posted
it's interesting that Apple wants to go
retro like why and since we're talking
about Apple we've got sources also
claiming that the company is already
requesting supplies for time-of-flight
sensors for
next iPhones not these ones but the ones
that are coming next year according to
supply change sources Apple has a stir
suppliers to ready VCSEL or these sell
components for their time-of-flight
cameras that will allow them to scan up
to 15 feet away from the device Apple is
set to have two-year lead and 3d sensing
over their competitors and Sony maybe
the time of flight supplier
even though Apple has been investing in
other companies as well along with this
we should expect 5g a our glasses and
better Apple maps that use the cameras
for its full potential because yes the
whole idea of using this time of flight
is not for photography it's for AR yeah
and how about if we discuss the future
of the Nintendo switch I'm actually
starting to consider that Nintendo's
switch light I'm just not buying any
more digital games because I don't know
what the feature is gonna be and to how
you're gonna be able to play these games
between them but for those of you that
want to buy the standard Nintendo switch
I recommend you wait wait until August
because the comparison page for a
Nintendo in Japan is apparently already
showing that there is a device with
better battery life that's coming so the
source claims August it seems that it
will be the launch for Japan in August
and we should expect Lee in the United
States as well no design changes this is
pretty much what we saw in the FCC where
better specifications are being offered
so I'm really looking forward to that
switch more than the light but we'll see
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10
and what to expect in two particular
areas I mean we saw the announcement of
the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 plus we've
heard that a sous is going to be the
first company launching the ROG phone to
with it which is rumored to be announced
over the next week or two so we were
expecting that the Galaxy Note 10 was
going to bring this processor according
to sources no apparently the processors
not going to be ready until late this
year meaning we don't expect that a sous
phone to be launched early either and
the Galaxy Note 10-4 August or
apparently Snapdragon 855 which is not
bad but not the latest and greatest
because there will be a newer one we
expect that to come with the pixels now
and it seems that that's not the only
thing that we're not getting
apparently we read that we were getting
the 50 watt charger in the box for the
plus variant now we hear that no that
it's gonna come with a standard one that
we get on the galaxy s 10 5g which is
not a bad charger but it's not 50 watts
and you would have to pay $50 or 50
euros more if you want that faster
charger let us know in the comments down
below I mean what do you think do you
think this is a good idea or not I think
that Samsung is like shooting themselves
in the foot if there is a newer better
chip they're one of the suppliers I mean
they've got a strong partnership with
Qualcomm why not figure out a way to get
that plus variant on the Galaxy Note
10.1 a turtle at processor in and just
launch the note 10 that's me and
obviously yes come on Samsung we need
faster charging in the box I mean one
plus one plus that's trying so much less
money than you guys is offering the
fastest charger in the market right now
with a one plus seven Pro this is just
me we'd love to know what you think in
the comments down below
