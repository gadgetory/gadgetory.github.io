and we get details on what it might be
Google bring some major discounts to
some of its mobile products an apple
seems ready to bring some more 3d touch
enhancements to the iphone very soon I'm
hi meri behna and if you haven't watched
the movie major-league from back in the
80s I highly suggest you do this is
parking out daily the official news
today begin with Google as the company
has just brought some major discounts to
it's a product portfolio at least in
mobile if you're interested in products
like the Huawei watch for example you
can now get it fifty dollars off at the
store and if you're interested in the
devices like the Nexus 5 actually could
also get it with a minor discount but
then again if you're looking at the
Nexus 6 speed sadly that is not on the
list but anyways these discounts aren't
really bad at all then when it comes to
teazers LG has already begun teasing mwc
2016 and this is rather interesting as
the company has usually announced its G
updates further along during the year
and instead it seems that it might make
it to mwc which is again odd for the
company but hey we even hear rumors that
there will be a removable battery on
this film but you will actually be able
to slide it from the bottom sort of like
an old HTC phone from back in the day so
stay tuned this could be hot and
particularly at a time when the galaxy
s7 will also be announced and as Lenovo
continues to peel the onion when it
comes to the future of Motorola those of
you that were worried about the company
we know what will happen for the next
two or three years but then again we
also hear that devices like the Moto G
and Moto e aren't going anywhere if
anything the company is actually going
to invest on keeping these devices
further because obviously this is part
of the product portfolio that actually
made Motorola popular over the last few
years so stay tuned let's see exactly
what these changes might be as well the
spotlight over Apple those of you that
continue to enjoy 3d touch up to a
certain degree with the iphone 6s seems
that the company is bringing more
upgrades to it as of iOS 9.3 which
already reached beta for developers not
exactly sure how Apple plans to enhance
3 touch in the case of third-party
developers that haven't still taken
advantage of this technology but
hopefully 9
three might do something about that and
finally the very interesting rumors of
today have to do with the Apple watch
too as we hear more about this March
event for Apple it seems the company is
prepping to announce the Apple watch too
in addition to the iphone mini and the
ipad air three and it does make a lot of
sense as all three devices are actually
already dated they are due for an update
but then again in the case of the Apple
watch it does lead me to the question
today what would you change from the
current Apple watch that you would like
to see on the future model in march in
my case a persistent always on display
for example better materials in the case
of that I onyx glass which was just
terrible at the bottom and a cheaper
price tag but definitely it was a
comment down below we look to know your
opinion friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the nose
