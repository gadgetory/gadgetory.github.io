Pacquiao calm and we're going to take a
look at the new outlook calm email
program for Android from Microsoft let's
check it out so here I have I've started
a setting up my outlook calm email we
have some options you can do a nickname
you can see how many messages you want
to from how many days push
and there's my truncating and I want to
sync contacts and calendar there's no
tasks here and there it is I got my
hotmail up there now all emails if I
want to do multiple accounts nice to
home so from here I can add another
account and we just have to enter the
username password and then go through
those same options again so what we're
looking at it's very basic you got check
boxes over here and then you get your
big old gray buttons at the bottom
similar to the older Android versions
and we have a Menu key down here and we
get the big blocky buttons again here
and here's our account settings again we
can change some stuff up here sync the
calendar contacts
there's the same setting twice we also
have a quiet time which is nice you can
set it to not announce and download
emails at certain times and that's about
it for the settings and we have search
here but you can only do contact search
so you'll see there's barely anything
from Outlook com that is made it to this
app it's really just a regular email
program there's no suite there's no
flagging there's no categories and
contact categories don't even sync with
the People Hub right there and the
calendar works but overall there's you
know really nothing different from what
you would get with a native exchange
account so I could set up my outlook on
email as a normal exchange account with
the regular email program and there's
the same thing and it works pretty
pretty much the same way however you
know we have different icons at the
bottom and it's a different look it's
different email app but there's not much
different one thing that is different is
we get in Outlook aam email widget
here's how it looks right there but it
is not customizable at all it just kind
of shows your emails they're only the
top three can't scroll it like the
normal email widget so that's a look at
the outlook comm app for Android from
Microsoft and not too impressive and
basically it works but there's no new
metro-style design like some of the
other Microsoft apps and it's just kind
of they're not really not much reason
for it so that's it for now sure to give
this video a thumbs up
and we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
