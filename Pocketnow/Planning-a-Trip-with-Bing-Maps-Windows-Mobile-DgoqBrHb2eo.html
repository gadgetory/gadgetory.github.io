say you're planning a trip somewhere
you're probably going to want to look at
a map and save some important
information locations like airport or
the hotel place to go free Wi-Fi points
interesting restaurants things like that
and trying to get organized on a cell
phone is pretty difficult so we're going
to use a big tablet pc and this is bing
maps in the background it's just a
website you go to maps been calm and you
see i'm logged in right there with my
windows live idea and here i am in
manhattan you see these three buildings
i can i can rotate you know really get a
nice view of the city but you know we're
going to seattle so you know first of
all I have my collections over here and
here's my Seattle collections all of
these nice places to go to and I can
jump just going to fly over there real
quickly and there we are I should zoom
in closer
and it's going to download no more
mapping data but uh you know I want to
add some more locations so over here I
have a restaurant that somebody
recommended and I can just select the
address like that and then hit the
accelerator do map with bean and there's
my location and over here I can just hit
add to collection and then I choose the
collection that I want and save it and
there it is I go back over here to my
collections choose that one it's going
to load them all and then there this one
I just added let me just put in some
more information what was that
restaurant Lola
there's a URL name the restaurant I can
put a picture in there so that's saved
and now there's that restaurant in there
and so here's you got a pretty good
collection now I want to get those
locations over here onto my phone so
first off I have to go to actions and
properties I have to make sure that
sharing is turned on so that check box
right down there and then I have to go
to export georss so that's going to make
an RSS feed of my collection I'm going
to copy that URL up there this is where
it gets kind of hard now we're going to
go over to collections on my phone menu
add collection using URL and right down
here I should be pasted in it
there we go
and I'm going to call it if my typing
words so yeah oh there we go and now
it's showing up in my collections let's
make this bigger there we go
and there's all of my points of interest
doubleclick gets details let's find that
restaurant
okay here we go
there's my address phone number all of
that and I can hit map and there it is
on the map and of course I can go back
to details and do directions to here
well this is going to be a long group
because I'm still in New York but you
get the idea
so there you have it all of my points of
interest that I saved and created on a
tablet pc or desktop PC or any computer
I want are now totally accessible from
my windows mobile device that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
