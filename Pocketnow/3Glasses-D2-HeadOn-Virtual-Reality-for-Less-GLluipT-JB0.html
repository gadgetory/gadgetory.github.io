2016 and in the wake of major
announcements from oculus and HTC a
smaller player has seized the chance for
an undercut I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is the d2 Vanguard
edition from three glasses the first
look brought to you by D brand what sets
the d2 Vanguard edition apart from all
the other PC powered VR headsets out
there now physically not much divisor
available in white and black is
lightweight and comfortable to wear even
on a big melon like mine connected to a
gaming PC by a single thin cable and
dominated by a glowing logo on its face
when you're using it the specs aren't
bad a 2k display with a 60 FPS refresh
rate means that while you can see the
pixels they're only apparent if you're
looking for them and the 110 degree POV
is plenty of mersive three glasses had a
handful of titles available for play at
the demo from first person shooters to a
helicopter combat simulator head
tracking worked fairly well and while my
control inputs were confined to a
keyboard and mouse there are on visor
controls as well for games built with
the three glasses API I sometimes had
trouble focusing on objects in the
virtual environment and occasionally the
visor would get a little confused about
which way I was facing but that's
something I've also experienced with
other VR products like Google cardboard
or gear VR if I have a big issue with
the three glasses product it's that it
just doesn't feel much different than
any other VR headset it's still a young
category but I first tried oculus rift
almost three years ago and while this
device feels much more finished than any
beta product it doesn't really set
itself apart add in the broader
compatibility that more popular
competitors are bound to enjoy and
you've got a few things to think about
before dropping coin on this thing the
good news is that you'll be dropping
significantly less for the three glasses
visor than you will for one of the more
mainstream options the d2 Vanguard
Edition will retail for $399 a full 200
clams less than the oculus rift that
means VR fans with a limited budget
should pay close attention to this
product when it goes on sale later this
year and three glasses also has a whole
lineup of VR visors
various designs to carry us through 2017
