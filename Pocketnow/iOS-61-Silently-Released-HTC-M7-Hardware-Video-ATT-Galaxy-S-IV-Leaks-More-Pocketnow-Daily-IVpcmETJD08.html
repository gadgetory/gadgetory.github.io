hardware gets examined on video in the
80s for info gets leaked I'm crime at
Ravenna loving all you Windows Phone
haters and this is pocket now daily
that's right the galaxy s4 is one of the
most popular devices of the year and
even though we already know that mwc
most probably won't be the terrain from
launch of this device we already have a
code name I 337 the by sporting a 1080p
display and being called a galaxy s4 for
AT&amp;amp;T so stay tuned for the rumors cuz
we've got some more stuff for the galaxy
s4 coming up in the next coming weeks
can you believe the rumors of a cheap
iPhone keep coming back new leaks have a
device being based off the design of the
iphone 5 obviously the ipod touch
current generation and get this the
classic ipod i mean are those things
still being made what the point is the
ipod touches current design is really
cool so i do believe that design could
be great it probably will be based
appalling carbon it as most rumors are
saying but we'll keep you posted let's
just see where this goes probably a
newer version of the ipod binged up a
cheaper iPhone you never know another
one of the hot devices for early 2013 is
the HTC m7 we now have it on video being
compared to the HTC One X and you'll
notice that the design is pretty much
similar it's a bit taller than the One X
and it does seem to be sleeker even
though they only compare the housings of
each of these devices now that said mwc
2013 is apparently going to be the time
when it's going to be launched and
hopefully this design will come through
because it is really cool now speaking
of hot designs make sure you catch our
11th episode of after the bus that just
air today sporting the HTC windows phone
8x which pretty much owns the m7 s
design if you look at it i mean the
design is beautiful the device is
beautiful but there are some things you
should consider we still want to buy
this device as i think that make sure
you catch your Levi's walkthrough of
paranoid android if you've been
interested in getting the whole tablet
android UI on your Nexus 7 and on your
Nexus smartphone or Android device
smartphone so make sure you catch both
of these videos we
currently on the air right now and
finally for the men news of the day
epaulet finally released iOS 6.1 to the
public and while the number of changes
are so small and insignificant it best
to wonder why I didn't call it iOS 6.0
point to the only positive thing about
this change is that you'll be able to
jailbreak your iphone apparently in the
next coming week because iOS 6.1 was
already jailbroken at least in the beta
stages and it just specs to wonder
what's going on with Apple this pretty
much leads me to the question of the day
do you think that Apple is losing their
edge because iOS 6 and iOS 6.1 have
pretty much been duds they've been
terrible they're starcher down and
everything is just going downhill I mean
I think they're probably just sucking on
that success straw so much and they're
probably just sleeping in their laurels
as Steve Jobs would say that they
wouldn't do so leave us a comment down
below what do you think is happening to
the company and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone on top of roe make sure
you follow us on parking out our comment
