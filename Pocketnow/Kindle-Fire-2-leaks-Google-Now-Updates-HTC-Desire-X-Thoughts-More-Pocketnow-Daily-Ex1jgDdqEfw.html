Google now keeps getting better and HTC
announces the desire x silently I'm high
memory vana and this is poking out daily
amazon second iteration of the kindle
fire second rumor mill today this time
we found an image of the possible device
which sadly doesn't look any cuter than
its predecessors but we also got
confirmation that apparently this tablet
where this image belongs to a tablet
that will be launched alongside the
kindle fire as a parallel device amazon
recently filed a pen for a dual sided
tablet somehow in the future so stay
tuned for Amazon September six event to
see what we get even though Android 4.1
jelly bean is mostly a nexus thing
Google now keeps getting better a recent
update now allows you to get instant
information on movie sports and even
public safety information like for
example storm warnings the update is
automatic and even though the service is
quite limited internationally it's only
a matter of time before it isn't nokia
September fifth event is just around the
corner and already we land the third
batch of possible renders a future lumia
windows phones now it's still unclear
how many devices will get or if they'll
be any sexier than samsung's new atty
vest but hopefully they will be and
we'll be at the event to let you know if
these are worth your money or not the
iphone 5 takes the stage again and this
time because they found images of the
possible front panel display being
compared to the current generation
iphone 4s display you'll notice that the
new device is much longer Apple's
rumoured event to launch this device
will happen probably on September 12 so
that's true I'd stay tuned to the news
next week if I were you because will
most probably see some press events
happening and finally HTC has silently
announced they're undesirable desire x
it's not part of the 1 series and when
you look at the specs you kind of
understand why they went silent with
this whole announcement now that leads
me to the question of the day are you
happy or disappointed with HTC's recent
sort of I don't know low profile that
they've kept in the media the 1-series
was definitely a great product or a
great line of products but it seems like
if they weren't as successful as hcc was
expecting so make sure you leave a
comment down
now if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please
give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I'm high never be better thanks
