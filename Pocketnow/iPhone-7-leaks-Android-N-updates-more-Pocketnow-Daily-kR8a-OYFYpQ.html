rumors we thought were buried android on
Developer Preview gets some major
updates today and we continue to get
more mixed information of the HTC 10 I'm
hi Mary vera and if it's not the north
side then it must be the dark side this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with amazon as the company
has just announced its new Kindle oasis
the rumors were true this is a very
odd-looking Kindle that includes a case
that also charges the tablet the company
is making a lot of fanfare over how thin
this product is how practical it is etc
and it might as well as the tablet is
priced at 289 dollars and actually I
meant ereader not tablet ereader two
hundred and eighty nine dollars you can
buy a ton of 7-inch tablets for that
price let's see what we get at the end
and for those of you that are concerned
about USB type-c cables because these
are very easy to find on amazon for
price tags that are probably subpar to
the cost of these products there are
obviously a lot of concerns over these
wires were fake etc etc so the form is
just decided to create this protocol
that detects wires that are
non-compliant problem is we're not
exactly sure how that's going to work
we're not sure if we're getting a
software update that will allow current
products to the detected or if this is
just something that will come in the
future stay tuned we'll report back as
we learn more now very interesting
software update has just reached Android
and in the Developer Preview including
bug fixes for multi window support in
addition to the fact that you now get
emojis that don't look like Slimer for
those of you that grew up with me
watching ghostbusters you know what I'm
talking about even better is support for
Balkan which is OpenGL on steroids stay
tuned as we cannot wait to get Android
and for everyone else now even though so
far our experience with the HTC 10 has
been rather positive we've got some very
conflicting news about AT&amp;amp;T mainly
because the company hasn't really
pronounced itself about supporting the
HTC 10 we've heard every other carrier
tmobile even unboxed that on a
helicopter a lot of things are happening
and there's a lot to be excited about
this is a really good
phone RV will be live very soon to tell
you more we just don't know what's
happening with AT&amp;amp;T currently HTC is
recommending that you buy it unlocked if
you want it on AT&amp;amp;T I'm actually testing
it on the carrier and it performs really
well and finally the very hot news today
have to do with the iphone 7 iphone 7
plus we've got more leaks that show is a
very odd prototyping photos obviously
this might be just the Photoshop render
going back to the old meizu design that
we saw but still we hear that it's going
to be the same dimensions as the iphone
6s 6s plus in addition we hear that even
though the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
is going apparently we won't be getting
stereo speakers which is very very sad
and obviously we also hear about the
dual camera but it does lead me to the
question of the day what design changes
would you want to see on the iphone 7 in
my case honestly no more than enlighten
us how about a bigger battery I would
love that leave us a comment down below
