s here and can somebody please show them
a photo of the full American continent
but you're saying your name all wrong
tip try saying it's slower while
pronouncing the letters that are
actually there and whatever dude that he
just speak Mexican and that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi Matt iveta
this is pocket now and this is our
pocket now daily recap or last week so
on Monday asked you what do you think
the final lame for Android L should be
as the rumors are that it's going to be
called lemon meringue pie if I have that
pronunciation right we have a staggering
2162 comments that is a record thank you
very much guys out of which one of them
says if the next version of android is
named lemon meringue pie then people
will definitely end up calling it
android l only and you're completely
right there are certain names that are
just so ridiculous people would rather
not pronounce then hush hype says
licorice for android licorice this
sounds catchy and yeah why not then
TechCrunch says call it android lollipop
and yeah whatever dude I still feel that
Android L is fine let's call L point one
whenever there's an update or whatever
but L is fine there is no need to give
it a pastry name my opinion obviously
but I'm Tuesday I asked you to choose
between the haptic feedback on the
display that Microsoft is testing on
microsoft research or the new pen that
Apple has with this flexible display
technology that actually creates a sort
of a keyboard mimicked through glass on
the display for you to actually feel
something this is already done by a
keyboard replacement cover call texts in
the market right now and we have 249
comments out of which and kit says if
this technology is already in the market
how the heck can they get the Panther
the same technology and you don't have a
good point there but this is a patent
for a display for a tablet and the time
that brings its technology not
necessarily a cover so there is a little
bit of give their thang Gibran says a
screen that turns into a keyboard not in
our lifetime they can't figure out
battery life what are the odds of them
building a transformer phone and you
have a solid point there probably the
best comment of the week yeah there are
some imposing issues right now that
not been fixed for years like battery
life so you never know I mean why won't
they fix that first though this would be
a cool idea that would happen don't you
think that another commoner says which
one is better all depends on the
implementation somehow I doubt that
Apple can pull a flexible display off
without sacrificing screen clarity and
you're saying that because of the LG G
flex yes definitely has a terrible
display but you never know display
technology has evolved a lot over the
last couple of years if you think about
it 34 years ago we were using wvga now
we're using 2k so hey you never know the
same thing with sapphire but on
Wednesday asked you if you're getting
either of the iPhone 6 models or the i
watch as the rumors are that Apple is
going to be launching everything on its
event on September ninth we have 858
comments out of which one of them says
I'm sure switching to the 4.7 inch
iphone 6 as my iphone 5 is kind of old
now and yes if you're rocking an iPhone
5 iPhone for rest and definitely the
iphone 4 this is the time to upgrade if
you're using an iphone 5s it'll all
depend on what gets announced so stay
tuned for that and Captain Archer says
I'll keep telling myself I won't get an
iphone 6 i'll keep telling myself i'm
saving this money to fix my car i'll
keep telling myself my current phone is
fine everything is fine and I have the
impression that you are not going to fix
your car anytime soon and Felix s 4.7
inches nothing else fine 5.5 inch too
big and don't want to drop my mechanical
watches so yes you're not getting an
iWatch and you know it's very
interesting out of all the 800 comments
very few people wanted the phablet and
yes I'm a big fan of phablets but it
seems that not everybody is here then on
Thursday I asked you if you would buy
the samsung gear s Samsung had just
announced its new gear SmartWatch that's
also a phone it's got a whole keyboard
and everything you don't really need a
phone though you can operate it with a
phone if you want to we have 566
comments out of which jeff s says your s
will be good for times when you're
traveling and don't want your phone
stolen you have a solid point there i
live in a country where theft is very
common and yes this would be awesome
though you know i do believe the burglar
would not leave with just my phone if he
sees the watch he's going to want that
to the Madison says Samsung gear s seems
to be the future when smartphones are
getting bigger and big
I definitely want to have one and you
know you have a solid point their
smartphones are getting bigger and
cumbersome though I do believe that
there will be a point where there will
be a line drawn between a phone and a
tablet hopefully someday I don't know
that the way things are going true you
have a point but then again I don't know
you don't you're not forced to buy a big
phone either Knutson says me buying it
would depend on how they price it that
you have a good point there we're still
not sure what the price is going to be
for the gear s but what I will tell you
is that I would not pay five hundred
dollars for a SmartWatch especially not
one this big especially not one with
that battery life and finally on Friday
I asked you if you would wait for the i
watch until 2015 as the rumors are that
even though Apple might announce the i
watch with the iphones on September
ninth probably the company is not ready
to launch it until 2015 and this is not
the first time this happens when the
first generation iphone was announced
Apple took six months to launch it so it
could be the case we have one day T 2
comments out of which Amon says it's
Apple who wouldn't and I could give you
a good example of a very big amount of
people that wouldn't but then again sure
you do have a point and Eric Enright
says I'll wait for the iwatch cos all my
tech is Apple now and it just makes
sense to keep it that way and yes if
you're in the apple ecosystem this makes
all the sense in the world the reason
why is because there is no value for you
to buy a sony tablet and a sony phone
and that's really disappointing it comes
to Apple hey everything works together
you buy an imac you buy a phone and
iphone and they actually talk to each
other and these are really cool features
that make owning Apple products of value
and probably that's the reason for the
Apple tax as well so yeah it does make
sense for you to keep yourself within
the ecosystem because I am more than
likely sure that that i watch is not
going to work with any other phone
that's not the iphone and finally kim
kardashian lovely name says i will not
wait for the iWatch i'm getting the Moto
360 I'm excited for the first watch that
brings LG G watch our build quality
Android wear the ability to replace my
phone entirely I'm also excited for that
but the technology is not there the Moto
360 is out today and the first
impressions from everyone are that the
battery life is terrible and yes it does
make a point I mean think about it if
you have to be charging your
every day even more so that you do your
phone or your tablet then it completely
defeats the purpose of this being a
wearable product so you know
smartwatches are really not taking off
because of that and that's mainly the
reason why a lot of people are actually
waiting for the iWatch because Apple has
more than likely you know figured out
certain markets certain markets like the
ipod for example and it's time the
iphone as well these were solutions to
products that already existed but that
other companies didn't figure out so
that's the reason why they're waiting
for the iWatch and let's see what they
bring in the end thats it for our pocket
