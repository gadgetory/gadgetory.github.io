variant that we get from Samsung a
thinner iphone 7 without a headphone
jack might lead to water resistance and
it seems that there are ways to make the
one plus three work faster I'm high
Meadow Rivera and after seeing all the
temperatures that some of you have to
put up with I really don't know what I'm
complaining about this is parking out
daily
as we try every single day the official
news today begin with deals those of you
in the market for the blackberry prive
it might have been a crazy price tag
initially but it's dropped in price a
lot and it's not necessarily a bad phone
it's actually a very good approach to
Android it's currently available for 299
on ebay unlocked you're actually getting
the AT&amp;amp;T variant but the seller is also
offering an unlock code which makes it a
compelling deal and for those of you
that are wondering which company is
reigning supreme when it comes to
streaming music we all know it's Spotify
but if you wondered exactly how much the
amount of difference there is believe it
or not Spotify just confirmed a hundred
million active users active users and if
you compare that to Apple music that's
50 million Apple music definitely has a
long road ahead and even with the
changes of iOS 10 I don't see those
changes being enough to make a dent on
Spotify his market but we never know and
for those of you that were outraged over
the recent video showing how slow the
one plus three is compared to the galaxy
s7 even with the six gigs of ram
compared to four well there is actually
a small little tweak it is one string of
code that you can apply to the one plus
free to fix that you can learn more in
the link in the description it was found
by xda-developers and even though the
one plus three is still not faster than
the galaxy s7 it is very close this just
proves how much software can make a
difference from the experience of one
phone to another another company that
wants to make a dent when it comes to
hardware changes at least this Apple is
apparently the iphone 7 is not really
bringing major changes but these have a
reason number one because apparently the
company is not ready to implement all
the changes it wants with the iPhone and
we're gonna have to wait until 2017 it
marks a difference mainly because that's
the 10 years of iphone makes sense for
there to be a change there and then
another thing is that apparently Apple
wants to remove the headphone jack
because it wants to go for water
resistance we cannot wait to see that
and finally for the very interesting
rumors today let's talk about galaxy
note 7 mainly because we've covered a
ton of rumors over there being a couple
of variants but then again apparently
according to trusted sources there will
only be one variant the edge variant as
definitely Samsung has noticed that the
company's edge phones have been the
that sold the most so it makes sense for
the company to only start building edge
variants that we wonder exactly how that
will hinder usability or make it better
up to the point where it leads me to the
question of today when you mind if there
was only a galaxy note 7 edge or would
you want the regular barian as well in
my case it has to do with the price tag
mainly because well edge parents have
been crazy expensive all the time we
would love to see this drop in price or
at least reach a specific level that's
not too crazy but it was a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
