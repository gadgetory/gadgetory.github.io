pocketnow.com and today we're going to
look at some of the software
functionality of the sidekick 4G from
t-mobile so sit back relax and enjoy the
show the default interface on the
t-mobile sidekick 4G is a skin from
Samsung it is not running froyo as the
default interface but overall I have to
say even with these three simple buttons
over here and the relatively simple
interface I mean does have some widget
options and some functions will get back
to in just a moment it while it seems
very simple and for the majority of us
myself included would probably replace
this with something like 80 w or
launcherpro the person that we might
pick this up for $99 your average Joe on
the street or your girlfriend or your
mom or your wife or etc etc even
yourself this interface does work really
efficiently and is actually pretty fast
considering it that's one of the fastest
skins that I've seen in a long time
phone contacts etc the only complaint
that I have is so far as far as the
interface goes is that the phone only
launches and we can see we got the
keyboard popped out here only launches
in portrait mode it doesn't have a
landscape functionality but that aside
pretty straightforward some of the
widgets that are included that are
different or is this feeds an update
link unfortunately it only updates once
per day that's it there's no option to
update it more than once if you go here
and here to the settings auto refresh
once a day is all you get you can have
facebook myspace for we know why anybody
would be updating you know choosing that
i just don't know twitter as your
options hey I would probably lose this
if this was my phone I would lose this
pretty quickly this is sticky notes and
what it does is it saved some of your
favorite text messages I've just pulled
the first one here from the the
activation the phone just give you an
example
when you close the link here it removes
that unstuck message and then you can
see that again again not terribly useful
unless you enjoy you know reviewing
messages from somebody special blank
spots they're down here at the bottom
it's a little hard to see in this
particular view this is your indicator
your page indicator as you move across
Google your it's got a different media
room as the widget here it's nice
because it brings everything together
and we'll come back to that in just a
minute and then last year we have our
settings and then another blank one over
there if we go into the menu and we
choose reorder we can see all of the pop
ups here because it doesn't have because
the home button is assigned to other
things pressing and holding the home
button or will bring down that the
notification window and not the no
double tap to bring up multiple icons
like you would see on a TW not a big
loss of functionality but important to
note this background with the color
scheme can be adjusted in the settings
let's go into there and take a look at
what options we have there we'll start
with that particular one the themes and
there are several themes you have a
choice rotated on this again the default
red and kind of a greenish and white
whitish blue brown and kind of a denim
blue color more of a tan brown and then
the really funky green and magenta
because they all have their own
individual names but the easiest way to
describe them is like I just did so you
can select one of these other options
and by highlighting it it will
automatically change all of the
interface for this so you can see over
here the color scheme changed and my
background change the widget's don't
change but some of the other icons and
the buttons and pop downs do change that
didn't change the notification bar as
you can see there other options in the
settings
it's going back up to the top drive
smart which is kind of like the vlingo
drive app allows you to send text
messages while you're driving or enable
bluetooth and auto responses to tell
people that you're on the road there is
a pro version for automatic driving
detection that's not included also in
here that's different from other items
is the jump key settings and it allows
you to assign shortcuts to the jump key
some of these already exists within
froyo anyway but it's nice to have a
dedicated button I don't know if it's
nice enough to lose this the search
button but it is functional in the
especially in this landscape format lock
screen shortcut is when you swipe up
away from the screen we'll come back to
that in just a second LED settings
allows you to change the color icons
that are the color leds that are right
up here in the corner and the blink
options for how often they blink and
when they blink to do and otherwise it's
pretty straightforward here talking just
briefly about software and I know I
talked about the battery life a little
bit in the hardware review but I can't I
can't believe how well that this does in
battery and it's the number of many
calls today but I had a day in 15 hours
on Friday into Saturday with about three
hours at the phone calls and compared to
my epic the battery been dead by then so
still an amazing amount of battery life
for for normal use now I'm not trying to
go through and do a massive turn on
Wi-Fi Bluetooth everything run video
till it dies type mode I just don't
think that's realistic in a testing
scenario and looking for real worlds and
you know testing here if so your version
of course 221 right now nothing too
surprising in here let's take a look at
that lock screen
so by default sliding down will unlock
the phone sliding up will launch the
jump key settings and if we turn this
back to here and do the same thing when
I swipe up launches there and then I can
assign what that shortcut is going to be
so let's say I want it to open up the
photo options and I can tell it I'm just
going to pick a random one here come
back to those in a second swipe up
launches the photo so speaking briefly
about the text messaging or the
communication functionality of the
t-mobile sidekick 4G when you create a
new message here you've got the option
to automatically change the type of
message to attach media directly from
one interface and smiley faces and that
sort of thing there are options in here
and for those of you looking to turn
this off and I notice that another
review that someone mentioned that you
can't turn off the default messaging
that's sort of true but if you turn off
the notifications just like on the rest
the Samsung models you won't see the
notification pop up on the screen and
you can use something like handcent or
other ms SMS mms messaging systems if
you like and you won't see the double
messaging option group tetra presaging
allows you to send text messages to a
group of people rather than a single
individual and then all the text
messages back and forth from that group
gets sent back and forth to each other
it's got kind of a list options and it's
got some functionality to stop the list
or tell it not to send you anymore
notifications for the next hour etc the
t-mobile Sidekick does have the ability
to do wife
by calling which you can see here but
here's the rub it actually still uses
your minutes and if it's using your
minutes and you've got a cell signal at
all then why would you use your Wi-Fi so
let's look at some of the other apps
that are included by default there is an
app pack that's included kind of some
default apps from t-mobile the the the
mini diary here is to kind of keep your
own mini diary and daily diary on your
phone if you like can't see myself doing
that but you can like that sort of thing
then so be it the my device
functionality is actually really great
because it does give you the actually
battery meter along with other
information about the device such as how
long the Vice has been running I did
like that timo mall is just like a
marketplace but for the sidekick 4G
directly TeleNav gps nav and once you've
seen the gps nav of TeleNav it's pretty
much the same on every device it doesn't
include the quick video chat here for
the front-facing video camera or rear
not depending what you like to have a
set up we already talked about the
universal composer and the tmobile TV
visual voicemail is also included Wi-Fi
call and we also talked about the one
thing we didn't really go into very much
is this well I mean other than the media
hub which is just like every other
Samsung device and media hubs we're
going to skip that but the media room
does include slacker radio all of your
video kind of functions user and
bandwidth cloud provided and music
functionality all in one slick package
so that's nice to have the other nice
thing that we didn't talk about is the
cloud texting which allows you to get
access to your text messages from the
web rather than having to have your
device right near you that wraps up our
software portion of the sidekick 4G
