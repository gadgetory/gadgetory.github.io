for the samsung galaxy s4 zoom and this
year it's the Samsung Galaxy K zoom and
if you have a day job view and you don't
know whether this one is a phone or a
camera well this is what we're going to
find out in our full review but first
this unboxing and first impressions
video kicks off our coverage so let's go
check it out so this is the box of the
samsung galaxy k zoom and as we
mentioned it's no longer using the
flagships name the s5 it's not the s5
zoom it's the K zoom and this is what
the device looks of course I think we
have the white version here but before
we open the box let's take a look around
it and Samsung calls out some of the key
features here like for instance the LTE
capabilities this phone / camera or
hybrid taxi hexa-core which is a six
core processor composed of a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core chip and a one-point
3 gigahertz quad-core chip for a
combination of a hexa core SOC and of
course we got 2 gigs of ram but fairly
smallish battery and you have to excuse
the traffic and of course the main
feature of this device is the 10 times
optical zoom and the 20 point seven
megapixel camera but let's crack open
the box and see exactly what's what's
inside and once all the seals have been
broken let's just slide out and yes this
is what Samsung calls the shimmery white
version we'll just put the device to the
side and make a short inventory of what
we have here it's literature which
nobody reads but you should we have the
standard earphones earbuds as soon as
the camera focuses there we go
nothing interesting then we have some
more gels for you and this is the
European charger because we are in
Europe and of course we have the USB
cable for syncing and charging and also
inside the box is a battery which is
rated at 24 30 milliamp hours I think it
will be a little bit small for the
immense shooter on the device but we'll
just have to wait for our test results
looking at the device itself this is the
Samsung Galaxy K zoom and if you look at
it this way it looks like a Galaxy s4 or
s5 mini
it has a lot in common with the flagship
and let's just peel this off just find
exactly where it feels well and open it
up this is where the Samsung magic
happens this is a twenty point seven
megapixel shooter and it uses Samsung's
own lens we also have some protection
here as well this shooter delivers ten
times optical zoom while also having
optical image stabilization a dual xenon
/ LED flash and the speaker on the top
and on the right side there's absolutely
nothing but your micro SD card slot
which is very handy because the Galaxy K
zoom only features eight gigs of
internal storage up front a 4.8 inch
screen which is only 720p but that is
good enough though 720p is regarded as
mid-range nowadays with all the Full HD
and the two-and-a-half k / quad HD
screens volume rockers for volume up and
volume down
button and a dedicated camera shutter
button let's correct this back cover
open and insert the battery and the SIM
card this is where the SIM card will go
this is where the battery is being
placed and this is of course for and
I've seen let's just get back once we
have the battery on the sim insert it
and once those are in let's boot it up
for the first time though we should
charge it first note let's see hope it
has enough power there we go galaxy k
zoom of course with the new power by
Android inscription which is on most
Android phones nowadays the Samsung boot
up sound and while we're booting this up
since we have these devices here anyways
we'll just yes thank you very much we'll
have more on that off camera and in our
full review we will do a comparison
between the Samsung Galaxy K zoom and
the Nokia Lumia 1020 which has as you
remember it's awesome shooter at 41
megapixels and we will also compare it
with the Sony Xperia z2 which also have
a twenty point seven megapixel camera so
this is up until now the best Android
shooter out there so we'll have lots
more on the samsung galaxy k zoom stay
tuned to pocket now and of course like
this video if you have liked it thank
you everyone thank you very much for
watching this was the samsung galaxy k
zoom unboxing and we'll have lots more
comparisons with the Xperia z2 which has
a great shooter with the Lumia 1020 the
king of camera phones so follow
PocketNow on all the usual social media
channels you can follow me as well and
until next time everybody stay safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
