Harman Kardon speakers a removable 3100
milliamp hour battery and a whopping 320
gigabytes of storage and that's not even
scratching the water resistant surface
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is a quick look at the spec beast
of CES the saygus v-squared
specs aren't everything
but don't tell Sega's they've taken the
one-plus approach to smartphone design
packing in every possible hardware
feature to make this smartphone standout
in some cases that's thanks to novel
implementations of existing features
Sega's achieved that 320 gig capacity
with tandem microSD cards combined with
an on-board 64 gig reservoir
it's fingerprint scanner sits on the
right edge instead of up front as usual
the radios use a fractal antenna array
for increased reception and the screen
backlight is automatically adjusted by
not one but two ambient light sensors
front and back elsewhere
things get a little more conventional
but no less impressive Gorilla Glass 4
cover glass and IR transmitter Qi
wireless charging a 21 megapixel camera
with sharp sensor on the back and a 13
megapixel selfie camera up front and get
this both cameras are optically
stabilized the phone does have
compromises the 5-inch display is full
HD not quad HD I don't mind that
actually it's probably a better call in
terms of battery life but the phone's
chunky industrial design won't be for
everyone this early hardware doesn't
feel too rugged in the hand maybe
because it's so lightweight and also
some of the more extravagant claims
concerning the abilities of the fractal
antenna technology seem well extravagant
Android 5 isn't here yet as you can see
but it along with out of the box root
access are promised shortly after
release any time a new small
manufacturer promises such an ambitious
product it's a good idea to temper your
expectations a bit still with a spec
sheet this dense and some features I
wasn't even able to mention that this
phone comes to market on time this
spring it's bound to be very compelling
to a specific market segment based on
what we've heard behind the scenes the V
squared might ship for $500 unlocked
with possible carrier deal
to be announced in the coming months for
much more in smartphones tablets and
wearables from CES 2015 in Las Vegas be
