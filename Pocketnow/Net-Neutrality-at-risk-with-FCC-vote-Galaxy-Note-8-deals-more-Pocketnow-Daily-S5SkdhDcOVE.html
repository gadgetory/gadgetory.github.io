threatened as the FCC is going to vote
on it yet again before to have Apple
working on a better and thinner OLED for
its next generation iPhone 10 and it
seems that Google is already flirting
with some of apples code for its fuchsia
OS I'm hanging out of event and only the
people that truly know me understand the
emotional connection I have with this
t-shirt if you want to get your own in
addition to a coupon code there is a
link in the comments this is pocket out
daily
the official news today begin with deals
and get used to it as we're getting
close to Black Friday that's going to be
part of the deal and I'm already bitter
about the fact that I won't be here but
anyways Verizon is going to have its top
Android phones up to 50% off and I'm
talking latest pixels latest galaxies
latest Moto's you can learn more in the
description because the list is rather
large and not all of them are 50% off
it's up to 50% off now let's talk about
Best Buy the company is offering yet
another awesome deal for Galaxy
smartphones I'm talking about s8 si plus
no date you name it you can get up to
350 dollars off any of these smart
phones but there are a couple of
conditions again let me not bore you
with that you can learn more in the
description now so the spotlight over to
Google as we hear some very interesting
rumors remember that whole secret
operating system called Andromeda and
remember that Apple codes its operating
system and apps on a service called
Swift that it announced years ago well
there are some trusted sources that
claim that Google is using Swift to
build Andromeda and this is rather
interesting as we all know just how
power efficient then how great OS 10 is
or now Mac OS and iOS so makes all the
sense in the world for Google to want to
play with this we just don't know
exactly when we should expect it or if
this will ever happen as according to
the source this is still very vague now
let's move the spotlight over to the
iPhone 10 2018 and the current one as
there are some positive and negative
news the positive is that Apple is
working on a much brighter and thinner
OLED display for next year which is
great because the one that's currently
on the iPhone 10 is not the brightest in
the world now the bad news is that we
hear that once again there are
complaints in China of child labour from
students being forced to work at Foxconn
for building the iPhone 10 and this is
terrible I mean Apple claimed that it
was going to double down on this like
three years ago and it seems that it's a
topic once again we'll keep you posted
as soon as we learn more about
and finally the very concerning news
today I have to do with the FCC once
again trying to overthrow net neutrality
something that was set in stone in the
Obama administration the rest of you
don't know right now there was going to
be a proposal tomorrow and there is
going to be a vote in a month so net
neutrality allows people to do whatever
they want with the internet it doesn't
allow ISPs to set any sort of controls
or throttles for whatever content you
consume if net neutrality gets
overthrown ISPs can do whatever they
want with the content you consume
meaning they can throttle whatever
website they deem is not in their best
interest for you to consume or they
could charge you more or whatever right
now it's extremely concerning because
obviously we want the internet to remain
the way it is so hey anyways and the
question today what do you think are you
worried or not worried about what's
going to happen tomorrow with the
proposal and the vote that's going to
happen in a month in my case I am
concerned definitely hey we live off the
internet pocket now all of us on YouTube
live off the internet so it's in our
best interest for the internet to be
free to everybody but hey leave us a
