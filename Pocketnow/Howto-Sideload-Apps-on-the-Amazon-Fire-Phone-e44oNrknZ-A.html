interesting device but it comes with the
Amazon Appstore instead of the Google
Play Store what if you want some other
apps I'm Joe Levi with PocketNow here's
how you can sideload apps onto your
Amazon fire phone first thing we need to
do is to go into our settings if you're
like me and use it a lot you probably
have a home screen item right there that
you can just use to jump right into
otherwise just pull down from the top
hit the settings cog from here we want
to go into applications and parental
controls open that up and we now can
allow non Amazon app installations tap
there select the app installation as on
read through the warning and if you
accept that choose okay otherwise hit
cancel this is the same warning that
we're used to on other Android devices
essentially it's saying you're going to
be side loading something here and the
app store can't be responsible for the
stuff that you're not installing through
it same is with Google Play so we're
going to accept the risk and say ok and
at that point we're done all we have to
do now is fire up our silk browser and
start looking for apks now ideally what
you're going to want to do is download
apk directly from the manufacturer so if
you wanted to get ways for example see
if ways has an apk for you you want to
get something from Twitter see if
Twitter has an apk most of the time
they're going to distribute those
through a Play Store not through their
website so finding them might be a
little bit interesting so let's say we
want to download the Chrome apk we'll go
ahead and search that you need to be
very sure about where you're downloading
this from to make sure it's a reputable
place and that you're not downloading
something malicious along with your apk
so find what you think you want download
and install it once you do it's going to
be over here in your downloads and at
that point you simply tap read through
all of the permissions in this case I've
already installed Chrome on the device
and it's saying that this update doesn't
require any new permissions if this were
a new install I would see all of the
permits
and then I could simply hit the install
button we'll go ahead and do that it
takes just a moment to go through and
install once that is all done I'm going
to have a new icon that I can access or
I can just simply hit the open button
right there and now rather than using
the silk browser I am using the fully
functional Chrome browser right here on
my Amazon fire phone as you can tell the
process really isn't all that difficult
the harder part however is finding those
apks most of the time developers publish
their apks through an app store like the
Amazon App Store or the Google Play
Store or some other third-party Play
Store finding those apks can be tricky
but not impossible
so go out and find what you like and go
ahead and side load it on your fire
phone if you like this kind of
information please give the video a
thumbs up and of course be sure you've
subscribed
we just passed 700,000 people who are
enjoying pocket now videos we're glad
that you're one of them for pocket now
showing off cool things that you can do
with your devices I'm Joe Levi thank you
very much for watching we'll catch you
