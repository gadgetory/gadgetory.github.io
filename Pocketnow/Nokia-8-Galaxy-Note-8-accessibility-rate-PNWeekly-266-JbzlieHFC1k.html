releases are coming soon the note 8 is
on the horizon will be running down the
top rumors and leaks before we head out
to cover the New York event Huawei has
sent out invites for the May 10 and
Nokia has launched the Nokia 8 with
Zeiss cameras in tow there's a lot to
talk about this week so make sure you're
charged and ready for episode 2 6 6 of
the pocket now weekly of this weekly
podcast recorded August 17th at 3:00
p.m. Eastern is a show where we dissect
and discuss those gadgets that make our
lives mobile smartphones tablets and
wearables it's all the stuff you wished
existed when you were a kid and science
fiction films were around 200 years off
in predicting mobile computing I'm Juan
Carlos bag now senior editor
pocketnow.com blasting the signal from
sunny Southern California joined as
always by plucky podcast producer mr.
Jules Wong out on the east coast how's
it going buddy boy
I would be 200 years off if I were to
estimate your age right now because I'm
gonna say happy 235th birthday yeah but
we had we had a podcast today so I mean
look so um in the post you're gonna hear
all the people clapping and cheering for
you but right now it's only just me and
possibly a few of our friends in the
audience here so with all due to yes
because I got the notification for both
so happy birthday well thank you I
appreciate that my birthday was
yesterday from the from the day that we
recorded this this crazy podcast and I
feel older and more tired and decrepit
and like advertisers care even less
about me now so it's all moved out of
that range where it's you know 18 but is
it like 34 so 30 yeah I'm well outside
that range now and I can just feel my
purchasing power diminishing by the
minute it's like I have this disposable
income and literally no one wants to
take it from me well I mean wages are
still kind of stagnant and everyone's
still looking that barista job they've
held for a cry
oh darn Millennials in there avocado
toast not buying premium luxury goods
and services well how about we promote a
premium good good or service like it's a
good it's a good I think it's it's a
good which is it has a phenomenal
service tied to it I'm glad you brought
that up mr. Juan because this week we
are sponsored by Eero now the single
router Wi-Fi model just does not work
anymore in our increasingly high
bandwidth world what we need is a
distributed system and that system is
zero whatever your Wi-Fi needs zero has
the power to seamlessly blanket your
home in fast reliable Wi-Fi via if
Ethernet Wireless or any combination of
the two gyro is a mesh Wi-Fi system you
set the main unit on a flat surface you
plug the satellite beacons into wall
outlets around your home to expand
coverage to any room in your house this
second-generation arrow now includes a
third five gigahertz radio for tri-band
connectivity
making it twice as fast as its
predecessor so you can do more in every
room of your house simultaneously also
Eros new thread radio can connect to
low-power devices like locks doorbells
and other home sensors the Eero beacon
is half the size but is more powerful
than the original making them more
discreet around your home without
compromising the signal whichever model
you choose with euros incredible support
you can call and get a hold of a Wi-Fi
expert within 30 seconds but you might
not ever need to this is one of the
easiest networking setups I've ever used
I plugged in the base station to my
modem I fired up an app on my phone and
the app connected the beacons quickly
and they even helped me adjust to the
position in each room for the best
signal strength now my home isn't super
large but it is two stories and I
believe the top story is made out of a
Faraday chamber to prevent any kind of
wireless signal leaving my office
so with lots of network noise coming in
from neighbors we used to run Ethernet
cables upstairs and downstairs to hook
up slave routers to make sure we had
good signal
Eero has single-handedly replaced that
mess with a single Wi-Fi network great
security access and each beacon also
doubles as a handy little nightlight
I've had it running for a week and I'm
totally spoiled mesh Wi-Fi is the future
so they are giving they are delivering a
special for viewers of the pocket net
weekly if you would like free overnight
shipping visit eurocom select overnight
as the shipping option and enter pocket
now at checkout
that's eurocom offer code pocket now at
checkout and we thank them for
supporting the pocket now weekly all
right for them and Harry for us for
working with euro to get this deal on
yes I used to run like five four
different Wi-Fi SSIDs
because I would have like this slave
router like Netflix for our TV then
upstairs you would have to remember to
connect to a different Wi-Fi network for
faster throughput it's all just one one
ID now and that the handoff is
phenomenal so like when I'm downstairs
in the living room I know I'm connected
to the living room beacon and then I
just walk upstairs I go to bed and I
could be streaming video and it hands it
off perfectly you don't see any drop in
connectivity it's it's surprisingly good
what if we want to spend four different
Estes IDs for your hero beacons I mean
you you want to tour it one thing over
the legal stuff in the other room it's
it's probably I think we here at the
pocket i weekly do not condone the use
of arrow for any illicit ordinance in
this podcast is this conversation right
now so to do that you want to get in
while we're live at 3 p.m. Eastern on
this 17th day of August but going on to
Twitter and entering the hashtag P and
weekly you can track other people who
are talking about the things that you
might want to be talking about and also
ask your own questions we'll try and see
if we can answer them throughout this
show or otherwise if you have a more
question
questionable question I guess that's
what like something of a long term it's
easy for you to say application I don't
know really I doing this for a year now
and I still can't get used to it
podcasting no podcast a podcast
no podcast you got it one more time you
can do it
dot-com and that's the email address
that I give up I think folks live
podcasting is hard man I know most weeks
we make it look easy but every now and
then it's still gonna it's still gonna
trip us up to podcast at pocketnow.com
you can send in those questions for
those of you who are listening after
we've recorded or if like I said you
just want to write out something longer
than 140 characters on Twitter that
would honestly oh but it's good times
we've already got a number of P n weekly
hashtags coming in at Peter hatin saying
people should sing you know and got a
little happy birthday message there from
Peter that's greatly appreciated and
from Andrew Wallace we can jump jump
into this one before we tackle the news
hashtag P n weekly what are the
snapdragons 6:30 and 660 equivalent to
with older flagship processors alright
so with the 660 they are using the new
in-house cryo cores those to the cortex
parts that they use for the 630 630
would be more akin I guess to the 625
but that itself as a as a mid-range
element to it in the 626 or a successor
so what we really want to be talking
about I guess is probably the 650 series
so sick I know this is a little
confusing but if we're talking about 650
we'd be equivocating to the 630 660 I
feel like is more of a more of an 8:00
8:30 no 8
it was the 8:20 that was the first one I
think I think the easiest way because
you're out you're absolutely on the
right track there Jules I think the
easiest way to kind of take a look at
the difference
between these various chipsets the six
to five and the six thirty are their mid
Ranger fare then we've got sort of an
overlap something that exists between
the 600 and the 800 series so for the
650 it was very reminiscent slightly
better in terms of performance than the
808 was the the before it so if you had
the Qualcomm 808 then you jump to the
650 I thought that was a pretty a pretty
direct evolution the same thing I think
is happening here
the only 660 I've had the chance to play
with is on the Oppo R 11 which is a
Chinese unit and it's super lockdown so
even install the gapps on it is kind of
tricky for me because I've never used a
phone quite so restricted before but
that 660 seems to benchmark
similarly slightly better than a lot of
Qualcomm 820 s did look like versus you
know and install that stupid little app
that you have to find in the market and
it's just right i I mean I know there
are other differences in in terms of
like core count and you know die size
and all those things but it really does
seem to be that the current year
higher-end 600 is relatively close in
performance maybe slightly better in
terms of performance and power
efficiency than the last year's high-end
chipset so I would imagine that there
would be a six seventy next year which
is similar in performance to the
Qualcomm 835 this power efficiency has
to be the sharpest kind of gradients to
all this because 652 653 they were not
known as efficient chips where as
opposed to 625 they were the last
vestiges of Qualcomm's just dogs
processors the 808 in the a-10 and the
Sitton that did affect the 650 as well
and so now we're just sort of on all
fronts from entry level through high-end
just Qualcomm is really really done an
about-face on improving chipset
efficiency but it took about a year and
a half before we saw the fruits of that
investment I don't think we've played
with us sixth
yet so our 6:30 so we want to be able to
confirm that but yeah it looks like
we're on track for I guess that kind of
a two-year improvement we're talking
about 808 so that's 2015 yeah it's five
was a late launch - I mean the 625 I
remember it came out first in the huawei
Nova wasn't that the first phone to use
a 625 and that was pretty late in the
year last over the 2015 fall 2015
I'm not sure no wait there was Nova to
blast last for in 2016 so it was 2015 so
I mean we had a star for legacy I guess
let me flipped leaf in 2015 speaking of
flipping leaves why don't we flip leaves
over officially that to you I wanna I
want a response to that I want I want
something that I was like what you gonna
do what you gonna do I'm filled with
anticipation for what what he's gonna
say maybe who knows it could be a
horrible idea but for the week of August
14th this is all the news that is fit to
podcast the huawei mate 10 is officially
queued up for an October 16 event in
Munich Germany the phone is said to
teacher six gigs of ram standard 10
nanometer Kirin processor for the first
time and more expensive than usual price
time ago we're talking about the
equivalent of $600 something that really
it hasn't been bumping up against the I
guess that Barry has been bumped in
Chinese a mobile carrier so we'll have
to see about that Samsung has had
another gear wearable leaked out
following the swap SmartWatch like gear
Sport is the gear fit to pro that's to
lunch just before Aoife venture beats
even blast reports that unlike the gear
fit to this fitness band is actually fit
for swimming has offline spotify
playback and among a whole bunch of
other features an enterprise Wi-Fi
infrastructure distributor has created a
Nicolas medallion called front
it has cameras on it that can link
directly to Facebook live YouTube and
Twitter for up to two hours of live
streaming or it can create a 16 hour
time lapse of where you've been and you
wear it it costs 400 dollars and is on
sale from the company right now the
Google is said to have paid huge sums to
remain the default search engine for
Apple's iOS products and Samsung phones
analysts expect that Mountain View will
pay 3 billion dollars to the former and
3.5 billion dollars to the latter this
year motorola has gotten a patent in the
US for a self-healing screen using a
shape memory polymer and a little
heating solution on a phone if the
screen should crack in theory it should
take just a few taps around that
breakage and some magic to fix it up
it's only a patent so we'll have to see
when if at all it gets implemented into
a product but it should be an
improvement over the shadow shield
solution they have right now finally
that Nokia 8 that we've been drooling
over or our group has been drew over
Headroom for the past several months has
been launched with flagship specs a dual
camera mono color combo at back and both
these the capability of taking pictures
video and live streaming from cameras on
both sides of the device of course you
have to call it something both ease grew
fees we fees yeah
Europe should see it in September at
around five hundred ninety nine euros
alright that was a heart bail their
groupies some things I don't know and
then you sort of know I mean we
shouldn't like you've tried branding the
stuff before it's it's not gonna happen
you're not going to do it well in and
it's like and it's kind of up to them is
if they can Kai if they can deliver it
in a way that really sort of resonates
or that really takes off i we are to
have a pushing you know market points
here so tomorrow
to market points so so we already have a
tweet in here from David bap bap teesta
silva things real nokia flagships had
that the 8 doesn't Qi charging an AMOLED
display and a dedicated camera button
terrible start for HMD hashtag pn weekly
I don't know that it's terrible but
there are a few things there that I
think are a little concerning until we
look at that this is a this is expected
to launch for 600 euro some inner arrow
so the standard version there's a 128
gig in standard 64 but there's a hard 28
gig so that's the average price they say
I don't know I'm feeling like this is
not a terrible position because this is
just spitting distance from like a 1
plus 5 at this point isn't it like you
have expandable storage you've got or
does it have expandable storage did they
mention that up to 256 yeah so I think
that actually did give rated splash
resistance IP 54 it's great but I mean
it's practically it's only good for
maybe rain or like so yeah but like we
said before it's it's really like I'm
just excited that they told us you know
that you didn't just put on some moniker
of like drizzled resistant that's the
actual IP rating consumers have an
expectation now for how durable their
gadget should be and when I'm hearing
that you know this this is gonna be put
together it's got a reasonably decent
battery size a 5.3 inch display I don't
know I'm feeling like this this is a
this isn't the most exciting obviously
but this isn't a terrible way to kick
off a new flagship series from this
Nokia label yeah I'm gonna take you know
not offense because I don't feel that
strongly about it but you know a little
aside from David's point here because
we're talking about its standard you
know a lot of standard hardware dafair
from
Foxconn which is a manufacturer partner
of hmd quibble who are both behind the
Nokia brand these days and given that
they wanted to go for a medal something
that has not been I mean we haven't
really talked about Nokia as a meadow
manufacturer except for maybe that c1
tablet that they had a couple years ago
I mean it's been that standard design of
plastic and the hard hardness you know
Xochitl charging would be would be out
of the ball ball field I guess for that
and amplified AMOLED I mean we're in a
tight situation for AMOLED in this
market I don't think yeah that
definitely feels like it that one of the
major compromises for trying to arrive
at this price point is I'm sure that the
camera button I think yeah it's more
it's more of a valid thing that was no
one no kiyose things but who knows what
might have happened because Microsoft
did transfer a bunch of design patents
to Nokia but yeah it's only 500 pieces
who knows what the other pieces that we
do not know of yeah when we knew they
weren't getting the branding you know
something we're getting clear black bag
but maybe the technology just couldn't
but yeah I wonder what though I'm like
if it's gonna just be called like Nokia
camera now for therefore there's a baby
I think I mean they already have the app
up you know because they can updated on
the Google Play Store instead of having
to do it through software updates so
yeah it's just um I think it's gonna
take time obviously but we're I'm
excited just it's I mean for a lot of
people I mean we're seeing phone
companies make some really bold and
daring design choices
this feels a bit more conservative I
don't think anyone would disagree there
but I kind of feel like this is probably
the right step to soft launch the Nokia
name again and start building up an
expectation for what they can achieve
from from at rina-chan well the first
Lumia series lacked a lot of features to
it took until the x20 Lumias for it to
get nice features
hashtag pn weekly and from peter hatin
i'm trying to work out who and why HMD
included the both e feature to me
seems like a real gimmick and may not
help I mean a lot of manufacturers have
played with both front and rear camera
broadcasting though I mean that was
actually a that was a really fun feature
to play with I know when we were
reviewing the Galaxy s6 active and like
trying to livestream going down a
waterslide with the front and rear
camera on at the same time and then the
splash water hit the screen and like it
ended the broadcast before it really
started this but but I played with that
and that make 10 make 9 like it was like
that big push or it's like oh you can
Facebook life right from the camera app
you know I think more manufacturers are
starting to link up to those api's and I
mean that's what that's what the front
rail is for right like if you're a
hipster or it will not really helps to
be just a pathetic are you hating on
millennials again do I need to go and
buy more avocado toast come on you want
it's good it's fine but like but but I
don't think a company's wrong in this
day and age to really be making selfie
features a major part of the discussion
I I think that's actually a pretty smart
consumer play and when you see like just
I and what I'm hoping is that we see
some of the same microphone acumen that
we had on phones like the 1520 because
that surround sound recording I don't
think anyone stopped how good that was
implemented on the 15 20 in the 930
so if we get an Android device with
decent front and rear broadcast
capabilities and the ability to to play
with surround sound audio recording all
at the same time like that could be
really fun to play with it could be and
I mean we're playing around with all
these everyone's been you know HTC it's
it's iPhone I guess that's really not
been the one that's you know multimedia
creations just tap and go and you're
done for them so it's it's that
familiarity meme that you've been
hitting on in terms of the camera app
layout and
the feature set I mean it really took a
little little we haven't grown warm to
the whole zoom lens and right I don't I
don't think we've it's why they'll say
it's like 3d touch so um yeah it's just
I'm not I'm not sure if we're going to
evolve or advance in terms of being more
involved with our multimedia creation
yeah that's another thing to mention too
is I'll be curious to see how they
implement the their dual camera system I
mean I thought it was a nice shot in the
arm for Motorola to go with match
sensors it's been a huge benefit I feel
for Huawei phones and it looks like
Nokia's doing something very similar
slightly smaller image sensors but
hopefully we'll get some really good
software processing depth of field
effects black-and-white photography
photo effects things like that so again
I'll be really curious to see how that's
implemented I think there's gonna be a
lot if any part of this phone is gonna
have unrealistically high expectations
it's gonna be on the camera performance
with that Zeiss label indeed indeed
let's this ice away from Zeiss and know
here for a secondary but we can turn
that into a verb I don't know I'm trying
I'm trying so hard in my name to work
good I think yeah it's it's it's like
putting work one word in front of the
other like a little change Oh trying to
like blocks words words are hard this is
ya know just me today so sorry I'm gonna
try and make this less of a problem as
we transition to Google and how word for
it I guess we're all paying for the
option to do this whole say it like hey
it's a galaxy and I can use Google on it
right away from the main screen also
iPhone to where it's wait doesn't I'm
not sure how the iPhone would really
work because like it's a preferred
search engine app like this is it
getting top promotion at the app store
or what cuz
I know is it is it like a Safari thing
too well yeah I mean I think that's what
they're getting at is is didn't Apple
threaten to switch everything over to
Bing and then that kind of just vanished
like people stopped talking about it and
that's one of the things I think these
companies have always had a little bit
of leverage over Google and it becomes
like a license not a licensing deal but
something akin to a licensing deal where
you fire up your phone and you have an
expectation that when you hit a search
bar you're just gonna be sent to Google
they're synonymous with search and so it
it would be kind of a nuclear option I
think a few people could be upset by
opening the search bar on an iPhone or a
galaxy and being sent to a Bing search
results page but they always have that
as a threat against Google and how
Google's ad metrics work that's
something that I think Google takes very
seriously is they should be synonymous
with desktop search they should be
synonymous with mobile search and so
it's almost like it's not extortion but
it is kind of hey Google it's a it's a
really nice search engine you got there
be a shame if someone on galaxy couldn't
find it is what I'm saying so they'll
make what the this is a terrible Italian
stereotype and I apologize well resume
listeners in the pocket net weekly
Goodfellas or the other movie that I
can't think of aside it's it's a bit
spawners damn it anyway this brain is
not working um let's talk about you know
well I was about to transition to
something when I didn't finish my point
goddamn alright so I'm getting in the
way myself let's pretend that didn't
happen
hello anyways how eighths I think is
something that we're going to talk about
in just a few minutes I do want to Pat
out a little bit more on what we saw
with the gear fit to pro though yeah
definitely as a sort of way to have you
know I mean we saw ip68 waterproof
last year for the kitchen - I've
atmosphere so you can actually swim I
don't like swimming has taken a really
long time and or is to be like prepped
for or are supported as a means of you
know adapting to Fitness technology yeah
it was one of the first but they've kind
of gone up scar to their lead Apple
watch and net and now it's just you know
between Apple and Samsung I guess really
so I don't know what what do you think
about two options this year because we
have the gear sports which is supposed
to be more of a SmartWatch thing right
and a gear for two Pro the mold band
well no I definitely think there's some
merit excuse me I have this dry cough
and I apologize you know I've got these
little wispy coughs we're apologizing
yeah it was like we apologize for our
existence and it's just really sad no I
think there's definitely some merit to
offering different solutions like you
know I really like my huawei Smart Watch
but it wouldn't be the best fitness
trainer if I were more fitness II
inclined and I think Samsung actually
has a good idea on their band so when we
see this fit to band you know it really
looks to me like sort of the next
evolution what we always wanted from a
Microsoft band you know really taking
into account different types of exercise
not just a lot of these things I think
are focused more on step counts so
walkers and runners get the lion's share
of of attention for new features and
support and all of these other types of
weight of weight I was gonna say weight
training all these other types of
fitness activities like weight training
cycling swimming seem to be
afterthoughts for a lot of these
products
I thought the Microsoft band was the
first good step in a major tech company
trying to address some of that oversight
with how it would interact with
different workouts and if Samsung can
kind of spiritually continue that
discussion then I think that's a huge
boon for the fitness industry I'm still
kind of surprised we talked about this
on the board at work podcast
I'm kind of surprised that we haven't
seen like a more fitness apparel getting
into this space for customized solutions
like sensors woven into compression gear
you know like your compression shorts
your compression top that have like
heart rate sensors built into that and
then can track muscle movement so that
you know maybe you're really trying to
do a lot of workouts with yoga or
pilates to see you know like temperature
or skin electrical conductivity you know
things like that that can help augment
the fitness education side as well you
know this is this notion that we can
achieve everything with a couple sensors
on a wrist I think we need to start
expanding out of that but at least for
Samsung's lineup I think this is a step
in the right direction
I mean Under Armour and all the other
clothing Outfitters still have to figure
that out I mean still kind of a bulky
solution that they have to deal with
that if they're talking about clothing
then we have to take care of so that
doesn't you know stretch and you know
water improperly there's a lot going on
I'm not saying that it's easy it's just
we've seen what who was it was Google
had that that tech demo with Levi's
wasn't it Levi's yeah the cargo jacket
and it was like oh you just have to rub
the wrist while you're braking or
something to order an uber later I like
those but I think there's room to create
more of a personal area network in
general like I'd much rather have tiny
little sensors that clip to my shoes
than trying to count my steps from my
wrist where as soon as I'm pushing a
shopping cart or my daughter stroller
like I just didn't have any steps that
day even though I walked across
Disneyland five times you know so I mean
like I just think there's room I think
there's room to expand beyond just the
wrist and this isn't really anything
that I think is critical of Samsung more
just the fitness industry in general but
from what I see from Samsung I'm really
excited that they are making a bigger
point out of talking about other methods
of exercise I don't think any company
I've seen making a similar claim was
misfit so I think it was the misfit ray
you could buy a plug-in for the misfit
app which was supposed to reconfigure
your ray so that it did a better job of
tracking swimming strokes but that's
still just like like the most basic kind
of step tracker it wasn't like you have
so had heart rate info or any type of
customized workout strategy directly
from your wrist so again I think
Samsung's on the right track here
yeah and just one more topic which I
found pretty interesting in the wake of
all our moto z2 force coverage and that
is the whole patent with the shape
memory polymer is what they continue to
use so what I mean they filed this years
and years ago like it looked like I
think one of our derivative vias said
like it looked like an Atrix device that
they used in the drawings but right so
it's like okay how long has this in the
making and when can you see it because
this whole ideal of okay we're gonna use
a plastic a very easily scratch Abul
plastic for shadow proof proofing it's
tit really hasn't worked out this year
to the critics and you know it really
has made kind of a controversial phone I
think it's a possible scale bar for for
some consumers so no I agree what's
interesting is you know this this is a
really science fictiony idea I love the
I me even the the patent diagramming
this looks super I mean it looks
futuristic and cool and like yeah I
absolutely want that what I think is
curious how do we control for phones
that now would have to have self heating
elements to bond and fuse pieces of
broken screen back together and what
will that do to the cost per unit of a
device as opposed to we were to take the
Moto Z to force as it currently exists
and we had a really good first party
solution from Motorola for a glass layer
that we could stick on top of that
screen
or I mean just imagine like what they
could do for marketing like they've got
their basic protector which is kind of
like a gorilla glass or a heart into
class and then we've got our premium
protector which is like you know
synthetic sapphire and just imagine you
could charge out the wazoo the margin on
that would be insane just because you
could call it sapphire we wouldn't have
to worry about including other
components in the phone that are rarely
used if ever used only used when you
damage the phone I think that's that's a
lot of cost to add to a device for
something that's not going to be you
hopefully not gonna be used very often
as opposed to yeah I had to spend
another forty-five dollars on a sapphire
screen protector because I smashed my z2
force but the actual screens fine I just
need to replace the front cover you know
for something that that is that works
better than like a third-party add-on
maybe it's even accounted for in the
frame that runs are along the border of
the phone you could do something really
interesting there where there's a little
bit of an edge or a lip so that it fits
perfectly and it's designed to be as
easy to install and is perfect to
install as possible that I think would
probably be an easier and a more
profitable solution for this then then
and re-engineering our phone screen
displays to have overly complicated
heating elements to fuse broken screens
back together I'm just not super
positive on this idea I mean maybe if
they you know took that sapphire
material and re-engineered the whole top
layer that chatter shield thing maybe if
we if they did that is like an optional
upgrade replacements they and would
they'll be selling them instead of not
selling them because so because low
sales have effectively you know just
like they said to us exclusively a
pocket now intent hello hi they're not
selling them anymore they're are selling
their replacements because people have
bought them so you know if there's no
profit there they might as well go for
the over-engineering I agree it's kind
of a you know too much but in that ass
as long as I think it's more user
friendly that goes right there and they
know what to deal with it it's I think
it's just easier and you know more
efficient no but something really
there's something really techie cool
about saying like hey if you smash your
screen you can fix it you know without
having to take it in because you have to
like ice you still have to deal with
two-day shipping or going to Best Buy or
whatever to actually replace the thing
as opposed to doing it right there and
then but you know I think that's but
that's just me no no I mean I don't
think it's just you I think there are a
lot of people that would think that is a
cool feature but again it's a cool
feature in a vacuum when we look at the
realities and the practicalities I mean
look at you know people complaining
about the price of the Moto z2 but part
of the price has to include the
engineering and the the implementation
of the Moto mod system which can't be
licensed out to other manufacturers no
one else is jumping onboard that idea of
modularity so Motorola and Lenovo have
to eat and build in the cost of that
Pogo pin data connectivity the software
developing for every moto mod so that
it's a seamless experience he slap it on
the back and the phone knows what to do
with that hardware every piece of that
has to be accounted for in the price of
the phone because it's not like there's
some other post phone purchasing
subscription cost surface that you can
use to get more money out of consumers
in the future maybe maybe but I mean you
know if if you're not gonna you know do
something that has a guaranteed you know
link to it then right I know it's why
why you bother doing you in the first
place it's yeah I think there are some
things that just need to be offered down
a branch I think even at the $800 ish
price that we're talking about for the
Moto ZT force it's still no I mean
that's what's tricky is because at the
same time I think a lot of enthusiasts
are wanting to see new stuff right we
want we want to be excited by technology
want to see something a new feature that
really like just blows our minds and I
think if you were to show someone their
screen healing for the first time we
ever saw something like that it would it
would it would be you know JA a gape
just incredible to say you're a multiple
mobile device the accounting work
because you got the margins you set the
margins up just I really I really need a
Motorola numbers guy to come in here and
tell me like well this is how much the
phone cost those margins this is what
we're gonna do to make it make it cooler
and sexier because I just don't see
where this is gonna be consumer feasible
but if we saw like the tech demo on this
I think we all be tripping over
ourselves to talk about how cool it is
yeah yeah do that by going on to uh well
actually you can't do that because we
don't offer anything or we don't offer
that kind of what just happened but I'm
I'm trying to say you can see full
details on these stories and more
just hit pocketnow.com and look for the
podcast section to get to this episode's
rundown and you can chat with us about
what you're reading on with the hashtag
pian weekly also be sure to check out
Jaime Rivera and the PocketNow daily on
our youtube channel now I'm trying to
get our guest on because they're there
actually somewhere on the line here but
I'm trying to you know see if the
they're able to I get in and apparently
someone's asking a question or why their
representatives was asking a question
hello this is inside baseball my name is
Jules Wong and he's one Kyle's back now
we're just trying to see if we can get
them in so in the meantime yeah I was
the minor technical difficulty here and
we're gonna try to get this sorted out
because we're trying to have an expanded
conversation someone sent us an email
which we weren't really prepared to
explore for our listeners take the wheel
podcast about accessibility options and
it's something that we've been wanting
to pay more attention to something that
we've been wanting to expand on as a
topic of conversation
there's a certain focus in talking about
consumer electronics and I don't think
anyone would be too surprised
here that you sort of focus on sort of
the the the most widely-known
inaccessible parts of the phone you know
things that are gonna affect the
greatest number of people but there are
whole communities of consumers and whole
collections of customers who have
different needs for interacting with
mobile data and services and have
different maybe potential barriers for
interacting with those services and so
we're hoping that we can start expanding
on some of that conversation while we've
been talking about some other sciency
issues especially digital mental health
smart phone and data Internet addiction
and other ways that we can kind of help
improve the landscape for future
technology services we we don't want to
see people left behind we want to make
sure that people are along for the ride
as many people are along for the ride as
we can kind of fit in our 21st century
data services boat so hopefully we'll be
able to get this guest on and see we've
been trying to coordinate this
apparently he's on vacation vacation but
I've been working through his
representative and it's kind of like you
know it's a it's a game of little
telephone and little tech intelligence
especially with hangouts because you
know it's not to ative kind of tool I
mean we use it every week for hey you
know this on-air broadcast so and like
we should put use it in big bunny ear
quotes jumping through hoops to make it
blow up in our face yeah I want to see
if we can actually tease what I thought
I mean all right so if you were to think
about the no dates because we're going
to talk about that I promise we are um
in maybe like three words what would
your three words be three words for the
note eight man and put on the spot I
would say
boring no no no no I was gonna say
bigger but fragile bigger but fragile we
have more of a screen there yes it's the
thing that has concerned me and if we're
gonna tease anything we do have a new
pocket now debate video coming out on
Friday tomorrow tomorrow afternoon
Friday afternoon where Jaime and I
debate the merits of the note as a
Productivity platform and I'm gonna I'm
gonna hide who's in who's debating for
and against that premise you'll just
have to tune in to the video um but you
know I pulled my trusty note for out of
retirement and I don't know that I felt
many phones that kind of have that same
notion of business great durability you
know classic Motorola's were kind of
built on that then the note 4 was built
on that and moving over to glass curved
glass on both sides infinity displays
you just don't have the same confidence
in chucking it in a briefcase making
shirts and your check your you know on
plain luggage running around trying to
answer business queries you know you're
holding suitcases I there's a certain
notion of business productivity that I
think the note is walking away from or
has been walking away from since the
note 5 in favor of a more generalized
consumer approach and is that really is
necessary when we've got phones like the
galaxy si plus you know we already have
the big screen the curved edges the
pretty phone maybe it's time for the
note to revisit some of the more durable
business II kinds of designs that we've
had for notes in the past you know I
mean mmm
Samsung has made a point its executive
one of them has made a point that you
know this would be media consumption
device as opposed to anything are they
productive and you know you can draw the
S Pen where you're supposed to do that
are you supposed to you know tap on you
know a spreadsheet or draw a little
something or other little doodle I mean
it's really up to the customer base that
actually adopts it and
they're funny that's you know more
gamers are using it and they're you know
enabling these game recording features
and other features that are not you know
necessarily suited towards enterprising
towards I guess productivity in general
and one of the things that's been really
difficult to kind of keep talking about
for consumer electronics in general I
mean look at all of the features that
come out and people cover them sort of
as a tangent or in in a really shallow
way you know like oh this phone can do
this thing and they mention it but they
don't really explore the use of it they
don't really explore what it really
means to engage with that feature to
engage with that service I'm trying to
think of some examples right now but I
mean it's kind of like if you had a dual
camera phone and you just took a couple
normal photos and you didn't really talk
about you know photo editing or
productivity or anything like that
you're missing what that camera can
bring to the market and I feel spen
often is the same it's like a it's like
Galaxy s8 but it has a stylus like well
that's that's not really the full
discussion on a product like that we'll
get into that discussion soon enough
because I see we have a new guest
joining joining the Hangout a few
teething pains and getting us all set up
here
I'm going to expand my window so I can
better see everyone in the Hangout and
mr. Holtzman from AARP I believe you
should yeah all right and you're all set
up and ready to jump in so you are the
the senior vice president of marketing
at AARP I have that title correct no
senior vice president of market
innovation market innovation excellent
okay thank you for correcting me there
that's actually a pretty important
distinction for what we're gonna be
talking about just real quick especially
considering that our audience is
probably a little younger my age and a
little bit younger what what how would
you describe the mission of an
organization like AARP well the overall
mission of AARP is to enhance the
quality of life for all as we age
so it's an ageless mission you just got
to be 50 to get into the club though but
to enhance the quality of life involves
many different things and where I'm
focused and my team is focused and
therefore AARP is focused is to identify
and to spark innovative products and
services and to encourage more relevant
and better more consumer friendly
products and services that will enhance
the quality of life by addressing unmet
and under met needs particularly in the
areas of health security financial
security and personal fulfillment so I
mean obviously a major part of our
conversation here at PocketNow is
focused on mobility mobility technology
smartphones and getting people engaged
with those types of services at work and
we're focused on mobility in the other
sense ensuring that people can get
around but that has become a major part
of that that interaction hasn't it is
the these now it's hard to envision life
now without some access to some of these
tech services we're seeing more
retailers and adopting like tap and pay
you know so that you're using your phone
more proactively as opposed to only
reacting to changes like from emails or
text messages or something like that
what are some of the some of the more
recent adaptations that AARP is an
organization has met I mean I just
recently went on the website to see I
was very surprised to see this
incredible portfolio of discussion
topics ranging far and wide from
entertainment to you know food to
lifestyle but you know I didn't see that
one bullet point that one category just
for technology you know or science or
something like that how have you seen
that adaptation unfold especially during
this electronics
lucien still there III think I froze on
you for just a second there I are you
still able to hear me yep Oh Sam now
okay I think you're back I am I in too
so yeah that that sort of evolution of
ARP relating to some of these more
technologically focused consumer areas
so you know first of all you know there
there are just the myths that you know
older people you know are not online are
not engaged with technology you don't
have an interest in technology and and
those are absolute myths you know the
first thing is is that you know do you
know who Vint Cerf is
I do not Vint Cerf is the father of the
Internet okay Devin he's in his 70s and
he works at Google he's a VP at Google
and an evangelist for the Internet and
Vint you know says when people say well
aren't older people afraid of Technology
his response is afraid of technology
what are you talking about we invented
technology you know when you look at the
cell phone and mobile you know who is it
that invented that that's Marty Cooper
who did it in the late 60s early 70s at
Motorola is still alive and who played a
role actually in the design and Korea
but phone which was the first you know
mobile phone cellular phone targeted at
making it easier for older people had
larger buttons and things like that and
and it's actually produced by a company
called great call which just had an exit
of over 400 million dollars so this is a
huge market people over 50 are
responsible for you know over 53% of
total consumer spending in the United
States they are one of the largest
purchasers of Technology people over 45
carved responsible for 71% of all
patents applied for in the areas of
information technology material sciences
and life sciences so even the economic
value and contribution the economic
contribution of those patents have yet
to be fully realized and the longevity
economy if you were to envision a
standalone economy that was solely
driven by the consumer spending of
people over 50 would be seven point six
trillion dollars making it the third
largest economy in the world and that's
just in the u.s. after China and the
u.s. at you know the US and China and
over three trillion dollars larger than
Japan so so you know and and well up
close to 90 percent of people over 50
are online you know people in their 50s
and 60s I'm talking to you on one of my
two iPhones on 63 I'll be 64 next month
and many of us particularly boomers grew
up with technology in the office I mean
I've been on computers since 1984 when
the first compacts you know made their
way into my office so he's so yeah I
mean I had one of the first portable you
know computers there was a Compaq it
looked like a sewing machine and some
people called it a you know I used to
call it a luggable because wait about
five pounds but tiny little screen and
had floppy disks and things like that so
you know the first thing is that there
is this myth that older people aren't
engaged with technology and they are
they've been engaged with every new type
of technology that has entered the the
market you know since they were kids and
first it was you know was the TV for in
the post-world War two ERA and then
every other adoption from you know VCRs
to
DVDs to CDs too you know Smart TVs to
computers to laptops to mobile to
smartphones
you know people over 50 you know have
have bought a good chunk of those so
let's look first let's first acknowledge
that I believe I believe we can take
that as read now I think because I think
what's sort of germane to that
conversation is one of the points that
you brought up like talking about some
of the concerns of more senior members
we got the maybe I think part of the
market got locked on that notion that
you know senior citizens need cell
phones with larger buttons and then we
kind of stopped with the general mind
share of what it takes to make sure that
all communities I mean not necessarily
just senior citizens but other people
facing unique challenges maybe a vision
based or maybe their hearing based are
you know sort of are stopped from
entering certain certain markets but
there's sort of a joke perception that
well what you need is a jitterbug and
big buttons and that's that's how you
sell a phone to seniors what are some of
the other needs that you know especially
I mean again from the focus of AARP
membership but that you're hearing you
know that might be a barrier to entry
something that's not being fulfilled
currently when we talk about newer
emerging services so the first the first
thing is the issue of design and you
touched on it by pointing to bigger
buttons and I think that you know for
somebody my mother's age who's 87 larger
buttons are actually an important thing
and in fact a smart phone with a with a
touchscreen actually is a difficult
interface for older hands and they're
physical changes to the fingers that
that make it so so bigger buttons that
that are push that that is clearly to a
group of people and to your point not
just people who are older but but people
who may have vision issues or other
issues I think that overall though
the the issue is you know there used to
be this I guess there still is this
concept of universal design and the
problem with it is that it got
essentially identified with grab bars in
a shower now and and so it kind of got
looked down upon my preference is is to
think about design for all and just like
marketing 101 if you have a marketing
solution for your most difficult
customer that just means that you're
gonna have that much easier time to sell
to the rest of your customers okay if
you if you build into the design on the
front end a user interface a and tools
that are intuitive and what Steve Jobs
would have called simply he wouldn't
have put a label on it except to just
say good that's good design and for him
there was good design and there was bad
design and most of it was bad design so
just think about what makes you know a
good you know a good website it's the
number of clicks to get right what you
want to get to write on a cell phone or
an aura or on a smart phone it's it's
how many things do you have to push to
get to the activity that you want to
actually engage in and that's no
different regardless of age so when you
design something that is simply easier
to use what that enable in enables is
the company that produces that it allows
them to penetrate the entire age
continuum rather than be stuck stuck in
a niche of just the accessibility niche
or the older market niche and that to me
is really the promise of several
underlying technologies that are now
coming to the fore particularly with
voice artificial intelligence machine
learning IOT and we have yet to see all
of those things one fulfill their thoth
there
their complete potential but more
interestingly we have yet to see how
they will come together in various
combinations to enable a future of
future activity so do you feel like one
of the barriers might be some of that
social stigma that if someone is making
design so so accessible and so at the
forefront as to engage in a conversation
where this is gonna be easier for senior
citizens to use this is gonna be easier
for sight and hearing affected people to
use that they could be then linked with
this is the phone for old people or this
is the phone for the blind or the phone
for the Deaf as opposed to really kind
of sharing in that mass-market idea of
this is good design I think you you
mentioning Apple specifically we could
make an argument I think some of our
viewers would disagree with me well we
could make an argument that maybe a lot
of the innovation happening in the
Android space is change for the sake of
excitement to talk about change where it
doesn't necessarily always represent
improving interactions or improving
access to data or services yeah well I
think I think that's true you know I've
been a Mac house since 1984 so you know
when in my house let's see how did you
how did you function you had Compaq at
work and Apple at home of WordPerfect
and you know and and other and other
programs yeah there was a lot of
printing out stuff you know I think that
the I'm I'm a Trekkie
right and I and I've always you know
looked at Star Trek and Roddenberry's
vision of what technology can achieve
and how and more importantly the
interface that the interfaces that he
created
between people and technology as
frictionless right so going back to 1965
the first Bluetooth communicator
although it wasn't called that was in
lieutenant uhura Zaire ear right and and
it was you know path-breaking and and
and it was pat breaking in not just
because the technology but also because
this was an african-american actress who
was a key member of the cast in 1965
exactly yeah at the same year as the
Voting Rights Act so you know
breakthrough in that in that regard the
first tablet you know Picard you know
sitting in his ready room reading
Shakespeare you know right you know the
first 3d printing card again going to
get his Earl Grey tea the first virtual
reality the the holodeck you know talk
about you know big data and machine
learning its name was data you know and
it was this Android that could do all
these these things at the service of
people and but I think the the and you
know we're not we're not going to get
into transporters but you know I think
the most significant view of the future
that that Star Trek
you know presented and is now starting
to be realized is voice and so the very
notion that you can simply speak into
the air and stuff happens in response
that to me is where the user in
interface starts to become frictionless
and that is the key not just to
accessibility for people who need extra
help in accessing these technologies
that is accessibility for everybody and
that really is you know the potential of
design for also we see Alexa we see you
know rural home we see apples you know
entry into its series going to get
better and better so that to me is
really where we're the
so because this has been one of my sort
of no evidence to support it hypotheses
is one of the reasons why it's so
difficult to discuss you know
accessibility settings on a phone for
example is it's really difficult to
envision how someone can interact with a
piece of technology if they need to rely
on those settings without someone else's
help like you can just crank open the
surface of your iPhone to find the
accessibility settings exactly and so
envisioning this and I'm glad you
brought up star tracker we were cuz I
was raised on the original series before
next-gen came out and we're going back
through and rewatching it and I actually
had to point out to my wife I think it's
in the third or fourth episode of the
original series where Kirk leaves the
bridge and he takes the the helmsman
with him and he tells you her take the
helm and you're like you've got an
african-american woman piloting the
enterprise and no one blinks like no one
comments on it just like that's how it
works in the future and that that was a
really big deal especially for its time
this one little throwaway interaction
with a bridge crew member I
unfortunately I would have to agree is
this something that has become a part of
the conversation with AARP members that
these needs aren't being met without
assistance from someone else or without
additional hand-holding to kind of get
us into how they can interact with
things like smartphones or just the fact
that these things are changing on such a
radical basis I know that's one of the
reasons why I have been a little bit
more active in recommending Apple as a
potential solution for some of my family
members because I have a reasonable
expectation that when they upgrade their
phone they won't have to learn all the
basics how to use it
whereas I don't always have the same the
same confidence in something like a
galaxy phone maintaining a consistency
of UI right well I'm with you just as a
user you know with regard to Apple
products and there's no question it was
the iPad that came out
and did in fact make touchscreens
possible for many older hands that
previously could not effectively use
what was even a smaller iPhone so what I
was gonna say was that yet you know
these issues of poor design insufficient
design insufficient products that are
just really easy to use intuitive going
back to plug and play and make it really
literally plug and play I mean I think
that's a challenge for for people that
need an extra you know some additional
assistance but I think that's a
challenge for the entire market most of
the stuff that is designed sucks you
know and and so you know for example if
you have a device that is black and you
know you're you're looking for the
on/off button or this or that and you
looked and you see that the button is
black and it's tiny and there's a
two-point font with a black raised
writing with a black background you know
that's not easy for my kids to see and
right now with their 20s than it is for
me so you know right and bless you for
thinking that any modern phone actually
even can dedicate the space for 0.25
okay so 0.1 whatever yes
point point 0.5 you know the point is is
that it's it's insufficient and you know
so ARP has been sounding this alarm
we've been at at CES every year for the
last eight years nine years you know
kind of with a campaign around design
for all my my AARP runs a demo day every
year called innovation at 50-plus live
pitch we
for six years primarily focused on
digital health and and digital solutions
for caregiving we we had it last year at
the Computer History Museum and in in
Mountain View we had it at the startup
accelerator plug-and-play and Sunnyvale
the year before that we've had over a
thousand companies applied to be one of
ten on stage we have you know we only
put 10 on stage at 1,000 we've plucked
770 companies and of those 70s 75 lists
about 31 32 have raised over a hundred
eighty million dollars in venture
investment another five companies have
exited through acquisition we've had 61
venture capital firms invest in those
companies we've had top-shelf VCS who
volunteer their time to be judges
whether it was Koestler or kleiner
perkins or you name them and and so you
know the marketplace has to start to see
that this is a market that is simply too
big to ignore and so if the solutions in
the market right now are insufficient
well that's the role of innovation and
it's the role of innovation not in just
in this area but but in all areas you
know a JW will do you remember
Woolworths yeah okay so what was started
by a guy named JW Woolworths and what JW
one of my favorite quotes of Woolworths
was I am a terrible salesman so I have
to make it easy for people to buy right
well and this is this is one of the
things like I would have a concern with
so you're working you're reaching out to
these companies you're having these
kinds of discussions you're putting them
on stages you're at tech conferences and
the I would say maybe one of the current
criticisms of the Silicon Valley
investor mentality right now is we've
got a lot of great salesmen right so in
in in direct response to the Woolworths
strategy there he has to make
get easy for people to buy are we
finding what kind of response are we
finding though you've you've been at CES
for eight or nine years and this is a
conversation that I still feel like many
in our audience haven't been easy
haven't easily discovered or haven't
easily contributed to wouldn't the fear
be this is really easy to pay lip
service to but then what do we see like
you know the put up or shut up what what
kind of responses do we actually see
making it to market to improve the
situation not just for seniors but for
consumers in general yeah well I I think
there I think your your core point is is
absolutely right there is a lot of lip
service and and I think that you know it
in many ways you'll have
organizationally you'll you'll have you
know in companies you'll have like an
accessibility group but it's really it's
really is an afterthought it's like
corporate responsibility so you know
corporate social responsibility it's
like that it's like that thing over
there but those are things that need to
be embedded and threaded through the
life of a company and it's just from a
business standpoint incredibly
short-sighted to make it that separate
type of thing it's really an example of
not understanding the potential of a
growth of one of the only humongous
growth markets that exists right you
know and so I come out a strategy
consulting you know I used to be a
futurist with the Nesbit group and when
I look at these things I'm asking myself
what planet are these people on you know
you know you know in in Watergate you
know the the the big takeaway from
Watergate aside from you know Nixon
standing with his hands up you know on
on the getting into the helicopter when
he resigned the other takeaway was
follow the money where's the money this
is the population that spends the money
and so you know we have continued to
have a
focus on younger people marking dollars
still are skewed to younger people and
there are you know myths about you know
well if you get them in young you know
they'll be brand loyal for life they
absolutely will not that might have been
I don't even know that was true you know
years ago 50 years ago but it definitely
is not true today particularly when
you're in technology markets where new
stuff comes along repeatedly so you
might have been a blackberry lover and
then the iPhone you know bypassed it you
know or you were a Nokia you know
lover or you know whatever or or a moto
you know cell you know lover you know
the things are coming hot and heavy and
it's only going to be the companies that
are able to constantly come up with a
value proposition that answers the third
question of strategy which is why should
you buy from me and not the other guy
now that's that that's kind of the last
point that I'd like to kind of end on
though is we see sort of this
acceleration of the technology market
where III think you know you were
bringing up the classic blackberry days
it was sort of expected that there might
be two years between a major shift in a
BlackBerry product right these things
would exist for a little while and prior
to that it was a big deal when like a
new desktop was released a new IBM
compatible PC that was like a five-year
ten-year strategy no one ever got fired
for buying IBM now and now and now you
just have software upgrades well and do
you feel like that's sort of
contributing to maybe sort of a tech
fatigue I think we're starting to see
the beginnings of that across the
consumer consumer spectrum in general
but this is also one of those things you
know like there's the stereotype of
grandma having difficulty using her iPad
every time there's a major iOS update or
an app changes on her folders is
repositioned is that something that's
becoming a part of the conversation for
AARP membership
yeah I would I would say it's not a
dominant conversation and I think in
terms of you know technology fatigue
when you see new products come along
like the Amazon echo you know if it
serves the need people get it you know
and so you you know you have an
accelerator in Seattle right now that's
funded by Amazon it's run by a guy I
know from tech stars you know that and
it's all about building on the echo
platform
well we've seen products around
caregiving that are being built on the
echo platform those things are then
gonna find their way into some kind of
IOT connection I want to see the day
when my mother can walk into her house
and just say Harry because she's renamed
Alexa hey Perry I love it Harry I want
to talk to Rachel who's that rachel is
my niece her grandchild who's in the
Peace Corps in Nepal and only has access
to broadband twice a month knows what
those days are can then schedule that
FaceTime conversation between Rachel and
my mother and then put up on the screen
reminders to my mother Harriet just
reminding you fling next week Rachel's
gonna be calling in four days Rachel's
going to be calling today because my
mother will have lost whatever she wrote
down that appointment on remand and then
all of a sudden my mom's there in the
lid in the living room watching the
television and there's Rachel right for
that because this has also been one of
the concerns that we've talked about
with voice assistants in general the
amount of personal information do you
think we will be able to build an
ecosystem that can address some of those
concerns at the same time protecting
privacy protecting user data you know
making sure that people understand
you know sort of what's the safe
behavior and what's not I know that's
got to be a part of the AARP mission is
that kind of outreach and kind of
Education
I think the the biggest things for for
AARP are certainly privacy but it's it's
you know privacy increasingly is in the
eye of the beholder and it is
increasingly you know opting out or
opting in as opposed to opting out you
know it's it you know you're gonna see
those that are demand opt-in and they're
gonna be those you know that I could
just be comfortable opting out privacy
has to be built-in as we've seen you
know with regard all there's always
somebody smarter reminds away I think
this is part of the reality that we that
we're dealing with and I think on the
back end things have to be done
certainly to prevent the break-in but
then it's you know once there is a
break-in
it's on the back end of protecting the
people whose data has has been you know
compromised uh you know so that's one
thing but the the the other part of this
is it is also you know the fraud and
targeting of older people once you have
that data or you know and that doesn't
require you know great technology you
know almost all of the scams these days
are telephone calls and and and and you
know somebody will call and they'll say
they're from Publishers Clearing House
and you've won but you have to send them
a check for a hundred dollars to get
your check for five million and you know
and and I've seen those kinds of things
left and right and if this is a major
issue that our members feel very
strongly about and it's an area that
AARP has rightfully you know focused on
you know working with attorneys general
you know across the country but also
providing
tools and education to people you know
about what information they should
volunteer you know over the phone or
even you know over over over the
internet so I'm but that's really
interesting to hear these so the the
stigma that you know grandma's falling
for the Nigerian prince email scam or
that their computers are getting hacked
because they're clicking on ad banners
really is kind of overblown that the
traditional more human scamming sort of
a data mining is is still the prevalent
cause of that kind of abuse yeah I don't
have data on you know percentages but
but but but it's still you know the the
you know the the the old true and steady
you know still unfortunately seems to
work
all too often but that that's also good
news I think for the future of
technological services that it would
appear the protections are at least on
the right track I mean they're obviously
never gonna be that's right that's right
and so for example you know there are
companies that startups that have been
on our stage like ever safe and true
link golden and others who are helping
to fight most importantly by allowing
families to to track you know financial
activity and and to jump on it you know
right away I also think the banks are
frankly you know just getting better I
mean I know for myself you know I
recently bought a new mattress you know
right and you know was a purchase very
different than usual right yeah I often
you buy a mattress and and and so I got
a phone call you know from you know the
fraud alert guys you know at chase you
know to say is this you and you know
blah blah blah and you know I think
increasingly that'll be happening you
know as well and the technology and you
know and even on the fraud alert stuff
that's where artificial intelligence and
machine learning and clean and those
underlying technologies are just going
to get better and better
so the
really just reinforces the idea I mean
we got hung up on things like Android
updates or iOS updates that really it
does seem to be that from your
perspective making improvements more
seamless in the background improving
that data layer of AI being able to look
through information is really going to
be the next major hurdle for improvement
services for everybody and that comes
with bringing more people into the tech
fold from various communities be they
senior citizen or from other facing
other disabilities or challenges right
and and and on the on the services side
the ability of these technologies to
help make recommendations that are much
more personalized you know you know so
for example you know in medicine there's
a lot of discussion now about
personalized medicine really what it is
is genomic medicine and because genomes
are singular and unique then people kind
of you know generalize it to say that
that it's personalized medicine it's not
it's it's it's it's molecular medicine
its genomic medicine what is missing is
the person that and the person it's
really about how they live their lives
and everybody lives their lives
differently things are different or have
different degrees of importance sure we
all have you know certain common vein
themes that we all want you know you
know a good quality of life and
happiness and and and social circles
except for you know the individuals that
just want to be by themselves of all
ages but you know but had your
circumstances your float your life flow
as my my friend and colleague dr.
Charlie a says you know it it's when the
products and technologies adapt to the
person rather than the person having to
adapt to the technology that's when it's
right that's when we have the the right
fit we had we had a question here and
actually I think that kind of helps
address it from a Twitter follower Peter
Hayden talking about some of Google's
recent pushes into
mainstream adoption of things like
augmented reality their visual
positioning service to help people
navigate areas that they might not be
familiar with but that doesn't really
seem to be you know a service that
should be focused on a particular
demographic that sounds like it should
be something accessible to all kind of
the last point you were making there
that it really if we were to take the
notion of you know who we're spending ad
dollars on you know we're targeting
youth markets the exciting conversations
around what next social media sharing
photo app is coming out this week and is
going to be gone next week that that
seems to be one of the last big hurdles
to get over for improving the situation
for everybody yeah no excellent well on
that on that note of being in an
agreement I think we should go and wrap
this up I really do appreciate you
taking the time to chat with some of
this stuff where can people find because
again you know I would imagine that most
of our audience is probably too young to
join the club but it seems like there
are still conversations worth having and
especially for relating to say older
family members because we're often the
people that are tapped to make those
purchasing decisions for our friends and
family and where can they find more
information on some of these topics
which might be relevant for some of
their older family members yeah well two
things one I you know what's really
important is that the older person be at
the center of innovation and that the
older person be involved in those
purchasing decisions you know purse
devices personal emergency response
systems the kind of I fall and I can't
get up buttons right you know half of
those are in a drawer and they're
they're in a drawer because they were
bought by an adult child without talking
to the older person and you know even
the oldest and frailest do not want to
wear something around their neck that
communicates like a neon sign I'm old
and frail right you know older people do
not want to buy things the old the older
guy does not want to buy the car for the
the guy right cuz in your head you're
not the older guy in fact we did
research years ago to ask people what is
old and you know what what old is old is
about 17 years older than you are
regardless of that actually makes a lot
of sense though I don't I don't feel
like I'm an adult yet I feel like I will
be in about a decade
well basically it's it's the next
generation my generation is old it's not
me and so you could have you know a 75
year old well my in-laws are 96 of them
you know that's 75 year old is still you
know young whippersnapper compared to my
in-laws and a generation away in fact so
you know so we gotta gonna you know
ensure that you know innovation on the
design side is involved so I was telling
you about our demo day you know right
all demo days have the same thing they
have you know venture capitalist judges
the entrepreneurs do their pitch
somebody's chosen as a winner but we do
something differently because we bring
in the consumer so we have a judges
winner and a consumer choice winner
because we bring in AARP members and we
give them wireless voting devices and an
open mic to provide real-time market
feedback to these entrepreneurs and that
is what is missing so in the startup
world you can have all the discussion
you want about Lean Startup methodology
which is premised on repeated it or
iterative interactions with the consumer
most startups and entrepreneurs don't
have the time the money or the way to
access you know the consumer and so you
know would it be better absolutely but
most it doesn't happen and so we saw
that as an opportunity to put the
consumer at the center of innovation if
you're designing for this category of
people that category of people better
have a say in to what's being designed
for people like them so in terms of
where people can go
for more information they can find it on
the AARP o-r-g
website another website to look at which
was started by AARP and United
Healthcare with a focus on digital
health is called the longevity Network
dot or RG and a lot of our studies
they're all you can download them for
free we're trying to build more of a
community and make it much more of a
destination for entrepreneurs and
investors and academia and you know tech
media and anyway those are resources
which you like you mentioned like we
have access to those resources even if
we're not card-carrying members of AARP
but that there are discussions there on
those sites that can help inform us you
know what might be a way to approach an
elder an elderly family member or
someone with unique concerns facing
something like digital mental health or
a home care or communications equipment
in general that's what you were saying
cuz III think you know you you really
nailed it with I fallen and I can't get
up there are so many of these
well-meaning well-intentioned products
like oh I need to get that from my
grandmother like she's not going to ever
use that but she's totally comfortable
using her iPad to FaceTime with her
great-granddaughter like that's right
not a problem right or she learned to
text but because of her granddaughter
exactly exactly and so the those those
types of conversations I think are
important to kind of keep in mind and
that we have access to that information
we don't have to have an AARP login to
get to some of that data no and I think
and I think there's a larger issue here
which is how how can you be involved in
the world at this time and be unaware
not just of the greatest demographic
wave in the history of humanity and
we're talking billions of years of
history right not only be unaware of it
but not be look
the implications of that because I would
argue that there isn't a single industry
even in b2b spaces that doesn't have to
be aware of this trend it has
implications across the board and so it
may not be obvious what those
implications are but that is certainly
the conversation that has to happen
excellent well thank you so much for
taking the time and we'll put those
links down in the show notes for this
video too so people can click on those
for more information and I really
appreciate you having this chat with us
it's something that again I don't think
a lot of us are focused on but there's a
lot of there are a lot of misconceptions
regarding how these contents very much
one thanks very much thank yours all
right wrap this show up I think I think
this is a good idea to wrap it up with
yeah I mean if you if you were sort of
again it's a IIIi feel bad making an an
iPhone user jump through the Google
Hangouts hoops to get rides like this
but I'm glad he was able to find his way
oh sure that's true hangouts as iPhone
lovely stuff but let's put a pin in it
folks there you have it another episode
