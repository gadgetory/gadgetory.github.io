of my favorite smartphones in the market
today the 1 plus 3t is still at the near
top of my list it is still my favorite
Android launcher and you simply can not
beat all the specifications you'd get
for the crazy price tag and since my
favorite color option this year is
actually matte black I have to admit I
just could not resist I am hi medley
that I was pocket now and this is the
midnight black one plus 3t I am
seriously glad oneplus did not leave the
matte black variant as the Colet
exclusive for long I am a big fan of
this color mainly because it always
looks good no messy fingerprints or
smudges to worry about there are some
key differences to the gunmetal black 1
+ 3 T and that's mainly focused on the
unboxing experience the box is now black
and red instead of white and red and
since this is an exclusive variant you
will get some minor extras like this
case that is flexible and dark it's
actually very thin so it blends well
with the phone it also provides more of
a glossy look if you're into more of
that look and feel I'm actually more of
a fan of the 1 + protective cases and
particularly this wooden option looks
like if it was designed specifically for
this phone and then the rest of the
contents are mainly the best charger for
some of the fastest pop ups in the
market today
and everything else you have a beefed-up
1 + 3 T here key differences with the
standard 1 + 3 are mainly the more
powerful Snapdragon 801 and the case of
the 1 + 3 T remember the midnight black
variant comes in only 128 gigabytes of
storage you have the same great aluminum
body that we've highly praised in the
past you also have a really good AMOLED
display which only stands out more when
surrounded by this darker chassis
empowering this devices obviously oxygen
OS which is hands-down my favorite
Android customization period I've got my
button combination currently set to a
long pressing the home button to call
the Google
double-touch to launch the camera a long
press of the back button to pull the
notification shade and the DoubleTap to
launch many buttons when available which
is something I wish every other OEM
would - it's really hard to not fall in
love with this a lot of the only thing
missing here is that I thought that dark
wallpaper theme would be included here
and it's sadly not I'm not really a fan
of oneplus wallpapers so if you like the
one I'm currently using just let me know
on Twitter and I'll share a link now the
other thing that's missing here is
Android 7.1 it should already be on this
device it was actually announced that it
would be rolling to the 1 + 3 t weeks
ago and for some reason it's just them
included in the box and the updater just
doesn't offer it now we move past that
overall if you're looking for great
flagship specifications for nearly half
the price tag of a standard flagship and
you're also looking for an elegant color
option I would highly suggest this
midnight black 1 + 3 T at $479 it is
simply hard to beat and folks just like
