about things like bendgate and such
disease on previous iPhones that vivo
apex concept apparently is not a concept
anymore according to rumors and
Blackberry has already begun to tease
that it's icon is going to be reborn I'm
Jaime Rivera and yet again believe it or
not as much as the old complaint about
my jokes he's out of jokes for the past
couple of days so why don't you help him
out in the comments this is PocketNow
daly official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for the
LGG seven think you and expect our
review coming very soon sprint currently
has it for seven hundred and ninety
bucks and before you correct me there
that the price is actually forty dollars
more expensive that's because there is a
buy one get one free deal if you're able
to connect the second line and you can
learn more about the restrictions in the
link in the description now let's talk
about the blackberry key to I cannot
deny how much I am waiting for this
phone and now we have teasers the
company has just showed us on video that
there is a very interesting back that
there are dual cameras and the keyboard
looks rather interesting it seems
different to what we currently see with
the key one again I'm looking forward to
this phone and June 7 is the event we
will keep you posted now let's talk
about Apple as a problem of the things
that I hate the most about the App Store
is not being able to try something
before I buy it and we've got a motion
from developers up to 530 developers
have joined forces to ask Apple to
change things to at least allow some
sort of a trial period that's not the
necessary freemium model that doesn't
necessarily work I'm one of the first
people that don't like it when I see
in-app purchases and it turns out that
the app is extremely limited because of
that I would rather test the full
potential of the app and that would be
easier for me to choose if I want to buy
it or not
then the freemium model but anyways stay
tuned hopefully Cupertino figures this
one out now let's talk about the vivo
apex as well we've got some leaks that
show us that this phone is actually
going to happen we're talking about that
device that we tried to find at CES that
it had a selfie camera that would pop up
and you had an insane 91% screen to body
ratio now more specs have emerged
apparently we get 8 gigabytes of RAM on
this thing stay tuned that will be
really cool
and finally the most interesting
nuisance they have to do with Apple
bendgate
and touch disease usually I don't cover
lawsuit news but we've got some
developments that are interesting mainly
because a judge has just proven that
Cupertino knew about bending issues with
the iPhone 6 and 6 plus the fact that it
was more susceptible to bending
there was a percentage even mentioned
the fact that Apple also knew of the
probabilities of touch disease the fact
that at some point after Falls or
anything the digitizer portion of the
display would just completely not work
still Cupertino launched this phones and
even though we had a repair program
afterwards it turns out that the company
knew this Wayne advanced even of the
repair programs which is weird not
exactly sure what's going to happen to
Apple with this whole lawsuit but in
today's question let us know what do you
think I mean what is your concept of
Apple and how much they praise the
quality of the products that they
produce and then you have a launch a
product like this because in my case I'm
not gonna lie on me no products perfect
and all companies are entitled to some
sort of mistakes and yes Apple made it
right with their repair programs and
everything but still I feel that if you
knew about these problems before the
products were launched and well before
the problems were sensitive repairs I
think there was a way to avoid this but
this is just my opinion leave us a
comment down below we love to know yours
