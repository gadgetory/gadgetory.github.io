rundown apparently it is in fact yeah
but I guess I guess maybe more scary
we're gonna let Jules get a get a good
as media's housing around here I want to
talk about the puzzle phone really
quickly this is you're not into the
project ara stuff if you're not into
what's the other thing I would be into
project RF had the opportunity to buy
the damn thing we just got to find the
trucks man just got to go find the
trucks it's cool this is good for
something from puzzle phone which is
another sort of crowdfunded modular
smartphone but this one is different
somehow first of all from Finland which
is very very important as we know most
of our most excellent phones have come
from Finland little hat tip to nokia
there it doesn't look to be as flexible
as project ara Jules calls out in the
news piece because the fact that we're
getting a spec sheet for this thing sort
of streams to me that there is not quite
level of customization we're looking for
right it's divided into three components
mainly a brain for high value hardware a
spine that holds the display and a heart
houses the battery and other and other
things it's a lot more streamlined than
our up at the same time limiting your
availability to mix and match individual
components right there only calling out
a 64-bit octa-core processor type so
that could be what that could be
Snapdragon 810 it could be nya not a lot
of specificity there except you a lot of
things 12 megapixel camera on the rear 5
in the front LED flash blah blah USB
type-c though that's neat I USB type-c
indeed I meant to mention is the oneplus
X comes with a old-school USB not the
type C which is where my concern though
with the start up from a modular phone
here is that when you invest in this
when you pick one up oh you're also
buying into this idea that you're going
to be able to make changes to it you
wouldn't buy it just once even if you
wanted a modular phone the point is that
you want to play around with it a little
maybe try different components maybe
upgrade later on and i think is really
important than or that's going to
convince users to get involved with a
project like this that they know that
there's going to be a lot of options for
them they know that the options that are
available right now aren't going to be
the only one
now make reassess their phone a year
later maybe they can upgrade the
processor to something that's then the
latest and greatest so it's really hard
I think to convince someone to go in
with an upstart with some crowdfunding
campaign like this I think that's a big
project are a lot more attractive it's
just knowing that Google's behind it
yeah some of you know Google's projects
looking at glass right now don't have
the long the public longevity that you
know the early adopters might hope then
again it's google when it has the the
possibility for this to be still going a
year or two later apparently it's not
that hard for them to raise some money
they're just started they have 39 days
remaining and they've raised sixty
thousand dollars of a 250,000 other goal
it's something I said yeah um the one of
the very first comments i read on the
coverage on this piece i don't know if
it was a pocket or somewhere else with
somebody said the same thing I always
say but what about the joy of buying a
new phone because that's like that that
sort of consumer rush that motivates a
lot of people to go buy everything not
just phones it's going to be absent here
you're buying a new module so I think
that will have to be replaced by the
satisfaction of doing something to save
the planet because we do have far too
much toxic electronic waste and
smartphones contribute massive portion
of that or um or what I don't know not
like i am going to get you heard it here
first i'm going to start a subscription
service for fifty dollars a month i will
send you a nicely a nice package a high
quality cardboard inside there will be a
glass screen and a sheet of plastic on
it that you can peel off it's just the
glass and the blasting every month i
send you a new one that you know what I
would thank you I thank you I will take
that that'll be wonderful just and
there's you're gonna have your fix it's
very happy that that I got to do that on
the oneplus X today and felt mmm just
felt so nice let's talk about the this
this Apple innovation that people are
this is absolutely hilarious and people
run a story and then people are like 100
percent of the comments were like how do
you patent an idea only if your Apple do
United States sucks apple sucks Apple's
terrible anyone who ever
looked at an iphone as a piece of trash
I don't know what patents are how do you
so the deal with this is mmm I just
wanted to go on record once again is
saying but I can't stand people like
that the deal with this is that mmm
thieves are getting wise to iPhone
locking schemes your phone locking
schemes so apparently what will happen
now is not only will people won't just
come and rip your phone at your hands
and run away they will I guess train a
weapon on you and make you unlock your
phone and disable data closes here boy
god this is scary shapes happen to four
in like other industries where we make
credit card super secure now they kidnap
you and force you to go to the ATM then
right it's like a less severe version of
the thing that everybody was scared of
when fingerprint scanners came out as a
con man now they're going to cut off
your thumb just down to your phone run
away with both but no they apparently
will force this has happened I guess is
that thieves will force you to disable
the tracking stuff and then take your
phone which is presumably a terrifying
experience and I hope I Malcolm ilysm so
apples come up with a leg yes so what
you you instead of unlocking your phone
with the designated finger that you
usually use or the fingers usually use
you program one particular finger panic
finger a panic finger to jump the phone
into panic mode and which will
surreptitiously then could not only
retain the Find My iPhone stuff but also
like actively send out a distress call
right now I am which seems like a really
cool idea as long as you can but I just
feel like the immediate way around this
is for the the even a mildly informed
thief to be like unlock it with your
freaking thumb don't put yourself back
soon you make your pinky or default
unlock and then you forget 10 minutes
later and call the police on yourself
right exactly yeah yeah I don't I think
this is there some best in tank problems
with the implementation but it was
certainly worth mentioning because it's
a it's got nothing it just I don't know
it's it strikes me as maybe it calls to
mind a a an old Star Trek episode where
Kirk's like they've got phasers on them
and they're like don't you do anything
money he's like no problem he's got a
communicator in his hand and he like
puts it back into his pocket slowly and
we get a close-up camera zoom on his
thumb like hitting one of the buttons on
the communicator and then Scotty is
sitting there in the command chair on
the bridge is like ah the captain gave
us a code GREEN it means he's in trouble
but we can't do a thing like wow that's
a really specific communicator what it's
for yeah what if you do is up program
something in with the phone centers
there so when it detects that you're
shaking and you're terrified while doing
your terrifying a shin there then and
you know mm-hmm don't like meanwhile I'm
gonna unlock my Nexus 6p you with a
quick I love how quickly that works i
think it's like just brill um I do like
marshmallow I think I like marshmallow
better than better than anything ever
fellas so far I've delved that deep into
it but would you get a new phone please
can I just can I just say and that we
all want I want to buy a new phone
someone make a better phone it I'll
bought one can i say i think i've said
this before Stephen I have I have one or
two phones sitting around that are more
modern than what you have in fact I may
have a hundred and twenty phone sitting
around that are more modern than what
you are using can i send you one any
wrong with my phone would you please let
me send you something i'm just so like
Stephen what do you think about this I
don't know I last updated my software
when the second Bush was in office oh um
if gotta be 2009 again one of these
years nice print left wimax on okay
they're still that's okay that's right
um this is a this next story is actually
interesting is one you wrote Stephen so
I'm gonna let you tell us about how
Microsoft is building this meteor so you
know we had wearable smartwatches and
we're sort of expanding into new
territory here the runcible we're
getting into like wearable I don't know
what that is jewelry but her loom yeah
but you might be hearing about the hero
bowls market soon apparently companies
now are looking more and more to devices
you can interact with just by speech and
then by hearing from them where you
don't need a screen is sort of like that
little notification sliver
earlier only that a microphone into that
you could talk to it might be in line
with this thing Microsoft's working on
called well it's supposedly called the
clip which sort of implies it would
attach to you not unlike motorola have a
clip and he do or the NFC tag I'm not
sure I the thing that this reminds me of
is the motorola hint that oh yeah it had
a picture of the hint on me post here so
we're not sure exactly how this is going
to work and be an earpiece or something
that would clip onto your lapel but in
any case it would be a voice powered way
to access Cortana primarily so you would
just tap on it maybeee listing you all
the time you say Cortana hey help me out
with so and so I can create appointment
for you look things up simply connecting
over bluetooth to your nearby smartphone
at the really neat thing is that the
report suggests that microsoft it's
already making Cortana available to
android users iOS Thetas just opening
they're getting signups now so Microsoft
is already shown its willingness to
approach cross-platform compatibility
with its wearables and what the band to
attend to and they're saying that the
clip might be able to work with Google
now and Siri directly so not just that
Android and iOS users could access
Cortana through it but they could use
the digital assistant of their choice
and I'd be really curious to see how
Microsoft makes this work especially
with Siri its kind of sounds like a long
shot I'm not sure how this might work on
the software side but if they could it
could be a beg cou this and the nice
thing but he rebels is that the price
can stay relatively low so as long as
you have decent amount of processing
power and a battery that doesn't have to
be charging throughout the day there's a
lot to I think like with an idea like
this you know I there is and I was just
thinking the other day when I come back
here is when I Drive the most where I am
right now because I don't drive in
Boston very often to squeeze public
transit card there's not snow in the
ground no I don't know in a car anymore
of those weird it just a real relief
yeah I love driving here and talking on
the phone and it's illegal to do both at
the same time unless you have a
bluetooth headset and I sort of hate
doing it with the earbuds because you
know the wire gets to hang on your
seatbelt on
crap and usually bluetooth headsets
particular moto pulse ones that I have
they're not really great at Santa noise
cancellation I don't think what noise
cancellation when you're driving yes I'm
able to hear the cars and like someone's
honking eyes yeah right yeah you want
everyone to be able to hear that
actually i don't remember i think the
moto pulse actually did well in noise
cancellation back when i reviewed it but
now they suck i don't know i would have
but in any case it plus it's
uncomfortable so the whole thing I'm
trying to say I'm sorry it took me
forever to get there is that I want like
a moto hint thing when i'm driving a lot
or when i'm walking around town when I'm
when I'm called upon to make a lot of
phone calls quite often I want something
just sort of lives in my ear is
comfortable enough to do that and is
unobtrusive and you know doesn't make me
stand out as like oh there's that guy
wearing the huge headset but no one's
really built one yet that I that I think
I would like to use for a long time so
this is an opportunity to to make that
happen my rolling and remembering i
might be making this stuff i don't think
i am didn't we have at some point phones
that had they might be dumb phones the
how own like pop out yes earpieces LG
did one of those for verizon and i don't
think was too recent to be a dumb phone
i feel like they did that with a verizon
new way and the android one or me might
have been a dumb phone i don't know i
didn't get to review that one I wanted
to I thought that was that was cuckoo
anyway this isn't the only thing that's
rumored from Microsoft we have more
sources hinting at a 2016 surface phone
oh you're super looking forward to this
are you I am I am because I think this
is where the line is going and not these
like holdover Lumias full-on reinvention
of the branding here but these might be
a while from the sound of things yeah
2016 mid-2016 is what the the current
thinking is with these would have intel
inside which makes a lot of sense and
would sacrifice a spec heavy outlook for
something optimized for enterprise and
optimized for performance but it seems
to be the speaking point now with
Windows 10 phones what the enterprise
angle yeah yeah yeah I know and I guess
we'll see apparently is it'll have some
enhance to continue on capabilities I
don't know what that means but maybe
damn curious to find out
when win32 app support in tow and less
focus on specs but if you want more
specs in your windows phone the Lumia
950 950 XL sequels could also be powered
by the newsnet dragon 820 chip we don't
know how that performs as of yet there's
a whole lot of other talk about that but
it seems like there's you know stuff
happening on that front I'm less excited
about those I'm much more excited about
seeing what the surface phone does and
how particularly how Microsoft positions
it because we had Microsoft come out
with this surface the serve the first
surface and everyone was kind of like
man and then the surface 2 and the
service pearl but then the surface pro 3
landed in Microsoft effort to push it
through and that turned out to be a
really good device and the pro 4 seems
to be the same so it'll be interesting
to see if they're able to do the same
thing on the phone side but all these
questions are still so completely
unanswered about how windows 10 mobile
run will run third party apps and what
kind of apps the software side is is
very interesting but I'm also really
excited to see what we could get from
the hardware here because surface has
really stood out as Microsoft getting a
you know mobile electronic design where
we haven't seen with the lumia handsets
yes it can bring that same design
language to a phone that is exciting in
and of itself speaking of Microsoft
things there's a product that Microsoft
has called outlook and this isn't about
that this is about the tablet outlook
for the future as we captain not some
yeah well you know it was a stretch but
to no one's great surprise tablet
shipments are falling year-over-year I'm
a little surprised are you surprised I'm
not surprised because I was thinking the
other day I can't remember the last time
I reached for a tablet first I can't
remember the last time when I was like
oh man would have I'm I'm doing those
two walks and what I'm the best tool for
this job is a tablet because the phones
phones are big enough now to where it's
like oh I'm just going to use the thing
i'm already using the thing that's
already in my pocket i'm going to use
that
rather than just reach for this other
device or if I want to do some hard work
harder for work I'm gonna reach for my
laptop but anyway the figures here
Stephens back he'd like every second on
his back Stephens no sorry the figures
here are that there was a 23 dammit
Jules just highlighted it for me I lost
it do you have the actual drop your over
here here second ago yeah I know we just
got derailed by that whole freakin
stupid google google fist shaking the
ipad ipad cuz he had twenty-seven
percent drop think there's nothing yeah
but that's not the pertinent spec is
actually not in the piece that we're
doing as it's a 15 point nine percent
quarter-over-quarter increase in tablets
including two in one end screen
detachable hybrid models this is
DigiTimes reporting here increasing 15.9
percent of the quarter but decreasing
twenty two point six percent
year-over-year that is crazy but see I I
don't understand why there is not well
they're still not this demand for
tablets and it might be because I'm not
a laptop user so for me the tablet
nicely fills this portable space between
phone and I'm gonna go sit down in my
office to use a computer okay yeah yeah
if you don't use a laptop than I see how
you could be like man I'm tablet or that
I'm not your standard you can I think
maybe we're seeing that proliferation of
smaller and lighter just eaten by
specifically hurts for Sifl orderly that
is not a word particularly thinner uh
laptops just making them more portable
mix named the dry for the tablet a lot
less about this thing laptops are
getting smaller and more portable if you
want those you can buy those and phones
are getting larger and more capable so
this whole Middle swath this this market
that Steve Jobs talked so much about
when he unveiled the first iPad I don't
think I think it's disappearing I think
that you know they're still we just
talked about enterprise there are still
all right this is this is stupid are you
still with Stephen are you with me I Oh
still here I kind of froze on screen
here there I go Google just kicked me
out as well no bargain this is all right
this is what we're talking about now
we're not talking about anything else
that's it we're doing this entire rest
of the show talking about our how
Google's authentication freaking worst
thing ever I can't believe it there must
be a reason rather than get all
emotional about this so I've gotten a
little Zen like Steven recently do you
know what I know I haven't I'm just as
angry orders ragers I usually am this is
my happy with the Google self-driving
car you're gonna be the middle of
traffic it's gonna do authenticate you
yeah and then it's can then it's going
to run a logic calculation and decide
that it would be better off killing you
then making you sit through any more of
its crap so it'll drive you off a cliff
and that'll be great for everybody now
my my thing is uh have you been watching
any of the bob ross twitch stream no I
haven't business son doing stuff too I
don't know but twitch has been running
this bob ross marathon it might be done
today and this is all very old news by
the time this gets published but in the
trees oh god i used to watch bob ross
paint pictures in unpublished television
when i got home from high school and i
loved it so much and watching that stuff
watching bob ross and like gamer culture
coincide has been really really
interesting in the in the comments and
there are many people who've written
excellent pieces about this but what
watching bob ross like almost non-stop
for the past week has done for me is
reminded me that that i could really
stands just be a lot happier cuz like oh
i get i get so frustrated by things that
really aren't that big a deal and bob
ross meanwhile sitting there like
basically saying in between brush
strokes like listen you know there's
there's no reason to get so upset about
stuff you know that worlds is a great
place you made your own world and if you
want a tree there you just
put a tree there and it's your world
Michael your assignment for today is to
go outside find yourself a nice adria on
that chair and watch the sunset and
that's what I want to do that's what I
might do after I shoot this one plus X
video Ivan I haven't seldom look forward
to a weekend as much as I look forward
to this this coming weekend gonna be
cold things were different with the way
my shot is framed now oh it's because i
don't have my lower third eye because I
got kicked out yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna
put that lower third up I'm gonna get a
little titanium white cadmium red I'm
gonna put it all together it's gonna be
terrific oh and i lost the Q and a bar
that's what's okay just even while I
pick up the pieces all going to hell
just what what is the next thing can you
talk about air fuel please yeah uh
wireless charging it's getting simpler
and changing and kind of getting more
complicated the same time we started off
the year with three big forces behind
wireless charging standards you had
wireless power consortium with the Chi
guys and then you had the other two the
one seemed like not quite as a prominent
player as the other the power matters
Alliance set at PMA and then the
Alliance for wireless power now they
were never as headline-grabbing as a PMA
and WPC but they announced back in
January that PMA and a4wp were going to
be joining forces are going forward we
only have these two guys two players to
worry about I think the merger formally
concluded like in June or July but the
two of them now decided to announce
their new name going forward so you're
going to start hearing about key and WPC
on one side and the air-fuel Alliance on
the other these are other players a
dascon let me just say it it is the
baddest-ass Lions in the wireless
charging space right yeah you have like
fire fighters that are going over these
you know burning fires dumping the plane
retardant chemicals not the air if you
will like it they're just spraying it
with gas watching the earth the fuel-air
explosion alliance oh yeah it still
sucks that we have multiple players in
the market now but as we've been seeing
with you know flagship phones this year
the tech to work with both standards at
the same time out there hopefully
looking more and more of that in phones
going forward so it hopefully will
matter less and less guess which brain
end of charger you have because the
famil right I I think it's a fantastic
so I was thinking of the same thing
Steven I was like man it sucks that
we've got two standards here what can we
just settle on one but if the phones if
most phones that come out now are going
to include support for both standards
within them and it's not that big a deal
to do it because that broadcom chip said
and think that it uses the same coil I
think then why not have to have 20
standards bodies competing so that so as
to make each other better so as to
leverage the that's the thing that's a
pump I worry that we're not going to see
like situation where the the better
standard will emerge victorious like if
a phone can use either of them in theory
the one that's better performing or in a
more efficiently the one users flock to
but instead all these companies are
locked down they decided ahead of time
we're going to support this standard
we're gonna support this shake hands
sign a contract and I don't think we're
going to see the sort of market flux
that would make the better standard
emerge we're just going to have two
options one movie better will might be
worse but they're both going to be out
there I don't know that this is quite
the progress it could be but yeah I mean
we've had the seed CDMA and GSM thing
going on in this country that's some BS
decades um yeah so we'll see what
happens with that I think we're this
charging should be it as always should
be in more things man i can't wait for
whose the company who did that
ultrasonic charging we heard about like
a month ago was that Marty Cooper's the
company that he's on the board of um I
don't know I guess want something new
lasers photonic charging and 0 energy
Thank You Jules and to close out the new
section something completely ridiculous
I'd we may have mentioned this on the
show before but I recently was cute in
30 for something called a Rufus cuff
which does it looks like a pip-boy if a
pillar were if a pip-boy were not able
to be used anywhere because so here's
the thing it's a it's a smart watch but
it's not it wraps around your wrist no
it's it's none of these things it's it's
it's a monster it's it's it's an
absolute abomination I found myself
watching the video
oh and waiting for like the onions to
tag line to show up and let everyone
know that they were just joking yes t it
what it is it's a workout case for your
phone it's permanent yeah yeah it's a
fanny pack for your forearm so what what
it's an android device running a custom
skin that has a big ol 3.2 inch display
your honor having high two inches on our
um it and well just watch the video it's
true what I mean this is like I feel
like someone had a warehouse of the
worst phone from 2009 like what can I do
with this I know I put a wrist strap on
it right yeah that's it out that's a
really good way to put it actually it
looks like an older smaller android
phone with a huge wrist strap 1200
milliamp battery is that all yeah so
it's big enough it is more than big
enough we live in a world where the gear
s2 has its own cellular radio and that's
a tiny little smart watch this is big
enough to house 5 gear s2 is inside of
its body and yet it is not a
self-contained device it still requires
your SmartWatch smart phone in your
pocket because it does yeah yeah that's
the great thing I've ever and it's huge
I mean its massive any they're even let
guys front-facing camera may I see video
calls here's the video call going on and
like it can do some cool stuff but it
requires your phone to be in four pocket
the whole whole time or you or I can
connect to a Wi-Fi for what you don't
want to bother taking the front of your
pocket just take your other phone and
strap it on your your you know right
right yeah the gym case that you've got
and and put your your existing phone
inside of it there's a front facing
camera for the video cuz a good wife
ablution ferodo if I to see I process my
face man cortex emotional maps we love
those no absolutely it's got a gig of
ram um but it's just crazy like why
would anyone buy this thing is what I'm
thinking and then I go to the actual
fundraising
so they have their own website it's it's
it's Rufus every sure it's not a joke I
as far as I know it's not you can
pre-order it in jet black turbo red or
white out I'm gonna go ahead and
pre-order now have we discussed the
price already 250 yeah yeah something
like that but letters can I have your
phone and a little wrist strap for 250
but here's the thing guys this is an
IndieGoGo project it is real and they've
raised four hundred sixty-two thousand
dollars for this thing and it's here's
where I change okay I would never buy
this I think this is a really dumb
product and I think it I don't see who's
going to buy it but that's the beauty of
this who gives a crap what what my
limited imagination can think up because
enough people are interested in this
that I raised almost five hundred
thousand dollars and people are gonna
buy it and wear it and presumably like
it and I think that's great I'm not even
being a jerk about this I mean I didn't
bring it on the show just to beat the
hell out i don't think that's very nice
I think it's that stories modern
capitalism yeah i I just I I'm glad
because I know as we've said before
these these crowd funding models while
yeah they're overused and every other
day someone else is firing up at
Kickstarter for some it's great
because the people who are interested in
something like this can directly pay for
it pre-order it and say well take my
money when you're gonna gonna send one
now there's only it looks like the claim
numbers are really low on these like
Jules is helpfully highlighting this I'm
Jungian still last few 49 level isn't
has only been claimed by 26 people how
does it we pulled how where's the money
how do the numbers work out then yeah
what are people what is that that seems
a little fishy to me I didn't see that
Sivan are you seeing what's going on
yeah look into the 14 have claimed this
$15 add-on for a ban 32 people have
claimed another band there's some
t-shirt how have more people claimed the
memory upgrade then
claimed the actual thing there are zip
hoodies you can get with the Roofus
brand on it so I'm going to that the
higher pricing tiers what's this oh oh
I'll hold on original campaign was one
hundred eighty percent funded on May
18th maybe this is added to that oh
that's probably what's going on yeah
yeah so that we're not looking at the
original fundraising round okay so
that's promising to it being a second
round of funding to make this happen
yeah and actually you but you know what
I like though is that like because
IndieGoGo is a respected platform and
it's you know it's sort of it's it's
legit we can look at the the figures
they've raised and be confident that its
actual data if this was their own
website was like look how much money
we've raised over like yeah that's not
I'm gonna need a second source on that
pal but it's IndieGoGo and I mean for
real they've actually raised this money
I'll talk specs on here in the pictures
and there's this big old hole on the
side for plugging into a USB cable I was
all ready for it to be a way how long I
guess seriously like something that
would have been so amazing in 2007 I
think is cool the micro it looks like it
would be a mini USB I would not be
surprised if we need a day off this John
people no one uses just did a search in
the chat for a for the word Rufus 0
we're on response nobody wants nobody
cat it's a modern OS on there yeah
anyway let's get to listener mail
because we gotta get out of here um long
gone yeah first listener mail is um
other all they're all special they're
all wonderful they're always terrific
and the very first one is from our
friend brand dot dot Brandon Brandon
hello PocketNow podcasters hello to you
brandon i'm debating upgrading from my
original nexus 5 to a 5 x rated here
comes the pain i'm somewhat frustrated
by the bias I've seen from various
reviews Jules special requests I'm sorry
I didn't give you a warning about this
anytime we say by us on this show I want
a dinger can you come up with a sound
effect for that they do it on the
unpopular opinion podcast which is
hilarious except they do it for the C
word and they have a little dinger for
the C word which is wonderful but yeah
I want I want a dinger for bias I'm
somewhat frustrated by the bias I've
seen from various reviews very good
there you go Thank You Jules um which
I'm sure is due to reviewing it in
conjunction with the Nexus 6p people are
calling it not premium plasticky etc
mm-hmm so that's the first part of this
second part my question is if I'm
upgrading from a five and one a better
battery camera smaller size in stock
Android and I'm fine with the
polycarbonate feel is the 5x a worthy
upgrade thanks for the great work you do
all the best Brandon Everett Washington
Brandon thank you for writing in thank
you for thanking us for the great work
we do it's because of great people like
you that we're able to do great work
which is sometimes grades and the second
part is very easy if you're upgrading
from a five and all those things are
true which I said is the 5x a worthy
upgrade yes yeah in fact Steven I think
correct marana the subtitle of our
review might be over the upgrade yeah
what about a feel you think he's that
well for someone with the potbelly part
is this bias I mean Babu bias so the
bias it's perfect i needa left um stop
using the word bias everyone stop stop
stop using it because no one seems to
know what it means and it's just been so
overhears it what it means right now in
the comments of any review ever is that
the reader did not agree with some part
of the review and is now picking the
least imaginative most available and
most overused term there is out there to
try and discredit the reviewer and we
don't like that no one likes that anyone
so it Brandon I'm not just coming down
on you i'm just frustrated about that i
don't think that your premise though is
supported you're kind of saying that
reviewers are coming down on the 5x
because they're using alongside the 6p
and the 6p has so much better of a hand
feel that the 5x is sort of suffering as
it was got the 5x first didn't they um
know everybody got them side by side I'm
glad and it's not an unreasonable
thing to say I'm just saying that at
least in my case that's not what
happened and it's not what would have
happened if I had only gotten the 5x and
not even touched the 6p I still would
have been like yeah it's probably
carbonate is matte finish polycarbonate
it feels like an old lumia which you
know they felt okay but like you know
the buttons are not especially clicky
there's not a lot of travel and feedback
the speaker grills are not cheap but
also not premium looking it there's
nothing about it that screams like oh
yeah really really well-made thing
there's also nothing about it that
screams like oh what a cheap POS it's
exactly what it's supposed to be it's
exactly what the five was it's like
middle of the road this doesn't cost a
lot of money but it feels pretty good
for not costing a lot of money so I'm
curious I mean it's not stock in the
same way as the the Nexus 5x there but
the oneplus X seems to have a lot of the
same features here that Brandon's
looking for would you say that feels a
lot better than the 5x I mean clearly
applause yeah it does now I keep in mind
i've had in my hand for two hours but
yeah this the oneplus x feels
substantially more premium than the 5x
does part of that is just by virtue of
being a glass sandwich and metal
constructed device but the button travel
and feedback this mechanical clicking us
of the buttons that in the side switch
everything seems to be manufactured to
really tight tolerances and yet it's
it's quite beautiful are options out
there you know so there's that but yeah
if your if your pc seems dead set on the
5x and i don't think you'll be
disappointed the 5x of good fun what's
the next thing Steven can you read the
next one ya know I rights in short sweet
and to the point do your pocket now crew
at eighty dollars is an original LG G
watch worth it what do you think soon
man I ima I love a deal um probably more
so than the next guy and we'll buy
things I don't need just because I think
that they are priced well for a first
gen watch like this though considering
the options out there now and the prices
they are man I want I'm like a
disposable SmartWatch price fifth now 50
is too low I don't know what to say it's
right on the color that's right being
like it doesn't even matter to think
about it
it's probably the last Android wear
watch that I that I would buy I would
pretty much every other Android wear
watch before the LG G wish I just put
that's in the same running with like the
Sony SmartWatch 3 but the SmartWatch 3
has has things going for it that the G
watch doesn't like what a smart with
reasons why your only android wear
watches that has what what was it we're
i was like 'oh the huawei watch is the
only watch that has this one thing and
then everyone's like what about Saudi
I'm like I don't know when Sony starts
trying I'll remember it but like
tomorrow so he has NFC I think or like I
don't know I think we're just I think
this jewel says I think we're just be
biased towards personal devotion no I
don't know the G watch is uh not in the
same league as the SmartWatch the smart
which does have a lot more going for it
it has a bare-bones when you're talking
about what you can get from a SmartWatch
but that said it's still Android wear it
still has the same OS as these other
more modern devices so you will get
plenty of use out of it and for 80 bucks
I think your money will go a long way
mmm I guess it met with what is eighty
dollars worth to you is the question
here what this is uneasy oh but this is
its what it's the sixth today right the
LG G watch urbane LTE 2 squared B you
know is launching today and it should I
think it's available in eighteen t
source today or it's shipping soon or
something like that it no it's available
for order today in the chipping week or
something um that I believe has to have
a new version of Android wear on it in
order for it to work so you know yes so
yet again we I mean on top of everything
we've already said it's gonna make the
1st LG G watch seem ancient there
already feels old I wouldn't buy it
sorry wife isn't moving fast man indeed
indeed and they have to and they've got
a lot of ways to go to before there were
truly excellent and the final one is we
have to get to I sort of wanted to be
out of here 10 minutes ago I'm sorry
that's no it's ok it's not your fault
although the sun has now gone away and
because i'm not near my studio I don't
know how I'm going to shoot this video
damn it hello pocket now says Ganesh s I
recently came across articles that
warned users again
picking up a smartphone that totes an
AMOLED screen the justification being
that the screen is not durable over a
period of time due to burn in is there
any truth to this what is your
experience with AMOLED screens as a
future owner of the Nexus 6p I'm kind of
scared now thanks and keep up the great
work as always I don't think you should
be scared sir yes burnin happens we've
talked about it on this show it happened
on the TV in the other room there I've
left it on ESPN all night for the
benefit of the dogs who are used to such
things and now all the scoreboards like
the weather air for an they don't they
don't know not these dogs these doujin
fierce angry um no and now all the
scores are burned into the panel because
I I imagine because it's a cheap TV I
don't know but I have never seen burn in
on on one of my smart phones I don't use
smartphones for very long even my
favorite I only use for eight months at
a time before getting a new one so
there's that but I also think that
people see retail units that have burn
in I think people see right but then
think of the use cases these phones are
going for how much screen on time are
you going to happen every time the phone
gets a break there when you have the
screen off when it's asleep this is time
it's recovering from the burnin and the
things that are going to be they're
going to burn in the elements on the
screen it are consistent this stuff
that's going to be like up in your
status bar times always changing I guess
the lower part of the battery will still
be consistent yeah like things like the
NFC logo the Bluetooth logo probably
yeah then again the time thing you do
have your phone on for an extended
period of time so you're you know
watching a movie or something on there
you're not going to have those status
things on there it's probably going to
fill the screen in which case the
constant motion is going to prevent
burning from happening there I just
think that the use cases that we see
that make burnin happen on things on
like home TVs don't necessarily line up
with the smartphone user experience like
you're not going to leave a video game
on your phone pause and walk away from
your phone and have the screen stay on
for hours and hours while you go to taco
bell or heat up some hot pockets even if
you have earned its such as Jules points
out it's such an easy fix you just you
just shake it just shake it like a net
your sketch and that burn
goes right away except elk you're joking
or not I'm definitely joking yeah I am
burnet i don't know what's getting
screens with mark knows it because
someone on the show's had burn in on an
AMOLED screen on their smart when we
need a first-hand experience right in
folks what's the address Stephen podcast
at pocket now dot coms great that's
great you stuck with the flow to which I
might you know thank you very much uh
the most upvoted comments in the Q&amp;amp;A as
we're getting out the door here why did
high at a leave pocket now asks Davis
tap don't really like to come to a
specific sir but I will tell you this
mmm it wasn't it was it is not a
development that I like I missed that
mofo and it's not just because he it's
not just because he handled half of my
workload we miss him but great news did
we do we say this to people already what
great news hi Otto is it not dead and he
will be joining us for CES 2016 I didn't
ever lay that was official pentax yeah
yeah so don't worry we'll hear from hi
Otto again every goddamn jerk in the
whole universe is outside my door for no
it's freaking reason you know you
distracted me from my incredible pun
there it wouldn't be a shitty podcast it
wouldn't be upon history there wasn't
shitty background noise everywhere what
was your pop would you say that between
now and CES pocket now might experience
a bit of a hi Otto hiatus but um oh um
yeah what do you think causes Android to
require higher specs to perform as well
as say an iphone Nathan Alvarez the
phases of the Moon system architecture
yeah if androids just designed very
differently and also the whole Android
model is different you have the same
you've this one platform running on all
these different kinds of hardware or as
Apple controls the whole stack it can
build hardware that's suited for its
software and it can tune each the way it
wants to do so it's just easier for
apple or do that why did just even wear
a justin bieber shirt last time I
suppose I don't listen to nobody and
right now you do how you like to do and
finally how do you guys decide who
reviews each device
do the OEMs get to request a reviewer
asks nishad right now I have never had a
reviewer request a perchik or an oem
request a particular reviewer from her
you haven't seen all the anybody but
Michael emails that get forward it
around so no the OEMs don't ask for a
particular reviewer generally and how do
we decide in the team generally the
devices go to the person the
high-profile device go to the person who
is most able to film a really nice video
review based on equipment location
availability and all that stuff I
personally wish we could I love
reviewing stuff I wish we could spread
it around a little bit more but we have
limitations on equipment and team member
availability not all of us are full
timers and and such I'd like to hear
from more members of the team more often
but hey hey hey hi hey well this is the
world as a confining place all right
there's a freak there's literally
there's a truck outside doing something
with its diesel engine so we got to get
out of here you know no time that's what
yeah let's some place to it's been the
pocket that Weekly again it's been a
