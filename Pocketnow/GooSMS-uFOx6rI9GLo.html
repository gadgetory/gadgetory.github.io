Pacquiao calm and today I'm a few neat
little SMS program called goo SMS and
this is a google based program and a lot
of the time at Park another common we
emphasize on data enabled programs but
this is actually an SMS based program so
there's a lot of features to this
program and we can just go through some
of them you can see movies local your
business listings direction so if you
want turn-by-turn directions they can be
text directly to your device whether a
glossary so if you wanted to find a
definition online you get sports
information stocks find out zip code
information so if you want to know
something about a city product
information local time maps flights area
code phone book so if you want to know
what someone's phone number is if
they're publicly listed you do that or a
business airline information translation
so if you want to type in some words to
translate you can do that calculator a
currency converter airport information
little web snippets so if you want to
find something out about a certain
website you just type in the website
address and it will give you information
on that website meet our report for a
airport you can do that their help
information questions and answers and
custom so if you want to ask Google
anything it will send you an answer so
I'm just going to go into some of these
and as you can see right up here I have
no data connection so it's just going
right through my SMS service so I know
the top 41 to find out movie in my area
I've got some here I've already loaded
some cement clear all history and type
in a movie so let's see what's out right
now ok so I'm just going to type in GI
Joe and then put my zip code and hit
Send and we'll give you a low
conformational to show you the date and
the time that it was sent we'll just
wait a second part to come back and
there it is page 1 of 2 so you'll most
likely get two pages or however many
pages you want you can also text next
and they'll send you more listings so
let's see GI joe rise of cobra and it
shows me the closest theater and the
phone number as well as the address and
Showtime so they show times for this
movie are 6 45
45 945 and 10 45 for today of course and
you can quickly send that to the google
SMS or GUI SMS which is what it's called
ok to close out this we get weather
information so if I want to type in a
zip code let's see just search for
beverly hills california it will give us
our confirmation that the message was
sent and it will send us the current
weather for beverly hills california and
it says it's 73 degrees fahrenheit and
partly cloudy so we'll just close that
and let's see what else if i want to
search for a stock say i want to just
search for google stock just click send
and it will give us the current stock
information so it's pretty
straightforward i'll show you the
changes in even after hours information
which is great feature so click OK get
product information all that other great
stuff but for the last thing I'm going
to ask it a question so if you want to
see something clear this again so if i
want to say what does laser stand for
will show our message confirmation again
and give us a little definition so it
says laser acronym for light
amplification by stimulated emission of
radiation and we'll give you a little
another definition here an optical
device that produces an intense
monochrome beam of coherent i'm guessing
it means light so what is closed that so
as you can see you can ask questions
without having to have a data connection
to get you an answer ok so for the last
feature i'm going to show you on this
program it's actually local time so if
you want to see what local time it is in
a city i'm actually going to spell it
incorrectly to show you how smart this
program is so let's see so I typed New
York let's send and Alaska did you mean
New York and yes I did and it is 828
p.m. on monday in New York right now so
the program is free and i will post like
par kaam has how to give this it does
require a serial number but you can get
that off of X DA's website a developer
they're created this program so it's
actually pretty nice to have it
available for free and i'll post a link
i'm talking other comments on how to get
this thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
