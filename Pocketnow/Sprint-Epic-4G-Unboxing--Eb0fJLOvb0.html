pocketnow.com what did he get when you
take a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone and
you add 4G connectivity and a slide-out
keyboard you get the Sprint's Epic 4G
and in this video we're gonna unbox it
it's finally here let's get to it
all right and this very well could be
the most impressive Galaxy S smartphone
yet this could be the phone to get of
2010 let's get to the unboxing it's a
big box and inside there is a small box
so we'll put that to the side and here
is the box for the Epic 4G this is the
second 4G smartphone in America the
first was of course the Evo 4G had a 4.3
inch display let's see what we have on
the box we've got some icons for Twitter
little Android guy galaxy s smartphone
4G the keyboard looks really great
really great let's look around the box
and see what we have here Super AMOLED
got the sprint colors on the back the
bright orange or bright yellow inside
the box we get the battery AC charger no
case or anything like that okay well
let's just get right to the unboxing
here I'm gonna lift off the lid and here
it is introducing the Samsung Epic 4G
Galaxy S smartphone with a stunning
Super AMOLED display I'll put that aside
just for a second I'm sure the
accessories are standard fare inside
here we've got a lot of heaviness inside
this looks like a large manual for the
for the device and of course if you
don't have 4G in your area
the epic 4G will work on 3G just like
the Evo so nothing terribly interesting
in there we've got some headphones and
where is the battery the battery is
probably already inside the device looks
like it actually comes with an SD
adapter that's kind of rare so it's a
micro SD to SD adapter from Samsung so
that you can plug it into your computer
or your laptop anyhow let's take a look
at the epic 4G
it's already feeling quite thin and you
know devices with slide-out keyboard can
be thick but this is actually very thin
can't wait to peel this off Wow gorgeous
the front is just completely black
unless you tilts it you can't even see
the screen
it looks very futuristic very much
different than the other Galaxy S
variants that are out there so let's
take off as much plastic as possible so
you can really get a sense for how this
device looks and feels let's take a look
at this keyboard spring-assisted
fantastic always nice to have very very
thin profile compared to some other
devices we're gonna compare this with in
a second see how this keyboard feels
medium click enos not terribly clicky
but it's got a lot of bounce to it so
the keys bounce back and really quick
very large size keyboard well balanced
and weighted but the front is just
what's really impressive it doesn't look
like a slide-out keyboard device if you
look at it from the side because it's so
thin in fact if we compare it to the
Droid 2 which has a smaller screen 3.7
inches the thickness difference is is
really apparent here and let's take a
look at the keyboards how they compare
and of course the Droid 2 doesn't have a
sprint assistant keyboard so it'll stop
in the center like that so let's take a
look at how these keyboards compare the
keyboard on the Epic 4G is definitely
bigger the keys are spaced apart more
but they're arranged in a grid like
fashion which may bother some people
that that are concerned with ergonomic
s' let's try to turn this on for the
first time as we continue to do
comparisons not sure if the battery is
and I think it is and here's the power
button on the side there it goes turning
on so let's compare this to some other
devices here is next to the good old
Google Nexus One which has a smaller
screen I can tell you the screen on the
Epic 4G is incredible on all the galaxy
s devices the Super AMOLED display is
just fantastic okay so here we are we'll
just do a little first time setup here
so it looks like to unlock we just slide
that up and we get the the usual galaxy
s interface so we can have up to seven
home screens but we can remove them if
we want super buttery smooth interface
with a hummingbird platform we've got
this interesting arrangement of icons
that we
can change to a variety of things we can
customize that and right now it's
updating the setting so that I can get a
a signal curious to see if I get 4 GU
right here typically there is 4G around
my apartment so we'll give that a couple
of minutes turn off the screen won't
allow the screen to shut off let's
compare it to the HTC Touch pro2 another
slide-out qwerty device and of course
the screen on the epic 4G is indeed
bigger one of the larger screen size is
four four inches let's compare the
keyboards so on the touch pro2 we get
keys that are offset and kind of
rectangular whereas on the epic 4g they
are square let's see if anything's
happening yet not yet it's still
thinking we'll come back in a second and
see if we're getting 4G okay now for G
wasn't enabled by default so I had to go
into the settings menu and turn it on
and now it's saying 4G net Network
disconnected another way you can access
the 4G setting is of course through this
pulldown window shade here so it looks
like I'm on 4G right now kind of a low
signal and now it's sort of bouncing
back and forth let's jump into the web
real quick and see if we can see some 4G
speeds here although it looks like this
is a low signal area to get the 4G
because it's obviously going in and out
so slide open the keyboard super smooth
slide out I'm curious to see how this
keyboard feels after using it for a
while first impressions us is that it
feels really fantastic has a really
great smoothness about it and I'm not
even connected to the internet here
maybe it's because I mistyped the
address
okay here we go this is over 3G but just
want to demonstrate the the speed over
3G and then we're gonna cut out and come
back in another video talking about the
software and the hardware and really all
the cool stuff that Sprint Epic 4G has
to offer now what's interesting is that
the Android buttons aren't really
visible over here you can't really see
are they gonna light up hmm that is up
there they are that's really odd
actually that you can't see the buttons
unless they're illuminated so when the
device is off and this is why the device
looks kind of cool from the front you
don't see the buttons you only see the
buttons when you turn on the device and
they become illuminated a pretty cool
effect to really give this device a
clean look from the front as you can
tell we're very excited about the Epic
4G this may be like we said the one of
the best Android devices of this year
definitely the best Android device on
sprint right now especially if you want
to slide-out keyboard although if you
don't want to slide out keyboard the evo
4G is also a really good option got a
lot more coming up on the Epic 4G please
subscribe to our channel if you like our
videos and give this video a thumbs up

that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
