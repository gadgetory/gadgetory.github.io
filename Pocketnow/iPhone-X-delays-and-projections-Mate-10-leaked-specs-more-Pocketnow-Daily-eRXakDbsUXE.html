already causing major manufacturing
delays Huawei made 10 lineup shows us
that we should at least expect two
devices to come and guess what phone
Bill Gates is using since Windows Phone
is dead I'm Jaime Rivera and I guess the
only positive thing about Tuesday's is
that Monday's is over
I know these are lame Monday jokes this
is out daily the official news
today start with Satya Nadella he just
published a book that I actually just
bought on Amazon it is definitely a good
story over how he turned around
Microsoft definitely a good read that I
can't wait to begin and the most
interesting part is that well he talked
about Nokia the whole acquisition the
fact that even though he wasn't in favor
of the acquisition the reasons why we're
not really because it was a bad deal it
was just the dealer was too late
Wow Microsoft actually didn't really
need to create a third ecosystem you can
learn more about it in the link of the
description and even though it's 15
books on the Kindle I think it should be
worth it to you
and speaking of Microsoft given the
death of Windows Phone if you ask
yourself what phone is Bill Gates using
in a recent interview he confirmed that
in addition to having a ton of PCs at
his home he switched to an Android fund
with a lot of Microsoft software
he doesn't really specify what phone it
is so hey in the comments chime in what
do you think he switched to what phone
do you think specifically interesting he
didn't move to an iPhone now let's start
about the huawei mate 10 and mate 10 Pro
we've got leaks from promotional
material revealing number one that there
are two phones number two even though
the design looks pretty much like what
we already saw we get some
specifications here in 970 processor
which we were expecting the most
interesting one is ip67 water and dust
resistance finally in addition to at
least one of the dual cameras that are
powered by or tuned by Leica to include
F 1.6 aperture pretty much like the LG v
30 I can not wait to see what this made
10 will look like and another
interesting leak that just emerged
there's a tweet that shows us high
quality renders of this mixed reality
headset made by Samsung and well it's
for Windows and we're
not exactly sure what Samsung is
planning to provide here all we know is
that this was leaked and it could just
be that the company wants to really push
all of its gear VR technology into a
different scope we can't wait to see
what we get and finally the very hot
Lucia's they have to do with the iPhone
10 for two things number one because
analysts are now predicting that the
iPhone 10 will outsell the iPhone eight
why because the iPhone 8 isn't as
selling as much as the companies
predicted apparently we're talking about
40 million units of the iPhone 8 versus
50 million units of the iPhone 10 or at
least up to that but we wonder exactly
how that's gonna happen because other
rumors claim that Apple is having
horrible issues building the 3d
technology for the facial-recognition up
to the point where the company might not
be able to go in full steam production
until 2018 so expect crazy delays I
don't know exactly how they plan to
achieve those 50 million units but it
leads me to the question today let us
know in the comments given the
similarities of the iPhone 8 and iPhone
10 and specifications it's really just
the difference in design do you really
believe that the iPhone 10 has enough to
outsell the iPhone 8 in my case I don't
know I would rather wait for the next
generation of the iPhones and whatever
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
