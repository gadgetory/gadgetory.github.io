least two years ahead of competitors
with face I Z Google pixel - and pixel
to excel have been fully leaked in this
time by a trusted source and the huawei
made ten pro emerges in leaks and has as
drooling I'm Jaime Rivera and if any of
you woke up to a Monday without the cold
fall chill let me know where I need to
travel this is PocketNow Haley the
official news today begin with old
technologies brought two new services
like for example facial recognition is
now making its way to Facebook for those
of you that have forgotten your password
now bear in mind this is optional you
can still use the 2-step verification
and whatever but yeah apparently in the
future you'll be able to unlock your
account with your face in case you
forgot your password problem is what
happens when you have an evil twin or
somebody's using a photo of you those
are a lot of questions that we're asking
ourselves right now and for those of you
that are wondering how the relationship
is between Apple and Samsung we assume
it's going great and all US are
predicting that Samsung is going to make
up to 14 billion dollars only from
making parts for Apple and for those of
you the thought that selling consumer
electronics with Samsung's biggest
business actually no the component
business is really what makes Samsung's
bottom line go up or down and this
proves that the company is willing to
partner so long as the money's there now
let's talk about Huawei we've got some
leaked images of the may 10 Pro from
famous tipster evan glass and the phone
looks gorgeous we've got some
interesting color options and more
confirmations over what to expect
apparently the possibility of a dual
lens and one of these lenses including F
1.6 apertures a possibility the second
will be the fact that apparently Huawei
wants to compete with Samms and when it
comes to Dex and you being able to use
your smartphone as a computer which
company will figure this business out is
yet to be seen as some of us haven't
really felt fond of Dex even though the
functionalities rather cool and speaking
of famous tipster Evan Blass we've got
some leaked images of the Google pixel 2
and pixel to excel the phones are
gorgeous
definitely I'm more inclined to the
pixel to excel because of the curves in
the display the curves and the borders
as well this pretty much confirms all
the leaks that we had seen
foreign videos and yeah you can ignore
whatever ultrapixel leaks would cover it
on Friday that was a hoax but then again
yes we wonder exactly which one of these
would you prefer so far from the leaks
were just two days away from the event
and finally the very hot news they have
to do with Apple analysts and face idea
according to KGI for example they
confirmed that the technology that's
coming to face ID is so revolutionary
that it's gonna take em Pater's up to
two and a half years to catch up to
Apple apparently everything that's being
brought here is just so different and so
new that we know that Apple pens a lot
of stuff so it's probably going to be
hard for competitors to catch up which
is rather interesting I mean a lot of
people are feeling that this whole
approach the facial recognition is
probably a little too harsh we should
have gotten the fingerprint scanner as
well you know there's just so much
debate over what the smartest way to go
about this market should be which
actually leads me to the question today
do you think that competitors are going
to follow Apple into face ID or they're
just going to stick to what works with
facial recognition to a certain degree
iris scanning and some competitors or
fingerprint scanners just the easiest
way to do things in my case I think that
the the fingerprint scanners not going
away anytime soon leave us a comment
