PocketNow and in this video I'm gonna
share a little bit of news with you guys
as of January 1st I will no longer be
involved from the day-to-day operations
of PocketNow and I'll no longer be
editor-in-chief now before I tell you
who's taking my place as editor-in-chief
and what that means for the future of
pocket now I wanted to share a little
bit about the past of pocket now to help
color in everything so pocket now was
established in the year 2000 by my
brother Jared minimun and his colleague
Derek Snyder now back in the year 2000
mobile devices were so incredibly
different than they are today they
didn't have color screens they didn't
have Wi-Fi they ran on single-core 166
megahertz processors with like 32
megabytes of RAM incredibly different
but there was a future promise with
these low-end devices but at the time
they were pretty revolutionary that one
day these devices would become so
powerful so thin and light that they
would transform society that one day we
would have a device that we would always
carry with us we'd put it in our pocket
and it would be as powerful if not more
powerful than the computers that we use
for work and of course we're living that
reality today but that was the thinking
behind pocket now it was a labor of love
it was never intended to be a business
or a company that could support multiple
full-time employees Derek and Jared did
it out of love a couple of years later
in 2002 I finally became involved I was
around 16 years old and I was getting
very jealous seeing my brother always
come home with the latest I pack or
giornata if you guys were following the
tech industry back then those names
sound familiar to you and he finally let
me come on as a news writer but he
wouldn't let me use my last name because
I think he was embarrassed that his
little bro was was writing for the
website that he was a part of so I went
by just Brandon news writer um so over
the next couple of years I got more and
more experienced in the industry and
around 2004-2005 after Jared had left
the site to pursue his studies
Derek also decided it was time to leave
to pursue his studies so he sold
PocketNow to a family friend of mine and
made me editor-in-chief and I was super
excited about that promotion because
finally I got to take control of this
thing and I had some ideas on where
could go and what we could do and around
that time we decided that we could no
longer cover only Windows Mobile devices
and then there was an evolution where we
decided to cover you know iPhone and
Android and tablets and now PocketNow is
expanding into wearables so there was an
evolution there and if we fast forward a
couple of years later to 2008 I was
finishing my studies I was running
pocket now all throughout my college
because college was kind of boring and
so it was great to have this outlet on
the side and in 2008 I decided that I
really didn't want to get a traditional
job getting a job having a boss just
wasn't something that I wanted to do and
if possible I wanted to do something
entrepreneurial so I decided I wanted to
try to buy to buy pocket now from its
current owner back then and I didn't
have the money to buy it so I went to
the bank I've got a loan right before
the financial crisis thankfully in 2009
so if I had waited a year I probably
wouldn't have gotten a loan at all and
because I had no collateral my dad had
to put his house on the line and I'm
very thankful for him for allowing me to
have that opportunity so in 2008 I
became the owner of pocket now and I
finally got to really do things with it
and over the subsequent years we hired
our first full-time employee which was
just a complete dream for me because to
take pocket now from where it where it
was to where we are today we needed to
have full-time employees people that
would spend 40 hours a week thinking
about and doing things for pocket now
and today we have five full-time
employees and I just feel so lucky that
we've been able to do that but over that
time period since 2008 the
entrepreneurial itch in me hasn't
stopped itching and I've become involved
with other things around 2010 I became
involved with xda-developers as one of
the main admins
over there this is a site that I've used
personally for for many many years to
tweak my my windows mobile device and
then tweak my Android devices so to be a
part of that is amazing and then
recently I became involved with a
start-up that's making an app called
femur and I did a video about this not
going to advertise it too much on here
it's a an app I'm very proud of it's a
free app for Android check it out it
changes your home screen on your device
and makes it look really beautiful and
there are about 150 themes to choose
from so over the years I've been
involved with other things besides
PocketNow and as a result you've
probably seen my video contributions go
down I write fewer reviews and really I
haven't been able to give PocketNow the
full attention that it deserves which is
why I'm extremely excited to announce
that one of the hardest-working humans
on the planet and one of my closest
friends and a guy you know very well
will become the new editor-in-chief in
just a short period of time January 1st
Anton de Nagy I cannot pronounce his
last name Michael Fisher can do it
really well I need lessons I guess but
Anton or Tony as we call him around here
again is one of the hardest-working
people I know and he has an amazing
vision on where he wants to take
PocketNow because we want to grow we
want to grow and get bigger and better
we want to hire more people we want to
be an even better website and video
channel for you guys so that's the story
of pocket now that's where it has been
and where it's going I'm not going to
disappear completely I'm going to be
working with Tony over the the coming
months to make sure that he's
comfortable and and help him in any way
I can
I'll also be contributing to pocket now
because my obsession for for phones and
tablets isn't going anywhere so you'll
see me write some reviews and do some
videos I might be on the podcast here
and there so I'm not going to disappear
from the earth here and of course if you
want to follow me and see what I'm up to
i'm on twitter at brandon minimun and
and that's and that's pretty much it so
kind of a bittersweet video to do but
but things are changing but I think
things are change
for the better and I hope you stick
around and I want to thank you guys
again I know we always do this and it's
becoming cliche but if it wasn't for you
guys if you didn't watch our videos if
you didn't go to our website and read
our articles we we literally couldn't do
this we just would not exist so thank
you for your support and I also want to
thank the whole PocketNow team for
giving me so many opportunities and and
really allowing me to live a dream here
and I guess there's nothing left to say
so happy New Year to everyone and I'll
see you around don't worry
again I'm not disappearing and that's it
for now
that means thumbs up if you like this
video I always do that the wrong time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
