couple of hours Microsoft Surface RT
tablets begin shipping and if you had
any doubts LG just confirm that they own
the Nexus 4 i'm hi meri behna wondering
if this iPad Mini would be like many me
and this is parking out daily
you know the only thing better than to
have an apple event today is what
competitions willing to do to strive
your mind away from it customers are
already confirming that Microsoft is
sent them a letter confirming that their
surface RT tablet has shipped now we
still haven't received our letter
confirming that our surface review unit
is on its way but trust me we're waiting
for that like there's no tomorrow now
speaking of microsoft and windows 8
there's already confirmation that i'll
release they both skype and Hulu Plus
will be among the applications that will
be available on the Windows Store this
just shows how Microsoft is taking apps
a lot more seriously than when they
launch Windows Phone 7 in the past now
get this if you didn't pre-order your
surface tablet and you're among the
first 100 people on any microsoft store
waiting there to buy a surface tablet
well you'll get a free Xbox music pass
so if I were you I'd definitely be there
now if you have any doubts about LG
building the future Nexus phone well an
LG executive from India dis confirm that
it will happen it'll be based on the
optimus G i'll be running android 4.2
out of the box though we still don't
know what that will be called now let me
surprise you a little bit right now you
remember that I didn't like the optimus
G and neither did I like the fact that
LG was building the future Nexus device
even if it was based on this but after
watching Michaels video review on the
optimus G that happened just a couple of
hours ago I'll be honest with you I
actually changed my mind the device
looks really cool and it performed
really well in the reviews so make sure
you watch Michaels fully of the Optimus
G M you'll probably change your mind
along with me probably the Nexus 4 will
be a really cool device now for all 11
of you that ever used google wallet as a
payment service you're probably in for a
treat because google has just updated
the sign up page and apparently it's in
for a big dramatic overhaul it's
currently invite-only we still don't
know what the changes are but they're
asking if you're using an android phone
and iphone or any other phone so it's
probably going cross-platform or
something let's see what happens and
finally for the most expected news of
the day apple's ipad mini event this to
happen at 11 a.m. pacific time which is
1 p.m. eastern and we already brought
our top 5 predictions on what we expect
to happen on the event it will be
covering everything as it happens now
there are a ton of ipad mini leaks and
that leads me to the question of the day
what's so many leaks what leaks do you
believe in what leagues
don't you believe in because well I said
that the iphone 5 leaks were faking I
was wrong so legals are coming down
below now if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm high never be better
