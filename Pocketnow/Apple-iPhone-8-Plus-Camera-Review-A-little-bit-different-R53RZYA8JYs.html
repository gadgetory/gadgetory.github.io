Apple cameras are touted as being the
most intuitive the primary reason for
this praise consistency both the layout
of the app and the output from the
camera even Android users have a pretty
good idea of what to expect when
handling an iPhone camera the iPhone 8
announcement came with the requisite
claims of improvement over the previous
generation again we're told this phone
has new sensors and deeper pixels will
those marketing terms deliver tangible
improvements for photo and video output
the best way to test is to compare our
iPhone 8 plus against the iPhone 7 plus
of this camera comparison brought to you
by deep brand looking at overall photo
performance the main changes come down
to post processing where the iPhone 8
plus seems to be cranking a bit more
saturation and vibrance Apple has a
history of staying conservative with
white balance sometimes producing shots
that veer a touch to blue there is a
general warmth or glow to iPhone 8
images which is pleasant that would
touch less accurate even for the warm
California afternoon light in most of
our tests we did notice faster and more
accurate autofocus especially on the
zoom sensor where the iPhone 7 could not
lock onto this flower until we backed up
the iPhone 8 radically closed the
minimum focusing distance and had no
issues with the busy background and for
claims of a better portrait mode
practical output remains about the same
in our tests video output is remarkably
similar again in some shots we might see
a slight vibrance bump or white balance
shift but in most of our daylight tests
we'd swear we were seeing footage from
the same phone and we can easily
demonstrate that the sensor size has not
changed on the main camera at minimum
focusing distance bouquet from both
phones is exactly the same zoom
performance is also similar though the
iPhone 7 seems to preserve just a touch
more detail at the far end of the
software crop may be a byproduct of more
aggressive compression which we'll talk
about later in this video if there are
improvements to be seen we'd most likely
see them in low-light conditions the
iPhone 8 is noticeably bumping up the
bright
nassim post and again saturation is
layered on heavier the newer phone
doesn't seem to be preserving details
any better more just using a different
color profile when producing a JPEG this
is most apparent in a controlled indoor
test it should be reiterated that Apple
has a terrific lens on this phone it's
not the sharpest glass we've seen this
year but it's wonderfully resistant to
obnoxious lens flares there are
improvements to be found moving from the
iPhone 7 to the 8th but mostly we're
looking at quality of life and software
differences iOS 11 brings HEV C video
compression drastically cutting file
sizes on 4k video the iPhone 7 will
benefit from this as well but the more
powerful chipset in the iPhone 8 means
we get a new 60 frame per second 4k mode
this review was rendered at 30 frames
per second but we can show you what this
looks like as a half speed slow-motion
video
speaking of slow-motion both phones can
shoot 240 frames per second but the
iPhone 7 is capped at 720p the iPhone 8
moves us up to a 1080p image Apple again
takes the lead for best slow motion on a
phone the new fun feature for editing is
portrait lighting in addition to
software background blur users can that
with just lighting based on depth and
contour information it's a handy way to
tweak a photo often producing a better
final image than just applying a filter
or boosting brightness so let's wrap
this up where's that leave us with the
cameras on the iPhone 8 plus Apple is
trying to shake things up a bit this
year but it's difficult to see any
significant differences which can be
attributed to hardware we're expecting
to see bigger differences on the iPhone
10 the Galaxy Note 8 leapfrog 2 the
iPhone 7 and with the exception of a few
settings like 4k at 60 frames per second
and 1080p at 240 we think Samsung's
Hardware stabilized zoom is currently
the better offering apples most apparent
change is a move towards more
crowd-pleasing juicier post-processing
which is actually a step removed from
the familiarity of iPhones past
remember that consistency what makes a
camera more intuitive being familiar
with the interface which hasn't changed
and being able to predict the outcome of
your shot which now has changed an
informal poll on the pocket now Twitter
account pitting the iPhone seven and
eight against each other on a night
street scene the iPhone 7 won by a
significant margin that's how familiar
we are with iPhone output the iPhone
eight still represents one of the better
cameras we've reviewed this year
incredible horsepower and we're really
excited to see Apple move the industry
into using better video compression but
if you're on an iPhone 7 you're not
missing much and while you're out
holding your phone over freeways and
rolling around in the dirt to get that
perfect shot it can be terrifying trying
to hold on to such a slippery gadget
