getting closer according to hackers Dell
and yes I didn't get that wrong Dell
just announced for new tablets and
Microsoft continues its dilemma over
which is their new CEO I'm hi Mary vera
and seriously if Microsoft is having
such trouble finding a new leader we
could all just send our resumes guys
this is out daily so let's start
today off with some unexpected but
actually cool news do you all remember
company called dell you know they used
to be the biggest pc maker years ago
they even made some really cool pocket
pcs in some awesome smartphones well
even though they've been kind of hidden
from the mobile space they actually
launched four different tablets today by
the name of venue tablets and don't get
confused the Dell Venue 8 Pro and Dell
Venue 11pro are actually the windows 8.1
tablets and then the venue 8 and venue 7
tablets are their Android tablets and
these tablets actually have some very
capable specification links down below
for full details on this tablets and we
actually already have hands-on videos on
everything you can expect from these
these are actually some very interesting
products it's great to see dell back in
the game let's just see if these things
sell now another company that's making
some interesting headlines as LG as
they've now confirmed they'll bring a
smartphone with a flexible display just
like Samsung and even with the rumors
that we have from Apple yesterday that
the iWatch will bring a flexible display
we did hear that LG and Samsung had
ordered flexible displays and as it
turns out just like Samsung is going to
bring a new higher-end lineup of
smartphones well LG has got the z line
up and there's a line up will bring
flexible displays along with other
better flagship specifications so links
down below for details on that and let's
see which one comes first time in a
penalty these two companies are going to
bring something by the end of this year
aside from what they already have now an
interesting twist in the news is there
does seem to be some drama in redmond
over the next CEO of Microsoft then Alan
Mulally fort CEO seems to be a strong
candidate a lot of people have been
talking about it for the past couple of
days up to the point where it's taking
the internet by storm nobody wants a
carmaker CEO to be the CEO of a software
company
and as it turns out it's been so bad
that Mulally has come on record to state
that he's not interested but things even
seem to be more dramatic as three
shareholders and board members are now
stating that they don't even want bill
gates to remain on the board they want
these two guys out of the company so
let's see how that turns out let's see
if this is actually something good for
Microsoft now in some additional
executive drama what if Qualcomm's
high-level executives has now stated
that apples a7 64-bit chip is worthless
it's only a marketing stunt and
according to his arguments which are
kind of right the only thing you can
actually do is install more ram on the
phone which you currently can't and also
install some more complex server based
applications that you're not going to do
most likely or well let's see what Apple
has planned for this obviously what's
even more ironic is that after he stated
all this he said that Qualcomm's next
move is to bring 64-bit chips to
smartphones which makes you wonder I
mean why doesn't the guy make up his
mind if he doesn't like the thing why
did he criticized it and let's say that
they're gonna actually do it as well and
finally for the hot news of the day
those of you interested in jailbreaking
iOS 7 will get some good news very soon
probably we all know of Asian
revolutionized jailbreaking on iOS 6 n
as it turns out Avengers which is the
hacker behind evasion has now confirmed
that he's already got all the pieces to
the puzzle to be able to do it on iOS 7
and obviously now he's just gotta test
it on a phone and obviously make this
user-friendly for everybody else but you
know this leads me to the question of
the day but things like touch ID on the
iPhone 5s are you really interested in
jailbreaking your iphone in my
particular case honestly since the touch
ID information is stored on the chip and
it could be accessible to anybody after
jailbreaking your phone I would think
about it twice with the iphone 5s or
pretty much any phone you know routing
any Android phone with a fingerprint
scanner in the future since this
apparently will be a thing in the future
but leave us a comment down below if
your phone has a fingerprint scanner
would you be interested in hacking it
friends as always for an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and I promise you follow us
