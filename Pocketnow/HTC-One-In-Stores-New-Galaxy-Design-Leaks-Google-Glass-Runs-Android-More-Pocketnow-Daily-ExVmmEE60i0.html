nationwide more leaks of an unusual
Samsung Galaxy smartphone emerged and if
you didn't know it well google glass
runs Android I'm hi meri behna and
repeat after me thank God it's Friday
this is pocket now daily this is a great
day for a ton of you the HTC One is now
available in stores nationwide you can
pick it up on AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint Harding
today and you can also pre-order on
tmobile as well this is probably one of
the greatest smartphones we've ever
reviewed I'm not just talking about this
year I'm talking about one of the
greatest phones we've ever reviewed
period the phone is that great and if
you're still on the roads trying to
think of you should buy this phone or
not you know what you shouldn't even be
watching this video you know just go
down to the store buy your phone come
back and then film an unboxing for us
and leave us a video response the HTC
One is really worth it now we obviously
know that composition is complicated the
samsung galaxy s4 should be available in
stores of the next coming weeks as well
and it is a good phone too and the link
so that we found yesterday of that
squared edge galaxy smartphone continue
today we've also found some more photos
of this device and it looks like if the
galaxy s4 in the Sony Xperia Z had a
baby it looks like a big combination of
both phones and sometimes looks like if
it was photoshop so stay tuned for the
rumors this could probably be the next
design it could probably be a prototype
or it could probably be a good hoax now
let's talk about Microsoft we do know
that the company is already working on
their 7-inch microsoft surface but their
CFO just came on record right now to
state that the company is also working
with other OEMs with two different
projects what is to make Windows 8
tablets cheaper and another is to make
Windows 8 tablet smaller which is an
interesting project to come you just
wonder what the company is going to do
about Windows RT in that process because
if Windows RT is going to be run on
these 7-inch tablets they won't sell now
let's talk about Google we've got recent
reports that the company is working on a
new gaming platform we've got
leaderboards and other images that show
that the company is working with
something akin to a gaming platform the
biggest question now is if this will be
something that will compete with xbox
meaning we will get a console or will be
getting something like Game Center on
iOS it begs to wonder what the company
is doing but then when you've got google
doing
fiber and Google cable what's next I
mean they should even be renting cars
expect anything from this company and
finally for the hot news of the day a
lot of us have asked ourselves the same
question does google glass run android
app Larry Page just confirmed that no of
course it runs Android the guy was like
well what else would it be running it's
interesting just think about the future
of Google glass couldn't be that well
third-party developers could probably
build things that Google glass wouldn't
run in the future it's kind of hard to
know at this point but that leads you to
the question of the day would you buy
Google glass is it something that you
would like to have I'll be honest with
you Google glass if it were cheaper it'd
be something that I would love to buy
but then again I just wonder if it's
gonna be like Bluetooth headsets you
know those cool things that you once
bought and then they all ended up in the
glove compartment because once you
notice how ridiculous you look using
them you just stop using them all
together so leave us a comment down
below if Google glass were cheaper will
you buy it of course like i said i would
but i'm not sure if i'll actually use it
more than a couple of weeks and of
course for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's how i roll machine
