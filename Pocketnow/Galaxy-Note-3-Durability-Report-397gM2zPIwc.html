using plastic to make it look like metal
is that it's not and it won't look like
metal eventually but anyways I'm hanging
that out of this is PocketNow and it's
time for a galaxy note 3 durability
report first off a couple of disclaimers
I have been using this Galaxy Note 3 for
over a month then the reason why is
because I am the second person to use it
it first went to Taylor Devon for his
full review which he did a fantastic job
on he used it for two weeks and then he
sent it to me so yeah it's been over a
month and I have been using it non-stop
it's probably one of the favorite
devices that I currently have just like
with every device I all night baby this
phone a lot meaning that even though I
don't like cases I don't like putting
plastic on top of my phones I do love
sleeves and I use them to put them in my
pocket I do recommend the sleeve from
Amazon it will cost you like fifteen
bucks but it's actually for the note to
fits fine on the note 3 and it does give
you a very elegant feel it is actually
made of leather and you could just again
put it in your pocket and then just take
it out set it on the table like this and
you won't have any pause with the phone
I will admit this is probably the first
Samsung device that I have actually
liked when it comes to build quality and
don't get me wrong it is the same
plastic as the Galaxy Note 2 but the
difference is that you don't have any
hyper glaze it doesn't scratch in the
back easily as with the Galaxy Note 2
and in the case of the Galaxy Note 2 I
had a lot of problems with scratches on
the display which I haven't had on the
Galaxy Note 3 except for the fact that
because of the way they designed this
phone even though again it's made out of
the same plastic it is actually more
durable and it actually feels better in
the hand than the Galaxy Note 2 after a
course of a month using this phone as my
daily driver I'll tell you that my
experience has been mixed but not really
when it comes to using the phone as it
is because first of all the snaps are
getting hundred on this phone it's just
amazing the battery life is perfect and
then aside from that using the phone is
actually snappy even though you get
TouchWiz at all the phone actually
doesn't bog down after everything that
I've loaded on it which is actually a
good thing probably my only complaint
will be the IR blaster which is not as
strong as the one that I had on the
galaxy s4 but that's really something
negligence the only problem that I've
had with this phone has been with us
settings and this is really interesting
because even though I've only used this
phone for over a month think about it
you're gonna be using this phone for two
years with a contract so bear with me
here Taylor only used this phone for two
weeks and when the phone arrived to me
it already brought scratches on the
speaker grille and scratches on the home
button which is something new I had
never seen on Galaxy devices before and
other than that think about it I mean I
used to use it on a belt holster and the
reason why I stopped using it was
because the metallic tips of jeans would
actually scratch the faux metal band the
rounded which is not really metal and
you could see these scratches so deeply
in that you would really not want to
scratch your phone this way so again my
advice to you is use it with a sleeve in
your pocket do not use belt holsters
with this device because obviously these
are crazy big you'll look ridiculous
first of all and second of all you can
scratch the metallic or should I say
Chrome bends very easily and there's
just no way you're not gonna notice
these when you use the phone now wait
not everything is bad because first of
all this fake leather at the back is
actually one of the smartest things that
I've seen on a phone yet I would have
never thought I'd see this from an OEM
but first of all doesn't matter what
black phone you buy you're gonna have
problems with fingerprints except with
the Galaxy Note 3 and I don't know why
it is but this fake leather actually
does a great job in deterring
fingerprints I'm very smudgy hands and I
do not have any problems with this
galaxy note 3 whatsoever so you can buy
the white model or the black model but I
do recommend you buy the black bottle
because the leather of the fickler that
is actually feels more like leather on
the black phone than on the white one so
again the good thing about the back
plate is that even though again it is
not real leather it'll do a far better
job than any other previous galaxy
device that you've seen with hyper glaze
trust me on that it doesn't get
scratched and it actually looks very
elegant so overall my experience with
the galaxy note 3 has been actually more
positive than negative again the
software is performing great even though
I hate TouchWiz and then in the case of
hardware if you take care of the phone
you shouldn't have any problems with it
again my advice to you get a good sleep
so use in the pockets don't just carry
it in your pocket like that because
again plastic is not really as strong as
any other material
glasses and as strong as well now a lot
of people complain about plastic in
built quality but I will tell you that
plastic is a lot more resilient to Falls
than aluminum so you know it depends on
your opinion but so far I'll say that I
do like this phone I do like the way it
is but anyways leaders are comment down
below on your experiences with the
Galaxy Note 3 we won't be having another
after the buzz video with this phone
eventually to sell you even more about
our experience three months down the
road so make sure you leave us a comment
down below with your questions on what
you would want us to cover during that
after the buzz as well that's it for a
durability report thank you very much
for watching make sure you share your
experiences with the phone in the
comments down below or whatever other
phone you would like us to do a
durability report on it also follow us
on social media and subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well you can follow
me on twitter i underscore to be better
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I am Hein that of
it I thank you very much for watching we
