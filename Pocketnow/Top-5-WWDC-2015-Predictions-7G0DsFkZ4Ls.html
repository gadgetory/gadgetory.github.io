apple's WWDC 2015 event is a just around
the corner on Monday and we've got a ton
of predictions of what to expect so I'm
hi Mary that I'm this is pocket now and
these are the top five things we expect
to see at WWDC 2015 number five is
improvements to Apple maps if that's
even possible this has been apples
biggest flop in history and even though
the company has become extremely
infamous when it comes to this we've
seen apple bands all around we have seen
the company working on hiring a
javascript experts in order to make this
a web service so the reports claim that
this might turn into a cross-platform
thing and that could give Apple some
leverage but it won't make it be Google
so it has to come up with something
cooler we'll see about that number four
is Apple music the company has been beta
testing this service for the longest
time when it comes to the iOS
application but we want to see what
Cupertino wants to do with all those
billions of dollars that it spends on
beats music it seems that they are
planning to take over Spotify and
YouTube with a streaming service that's
better the problem is they don't want to
make that free so we don't understand
how exactly that is going to happen but
the event will tell number three is a
new or Apple watch operating system this
is probably the favorite wearable of the
public when it comes to sales so far but
it's not necessarily the best one when
it comes to its software there are still
a ton of works that should be fixed and
we do expect that this being the
software event for us to see better
improvements on how the Apple watch
should perform number two don't have to
say it iOS 9 and a new version of OS 10
we are expecting for this to happen and
we expect both of these two talk to each
other even better particularly with the
launch of that new MacBook and the fact
that it doesn't require a regular
chipset for it to work it's more of a
mobile thing so yeah Apple is trying to
converge things closely but it's not
trying to get both operating systems to
be just one it's doing things separately
and we expect really cool things for iOS
9 like for example this new proactive
feature that is supposedly going to be
sort of like Google now all
the apple way in addition to the fact
that Apple is planning to iron a ton of
bugs with this operating system
something that is very much needed and
finally the top number one prediction
that we have to this event is a not one
more thing but we do expect something
hardware related Apple is not famous for
launching hardware WWDC it has done so
in the past but we are expecting
something I've had related particularly
we've seen rumors of an iPad plus we've
seen rumors of an iPad pro we are
expecting for Apple to do something
about its tablet lined up as it goes on
the Klein it's been on a downfall for
the past year so this would be the
perfect show floor for Apple to show it
off and get the delivers to build apps
for it for it to be launched hey in the
fall or something like that we're
expecting for Apple to do something when
it comes to hardware it is in desperate
need of revamping the tablet market and
it does leave me to the question of this
top five what are your predictions for
this event what do you think apple will
unveil there is a lot to come and we
will be covering everything live that's
