devices have some really cool widgets
one that's getting a lot of attention is
called the circles widget it looks
really nice it's a clock as your weather
forecast your current weather does
everything that you want a nice good
clock widget to do but I don't have a
Motorola phone so how can I get it on my
devices I'm Joe Levi this is PocketNow
let's go find out how to do that so
first off this video was going to be all
about how to find and install the ripped
or the ported version of the Motorola
clock circle widget thing onto your
device was somewhat simple you
downloaded one zip file inside that were
three apks you installed each one of
them change your launcher over to the
Motorola launcher and then once you did
that you could install those widgets
just like any other widgets and it was
great they even had that cool circle
flippy thing where you'd roll the widget
to change from you know today's forecast
to tomorrow's forecast and all that
other cool stuff that the Motorola
widget does unfortunately in prepping
for this video every single source that
I found had been sent a DMCA takedown
notice by Motorola and you can no longer
find those files at least I couldn't and
if I can't you're gonna have a hard time
doing it so let's see if we can do this
a little bit more honestly we'll lose
some functionality but we'll still get
essentially the same look and feel as
the Motorola widget this is my Nexus 7
very obviously not a Motorola device so
I want to go ahead and put the clock
widget the Rings whatever you want to
call that right here the circle widget
on my screen so the first thing we're
gonna do is we're going to open our app
drawer head out to the Play Store and
we're gonna search for one more clock
widget now there are two results both of
them are by is afrin software one of
them is free one of them cost a buck
we're gonna show you everything today
with the free version just in case you
know you want to try it out the paid
version
essentially gives you just more clock
sizes so let's go ahead and try this now
with the free here you can see all fun
stuff we go ahead and install it which
I've already done once that's done it's
just like any other widget so we'll go
back here to our app drawer and over to
widgets and now we need to scroll over
to one more clock widget which is OMC
and I tapped on that sort of drag it
this free version only has a 4x2
but you can get whatever else you want
so first thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna tap that we're gonna skip past and
then we're going to come into themes you
already noticed I've got the clock
widget theme installed it doesn't come
that way so hit widget theme you're
going to want to download all clocks
which I've done it's about 7 Meg it
takes a little bit of time a couple
minutes but that's it once you've done
that you've got a whole bunch of these
cool things that you can choose from one
of them is called chrome rings go ahead
and select that you can personalize your
clock if you would like something's over
here and lots of stuff you can do drag
move tweak colors maybe not colors lots
of stuff we're not gonna play around
with that too much will abandon those
changes skip our useful tip again now
one thing I do want to point out is over
here in our weather and widget options
you can see I can refresh my weather it
does have what real-time weather weather
provider used to be Google but Google
turned off their unpublished weather API
so now this widget is chosen that yrn oh
it's been fairly decent even though
they're nowhere near where I live the
source but they've got weather for the
rest of the world so that's kind of cool
I've got it set to update my clock every
30 seconds that's the default and to
refresh my weather every hour I'd
recommend that you do that or a little
bit beyond that 4 or 8 hours just to
conserve battery life of course if your
weather changes often you may want to do
that more frequently
once that's done simply back out of it
and rotate this again that way there you
go you've got your sir
clock now what does this not have that
the Motorola version has well if you
want to flip this you see that that
didn't work it opened it up I can't flip
around and switch over the rings to get
more information to get more days
forecast it just doesn't work that's
because this isn't the Motorola widget
that's the one that they DMCA to have
everybody take down the sources so
unless you can find those files you
can't do it again but if you can find
those files it's three apks you install
them you set up the motorola launcher
essentially as your launcher so it
replaces whatever you have that may or
may not be okay with you but if you want
it to work you got to do it so once
you've got the motorola launcher set up
as your launcher then you just go ahead
and add that widget and you're done it
works just like it would on a Motorola
device of course because it's not a
Motorola device you may run into some
quirks some weird stuff who knows but
you can always fall back to get the look
of the Motorola circle widget or the
rings widget without having to tread any
legal boundaries there with Motorola so
what did you think is that an acceptable
alternative to the Motorola rings widget
are you gonna go ahead and track down
the contraband apk file so you can get
the real one and get the cool flippy
stuff or are you happy with some other
clock widget that has weather built in
any of those answers we want to know go
to this link right here down at the
bottom if you're watching this video on
youtube we've got the link over to
pocket now leave your comments your
questions answer those brief questions
for us over at pocketnow.com we'd love
to know what you're planning to do with
the rings widget or maybe you just think
yeah it's just one more clock widget but
still we want to know if you liked the
video make sure you give it a big thumbs
up if you have not yet subscribed to our
video channel if you can do so at the
end we'll have a nice button for you to
do that for pocket now showing off
really cool widgets I'm Joe Levi thanks
