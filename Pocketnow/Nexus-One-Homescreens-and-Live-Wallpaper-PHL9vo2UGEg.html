pocketnow.com
and this is a look at the home screens
on the Google Nexus One we're going to
talk about the live wallpapers the
widgets and the various home screens
that you can have on this device so
let's start off by turning it on and of
course this unlock pattern is optional
you don't have to see that every time
you turn on your device and as with
other Android devices you have multiple
panels that you can sort of customize
with widgets there are five of them so
there are two to the left and back to
the center there are two to the right
now a way that you know where you are is
by looking at these dots down here so I
see there are two dots on the left that
means there are two panels or two
screens to the left and now there are
four to the right so it's a nice way to
sort of visualize where you are although
there's still no way to sort of jump to
the one all the way on the right or all
the way on the left you still have to
manually scroll which is kind of
annoying so let's talk about these live
wallpapers I don't know if you can tell
but the background is actually shifting
around a little bit
tapping does nothing but on some live
wallpapers tapping actually allows you
to interact with the wallpaper which is
quite fascinating so we can tap and hold
and we can go to wallpapers and then
click on live wallpapers and we'll go
through most of these galaxies pretty
cool it actually looks like a universe
of stars that swirls in into a circle so
I just click set and as you pan around
from screen to screen the aspect of the
background kind of changes a little bit
so that's pretty neat let's go to
another one grass is really cool because
it actually customizes itself based on
the time of day so as you can see here
at night you'll get a starry background
in the morning you'll get a sunrise look
during the day like you see here you'll
see a blue sky and during the night
you'll see a sunset or during the
evening time so it's really cool and the
grass moves just slightly as if it's
blowing in the breeze and as you slide
to the right and to the left the sort of
blades of grass slide with the screen
movement so very interesting and and
nice and subtle what live wallpaper
magic smoke is what you saw a moment ago
and you can actually change the look of
the magic smoke by tapping here so we
can get kind of a monochrome we can get
this wicked red
sort of the psychedelic blue and green
and so on and so forth they're about
five you that you can choose from and of
course if we click okay and set
wallpaper you get the idea you get the
wacky moving background let's go to the
check out the other ones okay there's
one called many says all music
visualizations together slowly revolving
a 3d just a way to sort of have the
background interact with music that
you're playing on your device so
obviously it doesn't do too much right
now because I'm not playing music but it
would if you did play music so let's go
back and there are several that interact
with music let's go to Nexus this is
sort of the the background that we saw
on the leaks of the Nexus One which is
actually one of my favorites it's it's
not too distracting although it seems
like it is right but as you can see you
can still see all the icons on the
screen what's really neat is you can
interact with it so you can tap on it
and if you go really quickly you get
many different colors it's kind of just
fun when you're bored just tap along on
the screen anyway let's go to the next
one we have something called polar clock
which doesn't always work let's see if
it'll work this time and see this
happens it says the application Android
live wallpapers has stopped working so
that's kind of annoying so let's go back
to the other ones we've spectrum and vu
meter which also work with the music
also waveform works with music this one
is really cool it's called well I don't
know what it's called what was it called
it was called water so we can set the
wallpaper this is another one you can
interact with so you get this kind of
water with the leaf so they're the
colored Leafs and you can tap on the
screen to have the water move sort of
like koi pond on the iPod Touch or the
iPhone so very cool as you swipe across
you get to see it more leaves and a
bigger view very fun background now
these live wallpapers do indeed use a
battery life in fact there's a screen
you can go to and we'll talk about that
in a future video
that lets you see the breakdown of how
the device is using battery life and
you'll see that about 5% of the usage
comes from these live wallpapers so if
you're really concerned about battery
life you definitely want to use a
standard wallpaper and down here we can
click wallpapers and see sort of the
default wallpapers or the ones that come
on the device that aren't animated there
are some very nice ones some blades of
grass it looks
cave many different choices here let's
go with just a plain one we'll go with
the grass just cuz it works very well
and there you go
blades of grass so let's talk about some
of the widgets that you can add I'd say
that the widgets that you can add aren't
as a robust as you'd find on the HTC
Hero for example there's a lot of
Android devices and each of them pretty
much have different widgets that you can
use in the selection on the Nexus One
isn't terribly impressive you'll see
what I mean
in a second so we can tap and hold we
can either add shortcuts widgets or
folders let's start with shortcuts
because this is quite useful we can add
a variety of shortcuts we can add an
application which is quite simply a link
to a program we can add a bookmark which
is very nice because you can see right
into the web browser someone at
pocketnow.com as a bookmark and here it
is I can move it around of course by
tapping and holding or that same token I
can drag it to the trashcan let's go
back into shortcuts you can also add a
contact so you can quickly dial somebody
that you call on a regular basis you can
have a screen filled up with pictures of
people that you call sort of like SBB
mobile shell in Windows Mobile I'll give
you an example I'll click contact and
add one
ok so I'll add Adam Lane here and
there's a little picture of Adam Lane
there's also an indicator on there that
will show me if I've got some kind of
communication with him so I'll drop that
in the trashcan
let's go back to shortcuts we can also
do a direct dial so one touch dial to
someone I whereas before with Adam Lane
if I tapped on his name I'd be taken to
his contact information also a direct
message this is kind of cool you can
have a direct link to direction so if
you travel to say Philadelphia on a
regular basis and you want a way to
quickly launch directions to get to
Philadelphia and of course Android 2.0
2.1 has built-in navigation you can do
that and shortcut name let's call it
Philly ok she's a little icon let's see
here if that one looks good a little
soccer ball and you click Save and once
you press on Philly it will start the
Google Maps Navigation I've got the GPS
disabled right now so that won't work so
let me drop that into the trashcan let's
go back into shortcuts and see what else
we almost got to the end of the list we
also have a link to email Gmail labels
and music playlist you can toggle Google
Voice which is quite nice and also add a
shortcut to settings so let's go back
and talk about the widgets that you can
add to the Nexus One we can add an
analogue clock but you really can't
change what it looks like this is what
it looks like and that's all the choices
that you get you can't do anything to
change the design so let's throw that
away go back you can also add a calendar
but again you can't customize the look
of the calendar you can only see next
appointment not you know two
appointments or three appointments
obviously tapping on the calendar will
take you right into the calendar
application so it's convenient to have
that perhaps on one of these extra
screens we can also do a link into
Facebook which is quite nice and you can
sort of tap to the right and tap to the
left to see what people are saying or
you can tap on the Facebook icon to get
directly into the Facebook app on the
device and it's a very good Facebook app
works quite well and again I'm going to
throw this away so we have more room on
the screen we can also add music so we
can play music from the SD card
something here news and weather which is
great we can choose to have either
weather news or news and weather and
let's just do news and weather so we
have everything in one and by default
the device actually comes with this
enabled and it's quite nice it shows you
the latest news on the right and on the
Left you get a little temperature gauge
and it knows where you are using the GPS
and you can tap on any of these icons
down here or on the temperature itself
and you're taken into kind of an
extended view of the day and you can
drag your finger along and say okay at
you know 6 o'clock a.m. what will the
temperature be what will be the chance
of precipitation and what will the winds
be so a pretty nice feature to be able
to really see what the weather
conditions are going to be like on a
certain time of day we can swipe to the
right while we're in this application to
go to top stories and we can read a
particular story by tapping on it and
we're taken sort of into the web browser
but it's it's not the web browser it's
really just a viewer that works in
landscape pretty well so we can tap
around and see the news story there and
then click the back button
to go back into the application and
they're organized by top stories us
sports entertainment and I think that's
it so really neat pretty much so really
neat news and weather application built
into the nexus one that I think a lot of
people will appreciate so I'm gonna
throw that away and let's continue down
the list of widgets we also picture
frame which is kind of cool so we can it
says pick an item from your collection
and I haven't yet fully discovered this
kind of navigation here it's kind of
strange sometimes it works sometimes it
doesn't
it's taking pictures of furniture the
other day so here I have a picture of a
couch you can move this around or you
can sort of reposition it and pretend
this is a picture of a friend or a
family member or something and you want
to put a picture on your main screen and
there you have a little picture frame a
nice little touch to have on one of your
auxiliary screens certainly this isn't a
new feature to Android but it's always
nice to have going down the list we also
power control which is what you see
right here so really OneTouch access to
enable your GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi syncing
and screen brightness and what's pretty
cool about this is if you tap Bluetooth
you get a little dim notification and
then it will turn dark once it turns all
the way on and there it goes now so this
are really handy application to our
widget to have on your home screen let's
go down we have search which we're going
to talk about in a second it has a
really good voice search built in the
device we also have tweet droid and twee
droid large I don't know if I'm saying
that right this is pretty much the best
application I've found for Android and
it says we need to have more space on
the home screen to add that and I'll
show you that but you're gonna see it's
not gonna be functional because you need
the pro version but really cool you can
have a whole panel devoted to Twitter so
you don't have to actually drill into
the application so we'll throw that away
and let's finish down the list and down
here we have YouTube which is pretty
cool so you can actually quickly upload
a video you can press the record button
film the video and the Nexus One will
remember your user name and password so
you can instantly upload the videos or
you can search the library of YouTube
tapping on the whole button
we bring open the the Android YouTube
application which is quite nice let's
talk about this this search so to the
right of the search there's a little
microphone so if I talk to it it will
search for what I say so let me try this
oops HTC hd2 review
perfect has really fantastic voice
recognition that works almost all the
time so that's a really nice feature to
have in case you don't want to type or
you're walking down the street you
quickly want to find you know the
Starbucks in Philadelphia that you're
trying to trying to give them a call or
something like that so let's slide that
down and see what else we have we've
gone through all of the widgets finally
you can add folders to your main screen
you can add contacts what's really cool
down here is Facebook phonebook so you
can actually have this drill into your
entire Facebook album and query the
phone numbers of people so that you can
quickly call anyone that's in your
facebook list that may not have a
contact in your phone really handy
little mini application here that you
can add to your home screen and of
course with Android you can always add
another application to your home screen
say after you download one by going into
the program tray and just tapping and
holding and dragging it right to your
home screen this kind of operates like
Windows actually you can go into the
Start menu click and drag and put
something on your desktop this is pretty
much unique to Android and I think it's
a really nice way to quickly add various
things to your home screen so overall
it's nice to see that the Google Nexus
One has some useful widgets for the home
screen displays it's nice to see that
there are five home screens that you can
use to customize again I'd like to see
an easier way to jump between these home
screens and also be nice to see even
more widgets with greater functionality
it would be nice to have a stock Twitter
widget for example that allows you to
update your status instantly and things
like that but pretty nice and the live
wallpapers are also quite impressive
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
