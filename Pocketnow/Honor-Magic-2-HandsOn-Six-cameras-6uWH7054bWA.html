today I am all the way in Beijing
providing some coverage for the honor
magic to launch event here I wanted to
share with you guys a quick hands-on
with the device and showcasing some of
the special features about it we have
one in hand it comes with a brand new
assistant called yo-yo so let's go ahead
and check it out this is TK pocket now
and XDA
one of the first things that you'll
notice about the honor magic 2 is that
almost bezel less display on the front
and that's due to the fact that we have
all of the mechanics and normal sensors
that we need on this behind the display
with that sliding mechanism that's why
we have that option we have a triple
camera setup on the front as well as a
triple camera setup on the back provide
us the ability of using basically a
really good combination of wide-angle
lens and monochrome lens as well as a
standard RGB lens on the back and in the
front we have a 16 megapixel sensor
accompanied by 2 megapixel sensors for
depth perception
the other main feature of course is that
we now have an in display fingerprint
sensor similar to the way we have it on
the mid-20 pro this is honors first
implementation of this technology on
their device and it looks and really
nice provides a very nice a very sleek
look to this device not only that it
gives you the ability of having a good
secure mechanism to unlock your phone
without having to worry about its chin
at the bottom for a fingerprint sensor
back at Aoife honor teased us with the
fact that a cure 980 will be powering
the magic - and of course they did not
disappoint
the Kiran 980 is basically always first
seven nanometer architecture chipset
that provides us an octa-core processor
that runs at two high cores to medium
cores and for low-power cores to give
you a really long battery life
speaking of battery life we have a
thirty four hundred million battery on
this device and that's due to that
sliding mechanism normally into this
form factor we're used to seeing a four
thousand milliamp similar to the way we
saw it on the p2 intro
now as far as the software we are
running Android 9.0 with magical s 2.0
on top of that essentially a derivative
in emui 9.0 on the honor magic - one of
the other things of course in nui 9.0
provides us is not only is it running
the latest version of android but it
also runs with a lot of new features and
new tricks to provide you better long
battery life so you shouldn't have to
worry about a 3400 millionaire battery
on such a nice device
now my initial impressions about this
device I'm actually quite impressed with
the way it works the mechanism is very
nice is very smooth of course we need to
give it some time to see how it's gonna
perform and how it's gonna hold up it's
been rated to last pretty long with the
five hinges that we have here we have
two on the side two on the bottom side
and then one in the center to give it
that nice little mechanism now there's
no IP rating of course since we have a
moving part on this device but it
definitely it looks really nice
functions really well face on lock is
still present there and there is going
to be a premium version that has a 3d
sensor in the front that provides even a
much faster way of unlocking device even
more secure for payments I want to say
thank you to honor for allowing us to be
able to attend the event this device is
available only in China and hopefully it
will be available in the rest of the
world at some point I am definitely
looking forward to spending some more
time with this and I'll try to provide
you guys with more coverage from the
magic to let me know in the comments
below what do you guys think of the
magic - have you heard about it are you
excited is there something that you'd
like to know specifically about it other
