pocketnow.com the samsung galaxy s3 is a
great phone it is good hardware it's
fast it looks good but it's got a lot of
software issues the on-screen keyboard
lacks responsiveness the email app is no
good and the launcher doesn't let you
easily make folders like you can stop
Ice Cream Sandwich fortunately as with
any Android device you can root it and
install a custom rom fixing most of the
software issues if not all of them so in
this video we're going to show you how
to root the samsung galaxy s3 and the
were to put a custom rom on it hopefully
solving some of these issues let's get
to it and as is the case with routing an
android phone there are always several
different methods to do so in this case
we're to XDA developers we're going to
download the galaxy s3 toolkit from em
skip it looks pretty easy and pretty
handy to use we've actually already
downloaded so we're going to open it
here and it gives you a bunch of options
and the first thing you want to do is
hit one so that you can install the
galaxy s3 drivers on your computer you
have already done and of course you want
to have your Galaxy s3 connected with
the USB cable and now we are going to go
to number to appear rude options so to
enter gives you a bunch of different
options and I'm going to go with the
all-in-one number three so many three
enter and gives you a little bit of a
disclaimer and it says do you want to
continue make sure you read the
disclaimer you want to make sure USB
debugging is enabled so jump into the
settings here and that is in development
developer options USB debugging USB is
connected remove the cable okay so yeah
disconnect it turn on USB debugging and
then you plug it in and we should be
good to go okay so let's follow the
instructions make sure your USB cable is
disconnected check got to keep the
device off here I'm in the background
kind of pulling the battery out now put
your phone into download mode by holding
the home button and volume down buttons
and press the
power button for about two seconds so
we've got home button down button over
here and power buttons sometimes this
takes a little bit of coordination so
hold them down and pressing them all you
should get a warning good no volume up
to continue good step three press volume
up I did that for connect your phone via
USB and if you're using download mode on
your phone okay it'll install the
drivers so let's plug her in good and I
got a little message in the bottom right
corner says everything's good drivers
were successfully installed when asked
press any key to run the Odin flash
tools and move the window so the tool
can order a side by side and follow the
steps from the tool kit wants us to
check off auto reboot and F reset time
click on the PDA button in Odin and
browse to the samsung galaxy s3 toolkit
folder open up the root folder okay
we're in the samsung galaxy s3 toolkit
folder i'm going to go to root with a
little role of the roll of the tongue
there and we want to hit this guy here
so we're to click open just making sure
that that is the right one and it is
click start
nine your phone will reboot yes it it
seems to be rebooting over here exit
Bowden so the toolkit continue continue
the process alright so we exited Odin as
requested let's see if you have let's
see waiting for USB debugging to be
enabled if you haven't done this already
go to settings developer options let's
do a pop up and take us we do it did
that settings adbd is already running
lots of sounds lots of things
congratulation through procedure is
completed completed pushing busybox to
your phone alright very good stuff is
happening okay now that I've got
clockwork mod installed on the galaxy s3
it's time to find the ROM and to send it
over to the phone and to to load it up
now of course the galaxy s3 stole new
device so you're not going to find
cyanogenmod 9 you're not going to find
some stock Ice Cream Sandwich roms yet
although in the very near future there
should be some so most of the roms are
very much based on Samsung's firmware so
you're not going to get sort of a new
email app and a tremendously different
experience but there are a lot of
changes to be had so I'm just going to
pop this one on for demonstration
purposes it's a a mega rom from indy and
it's got a pretty cool list of features
and changes and so we'll see how it how
that goes and i've already got that
downloaded all right so let's load the
rom and of course post links to to get
to all of these steps in the description
and then in the post on pocket now so to
enter the bootloader we are going to go
to volume up the home button and power
we should see clockwork mod show up
after a couple seconds there we are and
so what we're going to do here is wipe
data/factory reset you always want to do
that when you're installing a new rom
and we're deleting everything on the
device of course you also should
probably back up but I don't really care
what's on here we're also going to wipe
cache partition before installing this
rom and down here it says doing stuff
and now we are going to install zip from
sdcard right we're going to choose
from internal sd card because that's
where I put the ROM we're going to click
on Omega here and yeah let's install it
good buy a stock samsung and of course
you know there's going to be a lot of
really cool roms off of the galaxy s3 in
the near future and it's installing and
we've got some some information here
something to click Next and from here
you can remove bloatware it's kind of a
cool off set up here with the wizard so
we're going to I shouldn't see the other
options we have here this is kind of
neat custom mode let's do that that
sounds better install bloatware no apps
installed oh meg is extra apps you can
move them later manually now I want to
keep it clean wizard is ready to begin
installation so we're gonna have no
bloatware which is always a good step
and there's a lot of other cool features
so anyhow that is how your the galaxy s3
and again we'll put links up in the
description so you can do it for
yourself there are lots of methods but
this one was particularly easy I got it
done in probably 15 minutes which is
really great and now I'm set up to
install any third-party rom at any time
so that I can change the software on the
galaxy s3 do you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
