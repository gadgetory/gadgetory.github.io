boat sails into smartphone stream we'll
talk about that and we'll talk about
waterproof galaxies and more nokia eos
rumors today and a whole lot more on
episode 04 five of the pocket now weekly
the once-a-week podcast from
pocketnow.com where we discuss
smartphones tablets in the state of
mobile technology in 2013 I'm your host
Michael Fisher editorial director at
pocket now and today I'm joined by
senior editor Taylor Martin good morning
to you would oh and for the first time
in the history of the weekly we're
joined by a non pocket now team member
from Android beat and gadget and a ton
of other outlets I cannot remember right
now please welcome to the show stefan
constantinescu good morning sir good
morning gentlemen good morning to you to
have you on the air we have been twitter
friends for a long time haven't away we
have we have then it's because I'm
snarky and your snarky er which I don't
know I think that you you may win the
award for snarky astern that we have to
put it to the readers I do enjoy when uh
when followers of both of us kind of
chime in on our interactions which is
fun but we I was trying to like remember
this so listeners the way we the way we
kind of thought to do this is that as
you may be aware we've kicked off the
pocket now VIP which is a video series
we borbet I've episode 2 of that with a
guest I'm not sure if I'm allowed to
announce him so I'm not going to but we
kicked it off with jon rettinger we're
gonna have somebody else very soon but
we thought why let the video broadcasts
have all the fun so we've we've actually
planned on guests on the weekly for a
long time just turns out the time was
right for Stefan to join us so I was
just I was curious those time on what
can you tell us a little bit about your
story so we know where you're where
you're coming from how did you how did
you get into mobile and how long ago was
that Wow um so I don't know if you guys
remember Helio the oh yes our ombre
Helio the premium carrier that offered
like it was an mvno that offered really
fancy phones yes I used to work for them
it wasn't anything yes I did it wasn't
anything super fancy I will
that guy in the shopping mall like a
friend a friend check the Samsung out
check it out check it out good right
come charging out check out this ocean
it's called the ocean that's cool right
yes exactly um and then while I was
working there I came time to purchase a
brand new handset and i was looking at
all the phones out in the states and
they were all let's be frank all the
bones out in 2006 were quite bad um I
don't know man that razr maxx was pretty
awesome the first 10 so so I started
researching online and then it's like
wow look at all these phones in Europe
they have these really cool symbian
things with large screens and Wi-Fi and
whatever so I bought a nokia e61 and
he's 61 yes it's a hard side sliding
ones which one was oh no was that like
they know the the blackberry asked one
it was like the size of a loaf of bread
it was a question not a slice I love
like a loaf and I got that thing and I
had zero clue how to use it so I did
what all the cool kids were doing in
2006 I'm like I'm gonna start a website
writing about this so I can learn and I
did and a website called into into
mobile found it and they were like a we
like what you did we like what you do
would would you like to write for us
full time and I was like oh man should I
keep on selling cell phones in a mall or
should I write for a website on the
Internet of course I said yeah and after
got my after I got my first paycheck
which was june two thousand seven one
month after that I got a one-way ticket
to helsinki finland and just was like
all right I'm gonna try to end up
working for nokia and I did that's I
yeah yeah yeahs gameplay okay it would
did the one-way ticket to tell stinky
was that prompted by and
an appointment at with nokia or was that
just something where you were like I'm
gonna go and then I'm gonna get her job
yeah so after I started writing about
the e61 and then all the other things
the company was planning I was invited
to junk it and they flew they sent me
out to sea ES all the shows enough all
that stuff yeah and I was like this is
pretty cool lifestyle um these are
people i want to work with because
they're cool guys and I was like are you
hiring in the States and they're like
Saudi America is not nice country that
verbatim that's a verbatim nokia quote
no it's not roughly um so all all the
action was in Europe so I moved to
Europe Wow yeah I was there for I worked
there between March 2008 to was it april
may 2009 then the European economy went
to complete hell I got out and then my
old friends from into bubble cold and
they're like hey we see you're out of a
job would you like one again I'm like
yeah okay I like tekkit would ya I like
having an apartment and after that you
and since then you've been a completely
on the journalistic side you have not
since then taken a job at another OEM
you've been at several press outlets
right yes I've been at several press
outlets and I did some freelancing work
for two analyst firms so Wow yeah you've
been all over the place that's its
Austin I it's interesting to me that you
were at nokia before the stephen elop
kind of transformation happened but in
all your your travel since 2009 since
leaving okay you all of that has
resulted in you returning to to finland
to helsinki which is where you are right
now yeah this is why this is one of the
principal reasons that we wanted to
bring you aboard as our first guest
because we were it was recently yola
love day something I'm the mom maybe the
most
title for a mobile event ever but we
could not attend we wanted to you know
we were mostly here in the states except
for aunt honors in Romania and Jaime
who's in Honduras so we just couldn't
Brooke the the travel to Helsinki for
this event so we decided to cover it
remotely but you were there Stefan as
you come here person right yes I did I
want to hear that story I really want to
hear that was what that was like because
you know we're big if you're not aware
we are big fans of viola at pocket now
outside of a reporting standpoint where
we remain balanced dinner you take off
the you take off the press man's hat you
hang up your pencil and it's like man I
hope those guys do well because I like
their the what what they're going so far
what brawl famines boys no oh that's
right that's right we're in a fanboy but
before you get into this fun I just want
to say it's kind of crazy how similar
our journalistic paths started I guess I
mean I never just diverted and went and
worked for an oem but I was working at a
best buy mobile and selling cell phones
at a store and I was asked to write for
phoneDog so it was uh I didn't really
yeah yeah I didn't really create my own
site but i would post like little
reviews and things online so yeah it's
kind of crazy I like it Taylor is Taylor
has a as a nickname on the weekly he is
the Segway Smasher however I'm glad you
did it in that instance because I
actually that is something I meant to
point out all three of us on the air
right now are all veterans of the of the
smartphone retail space who now write
about smartphones I think that's pretty
cool I dig that I job at work tellement
next I'll here in the in the united
states I want to visit Helsinki someday
but so speaking of which let's talk
about yola love day Stefan give us give
us the story what what was it like let's
see I don't know how to tell this story
to you without making you cry um so
first of all it wasn't an event per se
it was um we we each had half
our with the CEO and a software guy and
he was were he was running us through
the operating system and the device and
then in the evening the yola love day
that was some sort of party which I
skipped out on because I don't know open
source 40 year olds all guys in hotel
party it's not my scene you after not
too much it so much more like you love
night then yeah so choice words um the
phone itself it looks really sexy on the
website right yeah definitely I think
Taylor wrote a whole piece on on its its
relative sexiness yeah in real life
don't do this to me feel so bad oh no
way what would like in what way
materials uh-uh we weren't allowed to
touch the phone but we sort of did but
we were sort of not allowed to I don't
know how to explain that without trying
to set off any alarms um sure they're
surrounding your place right now yeah
the bezels on the side of the screen are
ridiculous like huge same thing on the
top and the bottom and the screen itself
has zero viewing angles none whatsoever
and then as for the software I'll be
honest with you I was at their last
events which was in the fall of 2012
yeah and um it hasn't changed it's
literally the same software and I want
to be impressed I really do because it's
a Finnish company and I've been living
here for six years and I want to support
them at all and they're all X engineers
but it's like if you're going to spend
400 euros on a smartphone and that's
what they're selling this for 400 euros
you can buy a samsung galaxy s3 for the
same price yeah that's pretty that's a
pretty substantial price tag it is yeah
so if you're going to spend that you
your argument
that you want a a product that is more
finished that is that is more polished
that is what man 40 g status yeah right
yeah that's the thing you're painted to
get in on that first let that 2007
iphone right yeah i mean i'm a guy who
if i purchase something it's a tool and
it has to work perfectly I don't want to
trouble shoot it I don't want to open up
any online forums and ask people for
tips and tricks and stuff like that I
just want to open the box pop in the sim
card and I'm working now the yola phone
is the complete antithesis of that Aunt
its antithesis not antithesis Jesus
sorry I say I say antithesis so it's
okay I say a lot of words really strange
and I get help for it so you're you're
allowed view welcome to the podcast
where we talk weird no that's all right
yeah so that's interesting to me I you
know I to the saw the software in person
that uh what mwc and I Taylor I think
you did too right I was not there I know
you weren't there boots OMG i'm sorry i
wasn't gonna see yes I'm okay I did not
see him at CES okay uh well in any know
if they were there not only I don't
think so I've seen the thing in a person
as well I you know this the fact that
the software hasn't changed much
actually doesn't bother me too much
because when I thought it was pretty
polished I mean you know there was not
there was not a lot wrong with it I
didn't feel like there was a whole lot
missing from it it looked damn near
final running on that Nokia and not n 76
and 950 950 yeah yeah so I didn't have
it running on the meego phone yeah in
nine not at not a name WC that in oh
yeah so I don't know I mean I it's the
software excited me i was i was excited
to see the hardware and that's what I
was waiting for two from this from this
reveal and I ok so it's good to hear a
first person's perspective on maybe
these large bezels and this kind of
thing what about the material Stefan
because that's that's the one thing that
dumb I know you said you weren't allowed
to touch it I don't know if you can not
talk about it or whatever but I don't
know what to make of this and I know a
lot of this
hardware isn't final but it doesn't it
doesn't feel good it doesn't look like
it feels good I'm gonna talk about the
other half in a second but just the feel
I have one word mmm hallway oh that is
that's an effective word to use that is
the effect of word but the what was it
um the ascend p1 yeah that one wasn't
bad it was really lightweight it was
fair to that lasted yeah it it wasn't
bad it wasn't bad I saw the reviews that
one was it p 1 or was it like a sin mate
or something I'm gonna say like Huawei
geeth 300 or something just thrown out
already they have to have something out
there na the name g300 right or is that
actually a phone cuz I don't know it
actually is yeah huawei ascend g300 oh
the aam yeah but um honestly here we
gooo glee I I would be so much more
excited about this phone if it was 200
euros because that's what it looks like
it looks like a 200 euro smartphone and
they're charging 400 for it hmm so I'm
gonna say is this phone the g300 looks
like a nexus one so I can't hate it yet
you have to touch it don't get back
exactly right the tactile discussion so
alright alright so we've we've got a
materials kind of perspective here now
what do we think about this other half I
think this is probably the biggest piece
of innovation on the hardware I want to
say that I'm eager to give yola kind of
a break on the hardware not just because
I like them and as you say Stefan you
you also are would like them to succeed
and you like them and so on but the
thing is that they're not quoting any
concrete specs at all because I think
they're still source and those two
working out all those supplier
agreements and all that stuff so we
don't know who's making their screen we
don't know who's making their camera and
I don't think they know some of the
stuff yet so it is entirely possible
that when these things hit production
will will see some changes go ahead
that's a good thing though not because
you look at oh you know it is not trust
me I asked them up the was do everything
about the processor the screen
ology all that stuff yeah and all the
answers I got back where the three words
I hate to hear the most out of anyone's
face hardware doesn't matter okay yeah
that's like that's a half truth but the
reason I say that it's a good thing that
they don't have those specifications yet
and this is probably looking at it from
the wrong perspective but look at Yoda
phone they release are they announced a
phone how many months before it's going
to be available with specifications from
that time not when it's going to come
out when the yotaphone actually comes
out it's going to be sporting a year and
a half old specs so but I mean that
would have happened you know people
would have been disappointed in that
regardless of whether they announced it
at the unveiling or not right equality
they're still gonna get a lot of press I
mean I still want to see the thing yeah
but I'm saying this company might they
they might if they're if they have an
ounce of marketing and and I don't know
prowess I guess I'll just say I think
prowess savvy anything they will wait
and update the specifications as close
to the launch as possible yeah cuz what
are they saying they're saying quad-core
right no oh what is dual core yep ah yes
with an unknown frequency unknown Ram
unknown screen resolution we know it's a
4.5 inch screen that's all we know
that's over ingles yeah oh god I do
wonder if that you know did they say
anything about these demo units did they
say anything about like yeah this is not
the final screen I'm sure they said this
isn't final hardware right they said
that of course which they kind of have
to and everybody yeah right of course
that's the usual thing I probably they
probably got that display from Sony it's
possible Sony makes such horrible
histories but happy thought like no
u-turn be real degrees from the center
line and it's like oh it's gray why is
good right now hey you just you just
slightly tilt it away from you and the
whole screen just disappears you're like
what yeah what happened hit the power
button and then it turns off your like
what no what happened now as I recall
that didn't happen on the
tablet Z which is interesting I wonder
where that panel came from but we will
know we'll know more about that very
soon actually so let's let's keep it on
the on the yellow phone for a second I
sailfish OS powered the older phone for
a second I want to talk about the other
half did they did you see it removed and
then replaced Stefan no I did not and I
asked about that specifically I said hey
can you please remove the back of the of
the phone I want to see the battery I
want to see where the same card goes etc
blah blah blah and they were like that's
not happening no and I was extremely
puzzled by that I'm like a like why what
I want to know is the whole point to it
or one of the main points that they said
was the theme of the phone changes to
the color of the back that you put on it
right so if you put on an orange back
you have an orange display in you I you
put on this this turquoise color and
everything turns turquoise yeah that's
ambulance and one other yeah and in one
of their press shots I didn't realize
that it's one I used in the article 1 of
the press shots it's got an orange back
and like a navy blue you I yes yeah well
you can change it out like you don't I
mean I'm sure you can okay wouldn't they
want to show off that it kind of
corresponds to the color well they do
that in the turquoise one you know I
feel like I feel like with the that's
just a press decision you know like
they've got this photo up it's like all
right orange on one side blue and the
other this looks good this is this will
be more eye-catching you know maybe yeah
maybe but I want to say that they're not
the first to come up with the idea in
the editorial I wrote um I touched on an
article I wrote about Microsoft I think
last year maybe 2011 I can't remember
but Microsoft filed for a patent it was
at the beginning last year they filed
for a patent on a dual module phone and
what it was is the body of the phone was
kind of like a side slider so instead of
it having a physical Courtney when you
slide it out it has interchangeable
modules that you could plug in one could
be an extended battery or
orage one was a game controller one was
a media thing so you can like play your
movies on the screen of the store on the
phone display and then scroll through
your content on this this media plugin
hmm so they had this I can drop your
link if you want to see it so it's so
that's interesting so all right they
filed a patent for it but they did they
never did anything with it i think they
didn't well they don't they don't have a
patent for it yet but I think they I
think that was one of the patents that
they filed for so no one nice could use
this that is tingly because we've seen
this this concept come up before I mean
it's been probably it's probably like an
eight year legacy by now if companies
coming to come out of the woodwork me
like hey guys what if what if you had a
phone that half of it was customizable
and you can just slap on a customizable
back for whatever you wanted to do like
but I I think yola is the first correct
me if I'm wrong please somebody jump in
and correct me if I'm wrong I think
you'll is the first people to actually
kind of follow through with this in a
and what could become a big way right if
the phone ships then yeah they will be
yeah now it'll probably now it'll ship
with a default back certainly they're
not going to ship the thing backless I
mean that would be ridiculous so it'll
probably ship with the standard back
with a standard battery but I remember
asking marc dylan the head of software
about about the stuff on our interview
and he was like i asked him about what
everyone on twitter was asking about was
like asking if they're gonna do a qwerty
keyboard back and all his only response
was that he's he's smiling from ear to
ear and i was i okay all right well
that's you know i understand you can't
share the deets so I will look forward
to seeing that I don't know I what else
could they do with this extended battery
stuff what else what my imagination is
failing me well one of the descriptions
on the site was a back for work so
you've got all your your enterprise
applications and logins and everything
and one back and then you go home and
you pop one on and then you've got one
for your personal stuff so that the
software I've learned that the software
differentiation between two phones like
you switch to a work mode when you get
to work it's not necessarily effective I
guess because it's like me I work from
home I would much rather work from an
office because I don't get that set
operation its light does that make sense
like I don't get a physical separation
so I always feel like I'm I'm on the
clock sure I know absolutely i get that
that's a whole different conversation i
mean we all try think all three of us
worked from home I mean Stefan when you
work for outlets you work from home yeah
of course yeah yeah so I agree and
that's all that's a huge conversation
that I don't people have written books
on that but but so and yeah there are
some companies like blackberry 10 the
platform offers that I figure out what
it's called with that firewall between
work and personal and Samsung has a rock
knock knocks yep yeah and so with this
is cool and to solve that problem
through software is actually quite
elegant and it does obviate the need to
do this fancy hardware stuff that is by
all measures more difficult right but if
it would be good isn't this your way
what it just by two phones oh well ya
know it's true but isn't that like a
lamer way to like I just get so I think
it is because I get so geeky about like
all right I got my transformer phone
here and it's the same phone but check
it out and then it's like I do some
crazy stuff was like slap look it's my
work phone and then I take something off
put something else on it's like now so a
personal phone i'm going to the club you
know i don't know maybe it's because I'm
14 and I like movable parts and things
like that but I just like the concept
maybe did you get the link i dropped i
did so this is a cool pattern um it's
we're not gonna link to it in the in the
post unfortunately because it's it's
it's from from phoneDog and we have this
external linking thing but this is
really cool we can maybe maybe I can
drop the image in here but this is yeah
give you i can give you the link to the
the filing you should do another
editorial at pocket now about this now
this is really cool i I'm really so the
tailored already said it before but this
is this Microsoft side sliding side
sliding big ol Windows Phone landscape
slider with modules you can just drop
into the lower section so yeah it goes
the other part where he had to basically
just two displays was also part of that
patent i believe it was part of another
one they filed now we've seen those two
did that two displays thing try to work
with what was the carrier here in the
states i'm not sure if it
made it or to start in overseas no I'm
sorry it's a specific device it's a side
sliding dumbphone a landscape slider Oh
with a display right in the middle of
the bottom slider and the keyboard
flanking the display do you guys
remember that there's any TNT I think
yeah I think you're right and for what
it was called p and t it was split
something lands get working was it an LG
phone I think it was probably it was
either LG or Samsung right pantech or
pantech it might have been pantech let's
see but gentlemen let's be serious a
patent is like a it's like a wet dream
it's nice when you have it but you can't
really double anything with it then
we're right stuff on its LG double play
LG double play ok og double play look it
up everyone for a fun for a fun trip
back down memory lane that was only from
like what two years ago something like
it was a pile of garbage then it's a
pile of grab yeah but see these are the
things that get me excited like that
Samsung um creative or captivate or
whatever the hell we with a secondary
oled display beneath the primary one I
remember that yeah yeah like I like so
this is what I like I like innovation
alike cool ideas even if it is totally
impractical I I give companies props who
go out of their way to be like now we're
going to do something different so I
really like that night I hope that by
the time the yellow phone comes to
market it has a at least two or three
alternative other halves because if it
doesn't this whole thing is just why
bother right I just have one question
for you yeah have you pre-ordered it at
all what they do love the phone yeah no
but how will you not succeed but I'm not
helping them well here's the thing like
we did expect to get a review unit you
know avi I refrain from pre-ordering
most things I mean the pebble was an
exception because it was an accessory
right combadge might be an exception cuz
I I might just want one but like I
wouldn't do it with a phone just because
I would expect to review it and then I
guess that's the one that's the one sort
of you
entitled yeah I don't feel entitled now
I feel entitled practical how I feel I
feel for once in my life I feel
practical but I'm getting old I know
right oh god I have to go grocery
shopping with this Monday not not out I
am looking at the as the thing because
there was one other thing I wanted to
cover on yellow so um Stefan I feel like
I know your opinion on this but I'm
gonna ask you again and I also want to
ask Taylor and whoever talks first wins
no me first first we'll uh well novelty
being booed a second do you think that
if they get a solid screen in here if
they get a if they make the hardware
feel better do you think that the that
it offers enough potential to keep you
afloat until the yellow phone to the
floor taking um yeah go ahead to it I
was just gonna say that that's a lot of
ifs that there are a lot of it's a lot
more than just a display there if the
software is ready if the display is
better if the chipset can make the phone
run smoothly all of that together if
they bring it all together maybe it's a
it's a very long shot very slim odds
that they can but I imagine what will
happen is if they don't patent this idea
or if it doesn't infringe on Microsoft's
dual module patent somebody will borrow
the idea mm-hmm that's the unfortunate
truth that's interesting then I do
wonder how aggressively Microsoft will
if that patent actually went through i
wonder if well you know whatever there's
always legal battles right i do want to
make a point before stefan responds i
want to say that this I saw this
platform running on that Nokia and 950
and we've seen it just tons of times it
runs very smoothly on what is that four
year old hardware three year old
hardware really old yeah I would have to
say at least three yeah so if you can
unnecessarily on that hardware than I
don't think it's gonna have any trouble
running on what even it whatever this
dual core thing is there
throwing at it so I I hey look it'll run
smoothly they have one if out of the way
awesome they do they do 50 more to go
Stefan your thoughts well let's see when
they first showed off the operating
system sailfish they said that they
would have something out by the end of
the year and that was 2012 and then they
said okay we're working on it ill be out
by the spring and that didn't happen
it's going to be June pretty soon and
they said yes we will have a phone out
by q4 that's the official word q4 and
assuming it does come out in q4 that's
the huge if assuming it does it doesn't
run Android and it doesn't run iOS so
nobody cares that is a a cynical but
understandable viewpoint that I cannot
in good conscience disagree with and
also cause you're right like I argue
with Taylor who says that it would be a
shame if somebody stole their I all
their concepts with the with the other
half and the software I think once you
insert an idea into the world you don't
own it anymore like other genes it's
sort of all about who creates the best
implementation of it so it's unnecessary
weight welcome yeah like I don't not shy
away but I don't disagree with taking
someone else's idea and building upon it
because that is innovation that's how
innovation works a lot of the time yeah
it's not necessarily something that we
are proud of but you just agree with you
just disagree with taking the idea and
and like implementing it and duplicating
it just ripping it all you like LG does
for samsung oh god is so bad it's white
elva exists yeah I don't know you know
it's fun about it was funny about this
LG never really bothers to to to address
it they just kind of sit in silence and
like yeah we do it but so what yeah well
in
you if i'm not mistaken they don't
really care yeah you're just kind of
like yeah they copied us whatever we did
it better yeah we're like they copied
that guy and and now or I'm saying hey
look at this look at this look at this
like violating our new style guides it
copied it um no that sounds confusing
doesn't it yeah we ruin the podcast yeah
um no but to what Stefan was saying why
would anyone get behind a company when
no one is really getting behind
Microsoft right now you know nokia is
behind them but they have just after two
and a half years how long has Windows
Phone been around I can't remember 2010
i think was only windows phone 7 dropped
okay so almost three years now right
because it was elected to nap filter nav
is right yeah yeah so two and a half
years and they just now combined with
windows mobile if i'm not mistaken have
just over three percent market share
global smartphone market share and this
is what you do with it benin a net and
and blackberry has dwindled and dwindled
down to around the same so these two
big-name companies can't do it in the
market i'm not saying a third party no
name start-up can or can't I guess yeah
I'm not saying they can't do it but what
are the odds we need someone with clout
to massive long shot see what it is yeah
do you think they don't then in that
case what do you think they're going to
get bought or do you think that they are
going to just outright fail because
remember it's in its it's like an open
source thing right it's there's a lot of
community enthusiasm behind this that's
one of their big pitches is that like
yeah look we have we have a small but
very very fierce community I mean that
that ultimately didn't save that's
that's what's trying to save the
remnants of webos right now it's not
really working because nobody's left
well I shouldn't say that but not many
people are left but do you feel like
these guys have a little bit more of a
head of steam behind them they could
survive in that way i love i love that
we've gone to the doom and gloom
it's already I'm sorry well oh can I
read an excerpt like a really small
excerpt from the editorial I wrote only
if you do it with with fiery passion
fiery passion yeah yola is it perfectly
good not not like the dog from the taco
bell commercials all right anyway yola
is a perfect example of a company yola
is a perfect example of a company many
of us are rooting for but we'd be naive
to think or to take the road ahead of
them as I'm just done I'm done I can't
read translate it translate it for us
what is your final point before we move
on I cannot read oh that's a good one
but we'd be naive to take the road ahead
of the small company as anything other
than an unbelievably steep mountain and
simply rooting for a company doesn't
make the climb any less difficult mmm
that's that's a solid point I think we
all agree it's gonna be a very very
difficult row to hoe it's like a it's
like as remember that remember that
expression no I've never heard that in
my life yeah I've heard a lot of really
dreams hey Taylor you didn't grow up
with enough country music to hear the
expression road to hoe no I used to
rotor rotor home I used to think it
would certainly houses on helicopters do
you steal that from like a John Wayne
movie because he said a lot of sayings
that no one ever said hopefully was
stole it from a Reba McEntire song wow
that's even worse that is worse than
ripping off John Wayne really oh yeah no
you're right your ebook really you live
in super Carolina no Trisha Yearwood I'm
sorry Trish you're one of those
incorrect I've noted let's move back
into mobile technology know we've we've
got wet what Taylor Oh before we do jump
I want to say something Taylor has an
announcement that because we were
getting to know Stefan at the head of
the show we did not get to address this
Taylor has a new toy it's not a piece of
mobile technology you have a new toy
yeah it's I'm actually podcasting from
it right now no you're not because
you've plugged in an ethernet cable it
Taylor hasn't as an a-wing starfighter
what is this car called Taylor you have
a new automobile yes I got a scion fr-s
but I've been calling it a sigh oh de no
sigh Oh Beru
yo guru you familiar with the Scion
brand Stefan uh it was an off brand from
Toyota or something was it yeah it's
it's Toyota's like us hip brand yeah and
all the way over here was like kind of
perceived as like a grandma company yeah
yeah so they launched scion to appeal to
the younger demographics it's kind of a
little bit pretty crazy yeah it's wild
it's a wild-looking car what took what
colors you get it in um hot lava it's
like no I'm section about that now for
one of its newest ford hot la i was i
was driving it in the i was test driving
in the guy who was sold me the car i
called it orange while we were driving
any smack me in the arm and he's like
it's hot lava I mean I know the guy oh
and no that's wrong at be drugged I
drove an hour and a half out of the way
to go buy a car from him when there's a
dealership three miles down the road so
hey that's loyalty there well
congratulations man it's good that you
have a car that you love Taylor's in
love with this car I had to get had to
give him some air time to if you did I
love it and everybody keeps stopping me
to ask about it and it's cool because
I've never had a cool car before I mean
I had a scion tc before this but it was
just kind of everybody's got a TC I want
you to write an editorial and this is
not an assignment because I'm not doing
that but I I wish that you would write
an editorial drawing links between the
similarities between buying a new car
and buying a new smartphone because
there are a lot so many papers to sign
yeah that's one different contracts to
sign and then there's but also there's
that whole thing like people look at you
and it's like oh what's that yeah look
at that and then when you first see
someone else with a hot lava sigh on the
model number of the year your gut your
hearts gonna be either broken or you're
gonna wave at them i don't know i don't
know you well enough yet yes i would
always like gatos break when I do
somebody with my new my new phone I'd
like oh no I dis mine I have that
assault three yesterday yesterday alone
us all three other FR esas in hot lava
not in hot lava that's why I go that's
not been common color everyone gets like
a red or a blue or white I'm glad that
you know I got should I get Bernie yeah
the speaking of hot lava
and volcanoes and disasters and Taylor
this is your cue to ruin my Segway this
is henrik yeah we had the opportunity
AT&amp;amp;T in the United States invites us to
tour a relief exercise that they were
conducting with their network disaster
recovery team I thought you were
segwaying into Star Trek in the
beginning of the movie no that would be
awesome though but spoiler alert their
volcanoes in the new Star Trek so we
went it was hartford connecticut was
right down the road i went and i was
shown around for about two hours the
most elaborate set of equipment and
mobile technology on the network side
that I've ever seen in one place it was
absolutely absurd I'm not going to talk
a lot about it I just want to said
there's a video on unpacking now
covering this and it was stunning to me
to see the resources that a national
carrier like AT&amp;amp;T has to come into a
place that's been ravaged like Oklahoma
poor Oklahoma with his tornado you know
disaster and and restore service and get
people connected again and hearing some
of the stories from the from the people
working on the team were really amazing
and I got to nerd out guys you know what
a what a SAT colt is right or a cow cell
on wheels yep yes they're different
pieces of technology cycles and gals but
they had one sack hold on site and the
acronym i believe it's satellite cell
site on light truck and i first read
about the existence of these things like
10 years ago on howardforums or
something like that i'm like wait a
minute they can wheel up a a cell site
on a truck oh yeah that's so that's how
you know where the press event is like
if you're in New York you look for the
trucks oh yeah you look for the big
verizon or AT&amp;amp;T trucks parked beside
each other exactly right because they
can wheel them into bring additional
coverage into yrics cute additional
capacity into an area or additional
coverage to if the if the local site is
down but just being able to walk around
inside a satellite cult was was was
awesome just knowing that this thing
could wheel anywhere pop up a mast and
in like two hours can provide a cell for
you know however many people did you
 him coming along
bazinga what did you feel the cancer
running through your body now you walk
through that lesson activity yes because
the diesel generator was running so I
got a nice nice snout full of diesel
fumes but it's healthy sulfur yeah she
keeps you ready to do things makes you
feel like Superman build stuff that says
something that was a fun tour I i
encourage anyone in the press or VIPs if
you are in a field that you know carrier
wants to show off its disaster recovery
operations anybody who has an
opportunity to see this stuff should go
and or if you happen to have the
misfortune of being in a disaster area
and you see a carrier branded vehicle
odds are you can probably get some
internet or some some self service from
them to tell people you're okay so keep
that in mind pretty cool to see the
carrier's doing this that said should we
start talking about Android gentleman
and I'm gonna kill the Segway every
time every single time I love to see how
I want to see how you slaughter this
yeah okay sure no yeah what whatever you
cupcakes news or something what's up ya
know what Cartman droid figuring out I
got a hot love on my cell site okay so
you said you were impressed that they
could do will in a Cell site on a truck
totally I think was about a year ago my
grandpa handed me a newspaper and I saw
nothing about this on the internet and I
was going to write about it and I never
did but there was a technology a guy who
created the power of a cell site a a
full-on cell site in a box about the
size and shape of a Rubik's Cube it's
called a small cell yeah but but it was
just capable of serving hundreds maybe
even thousands of people now through me
yeah that's at least in the news article
said and and granted the news articles
and a newspaper and they don't
necessarily always know how these things
work but yeah wait what so I came I am I
just totally small cells are low powered
radio access nodes that operate in
licensed and unlicensed spectrum that
ever inch of 10 meters or one to two
kilometers on Okia siemens and pat works
liquid radio technology that's basically
what you're talking about liquid liquid
radio technology we're all we're doing
this right now as somebody who has
studied about cellular networks for
quite a few years yeah liquid metal
snaps the capacity and some other page
loading uh so here's the things that
we're at okay so sorry it used to be a
cell site was this fully standalone
operational thing where it had the
servers at the cooling it had all the
computer stuff plus the antenna plus the
power amplifiers plus the power source
all this garbage required to allow you
to watch a YouTube video on your phone
so ho kiya Siemens Networks said okay
why don't we put all the computer stuff
in the cloud aka the internet and then
our cell sites should be as cheap as
humanly possible they'll just be
antennas with power amplifiers and we
can even solar power them and that's
essentially all it is that's what this
liquid ready like what radio thing is
yeah and hear what I'm saying here
doesn't really look like anything that I
was talking about actually here's one
not that one still fascinated yeah no I
was looking for exactly what it was um
this isn't like a really innovative
thing like if you google alcatel-lucent
small cells they have it too I think
brought that's what I was talking about
Brad I was home at telefónica test oh
this was at MBC so every time I open up
chrome it opens four times at once which
everything yes we do that oh there it is
there's a little oh wow that's tiny yeah
that's why I was so like impressive uh
add that was like the last dude yeah
there was a guy just holding one in his
hand and all right Wow I'm sensing so
you know what I'm sensing right now like
my mind is reaching into the future
sensing the frustration of users who
can't see what we're looking at and I'm
sensing 47 of the usual why aren't you
guys have a video podcast comments so
let's move on let's talk about android
taylor saved that link so that we can
talk about
later because I think there's a really
cool editorial in that somewhere Leo I
killed your segway I'm so glad thank you
for staying consistent even though I was
totally wrong at least we had an expert
on the line you're doing it again thank
you Stefan get get out of here you boys
want to talk about droids I want to
thank you see this is a nice guest HTC
we have a big scoop from it was chris
sigler at the verge who kind of tipped
us off in the middle of the night a
couple nights ago I was like I was just
on Twitter I had finally gotten away
from mobile technology and this lights
up my feet and I'm like come I have to
click on this I have to click on this
even though I would rather be paying
attention to this episode of Deadliest
Catch or whatever I was doing and it is
this there's this interesting story that
HTC is losing a lot of employees or
employees are or losing HTC or something
something is going on there's a lot of
reshuffling happening not on the
engineering side but on the marketing
side of HTC and this is a cause for
concern in some quarters any kind of
shift like this is hahahaha you clever
bastard yeah I had to actually it starts
out dramatically to as a Tony's Tony's
news post about this the captain is the
last one to abandon a sinking ship and
he starts talking about Peter is it
child CEO Peter Chao yeah but anyway
he's not going anywhere he said he would
resign if the one wasn't a success but I
think it is going to be which we'll talk
about in segments but they're moving
they're moving a lot of product let's
see product strategy manager Eric Lynn
who we all know from his I mean it's
he's a veteran he's been around since
the I used to follow him on phonescoop
who tweeted to all my friends still at
HTC just quit leave now it's tough to do
but you'll be so much happier I swear so
it sounds like there's definitely and
that's backed up by some other other
stories and the virgin since updated
their story with other accounts I mean
it you know it seems like a big
reshuffle is happening over there but
some astute commenters have pointed out
that this is all happening on the
marketing side or close to the marketing
side and we hadn't all in San Francisco
right right
around Seattle you see right and and so
somebody actually said like you guys
have all been complaining for years that
HTC is not advertising properly at you
know well now they're doing something
about it so you know this shouldn't come
as a big surprise so I wonder I imagine
the truth is somewhere between that and
you know the sky is falling and no
there's nothing to worry about this is
what do you think Stefan well I've
actually read the purchase piece and I
agree was fascinating and I've been
following everyone else who has been
covering it because TechCrunch found out
about some other guy engadget found out
about some other guys seen it etc etc
and the total right now is 8 so 8 really
high level HTC executives have now left
and it's really interesting to see where
they're headed to so eric lin he now
works for skype um John Stark he works
for AT&amp;amp;T the head of digital services
Elizabeth Griffin she now works for
Nintendo so what do I think about this
um yeah how do you read the tea leaves
here you're really good at industry
analysis which is why I've wanted to
have on the show as well I mean I've
been following all the stories coming
out of Taiwan and everybody says that a
Chow is just firing from the hip then
he's not planning for the long term at
all so if the one works great if it
doesn't that's HTC's problem and he's
overworking everybody and it just sounds
like he's a guy who's trying to run
really fast really far and he's just
running out of breath Taylor she's great
yeah i mean i've read haven't read all
of it but I've read enough to know that
yeah that's kind of what's happening
here as much as i would say that i want
to say that this isn't anything to be
alarmed about it's something that it's
something to be alarmed about until
Peter child death step down I
I will be interested to see how this
goes now normally we would expect this
to be backed up by a story saying HTC's
One sales one demand is not meeting
forecast but we are not seeing that
we're seeing almost the opposite right
in some regards we're seeing HTC have
HTC One having sold 5 million units and
this is sold not shipped as I understand
it as are you know I think I confirmed
this with Tony and he he did say that
this is sold not shipped so you know
that's a lot I'm just going to ruin the
future transition and say that the
galaxy s4 has now officially shipped 10
million units which we were expecting it
to do before the month was out but I
personally wasn't expecting to happen
this quickly so the s4 is obviously
taking off just as we anticipated but to
see that the HTC One is is selling in in
fifty percent of that volume is actually
really astounding to me because I didn't
expect it to sell that well I just want
to bring out I just want to point out
that the Samsung figure was from an
official samsung press release date
whereas the HTC figure was from an
anonymous HTC executive who spoke to The
Wall Street Journal so I'm not saying
it's fake I'm just saying you have to
take it with a little pinch of salt
you're absolutely right and we have
actually reached out to HTC for comment
on that we have not heard back yet just
reach out to him this morning we will
see what they say so you're you're
absolutely right but even say say that
number is inflated right say it's 3
million or 2 million that's still kind
of impressive given how viral the the s4
is yeah absolutely it is lilia and it's
oh yeah we can't really speculate based
on this based on this number yet but
you're right Taylor even if it is less
than half of the quoted figure it's
still impressive because what happened
last year that would the 1x got glowing
reviews all across the internet and then
it just didn't it didn't move right I
don't have any figures on the 1x does
anybody know how much that actually sold
and it's in his prime period I think
they're both wanted him yeah somebody
else bought another yeah six and then
the review units all went back and and
like a 56 move total i wandered one I
wanted to keep mine but they didn't let
me keep my I've got one right here yeah
selling it I don't want it any of you
guys in the states had the one with the
call
I'm s4 and I hated you for it yes cuz it
rear better yeah yeah we had the tiger
31 and anything from it Nvidia's just
pure trash yeah do it you could have
played you could have played shadowgun
with enhanced graphics I have a computer
for that Taylor's gonna get toes gonna
get up close and personal with nvidia
stuff here soon and I think I am I know
if we can talk about that oh but I am so
let's hi I'm from Nvidia Howard ships
are fast but they're not in any products
please ignore that please ignore that
please ignore that and we're gonna have
a three hour press event to show off
nothing Oh anyway now they did show some
stuff but still these are sales figures
these are these are things that are
happening I think that the more exciting
story from the Samsung camp is that not
only are there 10 million galaxy s4
units sold but they are offering them in
new colors hot lava now I'm in now
joining white mist in Black Forest will
be this summer anyone want to guess with
the with the verb adjective next to blue
is Arctic guess blue Arctic and of
course red Aurora followed by my
favorite not brown autumn which i think
is just and anytime you make a brown
phone it's just won't a brown thumb up
it i remember in 2004 wynnum the design
the people designing the motorola I 834
nextel had consulted with some fashion
consultants on it because it was the
smallest nextel ever and they decided
that rather than offering it just in an
aluminum finish 2004 apparently the
color of the year in fashion was
supposed to be copper so they plated
this thing in copper and it was one of
the ugliest phones I'd ever ever seen
but it is an hour collectors items so
you can go get one but Brown autumn is
gross purple Mirage would I think be be
my choice for a new galaxy s4 just
because I like the name I'm telling you
guys a purple galaxy s4 with a yellow s
view cover oh my god no thank you oh
those were my high school color oh god
yeah there's a Lego art blingo oh man
you know that's cool I should plate a
phone in my alma mater colors I should
get a silver and blue
phone silver blues goes well together I
should just start carrying my galaxy
note 2 again with the bright orange flip
cover that I have you know what forget
it I'm just gonna go to Adam dad's house
and steal his Lumia 920 in bright yellow
and then I'm going to alternate that
with an HTC 8x in highlighter yellow and
I'm just going to be visible wherever I
go can we actually find a picture these
colors they're like 10 report saying new
colors and they linked to an old picture
of the phone are they yeah they are
there any visuals I haven't met him yet
either they have a photo of the red one
and the blue one but that's it look at
their mmm and the the brown one is in a
video on samsung's youtube channel yeah
if you want to see a blue one listeners
we might have we might update our post
with the with the photo but I'm finding
one a digi xav calm uh yeah it's a blue
galaxy s4 I mean cool it's more Arctic
than the blue galaxy s3 i'll give it
that it's more arctic than blue yeah
certainly more arctic yeah yeah I'm no
longer interested in galaxy s4 colors
Samsung is about a ten percent stake in
pantech how about that there's that news
that was pretty easy when that hit yeah
well I I don't understand this is an
unexpected move for me first of all I
don't pay any attention to pantech
because they don't have a show us
presence I apparently I should because
they're like the number three in south
korea is that right yep they are and
they make some crazy phones so they
announced the phone called the vega iron
and it is gorgeous it is absolutely that
it's like listen s4 should have been
really the Pangaea vega iron it's like
yes it's the two most badass words from
like cosmology and metallurgy and made
an awesome phone well and it like like
a-- it's like an xperia z it's like an
xperia z from Battlestar Galactica
because it has like with a corner cut up
the hybrid cut corners yeah we're a
lanyard hole oh hey lanyard holes so
hard
you have to watch the software videos
because they invented some crazy stuff
they're like the android capacitive
buttons on the bottom yeah you can put
those wherever you want now because
really you can put him alongside if you
want alongside in the center of your
screen if you wanted to like completely
cool stuff wife did great so apparently
any time I write about Samsung or LG I
always have one crazy guy come on the
site and he's like man pantech invented
all of this stuff they're just stealing
it they're just dealing it real yeah so
apparently they're big and and so I mean
well all we ever see from them in the
states are like mid-range low-end cheap
free phones oh yeah like the pantech
discover is the most like bad one and
you know bad in a good word in a cool
way and I don't think I've ever touched
a pantech phone in my life so well were
they an odm at one point did pantech
make phones for other people well that's
a good question yeah i don't know i
think you said that the pantech flex oh
I don't even know what that is an RA
also don't know what that is there was a
phone on AT&amp;amp;T that was like it was a
metal home from pantech oh cool wait did
uh yeah anyway we're gonna start getting
into I don't know that this is reminding
me of when panasonic used to make phones
and then I'm remembering tiny phones and
blah blah blah i miss tiny phones this
is this is interesting to me i mean this
is a big steak samsung has invested 47
million dollars into pantech there was
it's like a ten percent stake and i
think it i justjust don't really know
what to make of it because these guys
are competitors it's not like a carrier
buying a buying a stake in a carrier in
another country like is happening with
sprint right now it's it's you know
their manufacturers it's like Ford
buying port of Chevrolet yeah the quote
is that it is believed to further
strengthen bilateral cooperation in
smartphone and other business areas in
other words absolutely meant exactly
means we can steal from you rightfully
right
yeah I do wonder if this is like an
insurance move where it's like if any of
those claims not that I'm saying that
any of those claims are true but if
Samsung did in fact draw inspiration
from pantech on some stuff they may be
buying insurance against that I don't
know let's what's what's really cool
about pantech is like you said Samsung
just purchased 10% of them but there are
also two other corporations well one
technically isn't a corporation who also
owned a ten percent stake one of them is
Qualcomm so Qualcomm owns ten percent of
pantech really think about that yes and
then the other ten percent the
government of Korea really Zachary has a
temper and SEGA magic and so does
samsung and Samsung in the government
South Korea obviously obviously very
tight it'sit's literal read on their
interaction yeah one might say they're
in cahoots with one of the one might say
that yes well but yeah I killed your
transition sorry no not at all thank you
for that actually that's that's very
insightful and we did not have that in
our in this particular post that is at
something so I'm going to keep a little
bit of a closer eye on pantech but we we
have one more piece of Samsung news
before we hop out of Android and that is
concerning this galaxy s4 active which
when it first came out I thought it
might be a rumor well it'll be still is
a rumor technically but I thought it
might be an unfounded rumor and it's
looking real this galaxy s4 active is
looks to be basically a galaxy s4 in a
rugged waterproof shell that is for one
of the first times in history not making
it a bulky cat phone like the b15 that
just launched we are getting the
interesting thing about this is not
really that it exists but that no one
can seem to agree on what specs it's
it's shipping with because unfortunately
durable phones have a legacy of being
mid-range and low-end phones only there
are very few truly high-end phones that
are also durable or waterproof Xperia Z
yeah you bring that up again okay these
durable easy
exactly right it's waterproof waterproof
does not equal durability necessary
things scratched like I set it down on a
table with nothing like I wipe the table
down I was shooting a video yeah wipe
the table down set the phone down there
are no scratches when I set it down
picked it up there were scratches all
over the back yeah how does this happen
and then somewhat in the comics is like
oh the back is dragonfire whatever glass
or dragon dragon fire haha what is it
what is it I think it can trap dragon
trill yeah yeah Dragon Fire that was way
is a way cooler name yeah why wouldn't
you call it dragon fire there's a roller
coaster a bush gardens that already has
that van slyke um yeah likelihood of
confusion is high now so but the thing
is that these the specs on the galaxy s4
first looked like they were exactly like
at least one of the variants of the
galaxy s4 out there on the market and
then somebody came along and said no
look at this it's probably only running
a dual-core s4 plus or a dual-core s4
pro and we can't remember which row pro
and then another commenter came along
and said no look in the in one of these
frame grabs it says quad-core arm v7
processor which is probably a what
apq8064 within Audrina or 320 so nobody
can seem to agree on what's inside this
thing and I'm just hoping that it does
pack some really impressive specs
because it will be once again one of the
first durable waterproof phones to do so
I are either of you guys as excited
about this active or am I just a durable
phone nerd your nerd Thank You dealer
you lingered thank you good I appreciate
it good well that's been the pocket not
weekly we'll see you guys no I I think
we can all agree though that the screen
is going to be 5 inches and 1080p which
excites me the most solid point yes
indeed they're going to use the same
panel almost definitely and that's a
buttons buttons the bagel so yeah the
home back and menu keys are physical
buttons on this which they look straight
up 1998a too but you need physical
buttons on something like this that
you're going to market to people who are
doing what
wearing work gloves they're wearing big
clunky finger protection you know there
i wish i had the optimus g pro so i
could click the button into the mic
again that button sounded like a toy it
was like like a I don't even how to
explain it but you could just feel it
like you could fill the phone vibrate
when you click the button so it felt
Hollow yeah well that's what I imagine
what these deity vests has the same
feeling like hey you press the home
button and it's like oh okay that's
that's a little hollow feeling then you
taught me England and resonate you mean
this thing oh you if I can oh you got it
thanks for telling me you got it yeah
there um I just posted a picture of the
note you put on the box oh you'd hit
that's right what did I tell you treat
me gentle I'm special yeah yeah are you
sure the phone wasn't delivered in a
little school bus like I opened the box
I'm like what is this oh co t VES and
then I saw the note and I was happy
again oh good today's special I need to
talk to you up to the podcast by the way
good just gonna throw that in there good
you should do that speaking of after the
podcast we're getting close to it but we
have to cover windows phone before we go
yeah we do we do we do we need to do it
just so you can just so you can earn us
are legitimate following of of angry
Microsoft commenters that follow every
podcast because we get minor detail
wrong no I don't generally like putting
a lot of rumors in the podcast because
it's just then it kind of turns into the
same thing every week but this is a cool
one there is not any accompanying photo
or video or anything from this alleged
sighting which number one means we
should take it with a massive granule of
salt and number two means that it
reading it is kind of like reading one
of those UFO sighting again I was about
to say sasquatch does exist yeah but I
let on its I saw him once I want to read
this because it's so cool that this is a
this is the quote the lens housing is
round in shape and does not protrude
much the flash is xenon and the flash
and lens are both smaller than the Nokia
808 PureView blah blah blah blah blah I
love that
the number of megapixels were not marked
on the prototype with XX megapixels only
being written on the lens housing the
regular photo app is also available but
there's a new camera app called nokia
pro camera with a completely new
interface screen size and resolution is
same as 920 by the way if you just see
this thing in the wild I don't know how
you can say that the resolution is the
same as the 920 and appears to be AMOLED
the speaker holes are at the bottom as
the hand of the handset the handset was
much lighter than the Nokia Lumia 920
wait how could who the hell is the
source the source this is this story
comes to us from wmpoweruser and it's
okay yeah it's gorgeous Wow um you could
say that it's the same resolution
because that's the maximum resolution
that that windows phone supports right
yeah yeah yeah you could say that but
that's not what the account says the
account says it's the same size and
resolution like it's it implies that you
can tell it with you I can measure with
my eyes so they add where wmpoweruser
has updated their original article they
said we had another source confirm the
above info and added that the device
will not come in colors obviously the
source is not named they don't even
didn't even bother with the source
familiar with the matter believe us UFOs
exist if the source makes a smelly fart
and then another source says yep some
really smells does that really count
there were there were UFO sighting
losophy there are UFO sightings during
the tornadoes in um no dear God yeah in
that in Oklahoma in Oklahoma yes there
were UFO sightings and it turned out to
be uh transformers exploding because
that's what happens when power lines go
down true enough like there was a shaky
camera and drinking miles away so the
thing is I so I we agree that these
these are highly questionable rumors but
here's the thing it like all great great
rumors that usually end up being false
there it's very plausible all right this
description is not outlandish we're not
hearing about a flexible display or a
spherical phone or any
kind of garbage so I you know I think
this is probably pretty close to what
we'll see from what is still being
called the Nokia EOS well it was a guy
there was a guy in North Carolina who
set who spotted Sasquatch and he had a
heap drew him and said he had beautiful
hair so thing as Sasquatch is not likely
to be unveiled anytime soon the EOS is
likely to see to reach our eyeballs in
sometime in the next six months so do
you think that this is this you're gonna
do you think he had a suitable hair I
was Cleveland Brown who founded no look
at that jerry curl I think Cleveland did
rocking awesome jheri curl back in the
day so what what is uh if if the
flashback episodes of FAMILY GUY are to
be believed so what is the butt but i
think this is i don't i'm not saying
this is legit i'm saying this is
probably a pretty accurate description
even if its total of fantasy at this
point this is sort of what i expect from
the eos and this is what i would
probably get a lot get very excited
about is this what it would take for you
to get excited about a nokia another
nokia windows phone Stefan or would it
take more than more than this they got
to get rid of the live tiles and they
gotta switch to android and Oh get it
maybe I'll care that Windows 1 and 0 but
honestly this this whole eos rumor has
been going on forever and ever
everything f and there's a new one every
week yes we're good it's not yeah or
this one of the most talked-about phones
that ever why not wouldn't it be right
there's something that ho kia fans don't
want to uh personally admit but um
they're not in charge of the software so
if they want to put in a 41-megapixel
eos whatever sensor in there they have
to ask microsoft and i doubt they would
try that well well i think that what i
think is that Windows Phone needs all
the help I can get a Microsoft for all
its for all its bluster and all its
scroogled BS like understands that
Windows Phone needs more to capture more
market share so I think that they would
I think that they would embrace the idea
of this
industry-leading headline-grabbing
camera module and I think that's what I
say what they're gonna do what is the
only symbian phone anybody's talked
about in the past two years exactly the
808 PureView right exactly okay talked
it out who bought it out on Tony about
it okay he loves it um but but you're
right i mean sales figures aside it's it
is a very well-known phone it
established the PureView brand which
which has carried nokia to some degree
of success right that's there in yeah
it's the foot in the door but the
problem is that it's not just we have to
ask Microsoft if we can use this it's we
have to ask Microsoft to update the the
the capabilities of Windows Phone 8
right they have to upgrade the chipset
because old chipsets from last year
can't support 41 megapixels you would
have to use a Snapdragon 800 oh really
yeah because the maximum of like a
Snapdragon 600 is like 20-some
megapixels so if you're you're shooting
in 41 megapixel range or anything above
like say 25 or 26 28 whatever the limit
is you would have to use a Snapdragon
800 I don't know the limitations of a
Snapdragon s4 pro but i'm sure i could
find that I find that fascinating so
this means that we will see the EOS
either on alongside the next iteration
of Windows Phone or we will see the EOS
land with a chipset that is more current
more contemporary but it it will not
land with a 41-megapixel sensor it'll
it'll end with an an over sized sensor
that uses some other kind of software
magic to do some pixel half doubling or
some other terms than I will make up
yeah limitation is Snapdragon 600 is 21
megapixels and I can't find the s4 pro
interesting what about the 800 800 is 55
whoa yeah yeah or a big food or they can
they can take the HTC root and and just
magnified you know they can say listen
megapixels really don't matter our
primary shooter is a 1.3
megapixel camera but it's but it's got a
massive it's got a sense of the size of
a manhole that's what they'll do if they
did like a like a 16 or 18 or 20
megapixel camera mm-hmm with a large
sensor like an ultrapixel style sensor
it would be huge it would be enormous
would but it would be phenomenal at
least for a phone detachable lens you
know you want to check my shots who you
bring out the the DSLR lens for your
phone camera you know I I just have to
talk about HTC one vs samsung galaxy s4
and everyone's like which one is the
better camera the whole ultrapixels
thing blah blah all the reviews say that
the gs4 takes better photos in everyday
situations so side yes once you get
inside it is so bad it's awful if you
get in not even just poor lighting if
you get in moderately poor lighting or
even just slightly poor lighting the
camera is awful yeah the very first
picture I took with the galaxy s4 was on
an amtrak train and there was natural
light coming in through the windows and
artificial light overhead and I took
that picture looking down the aisle of
this train and I was like wow what is
with all this noise it was a well lit
shot from from any other perspective but
boy it didn't it didn't do well in do it
up but no outdoors beautiful photos and
Tony's Tony says up and down like he's
like that was the first thing you said
when he got the octa-core he was like
this s4 destroys the the ones camera and
yeah under ideal conditions it does but
man not in low light that is and it the
s4 takes the best panoramic shots on a
phone that I've ever seen oh yeah it
does I mean um I've never told the
iphone 5s comes out yeah prize yeah I've
never got stitching to work right it
makes what cars will see the one I used
did you see the one I did um no no it's
it's in the review I can link to it on
there's a download for the full size
it's like 23 megabytes yeah its a 50
some mega pixel is it what is it a
landscape panorama yeah it is just it's
the stitching is literally almost
perfect there are I looked through every
little area of the picture in there like
two areas where the stitching
a little off you get stuff more than 20
feet like close to the camera lens
closer than 20 feet of the camera lens
and stuff really starts going messy
there I hate panoramas have have given
me a lot of trouble this month I don't
want to talk about him I'm just I'm just
so so angry so I'm gonna so I'm going to
show you this picture needs somebody
lost opportunities before we head out of
windows phone actually we are gonna head
out of Linda's phone before we head out
of the podcast I do want to ask if
there's any other news that we failed to
cover or anything that has popped up in
the last hour that we've been on the air
because it was a slow week in some
regards but not in others it looks like
the only news that I'm seeing right now
is that there is a smartphone demoed by
LG with a barely-there bezel that sounds
awesome barely there uh well you have
the new verizon MVNO that is
particularly targeted to latina three
nose right yeah the that's JLo and that
at ctia right oh also yeah good an end
of the show announcement we're not at
ctia sorry because there was really
nothing there yeah well the thing is we
there's stuff there to report on if you
are if you are a broader publication we
are as we say often at pakka na we are
we are very very device focused so there
wasn't a lot there for us but sprint is
unleashing a bevy of waterproof kyocera
phones like the torque which we reviewed
in which we're going to write about
again tomorrow and so that's exciting I
like durable phones I can kind of get a
hell yeah no no you guys don't care yeah
