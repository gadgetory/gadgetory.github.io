marathon of metal monster phones but HTC
knows not everyone is all about aluminum
and accordingly it's released the HTC
One e8 a polycarbonate version of its
well-reviewed One m8
we've already compared the two and a
head-to-head faceoff but how well does
the one e8 fare all on its lonesome the
answer in Pocket now is HTC One e8
review happening right now in our modern
day cornucopia of high-end androids the
e eights
spec sheet does it proud its processor
is almost as high-end as you can get
backed up by plenty of RAM and powered
by a decently sized battery now that
battery is non-removable and the
on-board storage is on the low side at
16 gigs but microSD expansion is
available if you're big on storing a lot
of media the e8 also packs a 5-inch
1080p IPS display that delivers a good
combination of accurate colors solid
pixel density and deeper blacks than you
might expect from an LCD and it's
flanked by too loud and bright boomsound
speakers that outclass everything else
on the market
four regions where dual subscriber
support is important there's a version
of the e8 supporting multiple sims as
well it's all wrapped up in a unibody
polycarbonate casing that on our
electric crimson demo device is thickly
lacquered in gloss coat that certainly
gives it an eye-catching flare but it
picks up fingerprints and other smudges
very easily and it's tough to wipe off
when it does also it just doesn't feel
like a high quality material in the hand
it feels less substantial than 145 grams
like a plastic phone from a lesser
manufacturer fortunately there are matte
finish variants available in other
colors and there's also a fine sense of
engineering expertise here check out the
cleverly disguised volume rocker which
almost seems to disappear into the phone
casing while also providing a subtle
flair to the microSD tray as always with
HTC it's all about the details
speaking of keys HTC is once again
positioned its power standby button in
the least accessible position but just
as on the One m8 it doesn't really
bother us too often because the e 8
supports motion gestures as well raise
the phone and perform any number of
directional taps on the screen to access
different features or raise it and hit
the volume key to fire up the camera it
can be a little inconsistent but it
definitely makes up for the far away
lock button the 13 megapixel camera on
the 1 e8 isn't one of the phone's high
points yes it offers higher resolution
than some of the company's other
offerings but as we described in a
written piece at pocket now the
trade-off isn't worth it photos are
typically washed out especially in shots
featuring a lot of red which is
sometimes totally without contrast
sharpness is also variable across photos
with images blurring slightly toward the
edges possibly due to an inexpensive
lens HDR effects are provided by HTC's
typical haloed filter not the multiple
exposures approach that gives true
dynamic range and low-light shooting is
not good either
even the front-facing camera touted as
wide-angle well
isn't in our opinion the eh cameras
aren't necessarily terrible but they're
also not much good either here's a
couple video samples shot at the max of
1080p
fortunately for the e8 it does bring the
same camera software as other modern HTC
phones which means you get a capable and
fun viewfinder and most importantly you
get Zoey and Zoey highlights both of
which help immeasurably in covering up
the deficiencies of the camera hardware
so if you're not a stickler for photo
quality you could muddle through with
the e8 just fine we've already talked a
lot about Sense 6 HTC's Android
interface in our One m8 review from the
spring and not much has changed you've
still got blink feed for quick social
updates a modern and stylish interface
design a great keyboard and very quick
input response we did run into a few
more app crashes than usual on the e8
but we tested the device using an HTC
backup from our One m8 so we can't
positively attribute that to the phone
day-to-day performance is very good we
had no trouble with reception or voice
quality on att's cellular network in
Greater Boston during our five-day
review period and FM radio reception is
also commendable outdoors though
admittedly we do live in an urban area
where that's not uncommon gaming as you
might expect is outstanding on the
Snapdragon 801 processor and the phone
doesn't get as hot as it's metallic
siblings which might play a part in the
solid battery life we got this week the
e8 isn't built for the US market so your
mileage may vary but one day we were
able to squeeze 17 hours of moderate use
out of the phone before it petered out
the e8 is not reinventing the wheel it's
essentially a regional variation of the
One m8 with a different casing dual SIM
support and a mostly inferior camera as
an alternative to its aluminum
predecessor we don't think it's terribly
attractive but as a lower-cost version
of the same four markets where the m8 is
priced prohibitively the e8 definitely
has a place at the very least it brings
much of the best of HTC to another price
point and another region and that's
definitely a good thing
