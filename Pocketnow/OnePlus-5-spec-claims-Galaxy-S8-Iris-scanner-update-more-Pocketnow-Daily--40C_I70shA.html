power behind its future 1+5
Samsung breeches Orbitz iris scanner
issues even if it's still trying to
figure it out makes you see you 11 has
begun its - around the United States
I'm Hina Iveta and this any of you
spoils the new alien movie for me before
I watch it I will ignore your comments
for the recap man I'm serious
this is PocketNow daily official news
today begin with deals the LG tone
studios or wons favourite headset up
till the point where I saw that guy a
few days ago and he wears them
permanently I love my tone studios as
well they're currently on Amazon for 155
bucks that is a crazy deal for
everything you're getting I highly
recommend it other interesting news has
to do with the brand new HTC link BR we
just heard Google telling us at Google
i/o that HTC would be one of the
partners for standalone VR the link VR
is pretty much it I believe because
first of all you're not putting your
phone on your face that is awesome it's
what I loved about the LG 360 VR you're
using USB C to connect to your you 11
that is awesome we should be expecting
this link PR very soon and apparently
what you're getting is a 3.5 inch
display on the screen 1080p so certainly
read 1080 by 1200 I think this is going
to be awesome I can't wait to give it a
try
and speaking of HTC let's talk about the
U 11 as you know the company didn't
really sell the 10 and carriers in the
United States last year the U 11 is
making it to sprint and it's starting a
tour very soon so for those of you
interested in wanting to hold this phone
and squeeze whatever you want out of it
it's going to be available in sprint
stores for you to do that I really like
the phone so far since I started my
review period so yeah I'll give it a
check out now let's talk about Samsung
yesterday we discussed the problems with
the our scanner Samsung today brush
things off by telling us that well
getting a camera that can do that
infrared imagery is very difficult to
find because they're no longer sold and
that printing and infrared is also not
easy and the fact that it's actually
also not easy to get the customer to
want to give you a photo of their iris
and the contact lens there right it's
very
difficult for you to get all these
things but that doesn't mean it's not
possible so yeah we'll see and finally
the very hot because if they have to do
with the one plus five in a recent forum
post for the company tells us everything
about its power the fact that the
Snapdragon 835 blazes and that it's
addressing the touch latency issues with
these high-speed cameras to be able to
verify if there is or isn't because
according to them there isn't any
benchmarks to verify this and they're
actually right there aren't but anyways
it leads me to the question of the day I
mean for those of you that own the one
plus three or one plus three T that you
ever have touch latency issues because I
dealt with a few problems with the
display being unresponsive for the
notification shade but it rarely
happened on the oneplus 3 didn't have
any problems with celebra 3t leave us a
comment down below we listen on your
experience friends you know the way it
