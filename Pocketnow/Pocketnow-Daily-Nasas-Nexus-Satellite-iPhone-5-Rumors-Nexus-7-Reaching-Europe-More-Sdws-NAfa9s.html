the nexus 7 reaches more countries and
eighties vacation signal iphone 5 I'm hi
Mary vetta and this is parking out daily
yeah I know what you're thinking at
first I thought it was an april fool's
joke but this is not april and this is
definitely not a joke NASA is actually
sending a smartphone-based satellite
into space at first don't be sending
phone set one point oh that's based on
google nexus one hardware three year old
hardware and then there will be sending
phone set to point o based off the Nexus
S to see if they survive going over
there and coming back now the reason why
this makes sense is obviously because
well sending space shows the space in
the past would cost millions of dollars
and this time these Nexus based
satellites will only cause NASA 3500
bucks I just wish I understood why NASA
is always so far behind when it comes to
tech the Nexus 7 which is Google's only
tablet and probably the only android
tablet we'd recommend is currently being
sold in more countries in Europe as of
today countries like Spain Germany and
France will now be able to purchase the
device on the Google Play Store but
obviously there's a catch that we can
understand why European countries have
to pay more for their gadgets as us
customers only pay one hundred ninety
nine dollars for the tablet and European
customers will pay 199 arrows for that
same device you guys know this is not
the same exchange rate for those of you
that we're doubting the reports of
Verizon canceling all vacations for
their employees from September 21st to
the 30th think again reports have ATT
doing exactly the same thing with their
employees on exactly the same dates so
this does fall in line with the recent
rumors that probably Apple will announce
their iphone 5 on September 12 and we
will see sales beginning on sep tember
21st hopefully that will be the case so
time will tell LG has also been making a
lot of buzz lately with their optimus G
this new super phone from LG plans to
bring a different type of display that's
totally unique in comparison to every
other display in the market we already
know that LG is famous for their IPS
technology with the ipad and iphone so
we could just hope to see something good
coming from LG finally I just wish their
past products said the same because we
currently have rumors of an LG intuition
coming to verizon that's the Optimus Vu
that was announced at mwc and that's
precisely the catch the fact that it was
announced at mwc and we still
don't have a device and finally we all
know that Apple won their case against
Samsung last week over the patent
infringement issues between the galaxy
lineup and the iOS lineup but the
interesting part is that the jury did
not rule in favor of Apple in the case
of tablets so even though Apple made
more than a billion dollars over
smartphones the samsung galaxy tab 10.1
is pretty much free to be sold but Apple
paid more than two million dollars for
the infringement so let's see if the
jury ends up letting go the tablet
because currently that's still being
locked up now if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow was on pocketnow.com
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm haim every better
