early releases are out and running on
our iPad air 2 and Nexus 9 so let's see
how Apple's next generation software
looks next to Google's I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is a
quick first look at i/o s9 vs. Android M
boot them up and you're looking at the
usual static grid vs. customizable
canvas stop me if you've heard this one
before but we all know the basic
differences between these interfaces
let's see how the major improvement
stack up first multitasking Apple has
largely been playing catch-up to Android
and in this respect it's managed to
simultaneously copy it and leap frogging
copy part first
despite the 90 degree offset note how
similar the iOS app ribbon now is to the
Android multitasker with cascading cards
that can be dismissed by swiping them
off the screen it's a pretty shameless
rip but it seems to work fairly well and
here's the Leapfrog bit Apple has also
included native split-screen
multitasking for the first time we've
seen this on android before in the form
of third-party interfaces from Samsung
and others but it hasn't been launched
for stock Android yet on newer iPads
running iOS 9 this takes the form of a
feature called slide over swipe in from
the right side bezel and you get a list
of compatible apps to dock on the right
side you can also continue watching a
video if you decide to take an incoming
notification and on the iPad air 2 you
can run a selection of apps
simultaneously at whatever size you want
the use of the side bezel plus the
similarity to the windows snap feature
reminds me of the better aspects of the
Microsoft Surface
it makes the iPad feel like a much more
capable tablet even in beta form
elsewhere Apple still trying to get on
Google's level Android M includes the
familiar Google now off to the left side
with predictive information tailored to
be useful based on location and time of
day from calendar appointments to travel
times to weather reports to upcoming TV
shows well it's not yet integrated into
this preview build Android M will also
bring Google now on tap which if it
works as advertised will allow for
context-sensitive information too
be called on-demand from whatever's on
the screen at the given moment on the
iPad Apple's new proactive assistant
delivers news headlines app suggestions
nearby points of interest and tells you
when to leave the house if you want to
make your next appointment on time which
again is basically the same thing
Google's been doing for a couple
generations now it's even in the same
place on the leftmost springboard panel
though you can also trigger it with the
more recent downward swipe gesture there
are some cool plugins though if a lot of
videos come back from your search
requests you can watch them right on
this screen and apps can also plug into
Proactiv so you can open search results
within say the Airbnb app directly
instead of being directed to a website
series gotten smarter too using iOS 9 on
an iPhone will eventually let it do cool
things like remind you not to leave your
takeout on top of the car or guess at
who a strange inbound caller might be
she can also read your texts to you and
allow you to reply by voice something
you need a Moto X for on Android but
while series word recognition is better
than ever and her personality as a nice
touch she's still not as versatile as
Google now voice interface often
requiring you to state things in a
stilted and programmatic manner on the
flip side if you need to take a note on
your upcoming travels you'll be able to
do a lot more with Apple's new stock
keyboard while Google has improved its
text selection in Android M Apple brings
new formatting shortcuts and two-finger
scrolling for precision cursor placement
finally how about your privacy androids
app permissions have long been a
sticking point when installing
third-party apps and now in version M
you can approve or deny specific
permissions per app just like you could
on iOS you can also now manage all of
them individually in the app permissions
hub letting you see in one big list how
many apps have access to say your camera
or your microphone well this is great it
hasn't stopped Apple from continuing to
position itself as the privacy advocate
in contrast to the information hungry
Google but that's a talk for another
time for now that's the major stuff
we're gonna keep on soaking up
impressions from Iowa
9 and Android M and we'll be back with
more very soon while you're here see how
well Android devices and iPhones have
aged in our recent episodes of after the
buzz and be sure to visit us at
