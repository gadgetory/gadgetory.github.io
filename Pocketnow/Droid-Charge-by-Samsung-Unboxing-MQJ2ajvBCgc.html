now and today we're going to unbox the
second device available to run on
Verizon's 4G LTE network and today we
have the samsung charge which is the
droid charge for verizon so let's get to
the unboxing
okay so we'll just open up the box near
the school and there we go entire thing
and one easy step a pretty interesting
box gray with the little droid i conned
a verizon is synonymous for and the very
center so let's zoom in a little tiny
bit okay so there we go and let's see
what else does the box have it says that
we have the droid charge by samsung we
have a standard lithium-ion battery a 32
with gigabyte microSD card that comes
pre-installed so that's a great size
card and those are rather expensive we
also have a wall USB charger Product
Safety and all this other stuff this is
running android 2.2 we have the verizon
google and samsung let's open up this
part and see if there's anything else
rule the air and Verizon 4G LTE
certified so let's open up the box and
an exercise device the box is pretty
relative to the size of the device so
we'll just pull out the samsung charge
here and it feels pretty thick so we'll
see how that compares to some other
devices in a few minutes let's see what
else we have some oh very small wall
charger kind of looks like an iphone 4
wall charger which is pretty nice so on
the next side so help you got some
documentation a bunch of documentation
we have our USB micro USB charging sync
cable and it looks as though that's
about it it says the card is
pre-installed on the device itself so
let's go in for a little bit closer look
only power this on we'll be right back
okay so after powering on the droid
charge and the device does have a 1600
ml amp hour battery it was pre installed
because the demo unit and they had to
put all the settings in before they sent
it to us so we have this 4.3 inch super
amoled plus display and it's a pretty
clear I don't know how it compares to
the Super AMOLED here we have a samsung
focus and they look pretty similar
unfortunately on the same graphic right
there but the screen sensitivity is nice
the device feels pretty heavy and quite
thick so if we compare this to a couple
of other devices we can see that the
iphone 4 is much thinner the samsung
charges around 11.2
meters and here we have another device
that has a 4.3 inch display course this
is the hd2 and we only have an LCD on
this screen so you can see how the
screen is a much clearer on the super
amoled plus Samsung charge one thing to
know is when i first started up this
device and put in my google name and
password it did launch an update but it
only updated a two point two point one
the google android froyo version so stay
tuned for the hardware and software
review is where we go through the rest
of the Samsung charge on Verizon's 4G
network and you can pick up this device
for around two hundred and ninety nine
dollars with a qualifying two-year
agreement thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
