the things that were mentioned today are
far beyond cool some of these things are
coming in July with jellybean and others
are coming now if you simply update your
application so I'm high memory letter
with pocketnow.com and we're going to go
through a simple walkthrough up there
update to their Maps application which
now allows you to bring these maps
offline now a lot of things that were
demoed in the video and the keynote
happened on a Galaxy Nexus but for the
purpose of the video we want to show you
that this is available to everyone so
we're going to be using an HTC One X for
this video
maps has been Google's baby for the
longest time so it only makes sense they
do something about it you go into your
Play Store to get your update but you'll
notice that the only thing that's
changed is the fact that you can now
save maps offline so once you go back
into your applications tray and launch
maps you'll notice that the UI hasn't
changed one bit you still get the same
buttons at the top at the bottom for
local services navigation check enjoin
latitude location history and you have
my places but what changes here is that
your offline maps are here at the right
and the way this works is if we go back
to the map you'll notice that you have
now have an option to make the map
available offline so I try to tap here
since I already have a map of Houston in
my favorites you'll notice that I
already have a bar around it that tells
me that the map is already available now
I'm selecting the section that's too
large it'll tell me that it's too large
and it will ask me to zoom in once I've
zoomed in enough it tells me what's the
estimate file size at the bottom and I
could just say done but I've already got
Houston so let's look for another map
let's try New York City for example so
it's moving to New York City and I'll
have to do is move around to the section
where I want to save and I hit make
available offline it tells me that it'll
take 34 megabytes and all I do is hit
done starts downloading the map at the
top and it takes me back to my previous
list now depending on the map and the
details are the amount of file size
that'll take up so for example Houston
274 megabytes
Delaware was points
since I'm Petula where I'm at is 1.3 the
only problem with the service is that
sadly it's not perfect yet there's still
a work in progress for example let's try
to go into layers and select terrain for
example if I wanted to save this map in
terrain it won't work if I tell it that
I wanted to make it available offline
it'll take me back to the typical
section with roads now another thing
that's a work in progress is the fact
that if I let's try to send my phone
into airplane mode you have to bear with
me a little sadly HTC devices take a
little while to go into airplane mode
for some reason it's going going gone
it's finally there you'll notice that
the buttons at the bottom are no longer
active whenever I'm in airplane mode the
map is available let's try to go for
example to Houston which is in my places
offline let's go to Houston and there's
the bar of everything that I have
available offline I could go into the
map move around I can do everything
within Houston but then once I'm there I
can't search for anything
I can't navigate anywhere all the
buttons are not working it'll tell me
that it can't complete the action
without data connection it can take me
to places and it can't offer layers so
you're pretty much stuck with just the
map that works you can see everything
and yes you can hit the button for your
location and will remember where you are
there's something to Siouxland since I
have it available offline that's the
reason why it's there but all I can do
is know where I'm at within the map and
obviously if I hit the button at the top
for the compass the compass doesn't seem
to be working perfectly right now let's
try to for some reason the compass is
not working perfectly right now but you
get the idea that it'll tell you where
you are but that's pretty much the only
reason why the maps available so if
you're out and about and you want to use
this map for navigation if you're in a
place where you don't have data sadly
it's not going to be perfect it's not
going to work but again it's free so
we're not really going to complain about
it that's it for our quick walkthrough a
Google
new maps service don't forget to give us
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
I'm Jaime Rivera thank you very much for
