version of Apple's latest flagship and
this well it's not an iPhone 10s but it
almost is the biggest question we've got
on social medias if it's worth it to
upgrade between the iPhone 10 and the
iPhone 10s and well I think that this is
just one of those years were just the
beta believin call this an upgrade I'm
high amenity that out with pocket now
and this is iPhone 10s vs. iPhone 10
brought to you by the geniuses over a
Twix
so here's the thing who remembers the
last time that Apple had an S year I
mean surely the iPhone 6s looked a lot
like the 7 and then the 7 looked a lot
like the 8 but there were still
differences in between these phones not
significant but at least not as
insignificant as the ones here up to the
point where there's actually no s below
the iPhone as Apple has historically
done the iPhone 10's is literally
identical to its predecessor the same
glass finish and even if Apple claims
that the new one has a stronger glass
than the other there's really no way to
prove it
no grating data of the glass was
provided the same stainless steel that
unless you order in gold will look
identical there's really just the minor
movement of the camera hump which might
make your iPhone 10 case non compatible
but that's only if the camera cutout is
snug to the chassis which I don't really
have a problem with these cases from
Musha which I really love you'll also
notice at the bottom speaker design is
asymmetrical to house another antenna
band and that's about it both have the
same AMOLED panel that Apple dubs it's
super retina which means great color
tuning even for an OLED sacrafice site
you won't be able to tell which is which
unless you look close enough to notice
that the 10 s is a tad warmer than 210
even if both displays continue to be my
favorite for an iPhone Apple claims that
the speakers on the iPhone 10s are
superior to those of the 10 and I won't
say that they're significantly better
but I do notice that the sound is richer
on two 10s than on attend all soaked
lames that face ID is faster and
improved on the 10s when compared to the
10 but after all the testing that I've
done I really cannot tell the difference
I find them both to be just as fast and
I find it fascinating that if you stack
both phones side-by-side and try to
unlock them one will not unlock unless
you look at it and therefore you can't
do both at the same time I tried to do
it in video as much as I could and it's
just not possible to show you
really where these two phones are
dramatically different is on the inside
the iPhone 10s sports the first-ever
seven nanometer architecture on a ship
with its eight twelve Bionic meaning
more power efficiency and faster
performance its ports more RAM at four
gigabytes versus three there's now 512
gigabytes of storage options where the
iPhone 10 only came in 64 and 256 tears
even though these options are also
available on the 10s there's better
water resistance at IP 68 versus IP 67
which is just by a hair and really the
only spot where the iPhone 10 wins is in
having a slightly larger battery which
is compensated by the 10s and its new
chip architecture now will you be able
to tell the difference honestly no I
mean after iOS 12 it is very difficult
Apple did an amazing job at fine-tuning
its mobile operating system up to the
point where even the iPhone 7 plus
performs great you seriously can't lie
through menus on either phone just as
quick and features like 3d touch were
standard across the board this is one of
those rare cases where iOS has no
differences between the newer model and
the older if the new momochi is your
thing it'll work on both all the screen
time enhancements that were praised on
iOS 12 are here and honestly about the
only thing that I liked more about the
10 is having more wallpaper options when
compared to the 10s but that's about it
even in basics like gaming telling
difference is very hard sure the iPhone
10s has the most advanced processor to
date from the architecture perspective
which is slightly noticeable in how fast
it launches a game when compared to the
10 but really you won't be able to tell
the difference once the fraction of a
second is over and you start playing now
an interesting thing happened when we
decided to put both of these phones to
the test when it came to data speeds as
Apple is claiming gigabit LTE speeds on
the iPhone 10s when compared to the 10
and we decided to compare them both on
the same team mobile network on 57th and
7th year in New York City and the
results weren't actually as great as we
were expecting we ran the test with my
buddy David Cogan and sure the iPhone 10
has reached double the data speeds of
the 10 but once we added the samsung
galaxy now
nine to the mix the note nine just
destroyed both devices on the test
it's sad but these Intel modems are
really making Apple look bad here I
highly recommend that you watch David's
full walkthrough of the iPhone 10's for
more details at his channel at the
unlocker and then when it comes to
battery life apple claims that you're
supposed to be getting about an hour
more on the 10s when compared to the 10
but honestly I gave them a try and I
will tell you that there are cases where
the iPhone 10 won the comparison I don't
know exactly if it has to do with tuning
of the radios or what's the problem but
honestly the 10s doesn't have great
battery life by the end of the day you
will be looking for a charger with heavy
use the camera comparison is really
where the 10 s is better than the 10
Apple has made some dramatic
improvements here like bringing larger
microns to the primary camera and also
experimenting with a more enhanced
version of HDR the results are that I do
prefer the iPhone 10 s by a significant
margin I find it faster to take photos
it does a better job at capturing detail
and moving subjects and even if photos
are its head warmer they are more
visually pleasing probably the biggest
improvement is in dynamic range which I
had tribute to the new HDR and then in
low-light photography the 10 s just
demolishes the 10 in far better detail
and less noise when it comes to dark
scenarios
when it comes to portrait photography
the 10 s also has controls to edit a
photo after you've taken it and adjust
the aperture sadly even with this
feature coming out of beta I still don't
like portrait photos on either of these
phones borders are not well determined
and portrait selfies aren't great if you
have more than one subject and speaking
of selfies yes we did notice that there
are some sort of beautifying filters
here used by Apple which the company
hasn't really claimed not sure if it has
to do with the new HDR or that photos
are just warmer but the usual details
that the iPhone 10 would show as shadows
are now gone by comparison with the 10s
in video recording the specs are all the
same the capabilities are the same and
the resulting video I notice is quite
similar if not identical alright those
are still the devices that I recommend
most when it comes to camera
replacements for video and this is where
I can't really determine a winner unless
we have to compare selfie video
recording where I do notice that the
iPhone 10 has a better crop but then the
iPhone 10 S has better stabilization and
far better dynamic range on both videos
but while we reach our conclusion let me
interrupt this video for just 30 seconds
to tell you more about our sponsor Wix
if you're interested in creating a
professional website blog or online
store without any coding knowledge which
offers an insane portfolio of tools for
you to design something that's right for
you and it's all drag-and-drop which is
so practical or you can choose from the
hundreds of templates they offer learn
more about Wix in the links of the
description below to conclude let's just
say that I now understand why Apple is
not selling the iPhone 10 at a lower
price than the iPhone 10's for a second
year the differences on each device are
just so insignificant that it makes no
sense to just keep last year's model for
another year if you're considering
upgrading between an iPhone 10 and a 10
s I sadly don't suggest it the hardware
is the same the software is the same and
absolutely everything else is just a
meagre change unless you're valuing
things like data speeds which also
depend on where
you live or you value things like better
photography which I will tell you the
differences are better with the 10s
that's probably the only reason why I
would ever change from one to the other
just don't say that I didn't warn you if
you go for the change you'll probably
notice that it doesn't really feel like
an upgrade at all folks just like this
