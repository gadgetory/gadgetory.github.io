settle in shopping a smartphone we'll be
testing that edict over the next couple
days but first we have to get this thing
out of the box and set it up we were
sent to reviewers kit which comes in a
cool slider box with a collection of
snap-on cases I'm partial to a lighter
color woodgrain personally a handy quick
car charger is included we have a VR
headset which we'll talk about in a
future video and of course the phone a
cracking open the box the one plus three
greets you from a red insert underneath
which we've got a charger and USB cable
and a container filled with the papers
we should actually read through at some
point while reviewing phones now let's
just peel this backing off but I'll keep
the screen guard on for now we get
alternatingly critical comments as to
whether we should leave those on but I
want to protect the screen while
reviewing this phone so on it stays
firing up the oneplus three first boot
happens fast getting you into the setup
process quickly this might be the
fastest phone we've initially launched
while producing these unboxings getting
the phone up and running is pretty
straightforward
there aren't any strange additional
accounts to log into or create the
fingerprint scanning process is par for
the course and we are happy to see an
always-on sensor below the screen
thankfully the only major additions from
oneplus come in the form of a handful of
gestures you can turn on or disable
before delivering you to the home screen
just a second though this this is a
terrible wallpaper okay that's better
focusing on the initial out-of-the-box
impressions this is a well-built phone
metal construction doesn't wow us like
it used to as there are a number of
really well engineered low-cost metal
phones available these days but oneplus
has delivered an attractive and well
engineered handset many will point to
some HTC inspiration on the shape color
and antenna bands but when compared to
phones like the one m9 the sharper edges
here and gentle tapers here work better
than previous HTC s we've reviewed
there's a shiny track framing the screen
but nothing so bold as the large
chamfers found on the HTC 10 now walking
around the hardware there's nothing
going on with the top of the phone the
right side is home to the power button
in SIM card tray the left is where
you'll find a volume rocker and
three-position mute switch and the
bottom is pretty busy landing the
headphone jack you
Espie type-c connector and the speaker
the 16 megapixel camera sensor is built
into a module which does protrude a fair
distance from the rear of the phone and
which sits above a single LED flash a
front face is dominated by a 5.5 inch
1080p AMOLED display and a terrific
screen to bezel ratio there's not a lot
of wasted space the chin is home to the
fingerprint sensor flanked by capacitive
controls the 1 plus will give you the
ability to activate on-screen controls
if you want them instead something we
wish was a native Android option and the
forehead delivers a small phone speaker
and an 8 megapixel selfie camera oh and
one plus does give us NFC this year so
well done there while this is running a
branded version of Android called oxygen
OS a lot of elements will be familiar to
stock Android users the notification
shade and settings menus are largely
unmolested and I'm delighted to see a
clean simple app drawer organized
alphabetically by default major thumbs
up there
well done 1 + changes to the user
interface come in the addition of a side
panel which users can arrange a vertical
column of widgets and shortcuts and a
handful of gestures vertical slides on
the homescreen can pull notifications or
search the double tap will wake the
screen and drawing commands on the
display when off can fire up a music
player flashlight or the camera though
that's also backed up by a power button
DoubleTap so how does the oneplus 3
perform top-tier specs will always get
our attention but is the software
optimized to take advantage of the
hardware how about the camera or audio
playback oneplus makes a compelling
argument on paper but do we have to
settle on some of those features to
reach this $399 price well you'll just
have to tune back in for our future
videos and our real camera review coming
soon as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel as we have some deep dives
planned for the oneplus 3 and hit that
thumbs up button for a little extra
positive reinforcement for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos bag now some gadget guy
on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
