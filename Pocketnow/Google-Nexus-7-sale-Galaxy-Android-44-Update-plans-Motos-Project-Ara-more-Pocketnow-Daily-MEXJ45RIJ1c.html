android 4.4 kitkat the samsung phones
leaks of metallic parts for a samsung
galaxy s5 begin to surface and
motorola's modular project ah receives
new developments I'm high memory that I
and even though this new office is not
ready yet I couldn't leave you guys on
the weekend without the news this is
PocketNow daily listeners day off with
some official news I know you've seen
all our coverage of the Nokia Lumia 2520
tablet which is a really compelling
actually and the company actually plants
to make this a sweeter deal for you if
you order the tablet from now until
December second you can actually get
that power keyboard for free which is a
very substantial important and actually
cool deal so if you're in the market for
this tablet make sure you order that
tablet now and if you're in the market
for google nexus 7 retailers are
actually planning to give you a better
and sweeter deal than even Google as
they've just dropped the price of the
tablet pretty much the same prices that
we had last year so if you want a 2030
Nexus 7 right now you can go to ebay
amazon and best buy and get it for two
hundred dollars and 16 gigabytes you can
also get it for two hundred forty
dollars and 32 gigs which is probably
one of the sweetest deals you'll
probably see all year I wouldn't even
wait for black friday so move quick now
let's talk about motorola and they're
interesting project ara as the company
has just hired a new 3d printing company
to be in charge of building the frame
the skeleton the chassis and the
enclosure of this phone so for those of
you non-believers I thought this project
was not going to happen it actually
seems that the company is full steam
ahead would it would just don't know
exactly when we're getting it and what
the success of the Moto X's lukewarm
success in the Moto G actually making
some disruptive changes in pricing but
see what we get from this project now
for those of you interested in android
4.4 kitkat on your current galaxy phone
well samsung is pretty much leaked the
information right now we pretty much
know that you'll get it on the galaxy s4
and Galaxy Note 3 in january 2014 which
is actually a cool date and then you can
also get it on the galaxy s3 and Galaxy
Note 2 between march and april of 2014
which are decent dates even though
you're getting the galaxy s5 probably in
may of 2014 as well still this is for
unlocked phones so we're not really sure
what to expect for the US carrier
that we all have and finally for the
interesting news of the day we've got
some leaked photos of a metallic frame
for the future galaxy s5 as the rumors
and the leaks are talking about which is
really interesting since most of us
remember the leaks of the galaxy f
project remember you've got enough the
whole thing apparently Samsung is not
really going to bring this for the
project f apparently they are working on
keeping the galaxy s name though we're
still not sure but still that leads you
to the question of the day what do you
think of Samsung ditching the plastic
designs that they currently have over
metal I mean in my particular case I do
love the build quality of metal but I
won't lie i do love that sort of leather
texture of the galaxy note 3 so much
that i wish that the galaxy s5 would
bring this but he was a comment down
below what do you think and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is still
make sure you follow us on parking out
comment subscribe tell youtube channel
as well you can also follow me on
twitter Jaime underscored iveta please
give this video thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am happy that I thank you
very much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
