what you're shopping for this fall
LG might have just the thing for you for
pocket now i'm michael fisher at Aoife
2015 in Berlin here with a quick look at
the LG G pad - 10.1 well it's an Android
tablet so there's only so many surprises
we can expect right neither the 1920 by
1200 display nor the Snapdragon 800
processor is cutting-edge the 16 gigs of
on-board storage will fill up fast and
on paper the 5 and 2 megapixel cameras
are there but the cheap ad 2 wasn't
built to deliver on specs rather it was
meant to fulfill customer demands for a
larger screen bigger battery and faster
performance whether LG succeeded in that
latter ambition remains to be seen we
only spent a few minutes with the
android 5.1.1 build here but the screen
is bloody big especially taking into
account LG's dual window multitasking
and the 7400 milliamp hour battery is
nothing to sneeze at
also there's microSD expansion alongside
the built-in 4G support and IR
transmitter for TV control stereo
speakers on the edges and the tablet is
plenty thin and light at 7.8 millimeters
and 489 grams respectively in fact it's
light enough that holding it in
landscape with one hand really isn't a
problem it's a very comfortable device
pricing is yet to be officially
announced but LG says it shouldn't be
any more expensive than its predecessor
was at release this is just an initial
hands-on we'll be taking a closer look
at the LG G pad 2 10.1 if the
opportunity presents itself in the weeks
ahead for much more from Aoife 2015 stay
tuned to pocket now here on YouTube and
at pocketnow.com until next time this
has been michael fisher from berlin
captain to phones on twitter thanks for
watching we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
