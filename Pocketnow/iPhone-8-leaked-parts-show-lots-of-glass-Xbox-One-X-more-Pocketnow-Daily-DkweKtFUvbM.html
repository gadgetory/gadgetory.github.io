have emerged and yes they are all made
of glass some concept designs try to
school Samsung on the design that it
should bring to the Galaxy Note 8 and
TCL responds to how the BlackBerry key
one is in handling ventus well i'm hilah
Iveta reporting on my lunch break from
seattle and i agree i need to do my bed
letter for the next one
this is foggy now daily the official
news today begin with product launches
as honor has just announced the honored
nine and we were really anticipating
this phone it looks a lot like the honor
eight but with some curves at the back
and we've got that kara 960 processor in
addition to options for four or six
kilobytes of RAM starts at 64 128 gigs
of storage and in addition to that it
brings the camera combo that we love
from the huawei v10 at least in specs so
he had this is pretty much one of those
premium mid-range errs that is anything
but a premium mid-range err can't wait
to tell you more as soon as we get into
the labs now let's talk about TCL as we
saw the durability test by jerry-rigged
everything where the BlackBerry key ones
display pretty much came off and
according to TCL they have just
confirmed that number one they're
working hard to figure out what's
causing this number two of you have any
problems of the key one you could just
call them up and they'll send you over
placement due to warranty so yeah don't
go playing around with that key one but
in everything else that phone is awesome
now some of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 as
we've seen some renders here and there
put the phone might look like today
we've got some fan base renders these
schematics are actually not real they're
trying to school Samsung over how the
design should be first of all you notice
that the speakers are at the top and the
bottom number two we see the vertical
cameras at the back and we see I think
the LED flashes on each side and then
the fingerprint scanner at the bottom of
that because the s Samsung if you want
your phone to be aesthetically pleasing
without being a complete craziness just
to reach the fingerprint scanner that's
probably the way to do it craziness that
sounded weird I'll talk about the new
Xbox one X that just got announced today
it is pretty much an evolution to the
Xbox one
so whatever accessories you currently
have will still continue working with it
you can learn more about specifications
in the description because there are a
ton of teraflops being mentioned there
that I'm not going to go crazy for
what's most important is the super
sampling feature that trusts a big
better performance if you're using a
1080p display so it's great to see
Microsoft working hard on evolving the
Xbox one the only problem is you'll have
to wait until November 7 and finally the
very hot news is they have to do with
some leaked images or some probable
parts of the iPhone 8 first of all that
front no bezels at the bottom and the
top looks like the essential phone fine
that makes a lot of sense then the back
is made of glass and it's got that
cutout for the vertical camera do we
like it or don't we like it I could say
that I do I just think that we're too
early on to actually judge these to be
real or not but it leads me to the
question of today let us know in the
comments do you think these parts look
great or not again I like them I just I
hate this evolution to glass I just
broke my Galaxy s8 I had broken the
Galaxy a7 edge last year why don't we
just stick to another form of material
that doesn't break so easily please
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get the
news earlier before the videos filmed
but one final comment hit that subscribe
button down below for more videos like
this one it also follow me on twitter
hime underscore Torre that I run into
the grandma time elevator please give
this video a thumbs up if you like what
you saw I am hein but we've got to thank
so much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
