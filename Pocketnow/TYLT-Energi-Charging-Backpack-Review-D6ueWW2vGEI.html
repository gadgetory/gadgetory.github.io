pocket now so many that we can't always
get around to them during the work week
enter swag bag Sundays quick videos
giving you a quick look at some of the
accessories that cross our review desk
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
today we're taking a look at a product
that charges your gadgets while it
carries them the tilt Energy Plus
backpack
courtesy of ZTE style wise the energy
plus is more subdued than the typical
tilt product but it's still got the
company's signature touches of color
both outside and in there are six major
compartments not counting the external
headphone and hydration pockets and
plenty of sub compartments inside most
of the larger Bay's which makes for a
total of 13 major sections still the
backpack is on the compact side so
probably the most you're gonna be able
to jam in is one night set of clothes
alongside your computer the bag will
accommodate laptops up to 15 and a half
inches and it's got hidden features to
appeal to the techie and traveler alike
an NFC tag embedded in the shoulder
strap a trolley slot in the backpack
panel and flight through friendly design
for lay flat scans at the airport what
gives the energy plus its name is an
embedded ten thousand four hundred
milliamp hour battery pack that lives in
a dedicated pouch in the back
compartment on paper that's good for
about five full recharges of the iPhone
6 but it's not just charging one device
it's got three USB outputs a single two
amp port for tablets and dual one app
ports for phones and three cables
included or you can choose your own USB
wires if you want to color code if it
stopped there this would be just like my
normal backpack which always has an X
Storm 11,000 battery living inside and a
rat's nest of cables connecting it to my
various phones but the energy plus is
clever
it's got ports and tunnels snaking their
way through the bags guts letting you
channel power to whatever compartments
you want my configuration is the one
suggested on the included template the
high amp power goes to the large tablet
compartment while one of the phone
cables goes into the smartphone and
sunglass chamber and the final one ends
in the large center section you can even
run an external wire if you want for
topping up your phone while you use it
not forgetting the headphones and when
you need to charge the bags battery pack
you guessed it there's a trapdoor for
that too just plug it right into a
computer or a 2 amp wall adapter and
give it an overnight soaked it's a great
design but the energy plus also has some
big shortcomings like I said it's too
small for anything more than an
overnight trip especially if you're
packing wintertime clothes also the very
first time I put it on the right-hand
shoulder strap tore right off I thought
I got a lemon at first but according to
Amazon reviews I'm not alone in my build
quality complaints and frankly 160
dollar price tag is just too high I
could buy an extra m---eleven thousand
and a spigen 15 inch backpack separately
for less and I'd be getting a waterproof
bag to boot so the tilt energy plus is a
clever attractive design Sulli to buy a
build quality problem and a too high
price tag it deserves credit for how
smartly it solves the tangled cords and
backpacks problem and to be honest I'll
probably use it for a trade show or two
because it's quite handy is a portable
power reserve but I only fully recommend
it if you can personally test its
durability first and/or find it on sale
thanks to ZTE for our demo device of the
tilt Energy Plus backpack and thanks to
