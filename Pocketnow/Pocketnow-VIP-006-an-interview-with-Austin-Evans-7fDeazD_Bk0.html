everyone and welcome to episode 6 of the
pocket now VIP the interview series
where the technology itself takes a
backseat so that we can get to know the
people who report on it I'm Michael
Fisher editorial director at pocket now
and today I'm joined by a mainstay of
the YouTube technology circuit a
discerning reviewer of Technology and
one of the youngest looking people I've
ever talked about what's really low
that's low low it's a compliment where a
youth-obsessed culture okay the
redoubtable Austin Evans welcome to the
show sir henry begun yesterday thanks
for having me looking forward to talking
all kinds of VIP stuff let's Jeff this
is the first VIP thing anyone's ever
called me before so to the front and
you've been you've been labeled a VIP
yeah yeah true you and I have been to
many Samsung events together we're
always VIPs of those things that's a
good point yeah it's usually like a kick
to add VIP things though not brought
into them so right and that's true just
as a reminder to first-time viewers of
the VIP this is our chance to get to
know Austin both at work and and
hopefully outside of the confines of his
studio so if you if you have questions
for Austin I believe we have
successfully enabled the the Q&amp;amp;A panel
along the side just submit them and
we'll do our best to get to as many as
we can later on you're open to you've
got about 45 minutes for us there Austin
oh absolutely yeah sweet yeah I'm very
much looking forward to this let's uh
let's let's do some background I've had
a bunch of people on the show before and
I usually like to go over how we met if
we've met in person and that's not
always something that's happened but you
and I met the same way I met marques
which was do you remember yeah so is
that the galaxy s3 was the US launch I
guess it was I think it was yeah because
I had already spent some time with the
international one and then they invited
us there and that it's weird because I
think that was one of my first
excursions ever but I was surrounded by
people who had done this a whole lot
longer than i had and even at the time i
was struck by it was like austin looks
like I mean Austin looks like he's like
like 16 how old were you awake point I
was
20 i think 19 or 20 something like that
yeah Wow and at that point so we were we
were there with Marquez we were with
Lamarr Wilson and Ryan Bates and a
number of other people we had a really
nice time talking to everybody who's
kind of behind the gs3 launch we had a
wonderful experience there but I
remember having a talk with you and you
showed me your Twitter feed at some
point and I had was just starting at
pocket now and yeah I was like hey what
do you guys like eleven thousand
followers oh man I have 300 so well
that's different oh yeah yeah that was
like what was that almost two years ago
this would have been it was the summer
of of 2012 yeah yeah wow you've grown
like a whole lot since then I want to
kind of get to your specs here in a
second but first I have a question that
I've sort of been dying to know since
that summer and I've never here we go
yeah now can you predict it because i
don't know uh Austin not Duncan okay
let's do it okay look how many times
have you been asked this I'm 1,700 about
about yeah okay so Austin not Duncan is
technically you're isn't your YouTube
handle it's your it's your twitter
handle it's all of it my Twitter my
Instagram handle it's kind of what I'm
yeah most of my social stuff but youtube
is Austin Evans but yeah austin not
Duncan is kind of everywhere where I
couldn't get Austin Evans okay and so I
mean is this a reaction to a long period
in your life where people inexplicably
called you Duncan for no reason you
wanted to make it clear well there's
definitely a reason because that was my
name for pause the first four years or
so of being on YouTube or may not quite
four years but for the huge chunk of my
first start on YouTube everyone knew me
as Duncan 3630 three and the funny thing
was especially back you know two
thousand nine or so when I first got
started there was no way to change your
username at all nowadays not taking
advantage of this but I'm you can use
like google plus you link up with your
google+ account you can change your name
but a beginning there was no changing
and I had had Duncan as like an old
internet user name for practically no
reasons just I just had it there because
I was I want to be anonymous
on the internet and I use my real name
that worked out well for me so it was a
completely random choice I mean justjust
Duncan you kind of picked it out of the
air and then my friend picked it out
when we were like I'm probably like 10
years older so we were first both
getting on the air and add would like
are gonna be cool super secret less
let's go up with fake names and yeah is
kind of kind of holla when it just kind
of stuck but um it is a lot of people
got trapped in that in that same area
like I have a different youtube channel
that has a completely inexplicable brand
name because I chose it like a decade
ago on the internet and then jon
rettinger picked John for lakers and
that's what technobuffalo was for the
longest time so yeah word that's a
that's a common story I understand that
so you decided to rectify at one point
though when ya which brands yeah I was
about I don't know middle of last year
so I was like I was talking with
companies getting sponsor all this kind
of stuff and it looks really bad like I
think the moment I really realized it I
was signing a contract and on top of it
said Duncan presa 303 Mike okay no this
is this has gotta stop I've gotta fix
this yeah so then you've elected though
to preserve some semblance of it when
you when you you chose Austin not Duncan
because you couldn't as Austin Evans is
not the most uncommon name so a lot of
people were some people were squatting
yeah oh yeah yeah so I was able to get
austin Evans on google+ because i was
one of the first people because they eat
only they only opened up like where you
could get your own name or your own
custom URL not too long ago so they will
jump on that one but a facebook just
flat-out shut me down so it's still
Duncan over there I couldn't change even
it to austins or anything at all yeah
someone already had yes someone sorry
squatting the Twitter luckily someone
from YouTube someone had registered the
Austin Evans but they gave it to me
because they had used it in oil and yeah
so I was able to get it a couple places
at least that's excellent yeah we have a
similar Facebook problem we're still
pocketnow.com on facebook we look like a
look at 2002 you know an auction house
or something we want to get the dot-com
off there but we can't change it so yeah
it's pretty rough you have in the space
that you play in and we'll talk about
this in a second you've got you know
your colleagues you've got mark watson
is soldierknowsbest
you've got marques brownlee is mkbhd
what made you just decide that you to
bran defy your name I mean did you ever
consider doing a name of making the
channel you know giving it its own brand
or did you always want to make the name
in the brand one so the thing that you
gotta understand about my channel is I
went into it with absolutely zero plan
like the the channel name itself is back
from 2007 I just created the youtube
channel just so I can subscribe to
people because I was coming back you
know has first kind of discovering
YouTube all the way back in two thousand
seven like really having a good time I
kept like wanting to come back to
people's channel so i just i just made a
channel he's my standard internet user
name that i had used for years and it
was fine and great but back in two
thousand nine i was working with a
friend of mine and we had been well he
was creating a site and i was kind of
doing some work for him he convinced me
to do some video stuff so I was like
okay well I have a channel upload to it
didn't really think twice about it a
bell I know maybe two or three squeaks
and after I had actually had like a few
videos there a few of them had actually
done well I was like no this Duncan a
nice try to get rid of that like hmm now
I've got like 120 subscribers I'm never
gonna get more than that they deserve
some consistency that's a lot of people
yeah yeah so I mean I didn't have any
plan for it so I just you know stuck
with the name I have a few times i kind
of consider changing it but I mean
especially once I got any kind of you
know reasonable mass subscribers the
only way to change the name was really
to just kill the channel and go and try
everyone to move over to a new one which
would have been flying my head and 20
subscribers but you know a year or two
it when I had a thousand two thousand
five thousand that was it was like two
years at work out and watch throw away
so yeah about last year I decided okay
you know I need to get rid of this
pretty much the only kind of idea cuz
i'm usually not really not that great
with names it's like okay well let's see
if I just get Austin Evans and just go
with it and luckily I was able to get on
YouTube in a couple places and it's
worked it has work it's worked quite
well because i mean the the search part
of the autofill when your type in austin
e and it will auto complete with evans
and then there's a whole bunch of
numbers after after your name and points
his lost and Evans 200 300 600 and get
to that in a second but while we're
talking about numbers you have
considerably more than 5,000 subscribers
now you're at 440,000 subscribers more
than 60 mm
views total across 500 plus videos how
did we get here uh it was there a moment
at which you saw was there a particular
video that gave you astronomical growth
and and launched you into the partner
program or was this just kind of a
steady slow build over over the years
that is definitely the steady thing I
mean I think my first viral video was
actually was a the galaxy s3 i did a
galaxy s3 vs. iPhone 5 like speed test
and I got picked up by mashable got like
five hundred thousand views the first
date but that was after I've been doing
YouTube for over four years so it was
definitely not one of those big like you
know I post like a video with like a
giant iphone phone bill and I have a
million subscribers raising like that it
was definitely one of those you know
long slow burns I mean I think it took
me about a year before I got partner
back when getting partners actually a
big deal I think I like this how you
subscribers you had to qualify but yeah
either did know a lot of you poops to be
a partner back in the day yeah they turn
me down actually the first time I
applied my videos were really really bad
you know at the beginning but yeah i got
i guess straight up turned down and
finally when i got around to doing it a
second time after about a year they were
like okay well this guy's got a million
views so i guess we should maybe let him
in it's so that's not the the first time
I've heard that I think it was Marquez
heard a similar story and I've heard it
from others too and Google if you've
spent if you've been on YouTube a long
time you know that it used to be this no
compromise thing like if you got kicked
out of whatever programmer you got
denied admittance there was no
reapplying it was just like no whatever
we're gonna ignore you forever now but
no i mean it's it's really great to see
that that's matured along with YouTube
as a whole and now it's like no ill will
reconsider it you know some of the later
on and look what happened to you I mean
now you've got to a very very successful
place as a result of their change in
policy so I think that's really cool
yeah definitely i remember it was such a
exciting time I got the email because
especially like when I first signed up
for partner just like two months for
them to just to finally go through my
application and then they turned it down
and you know three or four months later
I tried again like a month or so later I
got the email like you've been accepted
I remember that was probably like the
happiest day because like 17 something
like that I was like on the ceiling like
I can't believe I'm just gonna make
money off of this and that
that it was it was crazy but yeah that
was definitely that ranks up there with
one of those top days of you know of my
life and kind of weird to think that a
lot of the people who are starting on
YouTube now they'll never really quite
get that moment because it's just like
okay partner everyone I mean YouTube
partners not even really a term anymore
so kind of weird to think about that it
is it's very strange i do you remember
getting your first like check in the
mail but I remember like the the journey
from partner to to getting the check for
me was like my father always gave me
this really nice advice he's like yeah
it's good to get excited about stuff but
wait until you can catch the yeah yeah
oh yeah I definitely remember that I got
my first check and i bought a nintendo
dsi with it i remember i was so excited
was barely enough to get the the dsi got
like I think the pokemon game or
something with it I was so excited and
yeah it was it was pretty crazy yeah
it's it's amazing it's it's a very very
cool thing and I love hearing like the
moment now but question you got the
check you were able to buy ad yes okay
cool but I doubt at that point you you
realize that you could make a serious
living off of this right i mean or did
you did you immediately start thinking
like how do i grow this as quickly as
possible and and make it as successful
as possible was it still a hobby at that
point yeah well i mean the thing is
YouTube came in a really good time in my
life because it was near right around 16
17 where I normally would be getting a
job but because i had this and I you
know I've been pretty much working on
like a job you know since i first
started those constantly cranking videos
out even what I wasn't getting paid but
when I did get partner pretty much me I
was able to get about what I would be
getting at a part-time job soon as i got
partner after a year or so so I was like
17 like oh wow thousand dollars a month
oh yeah let's do this I'm good yeah yeah
actually exactly yeah I was I was super
excited about it so it worked but um no
I mean I I always kind of knew even when
i first started kind of like in the back
of my head that yeah you can't make
money off of this and it'd be cool but
it was never something I was like okay
you know and two years I need to be
making xpad dollars i want to you know
you'll make a full time job it was never
anything like that it was just kind of
like oh that'll be nice if maybe I could
make that happen someday but it wasn't
like some kind of concrete plan right
thing is that what what is it has become
I mean is this your your full time gig
now making Austin Evans videos oh yeah
yeah so I mean it's funny because
nothing has really changed I mean I
still spend the same amount of time
working on videos as I did you know five
years ago but uh yeah it's enough for me
to live my own place and buy all the
kinds of tech gear that you have to and
uh yeah well that's awesome
congratulations on that by the way and
it's very nice where you was was that
your situation even when I when I met
you two years ago I mean how long have
you has it been your principal source of
income uh yeah pretty much the entire
time because you know at the time I was
living with my parents so it was it was
pretty much like free money I didn't
have to go pay rent or anything but yeah
uh yeah it's been premature my full-time
job the whole time the only difference
is I just moved out you know bought a
car and all I kind of fun adult kind of
stuff crazy adults yeah yeah the fun
grown-up living exactly what dumb let's
talk about your channel a little bit
because you have a variety of focuses
you go from from like PC builds to
gaming reviews to mobile and not that
this is necessarily a unique cocktail
you know they all they all kind of
interlock and we see a lot of channels
maintaining that that kind of diverse
focus but do you have a sector that you
prefer to cover is their site is there a
particular type of video that when
you're filming or like this is my
favorite thing to do I like it better
than either of the others yeah I
actually kind of like the new kind of
thing I'm moving into which is kind of
more mainstream stuff so I've been doing
actually for about a year zone out top 5
videos which I'll you know round up like
top five worst phones ever it's my most
popular video on my channel like a milli
and a half use it could be like top five
coolest things at CES which is what I
did last month I mean that's those are
the kind of videos to get me say right
now but the thing about my channel is
that changes pretty much every like six
months I mean when I first started out
on youtube i was doing iphone app
reviews i was doing iphone jailbreaking
stuff back when that was you know a big
deal sure but one of the things yeah it
was awesome back that yeah but one of
the things I've always tried to do with
my channel is I never ever ever want to
get locked into one particular segment
now something is working at the time
like some sample gaming pcs like I
doing that more than you know maybe two
years ago but right now something that
really enjoy doing something that the
audience really enjoys watching so I'm
absolutely going to do it but I don't
want to consider myself to be a gaming
PC channel or a gaming pc guy I want to
be you know doing whatever works and you
know as kind of you know trends kind of
go up and down I don't want to be locked
into something so I'm always ready to go
oh I'm going to do some more kind of
mainstream stuff like top fives people
like that I like that okay and start
focusing on that people want to see one
gaming stuff okay I'll focus on that you
want some mobile stuff so I've always
tried to kind of just keep it kind of
fluid and work on whatever people are
most interested in and I'm most
interested in that makes a lot of sense
i was going to be a challenge for
branding though I mean unfortunately you
did not choose a particular brand name
that confines you to one thing like you
didn't you know four years ago decide to
be like you know smartphone tech review
become calm you know thank you that yeah
exactly yeah I mean it's pretty much I
mean my audience has been great i mean
they pretty much support I mean they're
done I don't I get me don't get me wrong
like if my audience doesn't like a video
I'm not going to continue making that
series like usually I'll start out with
a couple and they always give me great
feedback if it's good y'all continue
making it they don't like it I'll stop
so I mean I don't want to try to say
like I'm forcing my audience around or
anything I mean they've been very very
helpful in supportive but it's pretty
much been just like whatever is it I
kind of impatient about kind of tends to
kind of come across the screen and
people who you might not have actually
cured while gaming pcs they started
watching my channel they see me start
doing videos and talking about it and
you know see me being excited and kind
of showing it off and maybe they might
get an interest in gaming PCs and kind
of come over to the fold and every time
can switch to channel around a little
bit a lot of times people just come
right along and just happy to see
whatever kind of new tech I'm talking
about see now that surprises me because
I i think that there's a stigma around
the YouTube audience that it is a fickle
mean-spirited bunch and I don't think
that's I think that's not true at all
but certainly it was true at one point
and I think that reputation is stuck
with it but I would not have expected
you to say even today that you you're
able to change your channel around and
change the focus you know every half
year or so and have people come along
with you i would think that no matter
how compelling a host you were that
people would just kind of be like now
whatever i don't really care about this
i'm leaving but that's not the case well
I mean definitely is the case to extend
you know roughly about ten percent of my
subscribers every month like you know
they kind of roll over so you know
people are definitely leaving but I
think the thing that's made it work for
me is that I've never tried to sell
myself as you know a gaming channel or a
you know a mobile channel or whatever
it's always just been a tech channel and
pretty much everything I do even I'm
switching around from this to that it's
still tech and people really don't
necessarily maybe even pay attention or
even really care that oh I'm not doing
quite some unit these videos I'm
starting to do more of these it's all
kind of just interesting tech content so
I've never tried to frame it in a way
where hey subscribe because I'm gonna do
gaming PC builds every day or anything
like that it's always just been
subscribe for more tech stuff you want
some more tech stuff tech stuff so
that's the kind of the way that it's
works for me at least that makes a lot
of sense I understand that well that's
that's good i mean it's congratulations
on that prescient decision to make your
branding you know a little bit broader i
have a question about the top five list
specifically and then I'll kind of get
out of this but we are seeing something
of the beginnings I think of a backlash
against lists thanks to the the BuzzFeed
saturation of facebook you know we're
you know 17 ways you can make your paper
clips but live more like ours you know
it's like that kind of yes but people
still eat up lists but have you seen any
kind of degradation in in your in your
audience on the list stuffer is the
quality of that of the commentary on
those lists a little bit more aggressive
because because it draws in more people
or what is just how's the top 5 thing
affected your your channel other than
driving traffic yeah so definitely one
of the big things is top fives or at
least the way I do them are very
difficult to make like I mean I've
actually been working off the last two
days I'm hoping to you know kind of
finish it up today but they're
definitely the videos well game pc
videos also take a lot of the build
stuff but there were definitely the kind
of the the kind of the halo kind of
brand thing where i spent all the time
trying to polish and make it really good
i think the thing is people really just
like to see like if i start especially
in a video form i say ok top five you
know best video game consoles of all
time people gotta start watching along
the way they go oh i used to have one of
those oh I knew that and kind of keep
them interested in into the
and because every wants no well what's
the number one even if they disagree
with you that's fine but they're guys
stick around they're going to be
interested and the way that the YouTube
algorithms are set up if you can kind of
keep someone watching a video for a
longer time it helps get more views
because YouTube obviously wants people
to watch videos for longer so it kind of
is just a self-perpetuating loop where
you get more views YouTube likes you you
do and just kind of work your way up so
I know there's definitely i've seen this
fish in the last couple months some of
that starting to dip down just a little
bit because a lot of people are doing
top fives and top tens and all that kind
of stuff but uh for the foreseeable
future I still think it's something that
totally viable for my channel sweet I
want to ask you we've had of you know
your channel has experienced almost no
interruption in in traffic but that is
not because you've not had a big life
event yeah yeah so I know that you've
talked a lot about this recently and I
know that a lot of people know about it
but I was finding if we were doing the
podcast yesterday the pocket net weekly
and I was surprised to find that not
everyone had heard this yet so just to
cover our bases can you can you describe
your your house burned down right yeah
pretty much pretty much yeah it was uh
about actually three weeks ago since
kind of that yeah I was uh it was crazy
I mean it was i was living in an
apartment and was I don't get whole
story I'm sure a lot of people have
heard it but I was on I was in an
apartment on the top floor and someone
couple floors below me they had
something like a heat or something
caught on fire the whole building went
up completely lost the entire way
through I was able to get out with you
like bits is like paperwork and a laptop
and my phone so yeah it's been a it's
been an interesting couple weeks it has
and what what made that most interesting
to me was because I showed up in my
subscription feed as you often do but
the thumbnail was not the usual you know
cooling fan with neon accents or or
smartphone casing it was the side of a
building on fire and I was like wow for
real and then I watched your summation
and I you know of course everybody was
blown away by this none more than you
but I think your audience certainly
certainly was was more than sympathetic
but then even more interestingly would
when did you go back was it the next day
yeah it was the next day so i was there
i filmed like cuz I'm you know me
youtuber to me now I watch my house
burned down of course I got to record it
a little bit but uh but yeah I went back
the next day after they put the fire out
and so you know me and some other of my
neighbors were trying to walk around and
see if we can find anything and so yeah
I was like because actually the what it
happened was because I was such a crazy
day with you know talking to fire
department and this and that trying to
work everything out and I finally got
home that night and checked Twitter and
just you know my Twitter just
unbelievably like I said in the video
you guys had actually broken my Twitter
just from everyone tweeting me and
everybody would another fresh right he
wouldn't yeah I wouldn't go all the way
down I said to go grab my laptop search
on twitter at Austin that Duncan to
actually scroll and the page was like
freezing up every time I load another
one it was like a couple thousand tweets
at least but uh but a couple of the
people who had actually we're tweeting
me is like hey I'm sorry that happened
but you should totally go over tomorrow
and record you trying to find stuff I
read them like that's a great idea I
should totally do that because I knew I
had to do some kind of video because I
knew as you know as much as I wanted to
I had I had an iphone and a laptop I was
not going to be able to go back to
nearby full tech videos for a little
while so I had to do some kind of idiots
plain people hey this happened you know
many little time to catch up but uh I
was just a great idea a couple people
had tweeted me I was like okay I gotta
do it and so I went over there and kind
of dug around a little bit but I
shouldn't say we'll find a couple cool
things but nothing your head that was
still functioning at a bird in water
that had been burned but it still worked
you had a computer casing that you were
able to find because they'd already
bulldozed it right so that the fire
damage had been compounded by structural
damage from the from the bulldozer right
exactly yes I think what it happen was
that I guess the firefighters have been
there all night and they kept seeing
little bits of hot spots to kind of
popping up so they're tired of fry from
that hose them down so they just got ya
bulldoze are just kind of often all over
which I should kind of sucked because
after the fire was pretty well knocked
down I saw a lot of my stuff because I
was on the top floor so a lot of this
might kind of stuff was sitting on top
so I saw like my computer or so like my
dining room table a few things yeah
those bulldozers came through that night
and he was pretty much all just kind of
her married yeah her i was never able to
find any of it again well but any what
you did you found bits of
recognizable things in the wreckage but
all this stuff ok cool I can I can sort
of get with this a yeah i can predict
that a youtube personality goes back to
his burned down apartment building and
and and makes a video all right that's
not a surprise what it was so striking
to me was watching this freaking video I
swear to god you broke my heart because
I'm like you were not necessarily jovial
but you were as good-natured as any
human being could ever be in that
circumstance like you're uncovering bits
of your life that have been burned
doused in water and then bulldozed and
yours you're basically just you're
clearly not happy but I you made it such
an enjoyable experience and I hate
saying that but watching this video like
it was this kind of weird testament to
human resilience I I guess it was just
like Jesus Austin I mean to just can use
anything does anything bother him you
know I did you get the same feeling
watching the video like you were like
wow I can't believe that I'm such an
easygoing guy I I don't know about that
I mean I think it really helps because
the way the whole fire kind of thing
went down because I was asleep I heard
yelling so I saw some smoke over my
window so I immediately threw up and
threw my clothes on grabbed my phone and
my my glasses I ran outside house I like
some serious kind of black smoke coming
out and I think it really helped because
i was still i mean i was awake by just
woken up there from that point on I
pretty much immediate was able to write
everything off of like okay i'ma grab a
couple things and I'm done and so I
think it definitely helped it I knew
what was going on and yeah I from here
the entire time I walked down I saw the
fire I ran down I saw the fire I saw
everything happened so does every point
was like oh no is this gonna happen oh
and Fire Department get here as soon as
I saw that amount of black smoke of like
okay I'm done and I didn't didn't even
think about it so I know it was it's
kind of weird how it happened but it
really wasn't like a like especially I
was looking through everything I wasn't
going like I wonder if I can find
something I kind of hoped but I knew the
amount of you know the fire and it was
completely leveled it was just kind of
like huh what if I can find some cool
souvenirs but pretty much that was my
thought process there you had already
come to terms with it when you were
watching it destroyed the first time you
were like yeah that's yeah I you know
it's it's something I don't think a lot
of people wouldn't necessarily expect
because you
are the entire focus of your
professional life is things right yeah
so but on the other hand I mean you look
at like what we do like there's new
phones coming out all the time new
computers there's new stuff coming out
all the time so yeah I mean the tech it
definitely hurts but I mean I know that
that's going to be a year from now
there'll be all kinds of new stuff and
you know whatever I mean the pretty much
the only thing that really kind of you
know sucks is like my data because I had
it backed up but it was in my apartment
so that was gone a lot of like the step
Franklin as a kid I used to do was
really big into writing all that stuff
gone so that was pretty much the only
thing that kind of upset me but you know
it's just stuff it's it's just stuff
ultimately it is just yeah yeah you
survived and we're all glad about that I
want to get back to the writing thing in
a second but before we do you uh you got
a surprise a couple of weeks back yes I
did so I was a staying at my parents
place yeah I'm gonna tell the story so I
was thinking of a parent's place and you
know I spent about a week or two trying
to figure out kind of I didn't know if I
was going to move because I had
considered actually moving out to
California some stuff had happened and I
after I signed my lease I you know big
opportunity came for me to go move out
to California and I came really close to
doing it and I decided not to so when I
remember I was staying at washington
place / down like huh guess I'm out of
my lease now yeah well I wanted ass gape
at RIT was there was these weird
thoughts but yeah so I spent a couple
weeks kind of considering whether I
wanted to do it or not or you know what
I was going to do and one day I just
sitting out there on the couch and I
just can't play on my new 3ds the first
thing I replaced and my dad walks in
he's like hey there's a UPS package for
you you guys sign for it I looked at on
like no it's like you got it any adult
consigned for UPS package but I knew
that new eps they're not going to sit
around forever so I ran out grabbed a
jacket I walk outside and there's a
brand new Mac Pro sitting in front of
the door and my mind just locked I could
not understand what was going on there
was a white car out in front of the and
further driveway so I saw that and I saw
the mac pro but touitou just did not go
together in fact they reported me
just have the most dumbfounded look on
my face I'm trying to understand what's
going on and then two of my friends Lou
from unbox therapy as well as jonathan
from tldtoday they pop around the corner
and the recording it is a giant surprise
they had done with the tech community to
kind of replace the mac pro and try to
give me back on my feet and they flew
all the way down from California and
from Canada to come and surprise me and
my mind was just blown I think
everyone's mind was blimey everyone was
there was a very very very heartwarming
video and &amp;amp; Event I'm that would have
broken my my heart and in the best way
if I were if I were you I must be felt
great to have that kind of support you
know from ya friends right it was
amazing I mean it wasn't even I mean and
I've said this before it wasn't so much
about the mac pro which was amazing but
as the fact that everyone thought enough
to pitch in to come down to try to
replace it that meant a lot more than
what they had actually done the fact
that everyone would actually do
something like that because I mean if I
thing is like I started watching a lot
of these guys like you know John for
lakers so Joe's best so are some of the
guys who I looked up to i was very first
starting the night bit like it's I've
come far enough that they actually
Nellie like can you can recognize me but
they actually go out of the way to help
me is just kind of like whoo yeah yeah
no it's it must have been profound and I
remember I was very because I was
surprised along with most other people
and I saw it I saw it hit the feet i'm
awake whole that way they did this that
this is awesome so that was my first
indications great i do what did you all
end up doing did you did you move where
are you were you sitting right now i'm
still in missouri i'm still missouri i
decided i'll wait another year because
it's kind of a big deal to move out
there because you have some family and
friends around here so you know I had
another those long kind of conversations
with myself which sounds really weird
say it but I yeah I just did not gonna
on a lake you have a thoughtful evening
on the beach yeah exactly though I think
the big thing was I just didn't want to
make a rash decision because like pretty
much like as I was sitting there like
watching the place burned down I pretty
much it decided my head like yeah okay
I'm moving now but I have to think about
a little more like you know I had a plan
I don't want to just throw the whole
plan away just because this and I think
one of the big things that was kind of
uh you know trying to meet you the ideas
like hey moving is gonna be so easy now
I can throw this in the my trunk in the
car and just put GPS and just try like I
liked the idea of the freedom because I
could just go do whatever whenever bells
like yeah but I don't know that's that
bat kind of seems like a decision I
would regret later if I just just take a
pack up and just disappear somewhere and
go have some fun absolutely no it can be
really alluring for a very short period
of time and I think you have to go right
then like if you're having that moment
you really want to go I think if it's
right then that's when you go but
fortunately you devoted a little bit
more time to it and stuff can I ask the
obvious question even though I don't
think you'll answer you don't have to
answer can you talk about the
opportunity in California or is that a
secret ah you can't really talk about it
Oh problem don't worry about this is not
60 minutes i'm not going to do it here
silently while you get uncomfortable but
i would like to hear about it some type
that if it is something that is meant to
be i hope that it happens yeah hopefully
mm-hmm i want to i want to sort of move
on to to the QA a little bit and i
actually had one question before we
started the QA but it seems that someone
has already beaten me to it so are you
cool to start taking some questions from
from the viewers here yeah let's do it
sweet let's do it let's start with this
question from Alex uh the vole chick
biffle sick I'm doing the best I can
there Austin what is your daily driver
for a phone right now again wait wait
before you before you answer can I guess
yeah go for cheating because I think
you've told me this but is it is it the
Moto X actually it's the iphone 5s ah so
i thought i thought i had it well i
think is mmm i did use the Moto X for a
little while um you know the funny thing
is I used to like really love like
iphones and ipod touches like i was
really big into that I mean that's how I
started my channel but uh i think around
the galaxy s3 i just couldn't deal with
just I OS anymore just so tired is just
so bland it just not changed and i was
looking at android nicole its giant
screen LTE is amazing yeah um but when
the iphone 5s came out I because I I got
the vibe I did review i immediately sold
it I was not remotely interested in
keeping it just like okay yeah but
but the 5s came out i really like i had
the same thought like okay you probably
can get rid of it but then we turned
into two weeks and a month and now it's
been analyst in September so four or
five months now I think it's partially
big as the camera because I'm a big guy
really really love good phone cameras
because I know I'm that huge an
Instagram or anything but I just really
love like a good camera on a phone
because I don't like to carry around
like yes large and all this kind of
stuff cause it's just big and bulky and
it really I feel like it makes me be
more creative when i'm working with like
a little bit more of a limited kind of
camera we've got it yeah i've got
actually i got a zoom with my feet and
try to you know line things up and
everything so the camera this is just
awesome but uh I'm starting to kind of a
little bit regret this small screen size
because it's like okay I had the the
note 3 little while ago I was like oh
yeah this is this is one of the big
bones like but I yeah I got news in the
5s sweet all right well that's I think
you're certainly not alone in that I I
don't have a 5s I'm actually staring at
a bunch of phones lined up right here
and i have a bunch more in the other
room and then in the other office and
I'm like I don't have a 5s all I have on
the iOS side is a 5c and it's very
frustrating especially we do comparisons
and people like you should have compared
that with a 5s Mike I know I don't have
what I'm sorry yeah Alex thank you for
the thank you thank you thank you um we
have another one here actually and I
actually want to another word from Alec
so we're going to close on but there was
one that I that is not a question it's a
statement and its really really cool I
don't know if you've seen this or not it
I don't this is from turbocharged films
I don't know if you can recognize me but
I'm the kid whose life you changed the
one with the dingy emotional video glad
what what's the story there uh yeah so
he actually he made this amazing video
and you know i wish i had the link to it
right now but he just made this amazing
video just kind of talking about how he
had watched some of my videos and just
kind of that I don't be like be
automatic but he it kind of turned his
life around that was i wish i had the
link to that video right now but dude
thank you so much for that video I know
I said it before on Twitter but that was
probably one of the best videos i've
ever seen just
show me the shoe me the link after we're
done and I'll put it in the post at
pocket yeah yeah I will find out had it
saved somewhere but I don't have it on
this computer i don't think but yeah
that was that was that was a pretty
pretty amazing video well good I'm glad
that turbocharged films got a chance to
to mention it again and I'm looking
forward to seeing it your predictions
about MW MVC mwc depending on where you
hail from this is from Fabian who is a
full name I will not try to pronounce
cuz i was a bit predictions for mwc this
year we were talking about this a little
bit before the show started you've not
yet you've never attended at Mobile
World Congress correct no no and it's if
anyone is unfamiliar it's basically the
CES of its CES x 5 and it's all mobile
it's in barcelona so that is terrifying
it's so awesome no you know it is funny
though because when you scale up CES
it's basically the same thing it's the
same tiny amount of worthwhile stuff at
the core surrounded by four hundred
thousand acres of iphone cases that are
crappy you know yeah that's not that but
um do you have the predictions is a
really broad question and I never I
don't like answering it myself so is
there something you're particularly
looking forward to from mwc I'm
definitely looking forward to see with
the new HTC one looks like although that
is actually that's supposed to be a
separate event right the HTC One yeah
that's gonna be March 25th in at a
double event in London in New York City
I believe yeah well I think that's the
most excited thing hmm about right now
you know I guess it's technically not
mwc HTC one is actually still one of my
favorite phones like I've ever used the
only reason I actually switched away
from mine was because the storage was
starting to go bad and something like
horrible read and write speeds really
yeah after about like three or four
months I was getting like I just like
unbelievable slow speeds like lagging
all kinds of stuff which is I never
really had with the phone before but oh
I've never that's interesting yeah I
have a widespread problem is it did you
heard it on fluoride heels yeah I
haven't heard of anybody else i'm sure
i'm fighting a search for maybe a few
people on some forums had that but no I
mean I had another HTC
it was a sprint review or something and
that one never really created but yeah I
had a developer edition and it just
after like three or four months of using
it the storage got slower slower and
slower to the point where it was like
physically lagging like a couple seconds
to open stuff everything I've like I had
to finally give it up and you know
switch over to the iphone actually
around that time but uh yeah double look
important sing with the new HTC the new
one looks like whatever they're gonna
call it so yes the all new HTC One the
an ahall course yes Oh what do we what
do we think about this we talked about
this a lot in the weekly yesterday and
that this is from GG froley what do you
think about the new HTC m8 and the
specifically and this is my question to
the double camera around back because
that looked like some BS to me when I
first saw the this weeks and then but
it's real it's what do you think man I
do not understand that's actually one of
the big things for like a lot of it's
been leaked but I still have not seen a
really solid concrete answer to what
that is about because it was like quiet
3d because usually a 3d camera you know
they're very close together and you know
they're like this one almost seems like
it's slightly offset to the top looks
like it's a different module I mean the
only thing I can maybe think of is it
has something to do with the Google
announcement yesterday on that uh what's
the the project you don't talk about the
advanced part i have the motorola the
project the project ara the modular
thing no no no the one where they had
the 3d camera and they're gonna like
allow you to like walk around with the
the phone it's kind of kind of map
things oh yeah you know what i'm talking
about i'm totally went blank on the name
me too i know it's me yeah well that's
been part of the speculation and then
also people have been saying it it might
be this kind of light row thing where it
allows you to determine focus after the
shot I've no idea i think that's
interesting so HTC has been completely
unable or may be unwilling to keep the
lid on the physical specifications but
we still have no idea what this mystery
module laptop does yeah so I I don't
know I mean it could be something really
interesting like that or it could just
be something boring like oh it just lets
you take a selfie or something I
I have no idea but uh before that I mean
I will say one thing though I'm kind of
a little this point they left little HTC
thing on the bottom where they got rid
of the physical buttons but then there's
still a giant strip there what's I I
don't know it's like that I don't know
now if we talked about this a lot this
week and a lot of people are really been
out of shape about this now I don't
really mind the HTC branding but sorry
you embezzled guy because if that seems
to be all that anyone want to talk about
these days I want to see they want to
see the most minimum bezels left and
right top and bottom I frankly don't get
it i mean if the phone looks good then I
I it can have as much bezel as it once
long as it looks good now is that do you
object to the logo or do you object to
the wasted space I definitely wasted
space I mean I got it like before
because you know hey you had your two
buttons you HTC logo that's fine even
though HTC One had a huge amount of
bezel but you know had the boomsound
speakers that was fine but now it's like
okay well they've got rid of the button
so now they're taking up space on the
screen and you still have that down
below it's almost like the screen is in
a way getting smaller which just seems
very bizarre to me that they couldn't
just maybe put that HTC logo on the back
or do something and kind of maybe extend
the screen out maybe you know just a
slight bit but yeah I mean it's that big
deal something that a deal breaker but
just seems a little bit bizarre that the
screen in ways almost getting smaller on
this new one I don't know that's a good
question yeah I forgot what the speck
said but I we might be looking for a are
we looking at a 4.7 again I've heard
4.75 I don't know but it's gonna be
around the same neighborhood just with
on-screen buttons I guess yeah well say
I add certainly we're gonna get our
questions answered but I'm surprised we
have so much time to wait now I think
you know the one was announced in
january or februari of last year and now
just this extra weight time is going to
be interesting with um yeah I want to
ask your help this is from Emil RK arc
perhaps what is your main source for
trends in tech and what is your latest
tech trend you currently use I don't
know I think this is a two-part question
but like tech trendy I don't know how
about that second part but I suppose
this is a question about your news
source or a we're just how you pick up
on what what the latest is that's
happening besides press releases I guess
because
boring answering oh I i keep my browser
locked pocket now at all times well of
course yes yes thank you thank
you taylor Martin AKA needle arc no this
is not a plan thank you that was very
nice i'm gonna use that in a promo there
you go i i i i endorse pocket now i know
actually the thing is I've never like I
know a lot of my friends he's like RSS
readers and just like load up like tons
of sites I forget all of my news from
Twitter I'm a huge Twitter fan for a
long time I just follow a lot of like
tech accounts people like you people
like you know like you know various
companies and you're just different
people in the tech industry and that's
pretty much where you get all of my
information so I'd like to just pick
like one particular source besides
pocket now but uh yeah right well that's
yeah that's a that's a solid answer and
I'm the same way I don't people were
going crazy when Google what was a
google reader that got canceled and and
then an RSS feeds and stuff I don't I
don't do any less time I get all my
stuff from Twitter and but whatever you
know you people can get their news
however they want do you have any
information which will all right so here
we go do you have information which will
samsung galaxy s5 well the samsung
galaxy s5 will well yes for that out
there I'm actually kind of i mean i've
gotta say i'm actually really impressed
with samsung the fact that they seem
like they're the only company who are
actually able to not have phones leak
have you noticed that like iphone leaks
I mean everything leaks but since on
does a good job of keeping that stuff
under wrap which for me even though it's
nice to know to see leaks and be able to
talk about it and do you know content on
it but on the other hand like me as a
consumer I kind of like that that was
kind of the thing that I really used to
like about Apple like remember like the
hype around like the like the ipad
launch I know knew what it was about
like that was a huge deal and I'm like a
lotta that's kind of diminished when you
oh it's just going to be another one of
these okay oh I've seen it six months
ago it's kind of like it's like like
especially Apple Vince nowadays is like
okay so it's confirming all the rumors
cool even in the face of like Tim Cook
saying things like we're doubling down
on on secrecy and stuff and it's like no
you can't apparently there's there's
massive holes in your insta
tuition and we're going to talk to Evan
bless and on the other progress i really
want to ask some of these questions
because it's interesting to see how that
whole model works but i agree with you i
I really like the surprise I you know
leaks leaks are so important we run
stories on other people's leaks all the
time and fine but I hate it personally I
am with you I'm like I just want to be
at the event I want to see what you've
got and if I'm going to be impressed or
depressed then I want that to happen at
the event I don't want to see it for
months in advance and be bored with it
on already on release day no that's yeah
exactly yeah so I mean I guess that's a
roundabout way of saying that I really
don't know what to expect with the
galaxy s5 I mean we've heard a lot of
rumors and speculation I mean I some of
like the core specs seem to be pretty
well set in stone like me like a 5.2
inch screen and maybe 1080 maybe qhd you
know and there's some of the basic kind
of stuff but that's kind of that's it
you could have guessed just by looking
at okay well what would a flagship phone
and you know launching right now be okay
well we'll be this this this so as far
as like the actual like interesting
information me I think the biggest thing
was like they're talking about they
might be like waterproof or something
and some of like the carriers what I'm
talking about like that's the biggest
leak and that's like an official
announcement almost it's kind of yeah
well I think those leaks are starting to
like bleed together like they did with
the node stuff because the galaxy s5
active is pretty much everywhere we're
very very confident about that or at
least some of us are so I think maybe
some of that is bleeding into the
official galaxy s5 leaks and who knows
but you're right samsung deserves some
kudos for being able to keep a lid on
this and well we'll find out monday you
know it's not I don't have that that
much longer to wait I particularly like
this question which has disappeared
because the because the feed has moved I
remember the question itself where did
it go thank you for your question by the
way about the galaxy s5 that was that
was awesome the question is well I'll
select it when I can find it but the
question is what is the most commonly
used app on your phone and I I've never
been asked this question but this from
Albert Johnson could you do you have a
ready answer
that's a hard one i mean i would
probably say twitter but i don't say
twitter too so let's let's take twitter
out of the cut out of the other thing
because we both say twitter right yeah
and but then i also say like a lot like
this built-in apps like you know the web
browser camera that kind of stuff now
say the dialer for fun can we just go oh
ok that would that would be like
probably like that maybe the top 20 yeah
maybe I'm like my bottom five actually
uh um you know I think I kind of shame
to MIT probably my top like used at
that's not like built-in whatever would
probably be alien blue because I spent a
lot of time on reddit unfortunately so
explain this I don't know what this is
I'm out of a society yeah it's just a
it's just a reddit client it's really
good on iOS cool yeah yeah so I spend a
significant amount of time on that app
every day so just go just throwing that
out there you ever think of doing and
ask me anything on Reddit uh I don't
think anyone would care I mean whatever
no they would they totally would guy
didn't give it another year and I think
I think everyone would would flocked
here to here ask me anything i guess i'd
do that show up for it do it now i'll
show up it'll be fun all right just just
me and you just talking back and forth
the incredibly interesting that's true
it lets just retitle this the ask me
that's what kind of what we're doing
right now I good yeah all right cool uh
let's we're gonna start whining now
because we're reaching the arrow point
this one is from Thank You Albert
Johnson for your question this one is
from Kelly the legend oh that's right
hey look do you buy most of the stuff
you review with your own YouTube money
or do you get sponsors and how do you
get sponsors do you just ask Sony hey
can I review a unit is it that easy I
want to say you don't have to enter any
personal questions about your finances
or anything that's like um it's
definitely a mix I mean before like my
channel is much smaller I just didn't
have money to buy things so it was
either a company would send it or I
would just talk about I wouldn't
actually have it now my channel to the
point where you know typically if I
would like to you know to review
something I can just you know sent an
email to you know like somebody from a
you know whatever
I'm looking at and just say hey this is
who I am this is what I do would you
mind sitting out a review unit you know
may I take the conversation from there
but to be totally honest I actually buy
most of the stuff that I review
partially because I don't like to have
to be on like company's deadline because
usually when they send you a review unit
as you well know it's like okay you have
it for a week or two weeks or you know
whatever he can I have a finite amount
of time with it whereas I by myself I
can do a video on in a month or two
months or not do a video on at all which
actually happened you know fairly often
if its product i just i don't i don't
care about i don't think anyone else
would care about i just wouldn't do a
video on it um do i do it is mostly as I
just turn and sell the products
afterward so some things like the iphone
this is something I use so you know I
would have bought it for myself anyway
so it just makes sense to do videos on
it but uh all the times for some other
products I'll buy it i'll do some videos
on it sometimes if it's going to be
useful like a lot of times phones are
useful for like future comparisons and
stuff I'll hold on to it a lot of times
it's just like okay I'll do the video on
it turn around and sell it make most of
my money back and pretty much done deal
it makes sense yeah I always think it's
it's nice and it's special when for me
when I've reviewed a unit and then I
send the review unit back where we send
it to another team member to do
something with and I miss it so much and
i miss most devices so i have this this
column that i write about when I have to
send a piece back and I'm sad but if I
really miss it a lot I think it's so
special when I'm like I'm sorry screw it
i'm gonna go buy it that's when I think
those are the devices I end up loving
the most is like wow I can't live
without this I had it once and that's
been taken away now I have to go buy it
and you know that that's a fun fun
moment when you're like oh wow now no I
can own it again and that's something
unique about like what we do is we get
to have the privilege of taking a look
at all kinds of crazy phones and all
this kind of awesome new technology it's
really easy to kind of just come be
jaded just like oh ok cool its just oh
it's only 1080p screen when I lab yes
it's really easy to kind of get yourself
into that mindset when you look at
everything you try everything sometimes
it's nice just guys take a step back and
go actually you know that's really good
not necessarily because of the specs are
this is that but now that build quality
is really nice or that really like that
you know the cool feature this little
thing and those are kind of phones that
kind of kind of come back to you go yeah
you know what that's actually better
than you originally said or whatever you
kind of you kind of want to talk about
it more go actually I've been using this
for
here and it's way better than really but
it's just that's kind of weird things
like the little things that you Caillou
notice you I keep keep talking about
keep using that kind of can't keep me
going back it's true and then then you
get the added bonus of liking something
so much that everyone starts accusing
you of being paid by yeah i mean i am an
apple fanboy i'm paid by Microsoft and
Sony sometimes pays me and so does AMD
and telling everyone everyone clearly
pay me did I never said whole closet in
my apartment that is nothing but checks
from people who I have a cache adjust I
open it up and I'm buried and money it's
great yeah exactly i don't know what to
do it all besides buy more products yeah
man well I I want to do I want to do two
more questions and okay one of them
actually three more but one of them I
just have to answer because it's popular
this one though is very fascinating to
me this is from oh I'm sorry this from a
meal again it might be more a michael
question i don't think so because i want
to know your take on this which mobile
OEM currently not big in the US for
example huawei sony zo me I still don't
know how to pronounce since I owe me
you're doing a move in so which which
brand that we don't currently have here
do you think as the best chance of
actually making an impact here I want to
ask you this question ossining I think I
have my answer but would sang lenovo be
cheating because I can't feel like
buying motorola yes of course that would
totally be cheating get out okay yeah I
think hallway I mean every time I go and
premature see their phones once your CES
I look and go wow that's getting better
wow that's getting better i mean i would
probably sell say wha wait blows sony I
mean Sony does have a lot of brand
recognition here I mean they do cell
phones not you know maybe in huge
volumes or you know massive success but
when they do cell phones um I know I'm I
probably say Sony but I really know what
Sony can do to kind of change up and
really kind of kind of move up to the
kind of the Samsung and you know these
giant massive levels I don't really know
what they can do because they're doing a
lot of stuff right it's just not quite
resonating well I know what they can do
they can message you know that there's
no marketing here
sony for sony mobile products whatsoever
and sony's my answer actually uh i have
no confidence that frankly that huawei
will ever pull anything out that's going
to blow us blows apart they seem content
to say here's this thing that you
totally expected isn't it amazing and
then it's like no it's not but but i
would like to see that change don't get
me wrong i don't want to just hate on
them but that has not been their track
record whereas sony is like wow you have
really compelling stuff and we actually
go out of our way to get it because we
don't have the greatest the tightest PR
relationship with Sonny so it's like we
usually have to buy the stuff for a
borrowed from clover integrity or
something like that and when I do it's
like this is amazing why do you only
have a partnership with tmobile in the
States here like why is why are you with
the smallest carrier so I think if Sony
if Sony an AT&amp;amp;T you have a meeting
because you know how aggressive AT&amp;amp;T is
at capturing like exclusives and stuff
if AT&amp;amp;T is able to weasel weasel some of
those exclusives away from t-mobile I
think Sony if Sony would just pour the
marketing dollars in and be on AT&amp;amp;T and
maybe verizon if they build some cdma
phones ever uh it would be did they
would be a force to be reckoned with
because their stuff I think tell me if
you agree with me on the hardware side I
think their stuff just blows away most
other contenders in the smartphone space
it's good although I feel like mu e
phones I try usually have at least one
kind of flaw that kind of annoys me like
I know a lot of them like like the water
from flaps that drives me insane like it
i don't care if my phone's waterproof I
don't have to deal with no chick opening
up flap or like sometimes the screen
like I know the Xperia Z I remember I
was a CES a last year and I remember
looking at it and I was with a friend
and we're like so is there something on
these screens and they're like no no
it's got great contrast like no I like
you see this like I know what you're
talking about I get it and then like you
change it a little bit like our screens
uh-oh exactly yeah I know most of the
Saudi phones i tried i had tried some of
the most recent ones but what's the time
when i try i should always like oh you
know what it doesn't quite fit in hander
of the flapper this was always just like
one like small or maybe kind of major
issue but there's always something
there's like yeah probably wouldn't use
that but i mean their clothes I i I've
got to give him credit they are
definitely close on a lot of these
phones like oh they would just change
that one thing would be awesome but
yeah there's a thank you a meal for that
question there's one from which i will
just answer very quickly this is this is
a question for Austin interestingly
Austin what is it about mkbhd and
cheerios from alex robertson Alec we
answered this question on Marquez is
fuggin a VIP appearance please go back
and watch that it's a wonderful episode
and we have a great time with it we have
one more major question to ask and
there's just another one I have to get
other way because it's been uploaded so
crazy mr. from William Kidd Mike someone
may go what's at redbox behind you I've
always wondered there's a lot of people
think this is a pokedex it does look
like one that's what I always thought
doesn't know this is a this is a wall
intercom panel from the original Star
Trek series in the 60s like Captain Kirk
you know because you didn't have the
badges like that you'd have to walk up
to a comm panel be like rich said red
alerts and things football wasn't really
that color I was it was this exact color
yeah except it was painted plywood in
the 60s you know this is plastic so yeah
and this is a this is a radiation
warning from a cell site that was on top
of a theater that I worked at and I was
at intermission I was doing a show and I
dare mention I was like I like this i
know but what were you not thinking all
the radiation that you were not allowing
people don't know about I think ya know
III don't think yeah I have memory
problems ever since then and I don't
have good why I was like well I totally
would have left him but I seen that fine
yeah every when I was just hanging out
like smoking by the south side like what
what these things are all about no there
were like 12 radiation signs and this
one had actually already fallen off it
was like on the ground it was like must
be a sign I'll take it must be a sign oh
I can talk all day but we we both have
we both have work to do right yeah let's
wrap this up with with one that I love
ending on and I always build it into the
rundown but I never need to because
someone will always answer it ask it
rather and I'm sorry that we couldn't
get to everybody's questions these are
all really great questions guys we just
can't be here for any longer but Evans
and Fisher around a lastname basis
yeah do you have any suggestions for
starting youtubers I love this question
this is always a question I put to
people you must have a canned response
by now or or just some some quick pocket
tips for people who want to start from
scratch and do what what we do yeah I
mean the thing is I can only tell you
what's worked for me and what's worked
for me is make a video make another
video that's better than that one I can
I the video that's better than that one
give it a few years and see where you
are I know that not everyone literally
wants to dedicate like everyone always I
mean just in culture no one wants to
take the hard road and if there's an
easy road and I mean if you are insanely
lucky you know get some kind of viral
video and you can use it as a launching
pad good great for you but that's not
going to really happen I mean just just
throw that out there like if it happens
that's great but don't bank on that like
oh just got make one more video with a
million views and you know I'll make it
you've really got to be able to be
dedicated and consistent and you really
have to be passionate about something I
mean I gotta say I mean doing this
almost five years if I wasn't passionate
about it there have been about 50
different times where I would have quit
I mean because they're I mean they're
going to be times where a video doesn't
do well or something goes wrong or just
things happen and if you don't have that
passion and that dedication to push you
through those kind of rough times this
is probably not thing for you I know a
lot of like a lot of people especially
some of the younger people they look and
they see what we do and they go oh
they'll be so great with all the phones
all this and that and it's like all this
must be the greatest thing ever and
don't they wrong it is the greatest
thing ever night that I'm not gonna try
to say this is all I hate going to work
or bare skin Oh God so true which tech
but I mean there's definitely not isn't
just not all happy and fun you know
there's deadlines there's no problems as
you can have like you know in your house
burns down there's all kinds of
hardships that you can go through and
sometimes the biggest one is just okay
no one's watching my stuff and that's
that for me that was a really tough one
especially when I was you know it's much
much smaller I mean like I said it took
me over a year to get thousand
subscribers so I mean that's you know
that was that was a lot of work for you
know getting like two comments I spent
all day on a video but you got to be
able to have that passion that
dedication to push through and
constantly make your stuff better
absolutely constantly make it better if
you're making the same thing
run over and over again you're not going
to go anywhere but if you're constantly
making it better and better and better
and better and better well it's just
kind of just get better and better and
bigger and all kinds of awesome fun
adjectives will be an adjective city
before you know let me hop on at one
point that you made it which is all that
I agree with consistency hard work don't
think it's a it's a it's all rainbows
and unicorns but also the passion thing
is is crucial and I feel like when
people say that it in increasingly in
conversation people passion it's so
important that uses look back it we're
not talking about manufacturing passion
for something you actually don't care
about like make videos or were written
pieces if you like or any any kind of
expression about things that you love
and that eliminates so much of the hard
work because you don't have to focus
resources on caring because you already
care and because you care about
something you have something to say I
think that's the important thing you
know I'll occasionally turn out a video
and I'll publish it now kind of sit back
I'm like what's wrong you know I did
it's cut right it's it looks pretty the
music is fine I mean whatever but why
don't I like it oh right it's because I
didn't say anything I didn't have
anything to say so I think it's really
crucial to remember that you're making a
video or a written piece to try and
communicate a message and in our field
it's often this sucks here's why it
sucks or this is amazing and here's why
it's amazing or how do these things suck
and anime is relative to each other and
if you can't keep an eye on what you are
trying to communicate that bit then you
just kind of have this like wishy-washy
PR commercial and it's okay so you'll
see through that people will see through
that in a heartbeat exact try if you try
to be fake you try to put it on I mean
obviously to an extent like you know you
have to have you know bring your energy
up level up a little bit kind of talk
and certainly I mean it's not like
you're just like hey so okay it's a
possible videos I did I forgot a smile
like cuz I've come in from an acting
background and I'm just like this isn't
totally different but you have Brandon
like duh my second videos like remember
to smile because because you're so dour
and this is this is Michael visual bag
and i'ma bring you something something
about this device this is a fun tablet
is here we go yeah
yeah but I mean as long as you have that
passion and that enthusiasm for
something it doesn't have to be tagged
as long as you have that and you have
the willingness to really you know put
the you know the hours and the
dedication and to make it happen a
little it'll happen it might take a few
years but it'll happen agreed Austin uh
