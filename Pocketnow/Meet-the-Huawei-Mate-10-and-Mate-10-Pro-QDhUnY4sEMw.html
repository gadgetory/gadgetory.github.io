flagship smartphones but we were still
missing the update of one of our most
admired players of last year reporting
from New York City I'm Jaime better with
pocket now with anton d najin munich and
meet the huawei make 10 and mate 10 pro
last year's huawei mate nine was the
near perfect example of how a smartphone
camera should be done battery life
should perform and software should be
improved it came very close to winning
our crown for the best of 2016 and this
year the huawei mate 10 and mate 10
probe build on those basics and delivers
some interesting surprises for starters
the design is completely new gan is the
aluminum of old in favour of a more
refined glass finish while weighs
dubbing this it's multi axis curved
design and off the bat i can tell you
that there are no sharp corners to be
found both variants feel like rounded
pebbles in the hand with a glass
providing an additional grip both
devices also sported interesting accents
around the cameras but according to the
company these are merely aesthetic we
also got to see that the porsche design
model is pretty much the May 10th row
with a vertical bore instead of
horizontal the differences between each
device are quite the paradox though
side-by-side it's hard to notice things
until you start digging into
specifications the regular made 10 is a
5.9 inch LCD at quad HD resolution and a
standard 16 by 9 aspect ratio the May 10
pro has less resolution at 2160 by 1080
but this is now a 6 inch OLED display at
18 by 9 aspect ratio the May 10 now
adopts a front fingerprint scanner while
the May 10 pro has it at the back and
the May 10 include a headphone jack
which is awesome but then the May 10 Pro
doesn't for reasons I just don't
understand the regular made 10 also
includes dual SIM support with the
option for placing one from microSD
expansion the main 10th row is oddly
only dual SIM with no extra storage
options but it does come with 6
gigabytes of RAM in 128 gigs of storage
versus 4 + 64 respectively on the
regular May 10th
also there is LTE on both SIM slots with
the May 10 pro now supporting LTE cat
18 versus cats 16 on the regular May 10
last but not least the May 10 is not
water resistant while the May 10 Pro is
ip67 now as for the similarities both
devices include an insane 4,000 milliamp
power battery supporting huawei
supercharged technology though don't
expect where I was charging Huawei
claims that the battery footprint is so
large that the coil just didn't fit
powering the show is Huawei's new Karen
970 processor that we saw at Eva 2017
and there are a ton of reasons why I
left this for last first of all it's
Huawei's entry into the ten nanometer
process so remember that whole Samsung
dec system where you need an expensive
doc in order to use your phone as a
computer well you can use the huawei
mate 10 and May 10 pro in the same way
but just with a wire no dock necessary
and if I understood things correctly the
wire might even be included in the box
and the UI is enhanced for private
smartphone communication to not be
shared with a computer screen which is
genius second and most important is this
new neural network processing unit or
NPU for short bringing some cool AI to
the mix for example the phone is smart
enough to know when you're taking a
photo of a flower a plant food a person
and much more
so the May 10 will automatically show
you that a detective the subject and
it's just the camera mode accordingly
instead of having you fumble with it
manually this is seriously genius is how
smartphone cameras should work but this
is just one of the many cases where the
mpu comes in handy speaking of the user
interface this is Huawei's new emui 8
and if you're asking yourself why the
jump in numbers that's because this is
matching the number of the version of
Android
so yes the new mates will bring Android
Oreo out of the box I'm still not a fan
of the iconography but I'm just really
happy to see that the launcher now
supports that Google feed with a swipe
to the left something that every other
om is missing this year
and for the cherry topper both cameras
on the May 10 and May 10 Pro are still
tuned by Leica so we have very high
expectations each camera lens is now FF
1.6 aperture yes even the secondary one
and we have 12 megapixels in RGB and 20
megapixels in monochrome with an 8
megapixel selfie shooter at f/2 aperture
overall of everything that I've just
mentioned sounds impressive that's
because it is I'm more inclined towards
the May 10 program and it's water
resistance but really either of these
devices has all the toys necessary to be
one of the best smartphones of 2017
whether this new lineup is worthy of the
title will depend on our full review
