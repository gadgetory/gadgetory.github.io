when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappears
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of a review to see how
they feel after a couple weeks so let's
do something about it let's take another
look at the newest version of the most
popular tablet in the world the iPad 4
I'm Brandon minimun from packing.com and
this is episode 10 of after the bus
we found that the iPad 3 wasn't exactly
fast the combination of the a 5x CPU and
the high display resolution meant that
the 3 felt underpowered in places like
high FPS gaming and even web browsing
where lag and stutters were not rare and
so we were excited to hear that the iPad
4 would pack the a6x CPU which is
derived from the very impressive a 6
found in the iPhone 5 in fact Apple
claims of the iPad 4 has twice the
performance of the iPad 3 which is quite
a lofty assertion not only were we
expecting better performance on the iPad
4 but perhaps less heat and better
battery life thanks to the smaller size
of the CPU and the new lightning
connector while not a headline feature
itself is now tied to a higher voltage
plug the iPad 3 took a terrible 7 hours
to fully charge we were wondering if the
iPad 4 would be any better let's start
off by addressing the performance issue
the a 6 X chip is a dual-core CPU with a
quad-core GPU so we were eager to try
asphalt 7 on the iPad 4 which looks
incredible on the iPhone 5 but was laggy
on the iPad 3 the developer has updated
asphalt 7 to work with the a 6 X chip on
the iPad 4 so what did we find
well the performance is definitely
improved over the iPad 3 but not by much
in fact as you can see here in gameplay
the frame rates don't see them up to par
with what we get on the iPhone 5 it's a
little bit laggy in terms of web
browsing the iPad 4 comes out ahead when
compared to the iPad 3 but not by much
in fact this faster but not by much
story rings true in every comparison we
did launching apps moving around a web
page and playing games all were indeed
more speedy on the iPad 4 but definitely
not twice as fast as Apple would lead
you to believe but beyond the slightly
improved performance the IFF 4 has
improved Wi-Fi according to Apple
how much improved in our tests it's just
slightly improved with range that is
perhaps 15 percent better than the three
again Apple is claiming a 100 percent
improvement in Wi-Fi speed and we just
don't see that what about heat
dissipation the iPad 3 would get quite
warm after a long gaming session and
it's
the iPad 4 has actually improved in this
area the front-facing camera on the iPad
4 is now higher resolution and it does a
much better job in low-light situations
if you're one of the few that actually
use FaceTime you'll appreciate this
improvement in quality how about battery
life and charge times what we've good
news to report thanks to the 20%
increase in voltage in the charger the
iPad 4 charges in well 20% less time so
instead of 7 hours to go from 0 to 100%
it'll take a bit over 5 hours the reason
it takes so long to charge the iPad is
because it has a tremendous eleven
thousand six hundred and sixty-six
milliamp hour battery that's like seven
average smartphone batteries in one so
it's no wonder that the iPad takes a
while to charge and speaking of charge
times has battery life improved with the
iPad 4 no it hasn't gotten any better
and that's not so bad considering if the
iPad 3 had really great battery life
expect 9 to 10 hours of battery life
with Wi-Fi and slightly less with LTE at
medium screen brightness for most users
that use their iPad for about an hour a
day this means that you'll have to plug
in once per week or so what hasn't
changed is the bulk of the iPad the iPad
4 is just this cumbersome as the iPad 3
making long reading sessions
uncomfortable unless you're resting the
iPad on something of course you could
opt for the iPad Mini which is
tremendously light and thin but if
you're considering the iPad 4 you
probably want the larger high-res
display also unchanged is the amazing
selection of apps you get for the iPad
the vast majority of which have been
updated to work on the Retina display
there's literally an iPad app for
everything and most are impressively
high-quality if you're going to buy an
iPad 4 you have a lot of choices in
terms of color capacity and LTE or Wi-Fi
our recommendation if you have the extra
cash is to go with at least to 32
gigabytes in capacity because if you
plan on downloading HD movies or a lot
of games and apps you'll quickly run out
of space with just 16 gigabytes then on
the issue of LTE versus Wi-Fi we
recommend that you opt for the LTE
version because even if you never use it
it'll improve your resale value plus you
can turn the LTE on and off as you need
it so you're not stuck paying for unused
data
in terms of choice of carrier we tend to
like AT&amp;amp;T a bit more because their LTE
network is rapidly growing and more
importantly their fallback HSPA+ network
speeds are much faster than what you get
on Verizon and Sprint over EVDO and
finally when choosing between black and
white consider that the white will hide
fingerprints much better than the black
so now that the bus from the iPad 4 has
worn off we can save this about it if
you own an iPad 3 there is very little
reason to upgrade in fact we see the
iPad 4 as an awkward in-between product
that is going to be outshined by a
significantly thinner and lighter ipad
in 2013 we say this because the 10-inch
iPads design is now three generations
old and Apple is likely on the verge of
revamping the design to be similar to
the incredible thin and light iPad Mini
so if you can be keep patience skip the
iPad 4 and see what next year brings

resolution display meant that the three
that's not right
but the high-resolution display melted
the meant melt meant melts melts meant
what one more time we found that the
iPad 3 wasn't exactly fast become the
combination the combination the
combination freeze compilation
