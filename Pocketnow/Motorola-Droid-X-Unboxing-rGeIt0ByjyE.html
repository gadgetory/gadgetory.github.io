pocket dot-com a lot of people including
myself are super excited about the
Motorola Droid X this is Verizon's
answer to the Evo 4G because it has a
massive 4.3 inch display it's super thin
and as HDMI out it's got a very fast
processor a ton of RAM this is a very
high-end smartphone indeed so I'm
excited to get to the unboxing let's do
it and so we've already covered the
Droid X a little bit with some first
book videos but in this series we're
going to go through and cover it more in
depth with a formal software review and
hardware review and an overall review
just like we do with all major other
releases see what we have here alright
wow this is a really small box it also
feels a little crappy I must say really
small box your droid X I'm actually
surprised that there is a device inside
this box with a 4.3 inch display but if
they're trying to save more packaging so
let's look around the box included is a
16 gigabyte microSD card that's great to
see the capacities keep being bumped up
I remember when they started to include
micro SD cards a few device generations
ago and they were 2 gigabytes and one
gigabyte now up to 16 gigabytes um very
nice looking phone I'm really excited to
finally have some hardware buttons to
play with the HTC EVO 4G and the HTC
Desire they don't have physical buttons
down here so they're difficult to feel
for anyhow let's open up very very nice
minimal packaging we'll set the device
to the side and have to put the battery
in I feel that vibration now that people
have been talking about when we tap on
the back there already tiny little wall
charger huh Micro Micro USB looks like a
real metal back battery cover that's
good to see and a battery that is of
size
1,500 milliamp hours getting started
guide there are never any interesting
accessories that come with phones these
days as the carrier's try to save on
cost a little bit so let's get the
battery inside the Droid X get a feel
for the size next to some other devices
and then we'll turn it on for the first
time so pop this in alright and you can
see the 16 gigabyte micro sd card is
already in there so I'm gonna bust this
open and take off this piece of plastic
soft touch rubber on the back here and
put this in okay you got the cover on
there nice and secure I think very
streamline right here and then you get
this hump which I actually like this
design compared to the Evo 4G so we've
got some notes up here volume up and
down power lock headset jack security
warning alright not so interesting well
very nice device the screen doesn't feel
and look as large as the Evo 4G or the
HTC hd2 very nice looking device it is
big in hand very large in hand it feels
slim like I said it feels smaller than
the Evo 4G which I always thought felt
very very large we have the HDMI output
here we off to test that micro USB power
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and a lot
of other goodies that we'll take a look
at let's turn this on for the very first
time and while it's turning on we'll
compare it to other devices so let's
look at it next to the HTC hd2 this
device also has a 4.3 inch display but I
think thanks to the thin bezel the hd2
actually appears to have a larger screen
I don't know if you can perceive that on
your end and in terms of thickness it's
really hard to tell because the Droid X
has this little hump up here where the
camera is what you can see this part is
about as thick as this part
okay we'll continue the comparisons in a
second let's let's touch the Android to
begin I'm sure this is going to be just
a standard you know getting started of
any Android phones we have to activate
the phone we'll go through that later
let's continue comparing it to other
devices I'm going to shut off the screen
for now here it is next to wants to stay
on here it is next to the iPhone 4 and
now it's talking to me the iPhone 4
obviously has a much smaller screen 3.5
inches in terms of thickness the iPhone
4 definitely looks thinner but if you're
judging it from the glass to the glass
and not just the metal piece it's
actually the same thickness as the Droid
X and next to another Android phone the
Google Nexus One the Droid X looks
pretty darn massive so a lot more coming
up on the Motorola Droid X this is going
to be a big contender in the smartphone
industry with such a large screen and
powerful hardware offering I've really
liked this button over here in the upper
right corner you don't see many
smartphones have a dedicated camera
button but it comes in handy it's a
little bit annoying having to press the
shutter button on the screen as is the
case with a lot of phones out there so a
lot more coming up as I said be sure to
subscribe to our YouTube channel to find
out when the latest video hits and
please give the video a thumbs up if you
like what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
