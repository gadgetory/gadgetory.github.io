and this is facebook paper this is
Facebook's answer to those in need of a
more elegant and organized approach to
Facebook or at least that's the
intention many complain about Facebook's
dull convoluted and unreliable
application and with paper this is the
answer to at least most of these
problems paper is like a flip board in
facebook home had a baby where you can
scroll from left to right and where
photos and storage take up the full
screen and a more immersive experience
it's extremely snappy and substitutes
buttons and taps with gestures that I've
gotten used to quite easily you can also
pen with photos using the phone sensors
instead of your fingers the app even
talks to you to help you navigate if you
find any problems which is really cool
now the real story behind paper is not
in its design but really in its purpose
facebook wants you to spend more time
with them their mobile application and
they're trying to merge every excuse for
you to lead into the same app as such
you can add different sections in the
application that provide you with news
feeds from sports headlines Tekkit
cetera it also merges with pocket and
read it later applications to help you
organize what you read and in what order
as such Facebook is one of these
sections and these other feeds are
separate sections so your experience is
immersive no matter where you are at
facebook or within any other section
again but this is still paper which is
cool now don't get confused again this
is still Facebook so you can pretty much
ditch the native facebook application
and get all your notifications and
services here if this is the experience
that you like the most all that being
said the fact that this is still
Facebook is actually one of its problems
you'd think that because there is a tech
theme then all the tech pages that
you've liked will fall under that feed
but they don't these are still part of
your Facebook feed sadly no you can't
create a spam section for all those
candy crush alerts from your friends
either in that same fashion you can't
really select the sources of news that
you get from different sections so these
can prove to be unuseful to you since
these are actually curated and sometimes
convenient to Facebook another one of
its promises that the text can be quite
small for the taste of many and probably
one of its biggest issues is that you
can only get this on the iphone for now
I don't whine facebook paper is still a
work in progress but a very good start I
really praised the company for nailing a
very good product this is a very elegant
it is extremely snappy and again it's
quite an enjoyable experience if you
like an elegant magazine you I if you
want a better Facebook client that also
brings you your news in one place even
though from created sources you can't
really go wrong here it was about time
that facebook became more than what it
currently is and let's just hope that
version 2 is more flexible on the
sources that's it for a quick walk
through a facebook paper do you like the
application have you given it a try
