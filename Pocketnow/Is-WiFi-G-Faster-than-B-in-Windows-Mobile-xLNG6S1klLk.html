pocketnow.com and this is a video of an
interesting
to see if there's actually a speed
difference between 802 11 g and 802 11
be on a windows mobile device so right
now i have my wireless router it's a
standard netgear wireless g router set
to broadcast and only be mode so I'm
here at dsl report com / m speed and I'm
going to run the one megabyte test and
record all three I'm going to do it
three times and then record the numbers
and average them so here's the first one
and we get 972 kilobits per second with
a latency of 1.1 38 okay let's do that
again click the back button click that
second one is 1108 latency of point 096
and one more time
and we get 1097 kilobits per second and
latency of point zero eight eight okay
let me switch the router to G mode only
okay let's do this for the g mode I'm
going to click back and do one megabyte
again get ready to record this see if
it's faster a little bit faster 1139
kilobits per second latency of 0.08 six
let's do it twice more to be fair
we get 1192 latency 0 point 0 87 back do
it once more and then we'll average
these
finally we get one one six zero latency
of point 116 okay okay so the results
are in 802 11 be averaged 1059 kilobits
per second with a latency of Oh point
one zero seven seconds 802 11 g averaged
1164 kilobits per second with a latency
of 0 point 0 9 60 G is faster than be on
a windows mobile device but marginally
you would think that it would be much
more considering that G is 54 mega bits
per second broadcast and B is 11
megabits per second certainly we don't
expect to come to those speeds those are
theoretical maximum and you're not going
to get that on a mobile device or even a
laptop but this difference is very small
I'm curious as to why perhaps it was the
speed test that we used though i did use
other speed tests before this video and
they showed similar results so
interesting results of this test no
doubt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
