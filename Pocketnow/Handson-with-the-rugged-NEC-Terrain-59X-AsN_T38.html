for the AT&amp;amp;T network it's a rugged
durable phone you weren't content with
just an unboxing and hardware
walk-around you wanted to watch this
abuse it I'm Joe Levi for pocket now
let's get to it some people might call
me soft I have a desk job I Drive a
Prius
other than the goatee on the outside I'm
not what most people would call rugged
while that may be what most people see I
also build stuff I get my hands dirty
well I won't claim to be as rugged as
others who do really hard work every day
I can certainly value the benefits of a
good durable smart phone that I won't
have to worry about breaking luckily the
NEC terrain lives up to its motto made
for hard work the NEC terrain is water
resistant it's a rugged device that
sports a keyboard and considering that
its primary purpose is to be rugged and
durable it's a pretty nice phone the
terrain is rated ip67 for dust and water
immersion and comes with a military 810g
for shock extreme temperatures and salt
fog I still don't know what that is but
it's got to be pretty good because it's
military rated right even with all those
durability ratings it still manages to
cram push-to-talk and a QWERTY keyboard
inside its ruggedized shell on the
inside of the device the NEC terrain is
a little more on the light side although
it has a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon s4 8960 processor it only has
one gigabyte of RAM and a 640 by 480
screen this smartphone isn't gonna win
any performance contests it's also
running Android 4.0 that's Ice Cream
Sandwich and it seems a little bit out
of place to us overall the device is
pretty snappy and we didn't notice any
hanging or lagging except when it took
us two or three times to tap it's
somewhat small on-screen buttons if your
job has you
in the field more than in an office or
at a desk and you want a phone that's a
little more durable than the relatively
fragile flagship devices from the major
OEMs the NEC terrain is a great mix of
performance specs and durability
hopefully that'll satisfy your need to
see this little guy abused dropped
kicked and even dunked in water if it
didn't you'll need to get your own phone
and send us the video of how you abuse
it if you liked what you saw here and
who doesn't like seeing phones dropped
in water and thrown across the yard make
sure you give the video a thumbs up and
subscribe to our channel if you haven't
done so already if you'd like to share
this video with your friends on your
favorite social media networks we're
there we'd love to see you there too on
Twitter we're at pocket now I am at Joe
Levi's for pocket now abusing phones I'm
Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
