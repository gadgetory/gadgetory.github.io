as competition grow strong Fitbit
continues to rule the wearable space but
not for long according to analyst and
Microsoft continues to innovate and
mobile software but for Android I'm hi
Mary vera and thus mwc 2016 begins to
wind down I might just get some sleep
after the alcohol obviously this is
 out daily the official news
today begin with Microsoft as the
company has just launched the new pub
keyboard for android not for windows
phone not for iOS for Android and the
purpose of this keyboard is to actually
augment what you could do with keyboards
right now it's not just for text
prediction yes it can do that but it
also brings an extended clip board for
whatever is you copied and pasted
historically in addition to a quick
access for your contacts and a lot of
other things that actually make a lot of
sense this is a really smart product
link to the description for more details
on how to get it and as we begin to wind
down mwc 2016 we already here awards for
2015 what products were the hottest ones
are the most people like then it turns
out that the well the samsung galaxy s6
edge was the winner for the best
smartphone or 2015 and when it comes to
tablets it was the surface pro 4 from
Microsoft if you agree or disagree with
that make sure you leave us a comment
down below and let us know now let's
move the spotlight over to wearables s
fitment past proven with its quarter
results that it continues to be the
leader the company currently owns 30
percent of the wearable market and
apparently that amounts to 8.1 million
units which is a good number the very
interesting part is that analysts did
predict that the company will be able to
continue with this momentum though
reasons were not really provided so
let's see how the next quarter goes as a
people are just becoming more conscience
to fitness and these companies are doing
a really good job at making that happen
now let's talk about the LG g5 probably
one of the hottest products of mwc and
one of my personal favorites for those
of you that did not like the whole idea
of the lack of an app tray in the LG g5
there seems to be a very interesting
walk around hit the link in the
description there's a video from DK from
XDA Developers where he shows us that
it's a bear
simple switch into another one of the
options for the launcher for you to be
able to just enable the app tray we're
not exactly sure if this is just part of
the pre-production software it will
probably change whenever the device is
available but hey so far there is an
option which is great that's the way it
should be and finally the hot news today
have to do with the LG g5 as even though
the company then really mentioned
pre-order details retailers like Best
Buy are already mentioning pre-order
starting on March 18 which is great true
it's a week after the Galaxy s7 launches
not pre-orders but we do know that LG
usually launches its products a probably
in April as it has historically so it
does make a lot of sense and we have to
remember that this is a very very hot
phone very different to everything we've
seen around there so it doesn't make
sense for the company to want to refine
a couple more things out there but hey
it leads me to the question of today how
many of you are pre-ordering the g5 and
if so what has a made you Lord tour this
phone in my case I will admit it's this
wide angle camera and the option to use
it or not that's been my favorite part
of it but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your opinion and
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get these news earlier before
