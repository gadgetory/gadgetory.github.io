google nexus 5 in its full glory Apple's
iWatch is now rumored to bring the first
flexible display to the market and
Samsung is once again being accused of
some fake benchmarks I'm primary data
and the only reason why I don't fake my
age is because I have an age stupid in
15 years this is pocket out daily let's
start off with some sort of official
news as some microsoft executives are
already talking about the microsoft
surface and its future and for those of
you waiting for more four factors when
it comes to the surface or an LTE
variant well we kind of got a
confirmation of more form factors
meeting we're still not sure and they
probably aren't either and we do have a
confirmation for the LT model but the
problem is when you asked him for a date
as they set spring 2014 sadly so anyways
and speaking of those certain things
without a specific date those of you
waiting for ddr2 amber for your nokia
lumia 920 on AT&amp;amp;T well it got some sort
of confirmation from an AT&amp;amp;T executive
that we will be getting the update in
the next coming weeks and the guy
doesn't know that we have 52 weeks in a
year and those next coming weeks could
be 51 weeks from now I guess the guy
doesn't understand exactly how
frustrated we are I mean why exactly
then we get Windows Phone it wasn't for
the timely software update now probably
one of the best leaks of the day is the
first league photograph of the google
nexus 5 made by LG and yes this thing is
gorgeous up to the point where you start
looking at the spec sheet and no
nothing's wrong just yet i mean it's got
apparently a snapdragon 800 in the same
13 megapixel camera as the g2 but the
problem is we're not getting the same
5.2 inch display apparently this display
will be a 5-inch display meaning 4.96
something so we are not getting exactly
a g2 here and obviously we are skeptical
to wonder if this phone will bring other
caveats in comparison to the g2 so stay
tuned for that and have your tired of
hearing of those curve display leaked
some trust me you're not alone but we've
got some more credible sources now
stating that apparently the first device
to ever bring a curve display to the
market will be apple's iwatch which is
kind of ironic judging by the fact that
Samsung and LG already made these
humongous amounts of orders for the curb
display technology so we could be
getting the iWatch probably sooner than
later we still don't know I mean Apple
still has to launch their iPad so stay
tuned for the rumors and finally for the
both interesting and kind of ridiculous
news of the day Samsung has just
confirmed along with AT&amp;amp;T that they will
be launching the Galaxy Note 3 and
Galaxy gear in October fourth so you're
just a couple of days away from getting
your new phone but we can't understand
why Samsung has been caught once more
faking benchmarks for the galaxy note 3
just like they did with the galaxy s4 I
don't understand the purpose apparently
Samsung is trying to show that their
device is significantly faster than the
LG g2 which is kind of not possible
since they're both running the same
processor in almost the same
specifications still you know we don't
understand why but again that leads me
to the question of the day our benchmark
scores a determining factor for you to
buy a phone meaning man if you notice
that the benchmarks on this phone or
better than the other one is this the
reason where you're going to buy a phone
in my particular case after the whole
Tegra 3 fiasco where the benchmarks of
the HTC One X were amazing up until we
started using the phone I trusted
benchmarks before but I don't now there
are a ton of phones out there that
perform beautifully without the best
horsepower in the market so leave us a
comment down below would you buy a phone
just for the benchmarks in my case
honestly I buy a phone after a good
review after a review tells me that the
phone is good or not in real world use
leave us a comment down below of course

everything that's happening in the
smartphone and supper world but you
