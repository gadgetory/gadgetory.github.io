on the same old Android phones over and
over Russia's probably got something for
you I'm Michael Fisher that's Tony
behind the camera this is PocketNow and
this is the yotaphone at first glance
the Yoda phone appears to be just like
any other Android smartphone it's got a
4.3 inch display at 720p it's powered by
a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with 2
gigs of RAM runs Android 4.2 jelly bean
and it comes with either 32 or 64 gigs
of storage
it's powered by a 2100 milliamp hour
battery none of this is really going to
blow you away when you flip the phone
over that's when it really becomes
distinctive the back of the phone is
covered by another 4.3 inch display this
one made of a Inc now when your thoughts
jump immediately from ink to reading a
book that's fine you can bring a PDF
back there and just read all you want
but what's nice is you can actually take
any image from the Android gallery and
throw it on the back there which means
you can move a screenshot you can move
an image you can also say you're
navigating to a destination and your
phone battery is low you can grab a Maps
image from Google Maps your route is
shown on the back of the phone and even
if your phone dies on the way to the
destination that's fine because the
e-ink screen requires no power to keep
that image actually just there the
screen will also show notifications and
incoming calls and there are bevy of
settings available to you to customize
the experience that the e-ink screen
delivers of course if you just want to
stick around front on the conventional
side on that 720p display you're going
to be well served by what looks like to
be a 12 megapixel rear facing camera and
HD quality front facing camera obviously
the biggest news though on the back side
the e-ink display and hopefully when
this device is released you'll be able
to offer even more functionality than
we're seeing here in this brief iZON
demo
no specific word on pricing or
availability yet but yotaphone has
informed us that they are going to try
and work that up as soon as possible and
they're aiming for as much availability
as they can we're certainly looking
forward to seeing more I'm Michael
Fisher
that's Tony behind the camera this was
pocket now stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
