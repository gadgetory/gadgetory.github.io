iPhone 10 plus units this year even with
the possible crazy price tag the sunrise
gold variant of the samsung galaxy as 9
is about to reach Shores that we care
about and speaking of crazy price tags
Oppo find 10 is getting a fancy
Lamborghini edition I'm high metal iveta
and everybody take a guess in the
comments we're getting mechanical parts
on phones now what do you guys think is
next this is probably a daily
the official news today begin with deals
I love that more companies continue to
partner with project Phi L G being the
next you're in the market for the g7
thank you or the b35 thank you I wish
they dropped that name you'll get a
hundred dollars in project fire credit
if you go for it and that's a
significant deal considering the price
tag of these phones you can learn more
in the description now let me put this
to you into perspective guess how much
money fortnight has made on the iOS
platform alone for the past 90 days a
crazy 100 million dollars this is just
to give you an idea of how important the
platform is I don't understand why
fortnight has taken so long to launch on
Android I'm really waiting for it but so
far it's so great I just opened my
account by the way I'll share with you
guys soon you could probably play
together now let's talk about the
sunrise Gold Galaxy S 9 and Galaxy S 9
plus we were waiting for it to extend
from other markets than just Korea they
just made it official as of June 24th
and if you get it on Best Buy you get up
to $300 off depending on the carrier
more details in the description as well
definitely a good deal now let's talk
about that Oppo find 10 we get more
information as of today those of you
asking for the price tag yesterday in
the comments
999 euro which let's face it I mean this
phone has got all the bells and whistles
of a top Android flagship with something
very unique which is that mechanism for
the camera that's all great for those of
you wondering about the lamborghini
edition that was just announced yeah
that one's going to be priced at $1700
I know it's a lot of money it's got
top-tier specifications including 512
gigabytes of storage and the reason why
I'm gonna defend that is because it's
clear I mean it's it's called the
Lamborghini edition it's not called the
Volkswagen edition and even Volkswagens
are not cheap so yeah
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the iPhone 10 2018 as
we've got details of how much Apple is
willing to invest the company is
expecting to sell a lot apparently
they're placing orders for up to 70
million units were 45 million of those
units are of the plus variant alone the
company is expecting to sell a ton of
them and the price tag is
are they going to be over $1,000
according to the source so it might not
be the case that we're actually gonna
get a drop in the price tag what's the
strategy gonna be well apparently the
company also plans to delay the LCD
iPhone up until November for reasons we
don't yet understand but whatever the
case may be let us know in the comments
how much are you willing to pay for this
plus variant of the iPhone 10 20 18 plus
whatever the name is gonna be because
you know I was like my god I wish this
phone didn't sell so well so that people
wouldn't go crazy and prove Apple that
they could sell a phone that's expensive
sadly I was proven wrong lessons know
how much you're willing to pay I don't
think I'd be willing to pay a thousand
bucks for that thing but anyways leave
