pocketnow.com you probably have multiple
computing devices like a smartphone a
laptop a desktop or just a smart phone
and a laptop or combination of those
somehow and a problem that you've
probably had in the past is how do I
synchronize files across all of my
devices so that I don't have to
constantly be transferring with cables
using USB flash drives to move things
around emailing files to myself well
folder sharing isn't new there have been
programs around for many years now or
you can take a folder on your desktop
put it on your laptop put it on your
desktop and have everything synchronized
back and forth but what is new is mobile
clients that allow you to do this on
your smartphone to Dropbox has mobile
clients for all of the smartphone
platforms so in this video we're going
to show you dropbox working on Windows
Phone Android iPhone and yes even the
iPad let's take a look
now when you download dropbox and by the
way it's available for mac and pc and
linux it will create a Dropbox folder
for you that you can put on your desktop
or in your documents the purpose of this
folder is to keep everything inside of
the folder always in sync and you get a
little green checkmark next to all the
items in the folder to tell you that it
has been synchronized so what I'm going
to do now is just drag a photo into this
Dropbox and this will synchronize across
all of my devices i'm going to show you
the web version next and then we're
going to go into the mobile versions
okay so here we are in the web interface
it's very simple and this is great
because of your you're at a friend's
house and you want to grab a file a
photo or a document and you don't have
dropbox installed you just log into the
web interface so if i click on the
multimedia here you'll see that picture
that i just placed in the dropbox folder
already synchronized let's take a look
on mobile devices okay so we're going to
start off on Windows Phone and I should
say that Dropbox does not have a
standard or a native windows phone
client but a company called rutten soft
has made something called cloud files
which will allow you to access all of
your Dropbox content so I'm going to
click on it here and i'm going to log in
okay and here i'm logged in and here are
my two folders docks and multimedia so i
can click on docs and i've got a
different file type for all of the
microsoft office suite so I've got PIAA
a word document Excel and PowerPoint or
actually I should say and also a PDF so
I can click on any of these and jump
right into them and each program gives
you different options so I can view the
file and it's going to download and open
it up and here we go here's the
PowerPoint presentation right in the on
the device and we can also open these
other things here's a PDF we can view it
or we can edit it and it will
synchronize across all of the devices
and it's going to open Adobe Reader 2.5
and well you get the point let's take a
look at another device let's take a look
at Android so on Android the client is
native so it's made by drop drop box so
let's go to the drop box client and with
Dropbox you get two gigabytes of space
free and the way that they make money is
that they have plans that have a lot
more space so here we go we are inside
of my Dropbox I've got those two folders
by
multimedia I can open up photos and it's
downloading the download speeds are
usually quite fast although I must say
that if you're trying to do multimedia
on your smartphone it doesn't always
work too well so I'm going to take the
smallest song here Foo Fighters monkey
wrench and I'm going to open it in the
music player and it's going to do this
for a very long time over a fast hsdpa
connection so I'd say if you're using
the mobile clients of Dropbox really use
it for documents and photos and not so
much multimedia because it doesn't seem
to be well optimized for that ok let's
jump over to the iphone ok here we are
and again this is a native client that
dropbox made it's not a plug-in or
anything like that so here we go there
are my two folders once again and it
works a little bit different in the
iphone so we can tap on a on any of
those documents and we get it in sort of
a viewer within the dropbox application
not as robust as you will get on a
device like an android device or Windows
Phone device that has better support for
microsoft office documents so we can go
into an Excel and xls spreadsheet and
things don't always display so well
especially on the iphone this really
doesn't work too well and it just
cancelled out but things like PDFs work
pretty well actually very well the
iphone is very good PDF support and you
get the point and the same thing applies
here to multimedia so if i try to open a
song here the smallest one here food
fighters it takes a really long time to
access that content so again for
documents it's great not so much for
multimedia finally let's check out the
ipad version okay so now we're on the
ipad let's take a look at Dropbox here
so there's the client and it keeps you
logged in which is quite nice and here
we get a list of my folders on the left
side and over on the right you can see
the preview of a document that I had
just been looking at so we can go back
to docs we can open up any of these
things it is just like the iphone really
good PDF support let's go to an Excel
spreadsheet see how it comes up
a little bit actually a lot bit better
and then on the iphone and we can
actually switch between multiple sheets
right here but we really can't do
anything to edit the Excel and if we go
back to the other files the multimedia
folder let's take a look at how a
picture comes up very nice right on the
right side makes really good use of
screen space see what happens if I try
to open up a song I think it's actually
gonna work amazing and so it actually
worked through the eye patch of course
has better hardware than the iphone to
be able to handle this kind of
multimedia bringing it down very quickly
so quite nice on the iPad so if you're
having trouble keeping things in sync
and you have multiple computers you've
got files everywhere try dropbox it's
free and with all of these mobile
clients it really changes the way that
you use technology I think because you
can always have those critical documents
and critical pictures with you wherever
you go synchronized across all of your
devices on pocketnow.com pushed further
instructions on how to get the dropbox
clients for windows phone iphone ipad
and android then if you liked the video
