at koalas international flagship towards
this half of 2015 the Huawei p8 the
Chinese manufacturer has ascended a long
way from its earlier products with help
from a hefty Digital appetite in its
home market
not to mention swelling competition but
while China reaches smartphone
saturation companies over there are now
looking for how to take the scene over
to the west and thus North America
always made the investment in Canadian
headquarters but they've kept from
releasing their best work onto our
shelves how deep does Howie's Western
footprint go with the Huawei p8 Lite I'm
Jules Wong with pocket now let's find
out in our video review we talk about
glass sandwiches and plastic slabs in
our industry it's funny here because
Huawei opted to endow the p8 Lite with a
plastic sandwich build top and bottom
white layers arm at the bottom designed
with a brushed metal motif in mind the
glistening sparkles are a nice touch and
furthermore look ma no fingerprints the
chromed mid plate features a bit of that
brushed texture too and contributes to
the overall tactile feel you can pick it
up scratch it up a bit and not worry up
a storm it's not durable but it's
resilient flipping the phone over one of
my favorite quirks is the color
notification LED on top right next to
the proximity sensor what ever happened
to those our US device shows off a five
inch 720p LTPS LCD there's adequate
saturation but it looks like sub pixels
have been poorly arranged I mean look at
this white screen sure it looks fine
here but turn it this way and there's
more of a blue tint back the other way
around and we see a yellow hue
representing the green and red elements
blacks aren't as deep as even comparable
LCDs can produce and the below average
brightness and some major reflectivity
issues also add on to the problem file
this is not going to be a display for
sunbathers or for sharing pictures and
even beyond that
forget pixel
see here if a display can be as
inconsistent in color production as this
one can
we'd have doubts about using it for
prolonged anything media consumption
gaming etc inside we're looking at the
64-bit Snapdragon 615 from Qualcomm but
has become a pretty popular mid-range
SOC there's two gigs of ram and a
one-size-fits-all 16 gigabytes of
internal storage only expandable by up
to 32 gigabytes through micro sd though
if you do go through with the extra
space keep note that the p8 Lite is a
dual SIM device in the US the case might
be that a two carrier situation isn't
necessary or comment at all but for all
it's worth you should know that there's
a dedicated micro SIM slot and a shared
nano sim and micro sd card space there
is an oddity in that you can clearly see
the displays backlight illumination from
the micro SIM slots keyhole which could
signal number one that the backlights
distance from the rest of the LCD is
contributing to the visibility problems
and number two there could be some
instant trouble with water if it gets
into the wrong places so this also isn't
a beached phone watch out a stripped
down version of emotion UI 3 on top of
android 4.4.4 not lollipop has made its
way to the west by stripped down I don't
mean that the aesthetics that endless
app screens and the software
redundancies are gone they aren't but
what is is the extensive theming
capability and access to a theme store
you're only given a few ways to spice up
your homescreen and even fewer options
to customize other interface aspects
also gone are the knuckle gestures and
pull up toggles and while one-handed
usability is still here for a 5-inch
phone and apparently only in the dialer
it might not be as useful here the quick
toggles are varied many and of course
rearranging the notification shade
contains allow or deny prompts for
further pressures next to first-time
notices occasionally you'll be notified
of battery sapping apps which you can
choose the close
notifications and power savings can both
be managed
within the settings to this being the
Flyway p8 Lite you'd like to think of
this as mu I light take that for what
you will a finger of glass serves as the
head house for a 13 megapixel BSI sensor
from Sony along with a single LED flash
well it sounds kind of close to the p8
lights flagship sibling the light lacks
oh is and doesn't use Sony's RGB W
technology shooting with the p8 Lite
again minding outdoor conditions with
the display is pretty neat while we
didn't take every bit of fun out of the
diet phone there's an all focus mode
which does what you would expect it to
do a well-done panorama function and
some other standard fancy stuff the
pictures and selfies themselves range
from all right to washed out hues trend
cool and high contrast scenarios can
really mess with the processing
sometimes too hilarious detriment take a
look at this HDR picture and this one as
well and here's the exif data to prove
that they're both different ones while
it may be in a couple of cases that some
terrible exposure interpretation happens
the processing in general certainly
cripples the camera's ability to take a
decent picture especially when you might
be relying on HDR for fairly common
outdoor conditions lack of proper
contrast and saturation also rule in
low-light in 1080p video exposure is
just as jumpy as the footage rolling
shutter also contributes to the cons
side and the mic pickup in the light
breeze just doesn't seem to cut a film
about you only the mic is picking boys
up over sea breeze nice sea breeze of a
v8 light can really chug on itself
sometimes generally the typical light
loads like social media browsing video
watching and web reading are taken on
just fine by the way the p8 Lite just
like the p8 has a single 1 watt speaker
on the bottom left of the device despite
some deceiving grilles down there
and yes it's just as easily muffled as
it is I'm serious that may detract from
your gaming experience as they take more
of a toll anyways with symptoms of
choppiness delayed tap recognition and
most importantly power drain my initial
assessment in battery life turned out to
be just one side of the power coin after
further testing i found out on lighter
days the p8 managed superbly on standby
going on 18 hours unplugged
unfortunately it only manages about 4
hours of screen on time over any given
time off the charger in some cases as
low as 12 hours now keeping in mind that
this is a twenty-two hundred million
power battery this should be expected in
a mid-range device but Huawei decided to
promote how their LTPS display results
in twenty to thirty percent better power
efficiency in LCD technology LTPS is
indeed better for battery life and other
TFT materials but that on the whole is
another discussion
what doesn't die with me is the fact
that the display can take up a whopping
forty percent of the battery on any
given day like other phones and when you
end up having to crank the brightness up
to the max when you're outside you can
see how that effectively washes away any
efficiency benefits testing the phone in
Greater Boston on AT&amp;amp;T if found decent
LTE speeds nearly everywhere we went
there's a silver lining here and it
comes to call quality which testers
deemed better than average with adequate
noise cancellation in louder environs
but there are few silver linings to the
Huawei p8 Lite that keep it from falling
below our recommendation threshold
especially when there are better options
in the US market at the $250 price point
right now so we find ourselves asking
Kwame
one of China's commercial achievements
what business does it want to do in the
West can it do better for a demanding
marketplace should we even consider
Huawei as a serious player here I didn't
think we'd be asking these questions
right here but given the circumstances
with cell carriers changing the model of
their business
and ever-improving budget smartphones
for more OMS shouldn't Huawei try harder
our full text review of the four way p8
Lite will come shortly on pocket now
