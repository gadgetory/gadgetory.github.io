the recent rumors are actually true
Galaxy s7 leak renders show us that
there will be some changes in its design
and since today a CES press they you bet
that there will be some announcements
I'm high Meadow iveta and the problem
with recording in pacific time is that
you always get the timing wrong sorry
about the delay this is parking out
daily the official news today are a lot
is today a CS press day and you bet that
there will be a ton of announcements
going forward starting with HTC and
under armour as both companies have
teamed up with new solutions for fitness
and you would be shocked number one we
do have a wearable from HTC and under
armour we also have this very
interesting scale in addition to other
products but I would bore you links in
the description as we cover everything
that just got announced which is a lot
of suspension stuff that will reach the
pocket now fitness video coming very
soon speaking of fitness products Fitbit
has just decided to actually make a
SmartWatch people are willing to where
we're talking about the Fitbit blaze
which is sort of mimics the surge but
here you have a touch display you have
the same five days of battery life in
addition to certain Fitness sensors that
will make this very similar to the
charge HR but you're not really getting
a Fitbit surge it doesn't have a GPS for
example but overall this is a very
interesting product that looks great and
even more interesting is the fact that
it's actually cheaper than the surge and
only two hundred dollars of retail price
you can pre-order it now you get more
information again in the likes of the
description speaking of official
announcements Huawei just went all out
today as the company has announced a
couple of products starting with the
MediaPad m2 tablet in addition to the G
X 8 smartphone and we also have the
successor the made eight which is rather
cool we actually have review units of
these products we will have reviews
coming very soon but even more
interesting we get a new huawei watch
that's actually built for women and it
looks rather nice Adam doubt actually
likes it we'll keep you posted as we get
our full review coming very soon now
moving the spotlight over to rumors
believe it or not the iphone 7 is
apparently not going to bring a
headphone jack we have trusted sources
claiming that suppliers are already
preparing for that 3.5 millimeter
phone jack to not make the cut we're not
exactly sure if that is going to be the
case you have to remember that Apple is
very used to prototyping meaning for
sure that there is a prototype for this
but then again there could be a
prototype that doesn't do it in the
future so stay tuned there will be
conflicting rumors coming soon now the
biggest oddity of a trade show is that
the hottest news are actually a rumor as
we get the first CAD files of the galaxy
s7 showing us that the design might
change after all it seems that the back
is going to mimic the galaxy note5 and
giving us curbs and making it more
ergonomic but we're not exactly sure if
this is going to be the only product or
the curve galaxy s6 edge+ will get a
successor early or what the case is
going to be but you know what it leads
me to the question of the day tell me
something are you really interested in
curved displays I mean Samsung has been
doing it but it's the only company
that's done it right and the calc cs6
didn't really sell well so is it
something you care about it was a
comment down below alright actually do
like a friends as always you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was filmed
