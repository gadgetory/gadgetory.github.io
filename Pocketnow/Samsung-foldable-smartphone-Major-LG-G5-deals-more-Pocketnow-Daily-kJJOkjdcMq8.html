smartphone displays are actually not far
off US carrier started making a case for
what a good buy the LG g5 will be and as
Apple pre-orders go live we get to learn
some interesting new things I'm high
metal iveta and I know that some of you
want to learn more about all the news
regarding VR reaching a specific website
we sadly can't cover that here this is
 out daily the official news
today start with the LG g5 and Sprint's
those of you in the market for the
modular smartphone I highly suggest you
consider sprint because well if you
preorder which starts very soon you can
actually get an American Express card
with twenty dollars back I don't think
it gets any better than that but there
are obviously other options i would
highly suggest you follow the link to
the description for more details and the
reason why i say that there are other
really good options is because that LG
360 camera is extremely compelling and
just this t-mobile is offering that with
pre-orders you can now also get it on
Verizon Verizon just announced that if
you go for the g5 on the carrier yes
that 360 camera is being included not
really sure if you're getting that spare
battery too but it still makes a good
deal and particularly with the g5 being
such a good smartphone and if you stayed
up late like we did to pre-order you're
either 9.7 inch ipad pro or the new
iphone s ii yes our review units are
secured well this is rather interesting
as we've learned a few more things of
these products starting with the 9.7
inch iPad pro we learned yesterday that
it only had two gigs of ram and it
wasn't really exactly the same thing
that you're getting with the 12 point
nine inch model but the smart covers are
actually more expensive of the ipad air
2 even though the design is exactly the
same when it comes to dimensions another
thing is that if you're going for the 4g
LTE variant it's rather interesting as
the sim is now embedded we can't wait to
learn more of how that works when our
review unit arrives now one of the
products that we are expecting to make a
big splash is the HTC 10 and we cannot
wait for the company to regain its
limelight hopefully through this product
but as we continue learning
where there are some leaked benchmarks
today of them being compared to devices
like the Galaxy s7 edge and even though
specifications are pretty much on par
Snapdragon 820 4 gigs of ram this device
is significantly faster according to
benchmarks you know you can't trust
those things but we cannot wait to learn
more for the announcement and finally
the very hot news that they have to do
with Samsung mainly because the company
has now patented how foldable displays
will happen from the foldable display to
the fact that there is this a very
interesting hinge that will make it
happen and in the result what you're
pretty much getting is a clamshell phone
it'll close like the old clamshell
phones from back in the day open up
whenever you need to use it we just
wonder exactly how fragile this will be
and how simple it will just be to do it
like you did with the old motorola
startac what you just pulled it out of
your belt clip and flipped it open
really quick and we're able to take your
call or not we would love to know in the
comments down below if you would be
interested in a clamshell smartphone
because i am not going to lie I am I
love the days of the clamshell phones I
would love to see this come to
smartphones if they figure that one out
