I am here with David from HP who's going
to give us a quick rundown on the HP
Envy x2 hybrid tablet and PC Windows 8
device which I've just spoiled the
surprise on David please you got it
right with hybrids so we really designed
this to be a true hybrid PC for Windows
8 and really be able to use it any which
way you want to with Windows 8
so it's designed to be a notebook when
you want it to be a notebook or a tablet
when you want it to be a tablet so as a
notebook we started out with a really
small thin unlikely notebook it's about
3.1 pounds mm-hmm it's really thin it's
about 19 millimeters at its thickest
point then it slopes down it's so it's
all aluminum so it feels solid in your
hands and ready to go anywhere with you
when you open it up you've got a bright
11.6 inch IPS display that means it's
great viewable from any angle it's
really really bright about 400 nits so
you've got you've got a great display to
start with the nice thing about an 11.6
inch displays I can also have a full
size keyboard so now you can type
comfortably on all day and the spacing
is just like you'd expect on a full-size
notebook sure and then you've also got
we've spent a lot of time on basic
usability and things like an image pad
so they get an image pad that supports
all the windows 8 gestures so I can
swipe through all my apps very simply
with my image pad and use the
combination of the keyboard and the
mouse to be able to use Windows 8 very
easily of course if you want to just go
up and reach up and touch something you
can do that too so I've got full touch
enablement as well on the screen all
kinds of options
absolutely and since we're running the
full version of Windows 8 I can also
come over here and type away and be
productive with the full version of
Windows 8 I can run all my old apps and
then of course all the new modern apps
as well now go ahead whenever you want
to you know you're done being
quote-unquote productive however you
want to do it now you can also now kick
back and very simply pull it off and now
you've got a sleek modern tablet it's
about eight and a half millimeters thin
so
slightly thinner than an iPad boots
contoured on the sides
you've got cameras on the front and the
rear so you got an eight megapixel with
a flash on the rear and a two megapixel
camera on the front and what's the back
made of I'm sorry to interact it's all
aluminum as well so you've got a great
feeling it's you know totally fanless
totally quiet totally thin modern tablet
and it feels great in your hands it's
contoured to really fit really simply in
your hands it's lightweight it's about
1.5 pounds total very lightweight yeah
yeah I noticed this it's reminiscent as
I said earlier of the the Samsung
achieve but with a bit more substantial
building quality okay I'm gonna Simon on
the back okay yeah so you've got a nice
lightweight tablet and you've also got
with this since we sell this as a unit
together we really took care to make it
work all together and so that includes
things like having a battery both in the
tablet and in the base so that's gonna
give you double the run time oh really
so so now you and also what you can do
is is with we absolutely include magnets
in the tablet and in the base that
actually draws the tablet together and
then makes it drop in very easily
there's no resistance to attach it and
then you get that nice Ottoman click to
know that you're good to go integrated
unit so with the batteries on both sides
it's also great because now I can be
productive say I'm typing away for a
couple hours and then I decide I maybe
want to go down the street to the to the
coffee shop it drains the battery in the
base first before the battery and the
tablets and now I'm still got a fully
charged you're always leaving with a
hundred percent yes very nice yes our
viewers and readers tend to be a little
bit on the speck head side can you tell
me what's running a pair of you in the
room this is a it's actually a next
generation Intel SOC so they're calling
it clover trail it'll be announcing that
I believe next month so it so the great
thing about that processor is it's got
it's got good performance for
soc chip it'll run all your Windows
applications and it's going to give you
great battery life and it's gonna allow
you then that nice sleek slim fanless
design that everybody's wanting in their
tablets and then it also has two
gigabytes of RAM okay and that we think
that's good to run all your basic
Windows apps and then in terms of
storage what we did was since this is
really meant to be a notebook that can
also be a tablet it has 64 gigs of
storage built in standard and then if
you want to expand that you can actually
do that one of two ways you've got a
standard SD card slot right here on the
side so you can expand it in the base or
if you want to have expansion ready to
go anywhere you want to you've got right
here it's hard to see but if we've got a
teeny little micro SD card slot right
here so you also put it in the micro SD
card right there and expand that you
know those are up to 32 64 gig already
that can go ok so then that can go all
the way up to 64 and so you see you got
that and then in terms of ports you know
we wanted it to be a notebook so you've
got things like USB port here this is
the charging port and the charging port
you can actually charge through the base
or you can actually charge it in the
tablet itself so you can charge it
either way the dock is the same yes
exact same connector and then on this
side you've got another USB port as well
as I pull size HDMI connect your TV's to
your heart's content as well as an audio
jack which we and a half millimeter
headphone jack there and we also have an
audio jack on the tablet so if you're on
the go you can listen to your great
Beats Audio it seems like a really fully
featured device and the availability is
going to be a ability he'll be later
this fall so we're set we're gonna set
pricing a little bit closer to launch
I've got availability will be this
holiday that's wonderful all right
that's a real quick and dirty video from
