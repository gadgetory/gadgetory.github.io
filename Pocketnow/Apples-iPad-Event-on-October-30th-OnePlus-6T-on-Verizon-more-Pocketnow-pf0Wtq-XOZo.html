register for the livestream of the 1
plus 16 launch follow pocketnow.com / 1
+ 60 for more information we have an
official date for the presentation of
the iPad pro and other Apple products
Peter Lau has just confirmed some
features of the 1 + 60 and is hosting a
very nice contest and it seems that
Facebook doesn't want their founder to
continue taking care of the company I'm
Jaime Rivera and watch my Instagram
stories with the whole Porsche design
and Porsche experience along with the
mate 20 pro RS no paint 20 RS and it was
insane this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for the samsung
galaxy note 9 this is the time to buy
it's currently on eBay I'm talking the
Exynos variant for 770 dollars and we're
talking about full specifications and
everything obviously the entry levels
here which is still a great phone it's
the one I'm currently using you can
learn more about the deal in the
description now let's talk about Spotify
as well we saw the company launching
their application for garmin watches
we've seen that happen with galaxy
watches as well now it reaches where OS
in a more native fashion it allows
better controls and everything it's not
perfect you won't be able to download
Spotify music to the watch just yet and
there's a collaboration with fossil
indeed as well in order to be able to
have this preloaded on the watch I just
I hate the fact that it still requires
the phone but anyways now let's talk
about Facebook as well there are some
news that the board wants to get rid of
Mark Zuckerberg as the Chairman and
obviously it has a lot to do with all
the scandals that have been happening
these scandals have been really bad in
the United States and you know it's not
that I'm happy for somebody losing their
job but with everything that's been
happening I feel that barring Zuckerberg
should have taken there's a lot more
seriously when Congress approached them
about it and so apparently this might
come to a vote at some point not exactly
sure if it's gonna happen but let us
know what you think about it
right I know you don't care about
Facebook anymore that's right I should
do the same now let's talk about the
oneplus 60 once again follow the link of
the description to be able to register
to the live stream it's gonna be awesome
Peter Lau was recently
on record talking about the future of
the phone it seems that there will be a
native low light performance version in
the camera that should be awesome it's
gonna run Android Pi the fact that you
will be able to use it in Verizon or
other rumors and speculations that are
out there and probably the coolest part
is that apparently there is this a
contest where if you win you could get a
oneplus device for the next about 25
years I'm reading the script right and
there's probably a typo or something I
don't know but okay fine let's see if
that happens and finally the hot news
today have to do with Apple and events
this is gonna be oh my god October 30th
we have an event from Apple and an event
from oneplus both happening an hour away
from each other in New York City I'm
definitely gonna be at the oneplus event
so those of you that want to hang with
me I hope you bought an invitation so
you can participate it's gonna be great
but yeah Apple has it event they've been
testing a lot tests teasing a lot of
artistry in their website and apparently
that has to do with what to expect for
these devices we're expecting new iPad
pros we're expecting also new MacBook
Airs
let us know in the comments if you had
to pick only one event to participate in
which one would you participate in
because I really want new iPads but for
me the one plus 60 is more important

to know your opinion friends again if

of our channels English and Spanish for
