is becoming an increasingly competitive
market and LG wants to capitalize on
that question is can it I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is our
four of you of the LG blue supreme on
Verizon Wireless not everyone wants the
best of the best whether it's due to a
tight budget
fewer needs or smartphones simply being
low priority not everyone drools over
the expensive high-end flagship
smartphones like we here at pocket now
do
that's why low-end and mid-range er
still exist in mass however 2013 taught
us low-end budget smartphones are not
necessarily all bad the question is can
LG's 2014 mid-range err live up to the
high standards its competitors
entry-level smartphone set let's take a
look at LG's lucid 3 on Verizon to find
out hardware and especially appearance
are not strong suits for the Lucid 3 by
LG as an entry-level smartphone that's
understood and expected but where
devices like the g2 and galaxy s4 were
unmoving and felt cheap the lucid 3
takes that to a new level the casing of
the lucid 3 is made almost entirely of a
slick slimy plastic not unlike the g2
the dark patterned backside fades into
the silver trim along the edges and on
the front you'll find a combination of
capacitive back and menu buttons
flanking a fiscal home button the home
button like on the G pro doubles as a
multicolored notification LED but it
lacks proper tactile feedback and the
casing is like a never-ending ad with
Verizon and LG implement on both the
front and back of the phone at a quick
glance the lucid 3 sort of resembles the
g2 from LG but upon closer inspection of
the power of volume buttons navigation
buttons and the finer details it's clear
these two are not so closely related the
story inside the casing is much of the
same
it's powered by 1.2 gigahertz quad-core
CPU one gigabyte of RAM and it comes
with 8 gigabytes of fixed storage for
the microSD card slot for up to 64
gigabytes of additional storage it has a
5 megapixel primary camera VGA front
camera and a removable 24/40 milliamp
hour battery it also comes with a few
standard connectivity options NFC
Bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi b/g/n and LTE on
Verizon's network the IPS display is
like something straight out of 2012
diagonally it measures 4
point seven inches but it bears a
quarter HD resolution 960 by 540 pixels
at times color seemed faded and other
times they pop contrast is decent but
the black levels are fairly milky side
visibility is hit or miss and the edges
of text and icons are noticeably jagged
we've seen worse displays before but
it's definitely been a while the lucid 3
when you consider the price free on
contract or 1249 per month for 24 months
isn't a terrible deal at best the
hardware will squeeze a few Yuans out of
you then again if you're worried about
hardware and specifications this isn't
likely the phone for you anyway with
this phone you're going to get much of
the same experience you would expect of
LG's more high-end devices becomes
running KitKat Android version 4.4.2
beneath LG's heavily customized software
you could LG's qslide apps quick memo
knock-on and some not all of the
deep-seated customization options such
as LG steam engine the ability to change
fonts and the ability to rearrange quick
setting toggles in the notification
shade however you don't get slide aside
with the g2 s more granular features of
course geared towards first-time
smartphone buyers the easy home mode is
also available which puts the dialer and
other important apps and services front
and center on the device if you've used
an lg phone recently you'll be very
familiar with a software on the Lucid 3
it's missing a few of LG's core features
but the most important and useful
features remain intact the lucidity
wasn't exactly built for performance so
it's fortunate to be running KitKat
which significantly brought down the
minimum system requirements of Android
and supposedly boosted the performance
on lower end hardware the Luther 3 is
unnamed 1.2 gigahertz quad-core CPU
manages to power through most everyday
tasks with relative ease though we
didn't have to put the phone through too
much stress to experience lag and
hiccups the application drawer sometimes
takes a few seconds to load the phone
sometimes pauses before returning home
and task switching is noticeably slower
on this phone than others of roughly the
same caliber its performance and
synthetic benchmarks only corroborate
our findings it's passable but nothing
impressive we also experienced framerate
drops in some lighter games like
roid-rage
which made the game nearly unplayable on
a lighter note the network speeds have
been great here in the Charlotte metro
area averaging downlink speeds around 15
megabits
second and uplink speeds consistently
around five megabits call quality on the
other hand wasn't quite as noteworthy
colors were loud and crisp on our end
but we were told our audio was choppy
and muffled battery life appears to be
one of the few redeeming features of the
Lucid three who are testing it managed
to hold a charge pretty well even
through heavy usage gaming social
updates syncing to gmail accounts
snapping pictures and downloading apps
most will have no trouble mustering a
full day on a single charge and if you
do LG has thrown in a power saver mode
which kicks in at 30 percent the camera
continues the draft story however after
the one in mate we're not so quick to
judge resolution alone but the lucid 3
simply doesn't take compelling images
colors are true to life but images like
sufficient detail and show a lot of
noise even in bright outdoor photos low
light is also subpar it will suffice for
basic camera needs but don't expect to
frame any of the pictures you take to
the Lucid 3
in all we can't say we're terribly moved
by the Lucid three not necessarily
because it's a bad phone or a poor
choice but rather because there are
better deals available cheaper phones
with better specs and performance a
better overall user experience two years
ago this phone would have been par for
the course today it feels out of place
the Lucid 3 is a great choice for
first-time smartphone buyers who won't
be turned off by things like a low res
display all plastic build and slight
stutters and performance the phone is
far from gorgeous and even further from
being the best bargain around it's lost
somewhere between the nexus 5 and moto G
a middle ground we're not certain even
needs to exist for a more in-depth look
at the Lucid 3 in our final score be
