you'll know just how much we've drooled
over an Android foot bone over the last
couple of years and now that LG has
decided to give us a reason to smile
it's really hard to be at a trade show
and not want to be a geek about it I'm
high metal better with pocket now and
let's talk about the LG wine smart than
the LG icecream
even though today is all about flats
laughs from almost every OEM it's really
hard to the night some of us miss the
old days of experimentation LG has
proven to be one of those companies
that's willing to give different things
a try with designs like the LG G flex 2
but to see an Android flip phone is
definitely code for nostalgia the sad
news about these phones is that there
are currently only available in certain
countries like Korea not on our shores
definitely but trust me we dug deep to
get our hands-on experience with these
phones mainly because hey how cool is it
to remember the old days of the flip
phone and how cool is it to have a smart
phone that's actually capable of doing
this let's begin with the more elegant
LG wine smart which was made official in
Korea last September we've got a 3.5
inch 320 by 480 display definitely not
the best resolution a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor 1 gig
of ram 4 gigs of expandable storage and
a 1700 milliamp power battery the
display is a touchscreen but under it
we've got a full-fledged numeric keypad
that's also assisted by one of those old
deep pads that we used to love for
one-handed usability back in the day and
we've also got shortcut keys for
different applications in addition to
the typical Android navigation keys even
cooler is the sleek design of the wine
smart which is thin though we wish we
would see an external display just like
we used to see in the old flip phones
from back in the day now even though the
LG ice cream has a name of a product
you'd probably want to give your child
and not somebody else it is pretty much
the same phone as the wine smart in
almost every way same clip design the
same keys and really the only difference
is the color options that you get with
the ice cream in addition to the fact
that you get an extra eight gigs of
storage compared to the four gigs on the
wine smart both devices have the same
make megapixel camera is a primary
shooter and the VGA camera at the front
as well and both devices run Android 4.4
KitKat as well
the rest is pretty much left to your
taste since they've got the same numeric
keypad on the same features all that's
different is in its design
sadly you really can't ask for much when
it comes to power with these smart
phones for their form factors but we're
sure that there is a market of people
out there that are willing to give this
design a second try again I'm Hyneman
better with pocket now make sure you
follow us on social media subscribe to
youtube channel as well you can follow
me on twitter hi i'm underscore Iveta
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I am hi never
again thank you very much for watching
we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
