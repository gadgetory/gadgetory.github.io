pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
of the acer liquid the a-star liquid is
one of the less expensive unlocked
android devices that you can buy right
now selling for about 450 dollars which
is pretty good compared to say the nexus
one which is selling for five hundred
and thirty dollars unlocked the acer
liquid also does some cool things like
it has a qualcomm snapdragon processor
like the nexus one and unlike the nexus
one you can use AT&amp;amp;T 3G with this device
so that's a leg up there so let's take a
look at the Acer Liquid let's do the
unboxing Wow pretty cool cover there
some liquid looks to be a relatively
thin device although we're gonna have to
do some comparisons let's take a look
around the box and zoom in on the
specification so you can get a better
sense for what we're dealing with here
so we've the quad-band GSM phone with
tri-band UMTS and that UMTS 1900 will
get you 30g on AT&amp;amp;T uns most places in
the u.s. we have this also of HSDPA and
HSUPA we have the snapdragon processor
although it's not clocked at the 401
gigahertz it's actually 768 megahertz
it's also got 256 megabytes of RAM 512
megabytes of ROM smaller screen than the
Nexus One at just 3.5 inches diagonal
but it does have that higher resolution
WVGA we'll talk about all the specs
coming up soon in another video let's
unbox the rest ok here we go this is
actually the white model it comes in
black as well so we'll put this to the
side for a minute and see what else we
get in the box
kind of slides outwards those of you
that saw our review of the ISA neo touch
which runs Windows Mobile we'll see a
lot of similarities with this device
it's very much the same device but
running a different operating system so
we have some software here what looks to
be a screen protector they also caught
the s100 that's the sort of internal
name see what we have down here we have
a battery let's see how long
this is it is up sighs thirteen hundred
and fifty million powers it's pretty
good sighs see what else we have down
here we've got a two gigabyte microSD
card which is nice to have then we've
got the charger and all that other stuff
to come to expect and we've got some
headphones and a charging cable which
uses actually mini USB not micro USBs
the newer devices are starting to have
so let's take a look at the Acer Liquid
s 100 closer up pretty thin device the
white is very interesting reminds me of
kind of the iPhone a little bit thicker
than I would have liked right off the
bat it kind of feels a little bit
plasticky but it's very nice-looking on
the front there's just this nice piece
of glass covering the entire front of
the device we have these four Hardware
buttons on the bottom which is which are
of course the Android buttons and on the
back we've got just a white coating 5
megapixel camera you won't see
fingerprints too much on here because of
its white color volume up and down
rocker interesting love to take a closer
look at the hardware soon let's compare
it to other devices okay so next to the
Google Nexus One they obviously are both
Android devices but the screen on the
Nexus One is about 0.2 inches bigger the
Nexus One is also going to be
significantly thinner than the acer
liquid now let's take a look at the
iPhone in white next to the acer liquid
so about the same size screens here
slightly different try phones definitely
thinner and you get kind of a more
bright white over here on the east of
liquid because it's a brand new device
the iPhone is several months old so it's
turned a little bit off-white and next
to the monstrous HTC hd2 obviously the
acer liquid has a significantly smaller
screen but overall the hardware on the
Easter liquid looks quite nice a very
interesting design with this white
border all the way around the edge
haven't really seen a phone that looks
quite like that we've got a lot more
coming up on the acer liquid we're gonna
take a look at the software and a closer
look at the hardware this may turn out
to be a good device Burke for people
looking to get 3G in the u.s. on ATT
without spending
as much as the nexus one if you want an
acer liquid s 100 of your own be sure to
check out clove code UK where they're
currently selling this and shipping
worldwide that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
