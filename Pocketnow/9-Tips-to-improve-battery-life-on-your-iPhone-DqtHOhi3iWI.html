lean mean smartphone computing machines
but as iOS has grown and become more
robust users might not always get the
best runtime from their sleek iPhones
for folks not making it through the day
whittling back on some convenience
features might make the difference
between going the distance or needing to
find a charger here are 9 tips to help
maximize that battery number 9 don't
quit out of your apps
it might seem counterintuitive but
constantly quitting apps actually makes
your phone work harder once the app is
cleared from RAM the phone has to
completely reload the whole thing the
next time you open it we got to get away
from this notion of phones looking all
nice and clean with no apps in the
multitasking view instead start thinking
unused RAM is wasted RAM number 8 limit
background activity while letting an app
live in RAM is a good thing if it's
working a lot in the background we might
want to limit that activity look in your
battery stats to see which apps are
using the most juice then go to general
settings and background app refresh to
shut them down
I always disable Facebook for example
because well it's Facebook this point
runs double for location services if an
app is pulling your location frequently
shut that down to number 7 turned down
the screen brightness auto brightness is
convenient but if you push the backlight
lower you'll save more juice just swipe
up that control center to make a quick
adjustment we want to find that happy
medium between completely unusable and
mildly squinty that's how you know
you're doing it right number 6 set a
shorter auto lock we'll never understand
people who just leave their screen on
after using their phone just hit the
power button now for those of you who
can't be bothered to manually turn off
the screen setting a shorter auto lock
will reduce some of the power draw from
your laziness our iPhone 6s defaulted at
5 minutes of inactivity 5 wasted minutes
of electricity drop that down to like 30
seconds and your phone will last longer
during the day number 5 radios when you
need them yup it's super convenient to
leave Wi-Fi on all the time and when
you're on Wi-Fi you'll use less power
than connecting over LTE
but when you're not connected to Wi-Fi
that radio is still drawing power
looking for something to hook up
ditto your Bluetooth it connects to so
many useful accessories like speakers
headphones and cars but if you're not
using it you're wasting battery disable
these radios when you're not using them
and while you're at it if you never use
airdrop you can toggle that off from the
control center to number four good
vibrations
pulses and vibrations for alerts are
delivered via a tiny little motor if you
don't need the buzz turn it off to save
a little extra juice hit up the sounds
category in your settings to toggle this
it's not going to be a tremendous
battery saving but every little bit
helps right number three disable the eye
candy sure took Apple a while to deliver
animated wallpapers and sure it's fun to
look at but that fun feature is probably
killing the last couple minutes of your
phone's battery iPhone home screens are
basically just an app drawer anyway
right keep it simple
and save some juice likewise the
parallax effect looks cool as your phone
moves around but it also subtly taxes
the GPU of your phone
head to your accessibility settings to
switch this off to number to manage your
iCloud a lot of info is backed up to the
cloud these days if you lean on your
iCloud a lot it might be reducing the
amount of time you can use your phone
for other things
check out the iCloud settings and
disable everything but your most
mission-critical needs and the number
one tip low power mode is your friend
throttling back the power of your phone
will noticeably extend your run time if
you don't want to manually disable stuff
then this one switch in your battery
settings will act as a catch-all
disabling background activity and
turning off some of the eye candy give
it a try if you're not a power user low
power mode might be the right fit for
you bonus tip by big or by little one
additional tip for folks shopping an
iPhone buying the larger plus or buying
the smaller se might be the way to go
for folks wanting the best battery life
in general lifestyle testing the medium
sized iPhone might be the poorest
performer of the bunch
even though it has a slightly larger
battery than the smaller iPhone it also
has a bigger higher resolution screen at
the phablet end the larger battery
capacity of the 6s plus more than makes
up for the increase in screen size and
resolution and there you have it folks
nine ish tips for maximizing that iPhone
battery now seeing as how our phones are
increasingly
centerpieces of our mobile lifestyles we
totally understand why some people might
be looking at chargers and batteries

to keep those lightning cables handy and
