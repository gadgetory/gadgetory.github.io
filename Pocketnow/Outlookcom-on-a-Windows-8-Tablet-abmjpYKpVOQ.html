pocketnow.com and Microsoft just
announced a new free email service
called outlook.com it's kind of a
replacement to hotmail and we thought
we'd take a look and see how it works on
a tablet PC let's check it out
so we're here in Windows 8 release
preview and if I go to Internet Explorer
I've got outlook.com already loaded and
see the tabs are here and I've already
logged in with my hotmail address and
you see it's quite different from
regular hotmail and let's see how it
works with touch see if I scroll through
the list my top bar stays there but I
have a lot of area to view the list so
let's choose an email to open that one
and now you can see the email reading
view we have a very large area now your
folders on the side still we have some
ads at the top we have our functions we
can categorize you can move to all those
are real easy to touch now on the
desktop you can click and drag some of
these messages and drop them into other
folders but that's our the work on the
touch tablet unless I use my stylus now
I can't drag it over there or into junk
or into whatever and you see it's a
paying attention there you also don't
get the mouse over functions unless you
use your stylus so you can see those
there or your mouse of course on a
desktop and one other cool thing here is
this little messaging button now with
other like the old hotmail used to see
all your Facebook and messager friends
listed online you don't see that here so
but if you tap that's where you see all
your friends are online show up in this
list so you can either start typing a
person or choose them from the list
however this has a little bug if I try
to
roll through it works but then it it
starts chatting with whoever I touched
first now up here there's another menu
it's kind of hidden there we go you got
to touch it just right it's very hidden
a little menu button Kimberley acts so
very easily but then there's a very
touch friendly tiles show up and you can
choose other ones calendar and SkyDrive
are not with the Metro theme yet but
people are so from here it looks like a
actual metro app you can filter your
contacts from here you can manage groups
you can manage all sorts of other things
there's your groups cleanup contacts and
vitam s injure and do new all that's
right there and what's interesting is
this social integration right from here
all my Twitter contacts are listed here
and I can tweet to them also in the
email there's your Settings button up
here we can choose different colors we
have different accent colors we can also
turn on our reading pane and with the
quick views over here we have documents
let's choose that one
and then from here you can see if the
documents are attached and you can view
them online and it's going to load in
the Office Web Apps except for the PDFs
so that's a quick look at the new
outlook comm preview which looks a lot
like a Windows 8 Metro app and works
pretty nicely with the touch sensitive
tablet don't forget to give this video a
thumbs up and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
