S tens display and there are very little
bezels here Media Tech just announced
their hey Leo p9d chipset and it gives
MIT Rangers a shot at AI and for those
of you who use an Amazon echo and Apple
music the streaming services are
apparently to get together I'm Jaime
Rivera and don't forget for those of you
that participated in the Spanish
PocketNow daily we're gonna have the
audio with the giveaways the winners are
gonna be announced today this is parking
out daily sponsored by swap up the
official loose today begin with deals of
Amazon has decided to follow ship after
Samsung announced 12 days of deals now
it begins with Amazon pretty much up
until December 13th where there will be
different deals every day but obviously
before you get bored about seeing deals
for diapers and things like that well it
seems that on December 10th is when that
deals for electronics begin you can
learn more in the description now sorry
about the 1 plus 60 is apparently there
are complaints about the display but
these are rather sporadic I mean I have
four units across all team members and
we don't have any units with the display
just yet but apparently some people are
noticing artifacts when it comes to the
notification tray in other areas so let
us know what the comments are if you're
having any issue the company has not
shined them yet now let's talk about
Amazon Alexa which I actually have to
talk rather slowly because there's
another one over there at the end and
Apple music as I'm definitely not a fan
of Apple music but there has been
Spotify integration for the longest time
when it comes to you know Amazon echoes
and now Apple music is going to join
ship as of December 17th you will be
able to link both services which is
great actually like Amazon's Alexa
speakers you know these echoes are
actually doing a fantastic job but Apple
music that that one's not my favorite
now let's move the spotlight over to the
company that actually builds the chips
for these Amazon echoes if you didn't
know that's mediatek the company has
just announced its new Helio p90
processor for those of you that don't
know this is the processor that powers
that line up is the one that powers the
premium mid-range and the company plants
the bet very high when it comes to
I 50% faster performance in a new fusion
AI core that's being added to this
chipset I recently flew at I paid to be
able to see everything that's coming
you'll be able to see it on devices
believe it I believe after December 13th
or it will be unveiled and I assume that
will be getting a unit with it we'll
keep you posted on that one
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10
screen protectors and very little bezels
there's a particular reason why we're
covering this again ice universe just
recently leaked the screen protector
where the bezels are nearly
indistinguishable I don't even know why
they're painting them anymore I mean
might as well just make a completely
transparent screen protector and let the
bezels just cover that up but the point
is does any of you notice a cut out on
that display cuz I don't see any and
we're not exactly sure if it's that the
Infinity Oh will not need will not be
bothered by it won't require this play
cutout I guess I don't what the case may
be but let us know in the comments what
do you think do you think this is just a
variant of the s10 or that cutouts won't
be available on all cuz in my case I
think that's the case I hear that there
are up to four units so that could be
what we're looking at but we'll keep you
posted soon leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know what you think
