the oneplus 60 and yes the fingerprint
scanner is missing there is a heavy
possibility that the galaxy s 10 is
going to be 5g capable according to some
data and if you were waiting for new
iPads at the Apple event don't lose your
hope just yet shows I I'm hi mary vera
and welcome to a video that's full of
rumors and renders because official news
are boring today this is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with a
teaser and it starts with Nokia the
company has surprised us with their
smartphones lately with all the products
that they've been launching and it seems
that they're not done now the company is
apparently working on a gaming phone as
they just sent the teaser and all it
says is game on it it has the silhouette
of a smartphone so we're assuming that
we should expect the gaming phone from
Nokia let's just hope they include some
hardware to back that up as you know
just another phone to play while
manipulating the glass display is is
kind of what other phones can already do
now let's talk about Huawei the
company's chairman just came on record
to talk about foldable displays there's
a lot of technology coming in here but
according to the company's chairman
they're working on this because they
want these foldable displace to
completely eradicate computers where
these replace computers and according to
him 5g is going to be a major part of
what to expect with this hardware 2019
are the possible dates let's see how
that's going to get the job done
now for those of you waiting for iPads I
was the primary one waiting for an iPad
pro replacement because mine is getting
old and we've got some leaks from iOS 12
that show us that yes there is a fall
2018 iPad and the works not exactly sure
if it's an iPad iPad pro what exactly is
that we're getting we hope we're getting
both but regardless of the case we hear
so many changes in the design and if
you've noticed iOS 12 one of the things
that I'm annoyed about is that now the
now the Notification Center is on one
side and the notifications are on the
other and no the control centers on the
other and so it looks like an iPhone 10
meaning we might be getting a notch here
now let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 variants their source code being
leaked on xda-developers that
shows things that are really important
particularly the amount of variance like
we've known that the code for this phone
is beyond in certain cases and now we
notice that there is one that says
beyond 5g so for those of you that we're
wondering if we're getting in galaxy s
10 with 5g apparently we are the thing
is give it a time line up the chips and
everything I don't think it's gonna
happen at the same time as the Galaxy S
ten launches I feel that it's probably
gonna be a mini launch of a 5g variant
but let's see and finally the hot news
today I have to do with the oneplus 60
because of two things the first one is a
some leaked renders the show as a
comparison between the body of the six
in the body of the sixty where the sixty
is a bit larger and there is no
fingerprint scanner and then we also get
this teaser video for India that was
leaked that pretty much shows an actor
telling us about the greatness of being
able to unlock your phone in a cool way
yes so this pretty much could hint to
the fingerprint scanner on the display
let us know in the comments what do you
think do you think that these renders
are cool do you like what's coming for
the 60 because in my case I won't lie I
got the oneplus X is probably one of my
favorite phones this year I am really
looking forward to the 60 leave us a
