iPhones including features for face
Heidi that we really want the price tag
for the LGG seven thinkyou emerges a few
days ahead of its possible launch in the
US and it looks like we should be
expecting a blackberry key too and very
soon I'm Jaime Rivera and you know it's
funny
Diego has only been doing this for a few
months and he's already run out of jokes
help him out in the comments this is
Parkin out daily
the official news today begin with okay
we're gonna call them deals because they
are but oh my god
so I do consider that the pixel book is
the most overpriced computer out there
it doesn't change the fact that it's
gorgeous and that every person that I
talked to that has one loves it so for
Mother's Day it's $100 off but it's
still scratching a thousand bucks its
$8.99 now and then for the you know up
tier variant which I have no idea why
you would ever do that it's 1,600 bucks
so again if you're in the market for an
overpriced Chromebook that's actually
really cool look at the description now
let's talk about LG and the g7 think you
expect our review coming this week for
the phone our retail variant is in we
haven't brought you a review before
because it was a prototype thing about
it is well I love going to LG events and
them not providing any price tags so we
had to calculate from the Korean recent
announcement and if you convert that
price it comes to around 700 bucks which
is pretty much what the g6 would cost if
you're in the market for that phone
that's what it will cost you now that
I've been testing the final unit oh I I
really like the phone actually now let's
talk about the BlackBerry key - yes key
- is apparently the name of the next
BlackBerry key one apparently there are
some major design changes dual cameras
and for those of you that are wondering
when it'll launch I'm one of them
apparently it's very soon it's already
being certified by the Wi-Fi legions and
also Bluetooth SIG so it's only a matter
of time I would say probably weeks but
hey that's just my speculation this is
we already talked about the LG G 7 thank
you this is rather interesting
apparently the manufacturer for the LCDs
of the LCD variant of the iPhone will be
LG and it'll be the panel with the RGB W
arrangement that we see in the g7 thank
you that's probably one of the things
that I like the most about this phone
even if it's an LCD Wow it is extremely
vibrant and it's gorgeous but yeah
apparently this LCD is coming now bear
in mind apparently this phone is going
to be a little thicker because the LCD
technology
a little extra space to accommodate it I
can't wait to hear more and finally the
most interesting news today have to do
with the iPhone 10 2018 we already
talked about the LCD iPhone let's talk
about the OLED ones particularly the
iPhone 10 plus apparently this phone is
going to be huge how huge I mean the
iPhone 8 plus is an extremely large
phone I would consider it almost too
large for my hands it's it scratches
right there with the Galaxy Note 8 and
still apparently this phone is going to
be all displayed so it's 6.5 inches
diagonal but apparently it'll take up
all the same screen real estate that we
currently have with the sorry body
realistic that we currently have with
the iPhone 8 plus so imagine an iPhone 8
plus that's all screen that is huge and
then apparently in the case of the
iPhone 10 the regular variant that's
gonna get a revamp it's gonna remain the
same size and then the LCD iPhone is
going to be somewhere in the middle this
is all great of most important face ID
apparently you're now going to be able
to unlock your phone while horizontal
thank you but that's not the only thing
that's coming with the new update but
we're still waiting to hear more they
just weren't specific and today's
question let us know what do you think
would you be interested in an iPhone 10
plus that's all scream because in my
case oh my god give me the notch any day
if you give me a screen that large but
that's my opinion leave us a comment
