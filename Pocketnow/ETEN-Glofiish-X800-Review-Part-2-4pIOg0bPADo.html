pocketnow.com and this is part two of
the video review of the eaton glofish
x800 we're actually going to turn on the
device now I've just recently reflashed
this because I was having problems with
Iran and let's take a look I haven't
done anything to this device this is
what you can expect out of the box it's
kind of hard to tell here but the screen
is very crisp it's vga 2.8 inch screen
and everything is just super sharp I'm
actually going to turn the screen
brightness up a bit because it's kind of
low and because I just turned it on
nothing's in program memory so it takes
a while to open and I'm going to go to
the system tab and it's being okay there
goes and backlight and here it is drag
it to the right okay hopefully that's
that's easier to see now so let's go
back to the today's screen here you get
a trial version of spb mobile shell
which is a great program in full but the
the trial program is kind of crappy you
you get these four tabs at the top which
will let you you know have a program
launcher do do an alarm situation you
could do weather and over here on the
right you can do quick dial and so it's
kind of a lite version I really wish
that included the full version this is a
600 plus dollar device and they give you
trial where it has the speed dial
contact on here which I really like you
can have it go by frequency or you can
you can find the person's name so if I'm
looking for you know Dan I press the d I
really like the speed dial because what
you can do is just assign one of these
squares to someone you contact often and
it's easy to just press it and go so
that's that we have a live search
plug-in right here although I wish that
was google i don't use live search too
often ok let's go into the program menu
see what's in there pretty standard
stuff though there are some extras in
games that's standard and also you
should notice in the upper right corner
there's a little less you can see that a
little battery meter there that's
convenient now let's see what's in gps
we have gps viewer which will show you
where you are your longitude and
latitude and location SMS here which
I've never
really used you can kind of SMS someone
your location your x and y-coordinates I
don't see how that would be very useful
but perhaps for some people let's go to
multimedia and it's loading it's a
little bit slow it's definitely a little
bit slow as you can see here we have the
camera FM tuner though that only works
if you have headphones on let me open
that and there it is so I'm going to
close that and multimedia manager which
kind of is like a file file browser
though really made for multimedia so you
can see thumbnails and that sort of
thing and then name card manager
something else I've never really used
I'm assuming what this does and yes
that's what it does is it it's kind of
like the the Titan to where you can take
a picture of a business card and it will
it will recognize the characters on it
and store it as a contact so that's
that's a welcomed addition let's close
this let's go on to phone see what we
have here we have a drink tone scenarios
which is the same as profiles for
windows mobile standard or smartphone we
can do a multimedia message and I just
tapped on that it's taking forever to
open of course and here comes so if you
want to send pictures that kind of thing
no I don't want to save okay here we
have speed dial which you will probably
look familiar that's what we showed
before okay I'm going to get out of here
let's go into utility see what's there
so we have application recovery which
I'm assuming will recover certain
applications obviously and you can let's
see what we have here well this is if
you uninstall an application that was
built in bye-bye eaten and then you can
just install it again such as the speed
dial or the mobile shell these
applications actually install when you
first turn on the device after get it
out of the box and it takes about five
minutes to install the programs kind of
like the eighteen t tell if you if you
if you have that device you know when
you turned it on it took a while until
you can actually use the phone we have a
simple backup utility Bluetooth manager
em desk which is pretty cool you can
access this M desk by pressing the HOME
key I kind of like this
then you get this little switcher here
you can change it to landscape quick
access scenarios flashlight which will
actually just turn the the white LED on
in the back here let's see what else
file browser it's just a quick way to
access some some typically used
functions and if i press it again it
will take me into this which is kind of
the same thing though in this tab base
navigation I don't find this very useful
I think it's kind of ugly looking to be
honest and here we can change some
settings about it and it's thinking
thinking and we can check off what we
want to to display in this M desk
launching application so I'm going to
get out of that go back to where we were
before okay we've default settings if
you want a hard reset your device I had
to do that already because I was having
problems with it not sure why task
manager is always helpful to have and
it's an interesting-looking task manager
because what it lets you do is click and
drag items into the trashcan and you
didn't see that but there was a little
animation that kind of had fire going on
in the trash can interesting so that is
that let's go to voice commander you
have voice commander it's not the
Microsoft version of a voice command but
it's voice commander which works okay
but I like voice command better going
down the list we have the standard
things you know internet sharing file
browser wireless manager let's see what
that looks like and you've got to get
the kind of eaten big wireless manager
that you can press with a finger so
let's get out of that and that's pretty
much it for programs let me go into
settings see if there's anything
interesting there standard things here
for the today screen we can uncheck that
live search I was talking about so that
it goes away I don't really like it okay
we can go over to system and we can make
sure you have error reporting off its
off by default on the X 800 that's good
check out memory what we have right now
I'm working with it for a few minutes
now and program memory we only have a
tiny 40
6 megabytes I have no idea why there is
hardly any program memory in fact if you
launch the camera application while you
have a few applications open you'll get
a message on the screen that says out of
memory it's amazing for a high-end
device that should not be a problem
storage space is about 170 free right
now is 142 because we've some things
installed and that's that's pretty much
it for the memory and and that's pretty
much it i mean everything else is really
standard you have some options for spb
mobile shell though because it is the
trial version you have limited
functionality you can't really do
everything that you can with the full
version which is great we've reviewed it
at pocket now and give it very high
marks so that is the e 10 x 800 nothing
terribly compelling in the software
Department and it really bothers me that
there's so little program memory the vga
screen looks fantastic I know you can't
tell how great it looks because we're on
YouTube right now but I will be
comparing a can I will be making a
comparison video between the X 800 the x
500 x 500 as a QB a vga screen and show
you what it looks like in terms of
screen data and how much you can fit on
the screen with a vga screen because
it's it's four times the amount of
pixels and a lot more a lot more
information that you can put on at one
time so that will do it for part two of
the video review of the e10 glofish x
800</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
