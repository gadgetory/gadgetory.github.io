launched its first mp3 player back in
2005 and the company has decided to
celebrate with a launch event and with a
couple of new products I'm Jaime Rivera
with pocket now here in Beijing with our
hands on the Oppo r7 oboes our lineup
has always been about defying the
boundaries of design just like in the
case of the OBE or 5 which was crowned
thinnest smartphone of the world last
year at least for a short period of time
we expected to see the same mentality
with today's launch of the Oppo r7 but
instead we see a company focused on
refining what was be done last year the
over wash 7 is actually a family of
products now and we'll talk about the
Oppo r7 plus in a separate video the r7
is actually the more traditional and
convenient product up to the extent of
sporting a smaller 5-inch 1080p AMOLED
display when compared to its predecessor
and using less walk speed now down to
1.5 gigahertz on the same Snapdragon 615
processor that we saw in last year's
model it is better in the fact that it
sports 3 gigs of ram that it's 16 gigs
of storage is now expandable via microSD
and then now we have a 23 20 milliamp
hour battery that still supports OPOs
loop rapid charging technology other
improvements come in the hand of a more
refined unibody metal construction with
curves at the bottom for better grip and
even 2.5 feet glass at the top to
complement the new curved approach
design it's camera also sees of
improvements internals with a 13
megapixel ISO cell primary shooter under
an F 2.2 aperture lens and an 8
megapixel wide-angle front facing camera
Oppo also claims to have spent
significant time improving the camera
experience with new faster focus
technologies among other features we've
got a new version of color OS this time
2.1 that mimics its predecessor in
certain ways and betters it in others
the UI is familiar in lacking an app
tray but different in the fact that it's
the iconography has been flattened to
match more of what we see with Google's
material design but speaking of material
design one major caveat of this OS is
that it's still powered by Android 4.4
or KitKat at launch and we're will see
its larger sibling launching with the
same color west 2.1 but based on android
5.1 lollipop so far our experience with
the new Oppo r7 has been quite positive
the fact that Oppo has returned to a
more conventional design by even
bringing back the headphone jack is
really cool but obviously you will have
to wait for our overview for us to give
you more information just keep in mind
we've got more coverage coming from
Beijing from opals launch events so make
sure you follow us on social media
