and in this video we're going to show
you android with HTC Sense running on
the HTC hd2 let's get to it
now of course this is running through
the Harry XE Linux bootloader but in the
past a lot of devices on XD developers
that typically run Windows Mobile can
run the Android very very well to the
point where you can use it as your daily
operating system so Wi-Fi works and
cellular data works and everything like
that works on the hd2 it's not there yet
as you're going to see this is just the
start of hopefully good things to come
for hd2 owners right now it's going to
go into Android so I'll come back in a
minute
alright and we are loading into Android
here on HTC hd2 always quota C I'm going
to let it load it's going to be very
slow and overall not usable but it's
cool that we're getting there this is
the first step of many to getting a
smooth Android working on the HTC hd2 so
let's let it load alright and here we
are so this is sense we can swipe to the
left like I said it's buggy so it
doesn't always do what you want it to do
so let me get it back to the home screen
ok so we can swipe to the left loading
the mail application so I begin we are
in the HTC messaging application and
swipe over to the left again there
should be probably nothing there
back to the center we can swipe to the
right these are favorites you can add a
contact let's see what happens if we tap
on that should go to the add contacts
screen right and there it goes we can
select a contact to add to our favorites
let's go back home go into the program
list here which is slow to load of
course and some things work and most
things do not let's jump into the
settings to see if we can get wireless
radios turned on it looks like it's in a
flight mode right now okay here we are
would go to wireless and networks but
actually seems to be getting a little
bit faster as I use it and it's in
airplane mode but it's kind of switching
in and out so if
uncheck it it kind of just goes right
back into airplane mode and then there's
an error message so we're getting there
a very very good first step there's a
lot left to go to get this to be usable
but you can follow the progress at the
thread at xda-developers I'll put a link
up in that's in the sidebar and on the
post on pocketnow.com we can go into the
foreign application and see the dialpad
but we cannot dial out because it's not
recognizing the SIM card so dialpad
somebody that's it for now
please give the video a thumbs up if you
like Android on the hd2 and we'll be
sure to follow it closely for you and
also subscribe to our channel

that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
