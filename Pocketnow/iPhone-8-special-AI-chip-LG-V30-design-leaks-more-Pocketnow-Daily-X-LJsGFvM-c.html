step in AI with the iPhone 8 we're
reminded of the LGV 30 and what the
device might bring according to rumors
and one-plus launches a referral program
to share some love with new customers at
old I'm high metal Yvette I'm back with
another crazy we could travel in odd
times for videos this is PocketNow daily
the official list today begin with deals
the LG G 6 continues to be one of the
phones we most recommend this year if
you're in the market for a variant
that's unlocked there's this really cool
deal on eBay right now $510 that I
highly recommend you consider in the web
in the description now let's talk about
another deal that some of you might
consider google play music has been
struggling to gain some limelight for
years right now you can actually get
four months for free and then you just
pay $99 after that now bear in mind
obviously there are country restrictions
and this is only for new customers by
the way so just create a new account log
into Google and then just take it off
anyway now it's not about oneplus and
their new referral program if you have
been a customer of the company ever
since the oneplus one pretty much
there's this new program where if you
refer two friends and they actually use
your referral code they will get $20 off
their purchases and you will get a
hundred points in the oneplus Store
which will allow you to get whatever you
want with these deals obviously the more
points you get the better and with the
fact that the one plus five is on its
way huh kind of makes sense now let's
move the spotlight over to the next
flagship from LG if you remember that
was mentioned at Google i/o the next
flagship from LG and famous tipster Evan
blast just reminded us of the designs
that came up from projects Jone which
could be the LGB 30 bear in mind we've
got dual cameras without any camera hump
we have this interesting screen at the
bottom that slides the top for you to
have that secondary display actually was
for you a little obviously use it I
currently don't use the secondary
display on the LGB 20 more on the B 10
at time because of its placement at the
top so yeah B 30 probably later this
year and finally the very hot news today
is that if mr. Vettel has been named the
new Barcelona head
it's not what is it iPhone 8 iPhone 8
again Apple's neural engine is
apparently what the company is working
on just like the m10 motion coprocessor
we have this new chip that's coming but
apparently is not just going to be on
the next generation iPhone Apple is
going to use this on almost everything
apparently it'll do better facial
recognition in position to a better
keyboard more see refun canal 'ti a lot
of stuff that could be happening as of
this next generation iPhone but it
actually leads me to today's question
how important would it be for Syria to
get better on the next generation iPhone
meaning would that be a selling point
for you in my case if I can't really
talk to it naturally meaning I have to
be saying hey Siri all the time I won't
really care but anyways leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends we love the way it
goes if you want to get the little
earlier before the videos filmed follow
what I'm talking out comment hit that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one can also follow me
on Twitter heinie underscore eggs that
are on Instagram at high metal Iveta
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I am high netting
that I think so much for watching we'll
see it's long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
