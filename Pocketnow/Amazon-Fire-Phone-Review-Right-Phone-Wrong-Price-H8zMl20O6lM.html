is finally here we've shown you its most
fun features and run through its camera
capabilities over at pocketnow.com and
now after six days of testing it's time
to tell you whether you should be
playing with fire and before we plop
down any more predictable puns let's get
started i'm michael fisher with pocket
now and this is the Amazon fire phone
video review the fire phone is a
mid-sized handheld featuring once
striking now predictable glass sandwich
construction its build consisting of
Gorilla Glass and rubberized
polyurethane heavily resembles the Nexus
4 while its size and shape 10 more
toward the iPhone 5 it comes in any
color you want as long as it's black and
while it is quite susceptible to
fingerprints it feels nice and
substantial in the hand it's powered by
a very capable set of specs and though
its display is only 720p at 4.7 inches
we don't mind for all the focus on ultra
resolution panels these days the fire
phones 315 pixels per inch are still
plenty and the four cameras dotting the
corners enable a feature that makes
resolution much less noticeable that
feature is called dynamic perspective
and it enables the best handheld 3d
effect we've ever seen yes it's a
gimmick at heart but Amazon has woven in
some practicality here as well
tilting the screen reveals details
otherwise hidden like the status bar up
top they're helpful descriptors on menu
items it's odd at first but you get used
to it over time along with the gesture
driven flick action the fire phone
recognizes to pop open side panels in
most apps sure you can use your thumb if
you're too self-conscious to do this on
the train or at the bar but the flick is
handy for one-handed use as is the tilt
to scroll effect in the browser even
putting the bells and whistles aside
it's hard not to appreciate a new
interface after months and months of the
same old thing the homescreen carousel
displays recently used apps books movies
and so on in an almost never-ending
ribbon up top
while down below a context menu appears
for each of them allowing you to do
things like delete emails without even
opening the
having the carousel on top and the
context menus down below looks good but
for usability we wish it was inverted
it's awkward to be constantly reaching
up to the ribbon all the time also not
all apps can take advantage of the
action area often they just display
related titles in the Amazon App Store
which is not very helpful speak to the
App Store well if you're like us it'll
impress you at first with popular titles
and there are even some cool games here
that take advantage of the fires dynamic
perspective but take much deeper than
that and you're reminded that this isn't
the Google Play Store Gmail Google Maps
hangouts nowhere to be found in Amazon's
marketplace if you're not too reliant on
Google's ecosystem well then the fire
phone will probably feel a lot like
Windows Phone in the sense that its
stock apps are well designed responsive
and attractive so it's not all bad but
the fact that many mobile sites identify
the fire phone as an Android device and
prompt you to download the app instead
even when such an app doesn't exist is
galling and only serves to remind you of
the limited catalog you're forced to
deal with if you don't want to sideload
apps Amazon's media offerings are much
more impressive of course the company
has found a nice way to showcase this
using Firefly a nicely designed app
which is the main reason people have
taken to calling the fire phone an
expensive barcode scanner but it can do
more like replace Shazam as a song
identifier and we really like how
quickly it can identify a movie or TV
show - the free year of Amazon Prime you
get when you buy a fire phone is also
nice but in terms of media at least it
doesn't bring quite enough to overcome
the app stores lack of many quality
titles if there's one glaring problem
with the fire phone it's a familiar one
for smaller platforms the ecosystem
shooting photos with the fire phones 13
megapixel camera is a lot of fun the
viewfinder is simple and can be launched
with a touch of the side key and it's
smart it suggests HDR when applicable
which can then be enabled with a tap it
also offers a fun lenticular shooting
mode so you can create photos that
respond to dynamic perspective photo
quality itself is okay
the fire phone has the same exposure
sensitivity issue as some other devices
we've seen so where you focus has a big
effect on whether a photo is washed out
or very dim there's also not much
dynamic range saturation is often on the
low side and while HDR does help
sometimes it also washes out colors even
more while introducing more fuzz to the
picture low-light performance certainly
isn't the worst we've seen but it's also
nothing spectacular
despite the optical image stabilization
on the upside all of the photos you take
are backed up on Amazon Cloud storage
for free 1080p video recording is fun in
that you get a nice smooth image on the
viewfinder that said the focus tends to
drift easily the colors don't pop quite
as much as we'd like once again and the
microphone is very easy to cover up
accidentally without knowing it the fire
phone is well designed from an audio
standpoint at least for voice calls
there's great warm side tone in the
earpiece and in loudspeaker mode one
color said they couldn't tell we were on
a speakerphone the speakers are mounted
at top and bottom which makes for some
nice stereo effects in landscape but
while they're loud they're also so tinny
that we really don't like using them if
we don't have to fortunately the fire
phone comes with earbuds in the box
their acoustic merits are debatable but
they do feature magnets to keep them
bonded and that great linguini style
wire that we liked so much
the fire phone is exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T so
you'll be happy to know that our testing
on big orange went quite well
LTE speeds initially weren't as
blazing-fast as we've grown accustomed
to but they sped up as our six-day
review period went on and having
coverage everywhere from the burbs to
the Boston subways is always nice as we
mentioned before gaming is a real
pleasure on such powerful Hardware but
you're definitely going to want to take
a charger with you if you're planning on
anything close to heavy use we haven't
even been able to get to four hours of
screen on time with the fire phone and
we've absolutely needed to charge it
every night usually before the day is
even over while we are using it more
heavily than you probably well this is
no phone for road warriors in a sense
the fire phone is surprisingly
predictable it brings equal parts and
novel delights and first generation pain
points on the plus side its interface
really is a breath of fresh air Amazon
features like whisper sync x-ray ASAP
and others really are useful and even
its gimmicks are charming mainly because
they actually work the way they're
supposed to the stumbling block here is
the ecosystem hit combined with a price
point that's just too high considering
the competition if every other platform
out there bores you to tears or if this
is your first smartphone or if you
really are a die-hard Amazonian in every
sense well then the fire phone is a
great Buy but that's a pretty small
audience for everyone else you'll get a
lot more for your money going with one
of the major platforms Amazon's first
smartphone isn't a bad product by any
means but it is twice the price it
should be for more on the Amazon fire
