apple store near you as soon as teasing
is the launch of their padfone mini for
next month and cyanogenmod 11 m one
reaches most google nexus smartphones
and tablets I'm hi Mary Mehta and let's
do something how about if you do the
friday joke this time in the comments
down below this is pocket out daily
listeners day off with some official
news as a sous is already teasing us
their pet phone mini to be launched next
month but wait right there because I'm
first of all this is not really an
appealing device we're talking about a
device with a qHD display in this decade
not year decade and it just makes the
device completely unappealing and it
makes me wonder I mean as soon as
struggled to sell this Pat phone and the
three times they've launched it so I
wonder what they're planning with this
mini phone because it's not gonna make
it sell anymore now let's talk about
cyanogenmod Inc yeah the company they
have just launched an engine wat 11m one
meaning milestone one and it currently
works with almost every Nexus device
including tablets and smartphones and
that even includes the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus that a lot of you were mad about
for not getting KitKat you can pretty
much solve that problem very soon and
obviously that means that we are
expecting to get cyanogenmod knightley's
and milestones for other devices very
soon hopefully the hurry up now let's
talk about Oppo as the company is
working on becoming the first Android
OEM to support the Snapdragon 805
processor that we talked about a couple
of weeks ago which is description for
full details on that and that's not the
hottest news here we're talking about
the company also working I'm competing
with meizu I'm bringing us something
closer to 4k on displays we're talking
about a 5.7 inch 2560 x 1440 display so
there is a lot to wait for this phone
whatever it happens it should be defined
7 and I love that name but anyway stay
tuned and an even more interesting news
even though Samsung has not been famous
for bringing as the most compelling
windows phones to the market it seems
that they haven't really dropped the
towel when it comes to this platform
apparently they're working already on a
1080p smart phone to be launched that
probably see us or mwc next year which
pretty much falls in line with the
reports that samsung is going to be
launching
multiple devices during q1 of 2014
obviously we hope that they also do
something to you know differentiate this
phone when compared to nokia so stay
tuned for that and by lee for the
interesting news of the day Apple has
just launched their ibeacon service to
work on Apple stores and the way this
work is obviously you walk into the
apple store your iPhone detects that
you're there through the apple store
application which it currently can do
when you're using Genius Bar services
and once you're there it'll tell you if
there are deals specifically in that
store aside from the fact that every
time you approach a specific product or
asked the app any specific questions
it'll tell you everything you need to
know for that product which is great
news but that leads you to the question
of the day do you believe that other OEM
should have their own stores just like
Apple does for example in my particular
case I would love to see HTC stores I
think that that would help them improve
the customers you know conscience of
their products because currently
customers don't really know much about
what they do but leave us a comment down
below what do you think and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video's filmer
she follows on parking out comments a
scripture youtube channel as well you
also follow me on twitter I'm underscore
