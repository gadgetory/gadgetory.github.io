James Bond second dislike funny very
funny well year early ass f I don't know
what to say um thank you that's right
it's that time of the week I am home I
believe it of this is parking now and
this is the Pagano daily recap the last
week on Monday the topic was the color
options for the galaxy note 7 I asked
you which was your favorite one given
the fact that Samsung is following some
trends and ditching others we have 1111
comments lovely number black onyx
hashtag black phones matter dude my
favorite color option believe it or not
is the black onyx for the galaxy s7 and
galaxy s7 edge and it's funny I've never
been really a big fan of black phones
mainly because it's extremely difficult
to record them and not have the camera
go crazy with dropping exposure and
stuff and also because some phones are
smudge magnets the darker that they are
but this particular black onyx model is
gorgeous it's really badass wait note 7
what happened to the note 6 where have
you been the past two months sounds like
is trying to suicide with their new
colors rest in peace should have kept
the white in the dark blue I have the
white galaxy note 5 and I just felt that
it looked really plain but I do agree
with the blue option on Tuesday the
topic was nexus smartphones we had some
leaks of the possible designs of the
future HTC nexus phones I asked you if
you like them we had 1061 comments
thanks a lot that vessels though on
Nexus it looks ugly amen really HTC is
going to screw Nexus lineup this year
well done I'm trying to understand the
irony the HTC 10 continues to be one of
my favorite phones I think that that
would blend perfectly with the Nexus
lineup looks like a nexus iphone no it
doesn't if anything Nexus devices are
about being commanding not than in light
that on Wednesday the topic was the
iphone 7 plus or pro or whatever it's
going to be called apparently we are
getting water resistance but there are
rumors that it's only coming to the plus
variant I asked you if that would lure
you to the plus Baron instead we had
1071 comment
thanks a lot again it's gonna take a
hell of a lot more than water resistance
to get me to buy an iPhone well that's
your opinion not necessarily what other
people think no I already have a phone
with water resistance and wireless
charging with a big screen it's called
exams and Galaxy s7 edge and that is a
very good phone indeed that nails pretty
much everything indeed new features of
iphone 7 it's waterproof kinda but we
call it h2o prevention oh my god I've
been laughing over this comment because
it's true you know Apple comes up to you
and tells you oh this is new 3d touch
technology or force touch when it's been
pressed to hold for the longest time I
find that ridiculously funny but it's so
true retina HD display etc on Thursday
the topic was the galaxy note 7 there
are rumors that there is an on edge
variant that is going to be of lesser
specifications for verizon I asked you
if that would underwhelm you about the
line if we had 636 comments absolutely
unacceptable especially since you pay
even more for a phone / course of the
contract I don't think they're gonna
price it at the same level but let's see
what we get note 7 should always be a
step ahead of the s line they are meant
to be the powerhouse phablets yeah that
used to be the case sadly not with the
galaxy note 5 and we hope that the trend
finishes there from 4,000 milliamp hours
to three thousand six hundred million
power battery from six gigabytes of
Bram's of 4 gigabytes of RAM the new
rumors are disappointing indeed the more
time goes by the lesser specifications
we get on this phone and rumors it's
probably going to be terrible we hope
that's not the case though and then
finally Friday we continued more rumors
of a lesser galaxy note 7 apparently a
light variant I asked you if it does
make sense and we had 750 comments note
is the superphone of the smartphone
world it should be built like Superman
note light hell no agreed totally agree
man the whole point of the note is for
premium specifications that are better
than the S line up to have a light
variant that beats the whole purpose of
the note line up exactly that is totally
my point as well no it doesn't make
sense they should have the flat and the
curve variance with the same
specifications exactly i hate that
confusion we've seen cases where other
OEMs have launched phones with letter
specifications and countries like India
for example
and these phones being underwhelming to
the market it does not make sense just
sell the phone for what it can do with
all the specific cases just that it
should be and the lit consumers decide
if they're gonna pay for it or not that
is my opinion as well that's it for the
pocket out daily recap thank you very
