now kinda behind the camera this is a
comparison between the samsung galaxy s5
and the samsung galaxy s4 our previous
hands-on happening in New York we are
here in buffalo episode so let's take a
look at last year's model compared to
the new kid on the block so at a first
glance if you look at them from a
considerable distance you will see that
they look almost the same but if you put
them side by side you will see that the
galaxy s5 here on the left is somewhat
taller than the galaxy s4 and that is
because the screen is larger but it's
not by that much larger we are having a
5-inch full-hd display on the samsung
galaxy s4 and only 5.1 inch full HD
display on the samsung galaxy s5 of
course the difference in height is
because of other hardware will get to
that to the first we just want to size
it up so that you can see how these two
compare we'll just switch the screens up
on both of them this is how they look
side by side I'd say they're
approximately there's a proxima be four
or five millimeters in difference
between a 2 when it comes to thickness
they're considerably the same I don't
have the exact numbers but you can see
it clearly here and also the galaxy s5
is approximately two or three
millimeters wider so you can see it
right there d wing on towards the specs
we mentioned the display which is full
HD on both of them 5.1 inches 5 40
inches but behind the screen there is a
Exynos 5 octa-core processor or or a
Snapdragon 600 processor on last year's
model compared to the galaxy s5 which is
powered by quad-core processor flogging
at 2.5 gigahertz there's two gigabytes
of RAM Oh last year's model 2 gigabytes
of RAM on this year's model and both
models come with 16 32 and 64 gigabytes
of internal storage of course augmenta
bill via microSD card
flipping into the back is where more
differences happened we'll see the good
old hyper blaze finish on the galaxy s4
and this galaxy s5 has a rubbery feel to
it because this phone is also water and
dust-resistant not water and dust proof
this cross-drilled rubbery back gives it
a better much better feel in the hand
and the hyper blaze gives you that
security that you will not slip it out
of your hand and while we are here we're
looking at the standard 13 megapixel
camera with no optical image
stabilization plus the LED flash on the
galaxy s4 compared to the 16 megapixel
camera with the LED flash on the galaxy
s5 there's a lot of features the event
was all about autofocus faster focus HDR
for both video and stills and right
there that's not a secondary camera that
is actually a heart rate sensor so if it
if enabled I touch this sensor here and
it will read my heartbeat going on to
the top of them will see that Samsung
repositioned the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack to the opposite side
compared to the galaxy s4 and they
switch places the IR blaster is now on
the left opposed to the right on the
previous generation still the power
button on the same location nothing else
towards the bottom we have the micro USB
port for syncing and charging main
microphone right there on the bottom
let's flip to the other side where we'll
see the volume rockers for volume up
volume down and nothing else on the back
the speakers are approximately at the
same location so the main design
principles are being followed to the
letter the galaxy s5 looks ninety
ninety-five percent just like the galaxy
s4 going back to the bottom just for one
second there's a USB 3.0 connection
right here just like on the Samsung
Galaxy Note
opposed to the standard USB to point out
on the samsung galaxy s4 that much about
hardware really quickly let's take a
look at software now the samsung galaxy
s4 features TouchWiz user interface
which you might love or hate it is
completely up to you and has that tabbed
featured groups of settings within the
Settings app tray and all the other
stuff like s help SVU air gestures and
whatever else you can enable opposed to
this Samsung to touch with to a whole
new level this is our app tray and once
we go into the notification shade you
will see that all the buttons or all the
icons for quick access are now a rounded
ones and the iconography as well as the
icons and text have been modified just a
little bit tapping at that button you
can of course reconfigure these quick
toggles let's go right there right back
jump into settings real quick and see
that the new icons are present all the
way and it's no longer a
it's no longer a tabbed representation
and grouping of your settings it is now
a scrollable list where of course you
can expand or collapse the settings one
other important feature which we need to
mention is that the galaxy s5 has a
fingerprint scanner but not a
fingerprint scanner / say like on the
iPhone 5s we'll talk about that more
when we'll compare it to the 5s this
part right here of the screen the bottom
part will read your fingerprint and he
will try to show you how to set up a
fingerprint to protect your device if on
the samsung galaxy s4 you were able to
enable air gesture an interview and all
the other so-called gimmicks they are
not focusing on these anymore you will
not be able to find them here in the
quick toggles instead they are very deep
inside the settings if you scroll
through this entire list and go down to
this category here which is called
motion you have air view which you can
enable of course we all know that for
the s planner for gallery for the video
player for the phone and in a separate
category motion and gestures will air
browse direct call smart alert mute buzz
and capture screen another thing to
mention is that Samsung emphasize that
the battery life is much much better
with ultra power saving mode because of
the fact that the specs are pretty much
the same as on the s4 the battery is
only 200 million powers larger than on
the s4 we have 2600 milliamp hours on
the galaxy s4 and 2800 milliamp hours on
the galaxy s5 and last but not least
jumping into the camera application just
to see how the viewfinder has changed
we'll try to flip this to the front
camera so we can see also i'ma and
myself shooting we have a mode selector
here which is Samsung's thing of course
you can down
more modes we're guessing from that
button right there there you go third
party or additional modes for a camera
I'm going to flip back to the main
camera so that we can activate some even
more modes in the auto beauty face
panorama and all your other usual modes
what else we have here inside the
settings will be able to set all of the
settings will take a close look at this
when we get this device in our review
labs but we'll try to keep this as short
as possible it's feature-packed but
that's what we can do within four or
five minutes this was a very short very
short look at the samsung galaxy s5
compared to galaxy s4 I've been hands-on
I'm sporting I've been talking a lot
hymas doing a great job trying to frame
don't go anywhere more videos of the s5
coming soon from both Barcelona and New
York thank you very much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
