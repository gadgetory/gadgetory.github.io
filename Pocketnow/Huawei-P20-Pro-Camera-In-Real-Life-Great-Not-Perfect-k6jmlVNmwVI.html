best smartphone camera in the world and
we decided to test that but in a
different scenario we decided to bring
it to my favorite city in the world
I'm home it'll be better with pocket now
this is the Huawei P 20 Pro and let's
see what it can do from the beautiful
city of Rome
keep in mind though this is not a final
review I still do not have enough time
with the phone call this more my first
impressions because I was at the right
place to do so so there are a couple of
peculiar things about the Huawei p20 Pro
that are unique to every smartphone to
start this is definitely the king of
hardware when it comes to smartphone
photography the only time that I've seen
three camera sensors in one phone the
fact that one of these camera sensors
brings a second approach at 40
megapixels in a camera and the fact that
there is also the same blend that we've
seen from lekha in the past where we've
got the monochrome sensor to complement
photography and now we also have a
telephoto lens that makes an interesting
solution in hybrid zooming with those
added megapixels as well really cool one
of the things that I like the most about
the b20 Pro is also one of the things
that's a little complicated to handle in
its AI a lot of companies use the term
AI now for photography we're really the
first company to actively use that was
huawei point the camera at something of
the techs what it is and it adapts the
thing about the b20 pro is it's
extremely aggressive a lot more
aggressive than the May 10 Pro you
pointed something and it automatically
switches modes it switches to portrait
mode it switches to blue sky and the
problem is sometimes you don't
necessarily want that there are cases
where the resulting photos are amazing
but they're amazing for Instagram
they're extremely over sharpened and I
know a ton of people that love them I
personally do these kinds of filters for
Instagram but I actually prefer the
photo to be as natural as possible which
is one of the things that I like the
most about the like approach with Huawei
and in the case of the b20 Pro you have
to point the camera at something it'll
switch modes automatically and then you
have to switch the camera back turn the
mode off and hope that it doesn't switch
itself back on as it constantly
mumbles with you to get it done sure you
can turn this off within the settings
but then there are cases where you
actually want it so I wish there was a
balance so all this being said you've
got the hardware
you've got the software with AI how are
the photos I guess an award the best way
to describe them is gorgeous but it all
depends on your taste in photography see
there's a lot of processing going on
after you take a photo the camera
actually sharpens the photo it provides
color wherever you need it and so
definitely if you're a photography
purist and especially if you come from a
previous Huawei smartphone where you're
used to that
pure photography then yes you're most
probably gonna fight this approach but
if you're just like me you're interested
in photos for Instagram then definitely
this is cameras gonna be a treat because
literally you don't do anything but take
the shot the camera takes care of
everything else and in most cases the
camera actually knows how to boost
everything adequately again because AI
detects what it's looking at and then
adapts the camera mode to whatever it is
that you need at the moment
now it is a very gloomy day in Rome
we're currently in Piazza Navona but my
favorite favorite spots in the city and
gloom low light that's probably one of
the best things that this camera can do
let me show you why
and then there are things like night
mode where Huawei has this very
interesting approach to deal with what
they consider to be the biggest issue in
photography and that's the fact that
there's motion blur every time that you
try to take a photo and you just can't
keep it stable and you're obviously not
carrying a tripod because this is a
phone it's genius at least at its idea
where it takes up ton of photos and then
eventually collages result that is
supposed to not be blurry fact of the
matter is or at least now the results
are great some of the time then there
are times where apparently the phone
just doesn't produce a stable shot or
the phone takes forever to capture shot
and bring you a result and obviously
you're they're stalled waiting for the
photo to be processed again
I believe that the concept is the
feature I believe that the concept is on
its right way but it still needs more
work I would say that this is the first
phone that I would ever trust for zoom
photography and trust me I've used them
all galaxy s 9 plus iphone 10 the
biggest problem really is detail the 3x
optical zoom on this phone is great the
5x hybrid zoom is great but even more
interesting even if you zoom into 10x
give the phone a second allow it to then
stabilize the shot and even those photos
are useful I really love this about this
phone
now I wish I could say the same about
selfie photos you know I'm not a fan but
as it turns out even though the hardware
is here with 24 megapixels on the
shooter even though there are software
to provide background blur through
portrait photography it seems that the
software needs work
and then in the case of the hardware
it's clearly a problem whenever you're
at night and sometimes either at fumbles
with white balance lured fumbles with
things like blends flaring it's really
bad in certain cases I hope this is just
the problem with my unit we've been
receiving software updates so it could
just be that there's more work to be
done here and then there are the extras
always seriously has to be spoiled with
monochrome photography there are cases
where coloured photos though necessarily
look good because the place is not that
elegant and where black and white photos
simply make everything look elegant and
for those of you that don't like all the
AI features and all the auto modes you
simply can just go into pro mode and
have all the manual photography that
you're looking for that Huawei has done
a great job with since the past couple
of mate phones now fun fact I wanted to
record this video in the p20 Pro fully
and that didn't turn out to be such a
good idea
there are a ton of limitations starting
with the selfie camera there is no
stabilization and even though though you
have 24 megapixels you are capped at
720p like really what year is this and
then in the second case for example in
the primary shooter there is
stabilization video is actually really
good but then even though you have the
cure 970 power here there is no 4k video
at 60 frames per second and that whole
960 frame per second video yeah that
experience is actually not good the
video comes out great and all the
problem is that the user interface
doesn't support you to be able to record
more than a few seconds as opposed to
the galaxy has 9 plus where it continues
recording before processing and then you
can actually ask it to go Ultra slow-mo
again in the case of this phone you
can't do that it actually starts
processing after it and just makes the
whole experience just cumbersome so yes
this is the Huawei P 20 Pro from Rome
is it the Renaissance of photography I
would say that there is a lot of promise
here it's got the best part where on a
smartphone camera there is a ton of
software to back it up it needs a little
help and implementation I guess my
initial verdict would be I would
definitely recommend this phone for
photos not so much for a video but again
this is not our final review I still
need more time with it let us know in
the comments what you think about the
photos and all your app that make sure
you follow us on social media subscribe
to our channel as well you can follow me
on Twitter Jaime underscore got on
Instagram at home every data please give
this video a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw I'm having everything I think so
what you're watching let us know what
you think about this video concept and
also see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
