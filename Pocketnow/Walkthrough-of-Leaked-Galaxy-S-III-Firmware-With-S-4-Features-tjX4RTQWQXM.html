but we weren't sure how soon I'm Taylor
Martin this is pocket now and this is an
early look at TouchWiz with Android 422
on the samsung galaxy s3 shortly after
the galaxy s4 was announced along with
the new version of TouchWiz Samsung
confirmed many of the new features would
make their way to other galaxies branded
devices namely the galaxy s3 in the form
of an update but it wasn't clear what
the extent of the update would be which
new features would make their way to the
s3 and which would be deemed
incompatible lucky for us we woke up
this morning to a treat courtesy of Sam
mobile a leaked version of the fortitude
to update for the i 9300 the global
variant of the galaxy s3 so what is this
leaked firmware Intel quite a bit
actually of course you get all the
benefits of Android 42 to daydream for
example is now available in the display
settings notifications with actions are
found in the notification shade as well
as the settings toggle page and select
widgets are available from the lock
screen and the lock screen is where some
of the first changes are apparent
widgets aside you can quickly access the
camera with a swipe to the left the old
ripple effect has been updated and is
much more polished and although it
doesn't follow your floating finger
around there is a light unlock effect on
the s3 similar to the s4 once you get
past the lockscreen the changes and
improvements begin to pile up it doesn't
look all that different at first glance
but when you pull down the notification
shade it's easy to see the brightness
slider has been updated particularly
when auto brightness is enabled there
are also many more settings and toggles
in the notification shade a lot of the
galaxy s4 screen mirroring s beam
driving mode smart stay etc if you jump
into the settings app like the s4 the
interface is now tabbed in four
subsections connections my device
accounts and more and after digging
around there are minor changes to be
found all throughout the settings in
display settings there is now an adapt
to splay checkbox in the screen mode as
well as a professional photo mode and if
you want you can remove the brightness
slider in the notification panel from
the application drawer we found an
additional widget called smart widget
which toggles the direct call smart
voice control and s being features as
for which s 4 features made the cut
there are quite a few things missing
which we imagine is tied to hardware
there is no option for air few nor are
there any air gesture features but that
shouldn't come as a surprise what is
surprising however is the lack of smart
scroll and smart Paul's opening the
camera app we were surprised to find
that it is remained almost completely
untouched in this update drama shot dual
camera and other s for camera software
features are absent but the gallery up
does come with a rather strange change
if you switch to the 3d view in the
gallery the background is an unsightly
white
also the dialer is the same old black
and blue dialer not the updated white
dialer found on the s4 so we must
iterate this update is clearly not
finished Sam mobile claims the official
update will roll out in June and we're
hoping more of the s4 s features are
brought over to the s3 specifically we
hope the camera and smart screen
features make the cut that's going to do
it for this video so if you enjoyed it
