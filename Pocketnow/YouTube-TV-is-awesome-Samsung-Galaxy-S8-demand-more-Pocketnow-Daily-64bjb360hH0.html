make it easy for you to cut the cord
Samsung sees a higher than expected
demand for its Galaxy si plus we already
hear details on the sequels for the
Google pixel with a plus one in tow
I am Jaime Rivera and one of the movies
I'm looking forward to the most this
year is the one teased by this t-shirt
like seriously this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with new
developments Spotify Premium continues
to be one of my favorite services hands
down the company wants to up the ante
over what Premium users get or what
freemium users were getting apparently
within the next couple of weeks
Premium users will be allowed to enjoy
new songs exclusively for two weeks
it won't happen with all new songs but
with certain ones that are included in
certain contracts that Spotify is
working on end up two weeks later
freemium users would be able to access
them with ads it's not a bad deal if you
consider it as Apple pretty much does
that all the time if you're an Apple
music subscriber so yeah that's all
about Huawei but not Huawei let's talk
about honor as the company is pretty
much branding honor as its own brand up
to the point where honor has just
announced the new honor eight Pro in
Europe and the reason why this is hard
this because the honor eight was
probably one of our favorite premium mid
Rangers last year it was gorgeous great
camera experience everything and the the
eight pro is pretty much a p10 up to a
certain degree dual cameras and
everything here in 966 gigabytes of RAM
actually we should say the p10 plus
instead and everything that we like
about what honor is doing with Android
lately so you can learn more about this
one link in the description hopefully we
will get that stateside soon honor
please now how about if we talk about
the successors to the Google pixel as we
should be expecting these by later this
year apparently they will retain the
same fish names while I must
and Timon and yes I said a third name
because apparently there is a third
device in the works but we don't know
exactly which is which or what
differences will be brought by this
third device I mean it makes sense for
there to be a small and a large one
could it be that they're also going to
be working on a less expensive variant
which is what we really wanted for the
pixel honestly it just went too
expensive for what you were getting even
though it takes amazing photos and
everything you could think of but yeah
let's see what we get soon as sadly at
the moment all we have our names now how
about if we talk about the Samsung
Galaxy s8 plus in particular samson
claimed that the company was prepared
for demand that it was going to build
enough of these units for everybody to
have one but apparently it did not
prepare for as much demand as it's
getting with the plus variant up to the
point where the company is stating that
it will figure it out that we will be
getting enough plus units but just makes
you wonder exactly why people are going
for the plus variant more than samsung
expected let's to know what you think in
the comments and finally the very hot
news that they have to do with Google
and its launch of YouTube TV we had
heard that Apple was working on getting
streaming services on their Apple TV for
ages in Google I think just figuring it
out $35 a month you get a selection of
TV channels depending on your area and
zip code and once you get that you have
options to obviously add other channels
or movies and stuff like Showtime etc
that's extra money but the point here is
that you get a lot of cool things number
one in addition to this channel
selection you also get unlimited DVR you
can tell the application what specific
channels programs shows you want and
whenever these go live the DVR will
record them for you without you needing
to intervene in any way and in addition
to that you can also do this for movies
and believe it or not you also get a
free month as a try and give it a try
and if you like it fine if not you
simply cancel without any sort of
commitment I feel that this is an
awesome service but it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about YouTube
do you think that this is good enough to
cut the cord in my case I don't actually
watch TV but this thing just made me
order a TV online like seriously I mean
if I can cast everything I pretty much
have everything I need with YouTube TV
but hey we would love to know what you
think in the comments down below
