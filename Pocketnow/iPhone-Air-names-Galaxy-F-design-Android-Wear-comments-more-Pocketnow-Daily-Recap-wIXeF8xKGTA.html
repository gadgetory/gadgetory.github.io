took you so long to figure that one out
lower the effing intro music volume
somebody get this guy a better pair of
speakers please this guy a drunk or what
yes this guy is Wien that's right a lot
of people asked for the show to come
back so it's about that time I am hi
meri behna this is pocket now and this
is the park and L daily recap for last
week so another I asked you what options
would you like motomaker to bring to the
Moto 360 as the rumors are that moto
maker is coming to the Moto 360 and you
will have some customizations available
we have 210 comments out of which David
a says fu smartwatches g-shock all day
and how old are you Eric Carter says a
stainless steel or metal band would be
great to have on the Moto 360 some of
the nicest watches are metal in my
opinion and you know ceramic is probably
one of the best materials that I've seen
the probably stainless steel is that it
does scratch quite easily but I don't
know if you've noticed ceramic watch
bands they look great even years after
they've been used so for me that would
be a great option to have the master and
commander says engraving on the inside
or outside with patterns or whatever
design you want p.s hi must stop being
an apple fanboy it's disgusting Apple
wasn't talked about in this video much
but anyways mastery commanders actually
right that would be really cool to have
an engraving of a watch first of all
because you can engrave the back and
give it as a gift and people won't
really see the engraving so hey it would
be something really cool as a gift I
love the idea that on Tuesday I asked
you how important are curved displays
for you as the rumors are that the
iphone 6 will sports some minor curves
on the edges we have 188 comments out of
which kevin roll-on says LG G flex comes
out no hype iphone 6 with curved display
hyped up like crazy and that is true you
know the LG G flex wasn't really a bad
product per se was a good idea the palm
as a display was terrible and Miami
cannas festival fan 01 says i love the
beveled edges feel great in the hand the
actual curve screens are super gimmicky
and very uncomfortable in hand a lot of
people defer about this a lot of people
like curve
displays I personally don't but not
necessarily because of the curves I do
find them to be gimmicky but I wouldn't
have a problem with them if the displays
were great but the problem is the
technology is not there yet the patron
no one says what difference does it make
flat or curved no difference and equally
good G flex is just stupid again the g
flex was not stupid it was a great
concept mainly because of the flexing
capabilities the problem again was that
the technology of the display was not
there to give you good display quality
and that was problem that on Wednesday I
asked you how excited would you be about
an HTC nexus 9 as the rumors are that
the HTC melantha's is this project and
has an insane amount of RAM 390 comments
out of which hater says would I buy it
HD seeds haven't are you kidding me I've
been waiting for this inside bought the
32 gig cellular wire I loved it i'm sure
the heck that i'm gonna love the nexus 9
of rumors are true and i would agree as
well I love the flyer as well and i love
the HTC m7 the MA these are great
designs I would love to have the option
for sense on a tablet but then again
again it's a nexus tablet so it could be
even better when Tommy Crosby says HTC
is the best OEM out there they make a
lot of mistakes cameras but with google
controlling them this could be awesome
to bet the nexus 7 though you know HTC
doesn't make a lot of mistakes they do
have a point with the ultrapixel camera
it's just that yeah I agree with all the
hype of more processors and everything I
do understand why products like the Moto
X didn't take off but then again at
times where we're no longer seeing
guzzling Corvette cars and where we're
actually becoming more fuel-efficient I
do believe that this trend will change
eventually that on Thursday I asked you
what would you think about the name
iphone air as the rumors are that at
least one of the new iphones that is
coming is going to be dubbed the iphone
their 561 comments out of which for
example Chuck Norris thank you for being
in our video that was amazing call it
the iphone sucks but i'm going to get
one anyways you know i don't really
understand iphone haters why is there a
lot of people just complaining about the
iphone and still they still go by that
thing what's the point then Jason 10
a319 says iphone HD Apple still hasn't
released a 720p iphone yet so stupid as
it
the iphone HD sounds right lol you know
that is actually probably one of the
best comments of the week iphone HD that
is an amazing name that would be great
hopefully that will be the case then
another commoner says iphone air is
pretty nice and you know the name is
actually not bad it's just misleading
mainly because you have a lineup like
the iPad lineup which is air and
apparently there are rumors of a pro and
then you have the macbook lineup which
the air is actually the entry-level
laptop so it's kind of confusing again
aren't there better names again iphone
HD for me is probably one of the best
names and then finally on friday i asked
you what do you think about the samsung
galaxy f design as there are leaked
photos of a galaxy device with chamfered
edges we have two different 13 comments
out of which Chester Foster says looks
like a dimpled iphone with a samsung
logo and you're kind of right i mean
chamfered edges aren't there other ways
to build a metallic product than sham
furred edges that we already see on HTC
products and Apple products I mean come
on Samson then jump s says it could be
the note 4 and it could but it's hard to
tell and it's really hard because there
are teasers of a new form factor coming
there are a lot of rumors of the note 4
but nothing says metal we've been
hearing about the galaxy f 4 months
already probably already a year and then
finally another commoner says I want a
carbon fiber phone and I do too but I
mean like real carbon fiber not just
something that looks like it and i love
the terms of motorola came out with
kevlar and other options you know i
would agree that there are better
options than metal if you drop metal
it's not as resilient as plastic and
then the problem with plastic is it
doesn't look as good either it's really
just not a good options either go
plastic or metal it would be cool to
test other things again like Kevlar and
probably other designs something that
doesn't look so dull thats it for our
pocket out daily recap thank you very
much for watching if you want your
comments to be featured on this video
