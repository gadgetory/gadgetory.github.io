new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all onto the next big
thing already so let's do something
about it let's have a look at a device
after a couple of weeks after release
and when it's not shiny and new anymore
I'm hoping to be better with pocket now
this is the Lumia 930 and this is
episode 40 of after the buzz it's been
nearly a year since Nokia launched the
Lumia icon on Verizon and six months
since the unlocked GSM twin the Lumia
930 made the scene by Android standards
that's probably the equivalent to a
couple of decades and device launches
but in the case of Microsoft's Windows
Phone not so much aging hasn't really
been a problem for the Lumia 930 mainly
because it's got very little competition
on its own platform unless you're into
the phablet size Lumia 1520 or the
elegance of the HTC One m8 for Windows
or even the budget-minded Lumia 830 the
930 is still the best midsize lumia you
can buy in both design and
specifications the Snapdragon 800 with 2
gigs of ram and 32 gigs of non
expandable storage powering the Lumia
930 are still top-notch specifications
by Windows Phone standards and this
particular 1080p AMOLED display is
probably one of the best-looking we've
tested even after almost a year down the
road software updates have been nice
enough to enable the double tap to wake
function that was originally absent in
the icon but sadly the glance feature
that's already available in the budget
Lumia 830 is absent on the 930 and
apparently that's the way it's going to
be since this display seems to lack
display memory
the devices built is proven to be
resilient as well
a recent fall from waist level barely
shows a minor scuff at the aluminum trim
and some scratches on the display and
another noble back which we actually
found a neat trick on how to remove it
still looks pristine over time this
device lifts up to every single positive
claim in Lunia build quality and unless
you mind using a phone that completely
misses the new trend of thin and light
you'll be satisfied to carry a product
that looks like new after months of use
aging is less apparent on the software
front and really the bigger story of the
Lumia 930 Microsoft has reinvigorated
its Windows Phone platform with version
8.1 gd-r 1 and unless you're a fan of
the ginormous Lumia 1520 phablet
the Lumia 930 is the only other Windows
Phone that takes full advantage of Lumia
denim or well everything except the new
glance screen features hey Cortana is
one of the coolest just like you can
summon a Moto X with your voice without
needing to activate the display you can
do the same with Cortana it might take
an extra second to respond compared to
the Moto X but Cortana will actually
provide you with faster results most of
the time other improvements include
snooze times for reminders and a Karkat
integration feature that we weren't able
to test sadly building folders shouldn't
be a cool new feature but these live up
to the name live folders as opposed to
just the simple icon on a folder with
other platforms live tiles within these
folders still display periodic
information to you to make them useful
it actually makes you want to use these
folders since the information is still
at a glance available to you other
improvements include a much overdue
consumer a VPN option in addition to
improve speed and Internet Explorer and
if you want the full list the features
that Windows Phone 8.1 brings make sure
you watch Michael Fisher's extensive
video in the link in the description
what makes Lumia denim cooler is really
the user experience improve UI fluidity
has the six month old device blazing
through anything you throw at it be a
day-to-day task or graphics intensive
games
my only complaint with Windows Phone
remains the excessive transition
animations to run basic tasks like
looking at a Facebook photo for example
these really aren't necessary but then
again the 930 handles these like a
flagship would battery life doesn't seem
to be affected by the dip performance as
well you'll probably notice that it
begins to drop rather quickly compared
to other devices but it eventually
settles and lasts for more than a day
with extensive views or at least my type
of usage where I even found Windows
Phone to be superior to Android as in
notifications I've been an iOS fan
mainly because of timely notifications
and Windows Phone has proven to be on
par with the standard every single time
which is great it could be because of
how the OS handles data or Wi-Fi which I
found to be top-notch
even without LTE and for the Lumia 930
held on to Wi-Fi in more areas than even
the iPhone phone calls and even voice
messaging are probably one of the best
that I've personally ever tested the
four microphones have users claiming
crisp sound on my end and the earpiece
reminds me of how good landlines used to
be a thing I only thought Motorola
phones could do the speaker at the back
is definitely disappointing by today's
standards but it's still plenty loud as
well
now Lumia denim and really anything
Lumia related is mostly about the camera
it's the real reason why I've personally
ditched the iPhone 6 for this Lumia 930
surely images on both devices are
comparable even with the 20 megapixel
PureView sensor and size optics on the
Lumia but it's really the software
features that make using a Lumia camera
so cool the Lumia denim camera
enhancements are so vast that we have to
film a separate video to show them off
and lick the description to watch that
in a nutshell to have rich capture allow
you to manually add Flash tone to an
already existing photo or to manually
add high dynamic range to add a shot or
to even be able to pull out an 8
megapixel shot from a 4k video on the
move is simply genius match that with
the audio quality of four microphones
over any time
video shot and it's really hard to beat
this camera we could go on for hours
about how cool this is so please watch
our separate video and get a glimpse of
what we mean by the Lumia camera overall
even after six months the Lumia 930 is
not only the Windows Phone to beat but
really a smart phone to beat as well and
this comes from an iPhone guy it gives
you the voice features of the Moto X
with a far better camera it gives you
the simplicity of the iPhone with a far
better camera heck it even gives you the
battery life and performance of most
phablets and there I say it again with a
far better camera
Microsoft has proven that even through
software an old flagship can challenge
new competition as even the app gap is
no longer existent for users like me the
only reason why I wouldn't recommend
that you buy this phone is because Lumia
flagship is long overdue still if you
want to Windows Phone now or if you want
a really great camera on a smart phone I
highly recommend that you join me that's
it for episode 40 of after the buzz
