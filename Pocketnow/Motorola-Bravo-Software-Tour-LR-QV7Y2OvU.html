pocketnow.com and this is the software
tour of the motorola Bravo mb 520 so
let's get started so the Bravo is
running Android 2.1 along with the
motoblur 1.5 user interface so that
gives you many pages that you can put
applications on or other programs or
widgets so if i want i can add a widget
here i just hold down and go to either
motorola widgets or android widgets so
i'm going to choose one of the motorola
ones here and we have many different
widgets that we can choose from you can
also download other widgets on the
android market for the android widgets
or sometimes you can also find the ones
for the motorola widgets so let's say
that we wanted to add a date and time
just hold this here and select the clock
style and we'll just click done and it
shows the date and time so i'm just
going to go into the applications here
and we have a few proprietary
applications we have the motoblur
accounts which gives us our account
information we have alarm timer which is
different on this particular device
opposed to different android devices we
can change the clock if we like just go
down here and let's say we wanted to
change it to this sort of modern style
we can just go click on here and then
change our clock also have a timer there
we have AT&amp;amp;T family map but the only
thing that that does is it sends a link
and turns this into a bookmark so all it
does is launch the browser to the AT&amp;amp;T
family map website we have 18 teen maps
and AT&amp;amp;T Navigator both of them are paid
for service that costs around ten
dollars a month we have AT&amp;amp;T music which
is also paid for service and I believe
that this costs four dollars and
ninety-nine cents a month so just exit
out of that we have 18 T radio which is
how you listen to the FM radio on this
particular device so you can either
subscribe or go to the FM tuner so I'm
just going to the FM tuner I don't have
any headphones plugged in right now so
we won't be able to hear anything but
we'll just wait for it to load and there
we go we have the FM signal so we go
back and go back again we have the AT&amp;amp;T
Wi-Fi hot spot so that program show
you all of the AT&amp;amp;T Wi-Fi hot spots in
your area you can also search by zip
code if you like and city and state no
back a browser of course calculator
which is the default calculator on any
Android device the calendar which is
also the default calendar we have a
camcorder which as I've said in the
hardware tour is only CIF resolution so
very low resolution camcorder and our
camera which is a 3.1 megapixel camera
go into our contacts we like go to our
dialer unfortunately this device does
not have speed dial like if you begin
typing a name or number it doesn't
recognize the number off the back so
let's say if i was to type 206 or
something it wouldn't give me a list of
contacts in my contact list so let's go
back we have DLNA which is an awesome
program if you've ever used media
sharing over your network this phone
allows you to do that so you can share
your media from the device or you can
also share your media on other computers
or network drives or like a playstation
wii or xbox 360 you can do all that and
just play it on the phone itself or you
can play the media on the phone on those
particular devices so we'll just go back
and we have email and a file explorer so
a pretty generic just shows us foam
files and shared folders the shared
folders is where you can also set up to
share folders over your network just go
back gallery I don't have any pictures
on this device right now so you don't
see too much just go back and gmail help
center instant messaging so you can add
an instant messaging account I believe
there's quite a few one here let's go in
here oh no just a matte windows live
messenger and yahoo latitude which is
the google application that shows your
friends or family or whoever where you
are and you can also view them and
course Google Maps pulsing that the
android market we all sing that media
share which ties into the DLNA
application and that allows you to
shares or media messaging so you can
view your universal inbox your text
messaging your facebook or your Twitter
just go back we have mobile banking
which is pretty cool if your bank is on
the list unfortunately not every single
financial institution is on there so
you'll have to load that application and
search for your particular bank or
credit union or whatnot mobile video
that uses that plays videos but it only
plays over the network connection so it
won't work over Wi-Fi so we'll just
disable this here and it connects to the
singular video website so we'll just go
back can also view mobile TV which also
works over the data connection
unfortunately doesn't work over 3g so i
can hit continue but it costs around ten
dollars a month we'll just go back we
have music unfortunately don't have any
music on here also because this is a
brand new device I'm it's I haven't
synced up everything yet but we can view
artists this is all the default android
2.1 music browser we have google
navigation news which we can sign up for
many different news accounts i have the
travel channel photos right here someone
i can view any one of these articles and
just go back phone portal which allows
us to sink our device either with a USB
connection or through Wi-Fi so we can
share our media we can also download our
text messages to our computers and save
our contacts and all that other great
stuff and just go back we have places
which is a google service and that goes
as many different categories to search
through restaurants coffee bars hotels
all the other great stuff and it shows
us our nearby location so we'll just go
back we have quick office which allows
us to view all of our documents and
we've probably all seen that before or
settings social networking so we have
Twitter and Facebook and probably some
other things on here let's see mine is
just set up for Twitter and Facebook so
just go back Google Talk so we've all
seen that before or task manager this
has its own proprietary task manager and
you can also set it up so it auto ends
application so it helped save the
battery so just go back text messaging
vlingo voice which allows us to tap and
speak so blockbuster and that will find
the closest blockbuster to me and give
me the phone number and all the other
contacts
information hopefully it works pretty
quickly let's see here so we'll just hit
okay and we're able to view the closest
blockbuster to my proximity and can you
voice commands which is similar to a
google voice search and we can also go
to where but that's a paid for
application which across two dollars 99
cents we have YouTube and YP mobile if
you want to use yellow pages a post
using the internet or Google so another
great feature that they've included on
this device is swype keyboard so if you
like to use the swype keyboard or if you
ever have it works really great all you
have to do is go move your finger and
we've probably all seen this book before
and you just move your finger across to
the letters and it starts to type out
the word so this has been the software
tour of the motorola Bravo mb 520 if you
like our videos make sure to give us a
thumbs up and also leave some comments
