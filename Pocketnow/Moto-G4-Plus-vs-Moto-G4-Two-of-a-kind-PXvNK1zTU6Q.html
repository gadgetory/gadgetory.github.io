we'd be pretty hard pressed to tell the
difference - motorola delivered two
flavors for this year's low-cost
g-series smartphone but what we really
have here is a spectrum of options at
some really well laid out price points
this all ties into the idea of moto
maker really well and it's a nice
consideration that just because someone
is shopping a less expensive device that
doesn't mean they should be denied
options to better fit a phone to their
particular lifestyle it's all the same
platform divided into four tiers of both
phones come with 5.5 inch 1080p LCDs
welcome 6 1 7 processors and 3000
milliamp hour batteries the lower moto
g4 comes in two flavors based on storage
16 gigabytes for one $99.99 and 32
gigabytes for two $29.99 the Moto G 4
Plus also starts users off with 16
gigabytes of storage but adds a
fingerprint sensor below the screen and
improves the camera moving from a 13
megapixel sensor to a 16 megapixel
sensor with laser assisted focus the
plus starts at 249 and increasing that
to 299 will double the RAM to 4
gigabytes and quadruple the storage to
64 gigabytes of built-in space what's
great is that we start with a solid base
model phone the Qualcomm 617 isn't a
speed demon and mobile gamers will
probably want to look elsewhere for
graphics prowess but this is plenty
capable hardware to get through the
daily basics the UI is responsive enough
though it might not have quite the same
relative feel of Moto's from the past
but it is kind of fantastic to look back
at a 2014 Moto G and see how much more
phone you can get for an extra $20 today
this is a fine starter package and then
consumers can pay more for extra stuff
do you need a little extra storage or do
you want that fingerprint scanner maybe
you need better multitasking performance
add in some fun color options and we're
happy to see that part of Moto's DNA
continue under Lenovo's ownership it's
not the same low-cost budget buster we
fell in love with when the G originally
launched but this is a more flexible
platform for fighting future Alcatel Xin
hua ways depending on
what the consumer needs this one phone
line can battle entry-level gear or
adding options can get it within
spitting distance of a 1 plus or as
Yowie the entire phone market is sliding
into some very competitive territory and
it's exciting to think that the base
model g4 would have battled well against
a galaxy s4 and HTC One m7 when they
were brand new so there you have the
folks comparing a Moto G forward to a g4
plus is less a proper phone comparison
and more an exercise similar to looking
at a car's accessory packages Sport
package safety sensors backup camera
just don't ever pay for the undercoating
right at least that's what I've been
told as always folks thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel to see our full moto G for
coverage we'll be releasing that full
review very soon for pocket now I'm Juan
Carlos bag now some gadget guy on
Twitter and Instagram and I will catch
you all on the next video
