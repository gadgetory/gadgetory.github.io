exist on the iphone for apple pull
slider cases from their stores due to
glass gate and city is now ready for iOS
4.2 but the OS is nowhere to be found
all this and more coming up right now
hello everybody I'm home it'll be better
and welcome to the pocket nail I review
the show we go through all this week
school and they're not so cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices now
this week we have a lot of more uncool
stuff than good but just to keep it in
order let's start off with the cool well
android 2.2 has just been ported to the
first generation iphone and the iphone
3g how well just as you can boot windows
on a mac through boot camp there's this
application called bootlace for
jailbreakers obviously they have all the
fun it doesn't happen for the rest of us
but this will actually allow android 2.2
to work on the iOS devices on a dual
boot so you can actually choose to boot
with iOS or android there's also being
ported to the iphone 4 soon through an
application called open i boot we hope
it's coming out you know soon enough we
don't have dates clearly yet but it's
part of the I droid project which is
really cool we still don't know if there
are bugs or not again these are all
jailbreak features nothing is final but
anyways it's android on really cool
hardware so if you've all in the
blackberry from November first 2005 up
to when the iphone was released in 2007
all the way up to September 7 2010 it
seems you'll probably get some money
back from AT&amp;amp;T or the IRS why well AT&amp;amp;T
is notifying certain customers that it
seems they were charging for taxes and
certain services they weren't supposed
to we're really not sure when to expect
this it seems AT&amp;amp;T meeks to get this
fixed by march two of next year really
not sure which users are going to get
this or if they'll be eligible for money
or certain other benefits so we'll see
how the news develops eventually now
itunes 10.1 has just been released for
the pc and mac you'll actually need it
if you're interested in upgrading to iOS
4.2 on your iPhone iPod Touch or iPad so
be sure to get it and aside from that it
will bring you the ability to have
airplay work
through an Apple TV if you already own
one and aside from that row all you'll
get us ping working through Twitter and
that's it that's pretty much it and yeah
the jailbreak community was worried
because Cydia did not work with iOS 4.2
s betas and gold master candidates but
it's just been confirmed that they've
already figured it out and even with all
the changing api's they will release
Cydia soon with iOS 4.2 and the
jailbreak and apparently it also brings
an overhaul all we need now is iOS 4.2
and thank God we're getting close to the
not-so-cool section because that's when
we're going to start talking about that
that does it with the cool let's
continue on with the not so cool iOS 4.2
has not been released yet I'm not going
to say delayed because Apple just said
november they didn't say a specific date
but we've been waiting for november
seventh nothing happened this friday
nothing happened then some people are
saying november 16th not really know
what to say gold master candidate to is
out right now so we could say a week is
the least that we're going to wait
probably next friday but some people are
also saying november 20 something which
is not cool i feel really bad for the
ipad owners that are waiting for
multitasking and there are a lot of us
users waiting to be able to unlock
iphone 4s with iOS 4.2 its promised by
the dev team so hurry up Apple I'm I'm
really waiting for this okay so Hasbro
has been working on a project where
they'll bring 3d goggles for your iphone
we're still trying to figure out why i
mean i'm really thinking would you
actually wear the goggles and it even if
you could wear the goggles i mean you
have to hold the phone on one hand and
then hold the goggles on the other and
how are you going to play with the phone
afterwards anyways now one of the really
uncool things that happen this week is
that it seems that iOS 4.2 will not
bring airplay to the iphone 3g why well
we really don't know why nothing
confirmed on what's wrong with the
hardware i mean what's next that iOS 4.3
will not bring phone calls to the iphone
3g really not sure if it's worth
upgrading anymore and well it seems that
Apple has pulled all the slider cases
from their Apple stores because a glass
gate
it seems that the famous gorilla glass
hippopotamus glass or elephant glass
whatever you want to call it is really
not that good if any dirt gets cut
within the case and the phone it seems
that it will scratch it and yeah that
includes the mophie juice pack so really
not sure what to expect really no point
from Apple nothing said just yet but
it's happening so anyways Apple that's
it for today's I review thank you very
much for watching any questions your
