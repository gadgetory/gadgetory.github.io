google glass to some naysayers HTC's
next frontier seems to be optical zoom
and its future smartphone lineup and
Google is rumored to bring as a cheaper
Nexus smartphone if that's even possible
I'm primary data I'm do area and nope
these are not the Clone Wars this is
 out there let's begin today with
what's official is we know the Google's
started selling google glass a couple of
days ago for just one day and they had a
lot of questions from people out there
that we're willing to pay the 1,500
bucks but said that they wanted to see
how that integration with prescription
glasses was so what Google is doing a
shipping out some press trowel kits for
these people who try it out they pay 50
bucks and with their credit cards and
then they get their money back and let's
see what Google does after this as glass
is still annoying now it's all about
Apple is there is this very interesting
rumor that the company is now working
with shazam to bring some song detection
on iOS 8 and apparently this will work
like Twitter whereas you just have to
look for the twitter button to share and
in the same way you'll be able to find
what song is playing with just some
featuring apparently this will also be
integrated to Siri the only sad part is
I don't know about you guys but I prefer
SoundHound now let's talk about HCC as
even though the company has tried to
lure a lot of people to its dual camera
mentality with the One m8 it hasn't
proven to be so popular and that's
mainly because of the 4 megapixels
ultrapixels whatever you want to call it
but in a recent interview with the
camera guru from HTC and let's leave it
there apparently the guy is talking
about the fact that they're working hard
on bringing optical zoom on future
smartphones and this is not new that
galaxy zoom already has that though in a
very odd and cumbersome way and unless
HTC decides to do this in a better way
than without pixels uh let's see how
they figure it out as we would love to
see some patents and speaking of HTC
those of you that complain to the
company does not have the adequate
marketing for its products me included
the company has just hired paul golden
and the reason why he is famous is
because this was the guy that actually
made the samsung galaxy brand be the
galaxy brand that it currently is so
hopefully the guy will bring some better
marketing probably a better name for the
HTC One m8 if it could get more
ridiculous but anyway
let's see how this progress goes
obviously this will take months probably
years to happen and finally for the very
very interesting news of the day we get
rumors that Google is considering the
media tech SOC technology that recently
discovered kind of purchased or whatever
you want to call it and decide to make a
very cheap Nexus smartphone Carly the
rumors are the company is working to
bring us a slimmer $100 Nexus smartphone
which is already possible we see it in
the Moto G already so it's currently
something that the company can do
already try it with Motorola and it
actually quite succeeded I mean that
phone is anything but a mid-range phone
but that leads you to the question of
the day for a hundred dollars would you
purchase an extra smartphone if it
probably you know cap certain things
that you wouldn't be getting in my
particular case honestly for a hundred
dollars twenty dollars or whatever nexus
smartphones are worth it I wish they
were available in more stores and
everything and they aren't at launch but
leave us a comment down below when you
purchase it and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is Phil mushy

much for watching we'll see you next
