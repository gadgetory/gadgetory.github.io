the past we've shown you all kinds of
cool shortcuts on how to get to your
information faster or how to get your
android to do stuff just by talking to
it well today it's kind of a little bit
different we've shown you something
called google gesture search in the past
which is essentially google search using
gestures by writing on the screen well
there are a whole bunch more players in
the field now so let's go take a look
okay so first up is our old standby and
that is Google gesture search it's free
in the market you can go ahead and
download it and install it and
essentially you get this very poem
looking search bar if you will that
blacks out the whole screen it has a
little text area down at the bottom you
actually write what you're searching for
up in this top part and your gestures
will be minimized and written down here
in this lower part so if I want to call
Citibank I write a see it blanks out now
I've got my C down here and everybody
with the C shows up and I I'm getting
closer
Attie why
oh wait it's not City it's City but
still City Bank is showing up so that's
really kind of cool if I want to then
dial them I can so kind of easy there
but it's a little bit difficult to get
to because you've got to have that
shortcut sitting on your home screen to
be able to get into gesture search mode
well to accommodate that here's an app
called gesture bar which doesn't have
any relation to to Google gesture search
what it does rather is it adds I'll show
you go ahead and show that it adds a
gesture search icon up in your
notification bar you can set that when
you boot up or even set that as the
default when you long press on the
search button which would then override
the voice search functionality that
comes stocked with that long pressing on
the search button but let's see what
that does so we're going to go back home
and here we go
we've got it up in the bar we're going
to
pull this down and tap and we can launch
gesture search right there and we're
right back into the Google gesture
search app so not all that convenient
rather than having a button to tap right
there on your home screen now you have
to pull down your notification shade and
then tap on that item in the other
notification bar so a few steps to get
there however it does make it convenient
because your notification bar is almost
always present it's almost always there
similarly if you're on your home screen
your your little tray buttons down here
are usually always there as well you
know I could come over here to another
home screen and now it's not there so I
have to find a home screen that I had
that on or open up my app drawer to get
to it the other way now if I'm already
in an app and not on the home screen
that's where that comes in kind of handy
so interesting way that we can do that
if we want to to go ahead and close that
we launch the app again and we simply
hide and then it is gone from the top
bar well next we've got an idea of
calling someone just by writing a
gesture and that's where this app called
gesture call comes into play you tap on
the app this is of course free as are
everything that I've shown you so far it
is paid by ads that run down at the
bottom you're familiar with that with a
lot of free apps here we can add a
gesture we can see our existing gestures
and we can go into options in this case
confirming that you've got the right
place before you make that call which is
really a good idea just in case you've
got a couple gestures that are similar
or it didn't quite understand who you're
trying to call you've got a chance to
back out before that person is is called
so from here let's go ahead and take a
look I've got Citibank in here again
so let's write a C for Citibank it
recognizes that and says hey do you
really want to call Citibank yes and I
can toggle a checkbox right they did not
show that message again which I believe
is not gesture based I believe that's
for the entire app we can go ahead and
tap yes and make that call now it's kind
of interesting let's go into gestures
here really quick
here is Citibank we've got to a long
press on an item we'll go ahead and edit
that gesture I wanted that gesture to be
a dollar sign okay so let's go ahead and
create that and now let's go back and
write our dollar sign it doesn't really
matter how I do my dollar sign it never
recognizes it so it looks like you've
got to do very simple single stroke
gestures in the gesture call app to be
able to to get that to work the way that
you want it to but when when it does if
you're doing just single stroke
characters or gestures it works really
well now but app the started this whole
thing off is called sign and one of our
pocket now readers James stock it
actually contacted me about this and
said hey you've got to give this a try
so we are and that led to to some of the
others this is probably one of the more
well thought-out gesture apps it's not
like just your search where it searches
everything it's not like just your call
where all you can do is call rather sign
light lets you send a text or call a
phone number based on a gesture as you
notice here you've got a top bar which
has a back button configuration button
or Settings button and that ad person or
add gesture button you'll also notice
that it goes away very very quickly so
let's go back into that down at the
bottom you've got a call icon and a text
icon right down there you'll also notice
in the background this is a beautiful
weather live wallpaper and yes it is
raining outside just a little aside
there but while I was doing that it went
away again first thing that I really
like about this app it's not there all
the time it's only there when you want
it and it's very elegant in the way that
it goes away one thing I don't
particularly like about it is these are
semi-transparent and they're so
transparent that the buttons on the
bottom kind of disappear I'd like a
little bit more opacity a little bit
less translucency on those so that you
could see them a little bit better let's
go ahead and take a look in this middle
area
that went away that middle area is where
you write your gesture so you've
actually got a transparent gesture
surface you can write in so let's go
ahead and do our Citibank symbol and
right there
it does something now I'm going to go
ahead and cancel that so it doesn't call
but let's go back and see what it did
first of all it took that more complex
gesture which is very nice you can do
multi stroke it didn't take multiple
times to to recognize the gesture it
just went ahead and did it the second
thing is I configured it so that it had
a vibrate on recognizer
so as soon as it recognized it it
vibrated the phone let me know hey I've
got this and at that point it came up
with the dialogue that said okay hey
this is who I think it is do you want to
go ahead and call and let's go ahead and
do that again so we come back in here
the whole Citibank and we have a
configurable timer a countdown timer and
we'll see yeah I did it went ahead and
called but we've got this configurable
countdown timer then that basically
gives us an opportunity to not dial the
number just like the other app did but
it also gives us a timeout so we don't
have to interact with it to make it go
ahead and make the call now that's
something that you can change in the
settings so let's go back in here to
settings and default vaio mode you can
set that's either call or text vibration
that's what we talked about vibrate
after dial gesture for confirmation or
success log we want to not keep a call
log after outgoing calls the call
confirmation duration we can set that up
as high as four seconds I'd really like
to see that go up more and then down as
low as no seconds so let's go ahead and
put that up at four and then the gesture
threshold which is how strict you want
the match to your your gesture to be now
this is the light version of the app
light version is free the premium
version costs about two bucks so really
not that bad the light version is really
there for you to give it a try and see
if you like it if you do then you can go
ahead and buy it but let's go ahead and
go in here to our contacts and let's say
I want
to contact Allstate insurance at work
and I'll do the letter A and it doesn't
save because the light version only
allows me to save three contacts or
three signs at one time if I want to add
more signs I have to download the full
version which really isn't a problem you
know it's a kind of a limited version of
the app lets you try it and see if you
are are happy with it and if you are
then you go ahead and buy the full
version so let's go ahead and look at a
couple other things now that we've
talked about things that I like in here
we can see all of my settings or all of
my contacts rather we can view all that
I have assigned so I've just got these
three and that's why it won't let me add
any more but you'll notice I can't add a
contact from here that's one thing that
I'd like if I don't have someone already
in my gesture list I would really like a
button that says hey go ahead and add a
person and then have that take me over
to my default contact manager it doesn't
do that I'd kind of like it second thing
and this I really like you'll notice I
have two buttons out here and you might
be saying hey Joe why why do you have
two buttons there one is actually a
widget so this is a shortcut that I
pulled in from my app drawer and just
dropped it on the screen this is a
widget and I did that by long pressing
on the home screen and choosing the
widgets and then picking that out of the
list they do the same thing but I really
don't need to know what this is I don't
have to have the word underneath it
because the button is so very very
distinct and and really kind of elegant
so I can then just tap on the widget it
has a little bit of an animation to show
me that it's kind of off hook so let's
go back and show that to you again
see if you can see it that's something
that the regular shortcut icon doesn't
have so kind of nice a little bit
cleaner takes up less space on the
screen but that gets us back to the same
issue that we had before you do have to
have it on the screen so if I don't have
it on here I'd have to have a shortcut
icon down here and of course this is
only shortcuts and not widgets but again
these guys don't have text under them so
that's kind of okay
but I can't access it from anywhere else
meaning like the gesture bar I could
pull down my notification bar from any
app and be able to get right to that -
the gesture search the Google desk or
search but with sign I can't do that
it's something that I'd like to see them
to do but honestly I don't know how they
do that other than putting something up
in the notification bar which really
that's getting kind of cluttered already
and I only have one email you know
normally I'll have a Twitter maybe even
a Facebook alert a calendar alert up
there I've got a lot of stuff you know
downloads I've got a raw manager update
so this space is getting very very
crowded even just now with only one icon
up there so I don't know if necessarily
putting it up there in the notification
bar is the best way to do it possibly
like what CyanogenMod has done coming
across here and putting it in that tray
or that nightshade but up here at the
top so that it's not in to go away it's
not in the bar but it is in the shade
now HTC Sense does some stuff like that
as well so it'd be kind of nice if we
occupied that space with common or
frequently used stuff that we want to
have access to easily but not distract
us from everything up there so kind of
interesting searching and dialing and
doing stuff with your fingers the one
other thing and James shared this with
me and I I agree I can only call or text
using this app unlike gesture search I
can't launch an app I can't search for
other stuff on my phone I don't know if
I really should because this is very
basic very simple it's a clean and
elegant concept but I'd still like to
have that functionality maybe buried
somewhere deep in a configuration screen
to turn that on or off or somehow done
elegantly so I can launch an app easily
using that using the gesture search so I
don't have to go hunting for it in my
big long list of stuff that's in my app
drawer so kind
interesting I'd like to think James
first sending in the recommendation one
thing he didn't want me to mention is
that he has been in contact with the
developer the developer is very very
quick in responding and just a regular
normal ordinary person at least that was
my impression not some huge company that
you've got to get a helpdesk ticket
number before they'll answer you back so
very nice there I do want to thank James
for sending in that recommendation if
you've got an app that you think is
novel or unique that we haven't seen
before or maybe something that we've
seen before but has been vastly improved
and you want to share it with the rest
of the pocketnow.com viewers make sure
you send that in to us you can click on
our contact information on any one of
our articles just the byline right there
underneath the title and send us off an
email that will get to us immediately
and we'll be able to respond to it as
fast as we can of course if you see
breaking news happening or have some
kind of a tip that you'd like to send in
to us you can also click on the tip s
button over there at pocketnow.com as
well of course since this is a video we
want to make sure if you liked it give
the video a big thumbs up if you don't
like it let us know in the comments what
you'd like to see done differently and
if you have some suggestions on apps
that we missed or didn't cover well
enough or if there's features of these
apps that we didn't cover that you think
we should have leave those in the
comments as well of course you'll want
to subscribe to our video channel if you
haven't done so already it's free and
it's probably the best way to keep up to
date on what's going on with all kinds
of smart phones stuff in a video format
and of course if you want text you can
head over to pocketnow.com subscribe to
our RSS feed and then you'll be able to
stay up to date and your friends will be
envious of the breadth and depth of your
