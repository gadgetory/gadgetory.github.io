exclusively about HTC one vs galaxy s4 a
lot of you out there are wondering which
phone should i get those are the two big
contenders we're also going to talk a
little bit xperia z although that is a
little bit on the back burner we'll talk
about why that is the case so we're
doing this hangout because we were going
to do this anyway we're going to sit
around and hang out and talk about what
device we want to carry as our daily
driver going into the future this is a
very personal subjective conversation
and we just decided to make it a make it
a hangout of course if you want to
participate in our hangouts we have the
real pocket now live or the other pocket
now live on friday at two p.m. where you
can come in and hang out and ask
questions and just talk to us but for
now we've got Tony and you say everyone
good morning or good afternoon we've got
Michael everyone good morning to you and
good morning to you gentlemen and we've
got Taylor hello everyone good morning
very good so I guess I guess I'll start
things off I've been using the HTC One
putting some final touches on the review
and and it's been it's been easy and yet
difficult to come up with a conclusion
for this phone it's been difficult
because there's the galaxy s4 coming
you've got the Xperia Z already out but
it's been easy because it's such a good
phone and me personally I'm trying to
think about the phone I want to use for
the next six months or whatever and the
question that I asked is i know i love
the HTC one it's got some features that
we haven't seen in a while or ever like
boom sound which makes a huge difference
when you're on a speakerphone or when
you're when you're listening to music
and so forth um the question I'm asking
is how is the galaxy s4 better than the
HTC One and I'm really having trouble
coming up with things for example I like
the ones hardware better I like the boom
sound better I like sense a lot better
than TouchWiz the only really two things
I can think of that the galaxy s4 does
better than the HTC One is one
expandable storage which I don't really
care that much about 32 gigabytes on the
one is good enough for me a number to
the 13 megapixel camera for mega pixels
on the one is just not enough
and it's kind of just this strange like
other pictures are pretty good but
there's still a low resolution kind of
thing anyway so how are you guys dealing
with this decision of galaxy s4 vs HTC
one I guess we'll just start with
whoever talks first I I'll bring up
something while it's on my mind the
removable memory is not the only clear
advantage of the galaxy s4 it is the
replaceable battery as well these are
two things that are always mentioned in
pairs when our commenters you know kind
of let loose about Samsung vs HTC and so
on so you know I think that's something
to keep in mind i agree with you brandon
32 gigs is plenty for me but i just
wanted to throw it out there just to get
it on the table before before we all
started yeah the removable battery thing
is interesting I don't think any human
has ever I think some people have done
it carried a removable battery with them
there is a thing of them what oh when I
had the HTC Thunderbolt I carried for
spare batteries battery life was so bad
when I think I like the Nexus I carried
this Barry yeah yeah when at the Night
Wars you don't want to happen you don't
want to have to do that and there's
something about the HTC One I haven't
tested yet but i heard its remember the
qualcomm 600 charge is crazy fast I
haven't done this quantitatively yet
Tony have you tried the time how long it
goes from 0 to 100 unfortunately not I
always plug it in over tonight and take
it off in the morning ok ok I'm actually
going to do that today I have a feeling
you know usually phones charged on what
two hours which is kind of crazy fast if
you think about it I think the one is
going to be like an hour and a half or
even faster which means that you know if
you're at the airport and you're going
to do a cross-country flight you plug in
it you know they've got this power
station now you're plugging in all
you're waiting it's at a hundred percent
like who cares about the removable
battery so to answer your question I
think we need to have two separate
answers 1 answer should be the objective
answer and from the objective standpoint
the galaxy s4 is better than the HTC One
from any perspective whether we talk
about the rumored American Snapdragon
processor that will clock slightly
higher than the HTC 10
whether we talk about the Exynos octa
core that's going to be also faster than
the one on the HTC one plus of course
the Super AMOLED vs LCD 3 that that's a
discussion we'll have to see it in our
labs but of course as you guys mentioned
both battery and expandable storage now
the subjective answer would be you don't
need 200 megahertz more on the
processing power because these phones
are buttery smooth and fluid as they are
right now out of the box so subjectively
it comes down to a couple of things one
though the quality whether you like HTC
or Samsung and whether you like TouchWiz
or sense and whether you want expandable
storage and battery or not yeah I like
dead zones here um the this yeah I guess
that's a good point objectively the
galaxy s4 does look better on paper I'm
speaking from my own subjective
standpoint my own opinion and and I can
i agree with you you know 200 megahertz
I don't think is going to change my
experience I think that's loud I think
that you know if you're if you're
playing a high FPS game and you were to
have a little FPS meter in the upper
right corner you would see a better
number with the galaxy s4 if it had the
Snapdragon 600 faster clocking or the
octa-core but like that's that's not
going to impact very much the screen is
interesting um Michael we were doing the
comparison the HTC one of the galaxy s4
last week and I I kind of thought that
the screen on the galaxy s4 was just
more impressive what do you think you
know the galaxy it's tough to say at
those demos I was thinking of this too
because we were focusing on the screen
at one point to do the air gesture the
air of you you know functionality on the
gs4 and I realized as I'm trying to
unlock the screen and this kind of glowy
sunlit glint is happening beneath my
finger that Samsung has done what a lot
of manufacturers have done is that
they've thrown this amazingly beautiful
rainbow wallpaper on the thing it's
group like running through the whole
spectrum of color and it's basically
it's a wallpaper that would make even an
ugly display look incredible so I was
not able to judge until you got them
both to white Brandon then I kind of did
a zoom there and I
yeah that was the one versus the gs4
video and it was very interesting to see
how the whites were reproduced
differently on each one I think the the
one of them had a had a more pink cast
and the other one had like that was the
galaxy s4 the galaxy s4 had it was it
was the warmer on it that's exactly it's
a very good point and without having
them in the labs both of them we can
conclude that the screen on the s4 will
be much much much more colorful because
it's an AMOLED screen vibrant colors are
there of course you can go into settings
and take them down a notch but compare
that to the screen on the HTC One which
I believe has iphone 5 like or even
better color reproduction it's going to
be again personal preference that's a
really good point about the iphone 5
comparison because i think that the
iphone 5 is the benchmark and screen
quality I think it has AMOLED like
blacks the whites are the whitest I've
ever seen on any phone and color
saturation is dead on and I just did the
the HTC one vs iphone 5 comparison in
your right Tony the the color saturation
is on par if not better than the iphone
5 the white isn't as good but you really
don't notice when you're when you're
using it at a high degree brightness
Taylor are we being unfair by keeping
the Xperia Z out of this conversation I
mean the police from the from the screen
bark if we're talking displays know the
Xperia Z has the worst 1080p display FC
it's not bad but it's not on the same
level as slcd three or maybe Super
AMOLED what's the what's the worst part
is that the viewing angles of color the
contrast contrast and viewing angles
yeah contrast is really low it's kind of
grey all blacks aren't really black
black so they don't really match the
bezel so you can definitely see that
it's not black and then your your
viewing angles I could sit here and hold
the phone and spin it around and there
are just certain angles text and things
would completely disappear on the
display at just certain angles you
couldn't it wouldn't have to be like a
sharp angle you could be maybe I don't
know 60 70 degrees and spin the phone
around and things would just disappear
there's only you in a difficult
situation would you say that the screen
on the Xperia Z is just like the screen
on the Nexus 7 in terms of quality um
really mean Johnny Wow maybe and maybe
in terms of contrast I didn't I have
them both in it Nora had the Xperia Z
but I didn't compare for the display on
that but the contrast probably yeah I
wonder would that last question I'm
sorry just would that change if we would
have if we would remove the on screen
screen protector which with which it
comes out of the box um I don't know
that's a it's not a filter I don't think
I read up on it it's not like it's not a
filter it's not a screen protector to
filter but I don't remember what exactly
was I read up on it and I don't remember
what it was sorry Michael because it can
you really saw that in Vegas and we were
wondering what the what effect that I
would have on the display because we r
you could you can see it on there i mean
it's you it's it doesn't quite match the
the edge so you can definitely see it's
there it's smaller but it's i have a
feeling and this could be just totally
off I have a feeling it's the same thing
that's on my camera actually my cameras
in that bag but i have the sony nex-5n
and it comes with a little protective
cover over it which is for polarizing so
if you take that off you mean you might
be able to fix like salvage a scratch
display but you're going to not be able
to see it on sunlight so so so
notwithstanding the onion oh that's
right word to use notwithstanding the
display Taylor is there any way that you
see the Xperia Z being better than the
galaxy s4 and HTC One well being
waterproof but that doesn't that's
really matter to me I mean I've never
I've never had a water damaged home ever
that's cuz you don't text in the shower
enough and that yeah that's because you
don't take the Year phone in the
bathroom like some of us do could you
literally text in the shower with the Z
or is it not really made for that yeah
you could um I can't remember who it was
Sam something he did a water test and it
stayed underwater for an hour hey it's
splash and water-resistant so if you
it'll stay dry or at least the insides
will stay dry for 30 minutes at 1 meter
depth of 1 meter so the only place left
in my world where I do
not taking my technologies the shower I
want to keep it that way but is he all
the way men yeah but imagine going to
the pool and shooting some underwater
videos add me some hot stuff right
before you got thrown out yeah oh that's
a loud ringer thanks to the room Sara go
samjhe pullin probably so say oh yeah
Sam point Tony he was in line with us at
the Samsung event I know excuse me at
the nokia van yeah yeah he did a water
tank out okay well i like his hand
because he didn't do it at 1 meter but
he said he didn't have any Tupperware
that was one meter deep so I Tony I know
you were going to chime in but I want I
want to finish this this this little
part here Taylor are there any other
ways that you can think of that the
Xperia Z is better because displays a
big big deal what about like performance
or or quality of hardware or software
maybe the build quality is better than
the galaxy s4 but I have a health s4 so
everything is kind of yeah but you have
the Israeli assault I've held the s3 and
then 02 and the note 2 I got it right
yeah then use of eighty percent LDS four
three much of it so maybe if build
quality the other thing um I had
something and totally lost it yeah the
build quality but it comes at enochs oh
you got it well yeah yeah it's a big
loss for the Xperia Z is your band
support I'm at least on mine I was stuck
on edge it doesn't have the right bands
it doesn't have band to which is what
AT&amp;amp;T serves here for 3g and 4g or hspa+
not LT well just to be fair again I
think your unit was an international
unit and was not a US carrier unit so
maybe those varietal be better but
that's what I'm talking about there's
nothing confirmed for them if I'm
correct so yeah it's it's not confirmed
yet we were before we started the hang
out here Taylor was mentioning made
really good point that people don't talk
about the ZL that much but really the
CEO is the Z without waterproofing with
a more ergonomic shape with a without
plastic with like a soft touch plastic
on the back
better brand support better band support
and and it's got smaller bezels I mean
it's a really nice cream but the front
is still it still has this viewing angle
problem problem was there any difference
in screens between the zia Anzhi when
you had both Taylor only that only on
the software side you can calibrate the
white balance on the CL so that was the
only difference so same exact panel
exact same panel but you could calibrate
the ZL to be if it looked a little warm
you can make it look a little cooler and
balance it out so that was a nice thing
but instead it's a nice thing and like
from the manufacturer when Sony does
that or like Samsung will do that but
then the carriers will come along off
and in America and they'll disable that
feature for whatever reason Samsung is
those cool AMOLED brightening and
dimming controls on their international
variants and then Sprint's like thanks
for making this galaxy s3 for us take
that off that's like a yeah we don't
need it yeah the problem is that it was
it looked more like a filter like an
overlay so if you changed it to just a
hard like saturated purple everything on
the screen with the purple so blacks
would look like a dark purple so it was
I don't know if it was actually
calibration as much as it was like a
filter to balance out some I don't but
you you obviously need to use it lightly
and not saturated but if you want a
purple screen and it's great oh my god
well while brandon is going to net own i
think that the only four most important
aspect which people are probably
interested in is how does the s4 stack
up against the HTC One and the xperia z
/ ZL in terms of camera quality now we
have not seen i mean we we did see some
samples from the s4 but we have not had
the s4 in our labs but we can compare it
to the S free and no two and take it up
a notch we've seen the one it's in our
labs and we've seen the Xperia Z it's
also in our labs which one do you think
will offer the best imaging quality the
yes go ahead galaxy s4 is going to be
like the galaxy s3 III don't think
they've made many changes to the Centers
of a sort of make it higher resolutions
I need something like an iphone 5 /
galaxy
three camera with higher resolution
which i think is going to be really nice
the HTC One you know Tony you've done so
many camera comparisons and you've lived
with it Munna as the way you Brandon see
pixels on screens on every screen I see
noise in every image whether if it's the
808 PureView or the HTC One or the
galaxy s3 or the iphone 5 the best
camera quality for me is the one which
produces the best camera is the one
which produces images with less noise
and I think we just lost Michael but
he'll be back so in my book I've seen
the most noise on the HTC one's camera
but also at the same time the HTC One
kicks some serious a SS when it comes to
low light performance you know what's so
interesting about the one and I imagine
that it's this way it was this way with
a DOA / PureView it's this away with the
Lumia 920 I wish Fisher was back so we
could talk about this it's the weirdest
thing I will be in a low light situation
I'll hold the one up to it and the one
will see more light than my own eyes and
I had a problem while while using the
one under the badly lit circumstances
and the flash didn't fire because there
was no need for flesh and I actually
when I when I flipped the flesh forced
on it produced the worse images than
without flash yeah yes I hate flesh I
never use flash flash is just because
get it you don't have do all see how
flashes like I do you don't you don't
have lighting like this up here this is
what you need just something so you take
that with you in your bar I would /
using flash I just I turn flash off the
day I get the phone and I never use it
do you guys room do you guys remember
before we have like variable flash and
flash that could sense the ambient light
conditions in the first early days when
flashes came out it would just destroy
the image with just white and it would
at it was terrible remember that it also
make a squealing noise I know that girl
okay that's the disposable camera at the
bar mitzvah
Tony so is the one producing less noise
because there are fewer pixels now
actually the one is more noise
interestingly oh i thought you said it
produces less noise no it produces more
noise but it's it's the low-light
sensitivity is better okay well I had
time or hands-on time with the Xperia Z
did some camera test I didn't do
extensive camera tests like you did I
mean I get I guess I did but I didn't
make dedicated post to it um it was
really it was actually surprising how
good it was I've never really had an
android phone that I absolutely loved
the camera on um even even the note 2
galaxy s3 they just didn't do it for me
and the 1x especially didn't so yeah I
never saw the the appeal of the galaxy
s3 camera and people have called me
crazy but I always thought it was kind
of bad so getting the Xperia Z was
surprising it was just as good as the
iphone 5 which has kind of been my my
benchmark for cameras on phones and
interesting that you say that because we
know that both Apple and and sony and
samsung all three of them are using sony
imaging chips yeah but the difference is
there's a lot of software at play there
um one thing I said to HTC in a meeting
at CES was stopped compressing your
images so much because you're producing
artifacts that shouldn't be there that
don't have to be there you're
compressing and that was a problem with
Android from what i was told i don't
know but you see that same compression
on pretty much everything you get the
same exact effect on the s3 on the 1x on
pretty much everything and it and see it
as much on the z so um i would take a
picture I had trouble actually when I
when I jumped it up to 13 megapixels it
dropped down to a 4-3 aspect ratio so
your output was 443 instead of 69 which
is the standard at nine megapixels right
ah just like I'm I'm sorry there so when
you dropped it or actually bumped it up
to 13 megapixels I'd take a picture and
I would take one with the iphone and one
with the Xperia Z
and I would have to actually open up the
information on it to find the resolution
to figure out which one was the Xperia Z
or insect you're saying that or look at
the the file name because they were so
similar I posted it on Twitter and
people were like I don't know which
one's better they looked so much alike
that's that's good to know that that the
experience he takes good photos and in
your review I mean it took some really
impressive sharp hi res shots I want to
jump I want to jump to a specific area
where we're not going to stay on for too
much longer maybe or five minutes or so
michael fisher dropped off I guess
Boston's Internet has gone down we're
doing at 225 viewers thanks everyone for
joining us we're just hanging out here
talking about galaxy s4 vs HTC One and a
little bit experience Z something I want
to talk about is software I've never
loved sense very much in fact when I got
an HTC phone and last year in the year
before I would root it and put you know
cyanogenmod whatever version was out at
that time because I like the stock
Android experience an HTC Sense was just
too much it was put a texture and a
color and a flavor on everything it was
just like leave it alone and then HDC
did you know with the 1x day I think
they messed up the multi task switcher
they made this 3d carousel no one asked
you to change the no one asked you to
change the multi task switcher HTC but
the one is different since five is
different and you know they did change
the multi task switcher but everywhere I
look even if I look at this widget at
the top of the screen it's just a
standard sense widget and you really
can't see it from here it's got some
sort of like texture it's got some
consits got consideration for all of
those pixels so that everything it just
looks so good Tony sent me a screenshot
of a setting a setting screen and I blow
it up the full resolution on my computer
because I wanted to get a little bit
closer because on the on the looking at
the HTC One the pictures are so small
you really can't see the fine detail and
if you look like like for example if you
look around the battery the battery has
this detailing where it's like this
line and it sinks in a little bit and
it's just easy nailed it with sense and
then I look at touch woods which is the
same old TouchWiz inefficient use of
space and color and and aesthetics and I
just say that sense is so much better
and nicer than TouchWiz what do you guys
think I'm currently running a lot of
applications on two phones here and I
want to show this up to you guys because
you mentioned HTC reeded and rethought
the multitasking screen and actually I
prefer the one on the HTC I mean take a
look at this you can see nine cards on
the HTC at any moment and you can see
one two three three-and-a-half okay
let's say four applications on on
TouchWiz or on Android standard
multitasking I really prefer this
because these cards give me a visual
representation of the applications which
are there even if I cannot read text I
mean who wants to read text on a
thumbnail but what's missing in that
screen Tony if you notice something
that's missing hold on because my might
screen turn of what is missing is the
clothes ol button well that but but the
every multi task switcher that I've ever
seen in my life puts the program icon
even if it's small next to the preview
and I hate how the I hate how on the the
sense multi task switcher doesn't have
that it doesn't but it has the
application descriptions as in a text
under the cards life in hell babe I it's
you know icons exist for a reason
they're they're like very easy to
recognize and I list read I don't want
to read write tell the tub this is
personal preference and we're not going
to argue or debate on this you prefer
that one I prefer this one much more i
prefer the stock one I yes I did they
even have to change it was amazing I
mean whatever this definitely like it
when they changed it in since four and I
don't like it now and I haven't even
used I haven't even touched it I still
don't like it now just circling back
really quickly because I had these up I
pulled them up when you were talking
about removable batteries on the galaxy
s4 yeah I've got this this is a power
bag my book bag has
a charge I've got two of these and I
have some my charge I have like 15
battery packs I don't need a replacement
battery and I know the advantage to
being able to swap batteries on the fly
is it's fully charged pop it in you
don't have to wait on anything it just
just boot the phone up and you're good
to go but I mean these work for anything
so as much as I switch phones getting a
like a spare battery for any phone is
kind of moot because I switch hold so
much so I yeah so you're you're always
ready to go it's not even a
consideration ever rule better use of
power packs like in your bathroom and
your kitchen under your sink you know
yeah basically I think everyone is a
clutch there's one of them under my arm
at all times speaking of that accredits
there so I don't mean interrupt you I
want to jump to to battery life and and
then close out this hangouts Tony how
has battery life been for you on the HTC
One we don't know what it's going to be
like on the galaxy s4 yet too early we
don't have it in fact a lot of what
we're saying is premature we're just
speculating we don't have the phone yet
of course but we will soon what do you
thing about battery life on the one Tony
well my my answer will not be a specific
answer but you will know exactly what
I'm saying so I'm not going to tell you
how many hours I can run with it because
I usually shut my phone down overnight
because I don't want to be bothered by
everything so I'm gonna compare my usage
scenario which is the same across all
phones on the HTC One with previous
phones so the way I use my phone HTC One
is right there with the s3 it's it lasts
me one and a half two days while turning
it off overnight so if we take that six
hours out of the equation then I'm
guessing it will be enough for 36 hours
of my usage but that it bands from
person to person okay so you can go a
day and a half even if you're like
playing games and you're like messing
with screen brightness and I don't I
don't I don't play games so that's again
my my personal usage so when asked about
games Tony says I don't play it no I do
nothing productivity on YouTube are
saying we are hasta
towards winning shot or one another oh
yes where we are you know this is heated
debate um so um that's funny so i've
been using HTC one now since uh less
than a week and I've had some really
strange things happen with battery life
where one day I won't make it through
it's only happened one day and I think I
know why and other days you know I get
to the charger at the end of the night I
take it off at seven a.m. and i'm
plugging in at nine p.m. and i still
have lino thirty percent despair which
is which is generally how battery life
is shaping up on the HTC One it's no
better or no worse than galaxy s3 like
you say Tony or iPhone 5 if you do a
little bit of management you'll get
through the day easily if you're going
out at night you're gonna have to top it
off but it's not a big deal because
we've Chargers freaking everywhere and
Taylor even has a charging pack in this
bathroom plus there's also a settings
which is on by default out of the box it
keeps Wi-Fi alive at all times and I
like to keep Wi-Fi off during the device
sleeping period and only rely on data so
if you flip that off then you will get
probably a couple of hours more battery
power oh yeah that's a nice little
hidden setting and we'll mention that
the review another thing interesting is
that HTC has this power save option
which a lot of phones have but HTC puts
it right in the notification shade and
you can't remove it which is weird it
automatically goes on when you're at
twenty percent battery life or you can
turn it on for the whole day and the
cool thing about it is that it doesn't
seem to change much screen brightness
doesn't go as high Wi-Fi performance is
probably slightly worse and i think the
processor might be under clocked a
little bit but when it says fluid as it
was before it's as fluid as it was
before so i did an experiment and i'm
going to do the experiment again because
it didn't work i was thinkin hey if
powersave doesn't bother me why not
leave it on the whole day with this will
that mean that i can get through the day
and have fifty percent left at the end
of the night set of thirty percent in
twenty percent the day i tried it that
was the day that weirdly it died at six
pm I think it was because I was
bluetooth streaming for about two and a
half hours driving home yeah but um you
know i'm going to try that experiment
because if that works usually with power
save there's always a compromise right
it's it shuts off your freakin like
ability to make phone calls but on the
one it you don't even notice it so
before before we go offline I would like
to ask both of you and I'm terribly
sorry Michael is not here but he has
some connectivity problems now if all
three phones were in front of you and
you would only be able to pick one for
the rest of the night of the year which
what would be the one without no pun
intended with the one okay are you first
probably the one I carried the One X as
office the camera was for six months
really without an issue I had it
overheated on me and that I was it so I
got it replaced but six months and I
didn't really have a problem um but that
was also accompanied by the iphone so I
had a nice camera anyway but yeah I
probably choose the one I lied i'm a
sucker for really nice design and and
metal so Taylor likes metal I like metal
well I do not don't mean I I I don't
like anodized aluminum because it scuffs
and scratches so easily my phone was
trashed after a couple of weeks even
though I take care of it and carry in a
case I have a counter-argument here's
mine and it's just as new I can walk
through around it you won't see a
scratch on it so it all depends on how
you treat your phones well you treat it
like a obsession yeah toss around
a little bit show her his boss cuz my
iphone 5 is is pretty close to destroyed
um can't really see it in this angle but
it's not holding up so well no phone
that I carried for six months well mine
it was maybe pho maybe five months
because I had to get it replaced ikd
sitting for five months beaten banged it
around through it around didn't really
care didn't really care it in a case
ever and it's got one itty-bitty little
tiny Nick on the top that's it whoa hey
I got a shirt yeah look creator
broadcasting to you live from
out of this what is this bleep world we
can't hear you broski um yea sorry I'm
broadcasting from an apartment building
with no power so I have my mobile
hotspot going and a little bit of I'm
sorry sorry to interrupt is that you
joined because you just joined that the
conclusion says I was asking everybody
and only Taylor got the chance to answer
if you had all three phones HTC One
galaxy s4 xperia z 03 in front of you
and you could choose one for the
remainder of the year as your daily
driver which one would it be can I
answer now yeah sure it would be the HTC
One without question I beg your pardon
Sunil 12 oh you did oh ok yeah yeah well
the one that as well you chose the one
also um ya know they think the thing is
for me is that a hardware has always
been very very important and I think the
galaxy s4 is a really good choice if you
loved the build quality and the TouchWiz
and kind of everything about the galaxy
s3 and while I respect the galaxy s3 I
never fell in love with it so the HTC
One is so much more compelling to me
than either of those alternatives and
principally that's hardware but also
like Brandon said earlier I like sense a
whole lot better than I like in touch
with so that's that would be my choice
for those two very brief reasons and
Sony I don't even think about ever just
because it's um you know American
Michael can I call you oz because that's
what I felt like you are right now look
I'm so funny if someone said Michael
live from Iron Man suit I'm just
hilarious because it kind of looks like
LCD display and everything on the camera
and you're there any like my heads up
display and all that kind of stuff yeah
we should be that way yes yeah it's it's
creepy in the booth when it's dark guys
I gotta tell you well its pitch black
Brandon your turn yeah so so back in the
day HTC used to make phones that were
all around just really good even down to
the way it feels in your hand and then
they messed up they came out with after
the desire HD everything went down
the 1x had lag it's amazing camera was
terrible it's in hand fuel was kind of
weird the only thing the X the 1x had
going for it was it screen a really good
screen what keeps surprising me about
the HTC One are the things that I don't
notice the things that I cannot
criticize because everything everything
together is just so well done the way
that it feels in my head I haven't
thought about the way it feels in my
hand because it feels so naturally
weighted the boom sound is I really
didn't think that would be that big of a
deal but it's really changed the way I
use my phone speaker phone calls are
incredible I place the phone down and I
play some Spotify music I leave sonos
turned off the way that it looks from
across the room the speed and fluidity
everything operates at an even beat I
mean you get these phones and it you
know jelly beans coming along and
hardware is coming on you don't see this
as much but everything just operates at
the right beat and I'm borrowing that
work for Michael because he likes to use
the word beat and to like to use the
word beat buttface but you know what I
mean like it's you press and it responds
at the exact right amount of time to
make the experience feel completely
fluid and completely amazing and then
the screens beautiful i love what sense
looks like although i am i'm going to
put a third party launcher on here
because i don't think that anyone in the
world even the blindest or the oldest
grandmas in the world thinks that your
home screen grit should be limited to
four rows of icons down on a 1080p
screen it's just totally inefficient use
of space especially if you go into the
app tray I mean it's come on you can fit
a lot more icons um so you know I don't
think my opinions going to change when i
get the galaxy s4 i think HTC really did
an amazing job and this is going to be
one of the highest ratings all i'll ever
I've ever given a phone when the review
comes out so sorry for the long winded
answer but I I feel good about the one I
really do I'm just circling back to the
Z quickly you're talking about how it
fills in the hand one thing is is that
the Z even though I have this note here
I don't have those anymore this thing
feels kind of comfortable in the hand
it's tapered and it's rounded and it
feels nice it's big it's huge
this is the note 2 if you couldn't tell
feels great but the experience he was
only five inches and it felt bigger
because it was just it was like the if1
just straight sides and it felt so big
and uncomfortable in a hand that was
probably the biggest turnoff that's why
I would choose the zo or CL over the Z
every day it was just it wasn't organ
Amish whatsoever the button placement
was really awkward too but yeah so that
kind of goes into play here if that was
better it would be much higher on the
tires unless we'd be talking about it
more yeah Tony what is your what is your
final conclusion here I completely agree
with the with you Brendan I have used
briefly that is the Xperia Z and at mwc
I've been using the HTC One both colors
for a week now and I've used the s4 now
I haven't but I use the S free and it's
the same sand and now I've said this
even before I've seen the galaxy s4 I am
tired of the galaxy s3s design and for
me design is more important than for
instance some of the features which I
don't use I don't use smart stay I don't
use that body I don't use anything from
the Samsung ecosystem were operating
system or user experience which would
allow me or make me choose it over the
HTC One but the HTC One on the other
hand aside from all the pros it brings
it also has a con in my book the biggest
con with HTC one is its camera
unfortunately well it it's it sucks to
hear you say that but what she knew is
coming I knew it was coming actually
it's a considerate like the weakest link
in the chain in a strong chain you mr.
in a strong chain because the phone
overall is very good but the weakest
part of it is the camera just like the
weakest part in any samsung phone is
depending on who you ask either TouchWiz
or something else I think that's a poor
analogy just just based on the chain
just based on you're only as strong as
your weakest link so I'm just gonna
leave here that you come up with a
better analogy but we're not smart
enough I guess I'm so stop it I
basket what I you know what I know what
you're saying okay so I'm gonna wrap
this up here so so guys thanks for
