we've got the t mobile webconnect rocket
USB stick with hspa+ and here it is it's
kind of large got your switch to bring
the USB plug out it doesn't Bend so it's
going to be sticking straight out of
your laptop but that's pretty good and
over here we have a micro SD card slot
so you can add you can keep some memory
in there and use it as a memory stick as
well and on the bottom is the sim card
slot which is under here but I can't
open it so you're going to take my word
for that and let's plug it into the
laptop
so when we plug it in windows 7 is going
to recognize the card
so after finishes installing we can
launch the t mobile webconnect software
oh here's the web connect manager this
is this is a Wi-Fi fab so you can you
also get t mobile's what a Wi-Fi hotspot
and here's a little note and we can
connect to that without using our
t-mobile 3g allocation of space or
contains lab and here's the 3g tab so i
can click on that and i can connect the
software can get kind of iffy like if
you boot it up it may not connect to
your home Wi-Fi network or you know if
the USB stick is not plugged in so you
know you might not need it because the
USB stick is also supported by windows 7
so you can use it without the web picnic
manager if you want to but I would
recommend it if you're especially on the
200 mega per month plan because this
will keep track of how much data usage
you are using so next we're going to
take it for some speed tests and show
you some screenshots of that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
