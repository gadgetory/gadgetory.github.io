pocketnow.com and in this video we're
gonna take a look at some of the
built-in applications on the Samsung
Galaxy s2 samsung has added a lot of
really cool apps that we want to show
you let's get to it so previously we
talked about the hardware on the galaxy
s2 and we also dived into TouchWiz 4.0
which is of course comprised of a lot of
really cool elements that makes the UI
really interesting and fun if you want
to check out those videos we'll put
links up at the end of this video we
know a lot of people are following these
videos on the Galaxy s2 it's going to be
a very popular device this year and it's
actually been delayed it's not shipping
right now but it should be in a couple
of weeks we're just very excited to be
able to show you this device before you
order one and we know it's expensive we
want to help you make the right decision
so let's dive into some of these
included apps we're going to skip any of
the stock built-in apps like calendar
and and and clock and whatnot because
those are basic also we're going to talk
about the internet browser in the next
video we're going to compare the browser
with that of iOS Android and Windows
Phone 7 the browser on this thing smokes
it is probably the fastest browser we've
ever seen it is really incredible what
two cores or at least the Exynos
processor can do for browsing and we're
gonna compare coming up soon so let's go
through this were these are all stock
applications we've got something called
readers hub here which is really cool
what this is is basically a gateway for
all kinds of digital content we've got
news over here and what this lets you do
is download newspapers and the interface
is really cool I've downloaded an issue
of the Philadelphia Inquirer you can
pinch to zoom it looks really good on
the Super AMOLED plus display on the
Galaxy S 2 most things do look really
good on this display and this
application is cool because if you want
to try it you don't have to sign in you
don't have to pay anything and if you go
over to store you can actually filter
out newspapers by country it really is
quite comprehensive the number of
newspapers that are available and you
can quickly download an issue you can
set it to automatically download the new
issue every day so you can read
newspapers on your phone pretty cool
if we go back we've got a book section
which is just linking to the Kobo ebook
store of course there's also the Amazon
there's the Nook ebook store and many
others there's Google Books now so
certainly you don't have to use this if
you don't want to
they're just suggesting that you do and
also there's a magazine hub which is
just the Zinio application which you can
download anyway from the Android Market
you have to sign in you have to create
an account it's much more interesting
when you can test something and not have
to sign in like this news feature up
here now another thing down here is Game
a pub there are three hubs there's
actually more than that but let's go
into the game hub we've got two panels
up here two tabs we've got social games
Samsung just rep Samsung's just sort of
recommending games for you to download
and we've got premium games over here
all of these are trials unfortunately
there aren't any you know full-featured
premium games included on this device
which is kind of a shame I've already
gone ahead and downloaded GT racing so
let's take a look at what that looks
like GT racing doesn't seem to be
optimized for WVGA resolution strangely
but you can get a sense for how gaming
performance is with this particular
application we can take a look at
loading times and frame rates and things
like that so let's play this for a
couple of minutes or at least four for a
few seconds before I crash into a wall
so loading
all right your guilt just sounds through
this real quick we'll take that car
which let's start kind of just fly
through these screens so we can get to
an actual race all right and we've got
the accelerator on the right I'm just
gonna floor it right off the line and
can you please and see how bad I am at
this game but you see frame rates are
pretty darn smooth I mean it's it might
be a testament to the game it might be a
testament to the to the hardware
performance of this device but other
games I've tested look really really
good on this phone which kind of makes
sense there's a lot of power behind this
so the game looks good the resolution is
it's perfect it doesn't looks optimized
for the higher resolution WVGA screen
here but that is eNOS when we get out of
that
okay and we're back into the application
tray and there's something else called
music hub which is Samsung's music store
if you want to download music to your
device Google is probably going to
release a music service actually today
or probably by the time you see this
video they will have announced that
Android really doesn't have a good music
service right now Windows Phone 7 has
ooh and iOS has iTunes but Android
really doesn't have anything so
Samsung's trying to beat Google to the
gun here and sort of create the
application that allows you to download
music so we've got Beastie Boys new
album you can buy for five bucks or you
can download these tracks so it's a four
pay music service obviously and you can
download music right into the music
library of your Android phone which is
pretty cool so we can go back and get to
the previous screen okay let's swipe to
the right see what else we have the
device comes with a file explorer which
is nice so you don't have to go ahead
and download a third-party file explorer
we've got a music application which is
actually very simple it looks pretty
much like the stock Android application
actually for music I've got a video
playing application if we go down we've
got voice command and voice talk and
this is actually pretty cool so if we go
into voice command it's a very well done
voice command application you can see
sort of the things that you can do with
it you can call somebody you can update
Twitter you can reply to text messages
so Twitter update let's try this one
Twitter update I am testing the Samsung
Galaxy S to see if it gets it check it
out perfect I am testing the Samsung
Galaxy s2 really cool voice voice
command there this is great if you're
driving you don't feel like getting your
phone out and texting while you're
driving which you should never do so you
can use voice command and there's also a
widget for this so you can quickly
activate the voice command when you are
driving and if we go down with another
thing called social hub which is really
just an aggregator for all of your
social networking so from here you can
add an account and gives you a wide
variety of accounts that you can add so
if you want to put your social
networking in one place you can do it
through that we've got a photo
editing application which is kind of
basic and and a pointless actually so
let's just take a picture and you can
see you can crop it you can fill it with
colors you can add some ghost effects or
whatever you have to make a selection
first so very basic photo editing
application nothing that will rival
photoshop of course we've got something
called AllShare here which is the DLNA
application which allows you to share
content from your device wirelessly to
DLNA supported devices and it's a pretty
nice application and this is really cool
right here Keys air it's a wireless
management tool that allows you to
remotely access your phone from a local
web browser I'm going to show you that
now okay so we've got the keys air
connected and let me just show you what
the screen looks like it gives you a web
address to use and it as long as you're
on the Wi-Fi network all you have to do
is plug in a web address to your browser
and boom you are connected to your phone
so let me show you some of the things
you can do this is your dashboard so you
can see photos that are on your device
and videos over here on the right you
can see music if you're playing anything
we've got File Explorer and you can
collapse these and move them around it's
kind of a really cool interface a cool
way to see your phone it's kind of like
htcsense.com although the way it looked
now is that you can't use you can't use
this remote phone management tool if
you're not near your phone you have to
be on the same Wi-Fi network so we can
drill down on these paddles on the Left
two photos we can download them to our
computer or upload new ones we've got
music and videos and ringtones you can
upload ringtones here's a really handy
feature bookmarks so it's kind of
annoying to add bookmarks onto a mobile
phone especially if you've got a lot of
sites that you check you can just do it
wirelessly through this particular
application there's no login required
all you do again is enter this web
address up here depending on what your
phone is telling you to do if you've got
SMS you can manage them from here you
can manage your call log your context
even jump into the File Explorer and see
and see what's going on down here you
can even play music stream music from
your phone to your web browser really
cool functionality here in Kies Air not
as robust er or you know versatile as
HTC Sense
but certainly very easy to set up very
easy to use to remotely manage your
phone okay and we're back continuing on
swiping to the right we've got a voice
recorder a video maker which is really
kind of like iMovie but for Android so
what we can do here is we can make a new
project you can create an effect so
let's choose stage you can swipe to the
right very much like iMovie as you can
see so we can hit apply and basically
you take multimedia from your phone
whether it's music photos videos or even
you can take a new photo or video you
drag it to the timeline and boom it
applies music it applies the transitions
you've got an instant movie right on
your phone pretty cool back out here I'm
also on the screen we've got something
called Samsung Apps which is hey another
app store like we needed one so this
will allow you to see certain
applications that Samsung Repp
recommends the selections really not
that comprehensive we can go into
category you can see the number of apps
that are here I mean why do you why is
Sam something doing this the Android app
store is is perfectly fine the Amazon
App Store is perfectly fine we don't
need another app store and there's
really nothing exclusive in there so
it's not like they've added apps that
you can't find anywhere else we've got
the task manager which we've already
talked about this is also accessible
when you tap and hold on the home button
you can just quickly go into the task
manager we've got FM radio which is
which is great if you like to listen to
local radio broadcasts you have to have
your headset connected naturally if
there's a really cool sort of retro
looking interface for that we've got a
memo pad which we talked about
previously Polaris Office which allows
for more advanced manipulation of office
documents so you can you know edit Word
documents Excel spreadsheets or whatnot
which is quite nice BBC iPlayer is just
a way to look at BBC broadcasts we've
got something called suggests right here
which is just linking to a website this
is kind of kind of silly that allows the
Samsung to show you certain apps that it
recommends and it's got a nice interface
here you can swipe to the right and here
are some apps if you need help in
getting some apps to download you can
click on that
so a lot of really cool applications
built-in we really like this Keys air
remote browser management really cool
feature there we also like the readers
hub especially in its ability to let you
look at newspapers without having to
download or sign up for a trial at least
in the beginning so a lot of really cool
software offerings here not that much
crap where are really no crap where
we're happy to report on the Samsung
Galaxy s2 once the carriers get a hold
of this we're probably going to see crap
where because that's what tends to
happen coming up soon we're going to
talk about the web browser of the
Samsung Galaxy s2 you don't want to miss
it
it's really incredible what this thing
can do in terms of web browsing speed
again we're going to put up links on the
video right now if you want to jump back
to the hardware video or to the TouchWiz
4.0 tour we'll be back with a lot more
on the Samsung Galaxy s2 thanks for
watching and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
