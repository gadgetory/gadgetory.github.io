mean better cameras for the iPhone 8
Black Friday deals continue after Black
Friday is over and new reports show that
it's not a good time to buy an iPad I'm
Jaime metal Iveta happy Thanksgiving to
everyone we are thankful for a ton of
things but it starts with the fact that
you guys spend your time watching our
videos it means a lot this is PocketNow
daily the official news begin with deals
s if Black Friday is upon us
Amazon has got some of the better ones
if you're looking for wearables the
Huawei watch is currently $200 you can
see the Samsung gear fit to 450 there
are a ton of fitbit options that drop
$50 on the price tag and these are not
the only deals you could find more in
the link in the description other deals
come from Verizon the company is
implementing this one for the weekend
after Black Friday where year can
actually get one of the hot smartphones
of the year iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus
Samsung Galaxy s7 edge etc but there's
kind of a catch first of all you have to
bring in a phone but depending on
whatever value is brought in from that
trade and you can definitely offer phone
but it doesn't end there if you're
actually switching carriers with this
trade in you can even get a two hundred
dollar Visa card for that I'm not
exactly sure if that's really a
compelling deal but still free phones
pretty much on two-year installments
Google has some other very interesting
deals if you're in the market for a
chromecast oh yeah you're getting three
months of HBO now and this applies to
either the regular chromecast or the
current chromecast ultra this is
actually a compelling deal because it
pretty much makes the chromecast free in
some cases you can learn more in the
description as well now as well the
spotlight over the rumors particularly
with Apple and iPads I highly suggest
you do not buy any because apparently
we're getting new iPads early next year
that 10.5 inch iPad that we've been
talking about apparently is just the 9.7
inch chassis with less bezels and for
those of you wondering what's going to
happen with a nine point seven inch form
factor apparently it will stay it seems
that we are getting new products and
these will be more affordable ones so
yeah hold your horses
and finally the hot new says they have
to do with
Apple and LG Innotech both companies
have apparently signed the partnership
and the whole idea is to bring better
dual sensors for the iPhone eight
currently you get a telephoto lens and
you get some sort of bouquet with
portrait mode apparently you're gonna be
able to get 3d photography with this
next generation dual sensor that we
might get from LG and this is rather
interesting as it actually leads me to
the question of the day do any of you
actually use these dual lenses on the
iPhone 7 plus because I will admit I
don't I'm still trying to figure out the
whole way of moving away from the
gimmicky face because I really don't
assume in two subjects much so yeah this
could be cool but I'm not saying it's a
killer deal like in the case of the
wide-angle lenses we get it from LG
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know what's your case friends you
