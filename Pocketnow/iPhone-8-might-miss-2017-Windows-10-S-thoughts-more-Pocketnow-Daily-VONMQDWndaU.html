with a new approach to a surface laptop
rumors claim that the iPhone 8 might not
be ready for primetime until next year
and it seems that the craze of building
Apple watch applications has come to a
halt I'm Jaime Rivera and I know this
video is for yesterday that Galaxy s8
review left me in Zombie mode and the
tomorrow's where we will probably do the
same again
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today is kind of interesting as
there are not official news that confirm
that there are companies pulling their
applications away from watch OS and let
me just ask you this how many of you
actually use third-party applications on
your Apple watch or any SmartWatch for
that matter I know that I use the Nike
Plus running application and that's
pretty much it but and everything else I
mean there are applications like for
example Google Maps that just pooled and
there are others that I would not
imagine even in this world or lifetime
using on a watch but yeah it seems that
they are losing popularity that makes
sense I'll talk about the ZTE Exxon 8
this is interesting we haven't really
heard many news or rumors about this
feature flagship smartphone the reason
why I put that on quotes is because
looking at certifications this does not
look like a flagship phone for 2017 it
seems that the company is scaling back
to stuff like a Snapdragon 820 again not
an a21 we were not really understanding
what we see this could just be another
iteration or varying that they're
pulling out or it could be the mini
variant but we will keep you closer to
me to learn more now let's talk about
the HTC u 11 we have yet another teaser
on Twitter which i probably can't show
you the video here that tells us that
apparently the companies designed for
this smartphone will be silent no more
we see water all over this light blue
chassis and obviously that hints to the
fact that its water resistance that
light blue tone is actually interesting
but most of all is that exactly how is
that design going to be silent no more
because if there is one thing HTC is not
silent about its design let's see about
that and let's move the spotlight over
to the
eight the reason why is because we've
got some very trusted sources that claim
that we might have to wait for that 10
year iPhone until next year which would
not make it a 10 year iPhone anymore the
reasons why is because Apple has been
struggling with manufacturing this phone
ever since it started its endeavor we
hear from sources that manufacturing
that thing has been a nightmare for the
company and that is kind of true over
the last couple of pocket our dailies
over the last few weeks the news have
always been that it's got the lights for
this delays for that that it can't add
the fingerprint scanner and the screen
that it can't curve the display
everything and it just wouldn't be the
first time that Apple had this idea of a
smart phone and then men bit of pull
until the following year
we had that case with the design of the
iPhone 6 for example so yeah it seems
that it might be a possibility and
finally the very interesting news today
for the first time have to be about
Microsoft the company's announcement of
Windows 10 as an addition to their new
surface laptop this is interesting this
was an education event and yet we got
this nine hundred ninety nine dollar
laptop that's gorgeous in every way very
powerful Core i5 core i7 but definitely
not something that I would buy my son
it's just too expensive now it makes a
lot of sense think about this the
Chromebook pixel is a showcase device
for much cheaper less expensive
Chromebooks and the thing about Windows
10 S is that it is not Chrome OS this is
actually Windows 10 in every way the
only difference is that it will only run
applications from the Windows Store
pretty much like the case of Windows RT
makes a lot of sense I don't know
exactly if it will hold any feature and
obviously we will have to wait to see
what manufacturers like HP and ace 4
come out with when it comes to hardware
that's less expensive than this surface
laptop but anyways it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about Windows 10 s and this new
Microsoft Surface laptop do you like
these products in my case I like them I
just don't know that there's a feature
for Windows 10 S at a time when you can
find $250 laptops running atom
processors that have a full-blown
Windows 10 home I don't know if it holds
a future unless the company kills
Windows 10 home
and about the laptop it's beautiful I
just I wouldn't buy it but anyways leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your opinion brands you delay agos
