now Michael behind the camera and we are
here in Barcelona at the LG booth taking
a look at the LG optimus g pro d
possible galaxy note 2 not even killer
but competitor let's take a look so
talking about specifications we have a
5.5 inch IPS full HD display for 400 PPI
on the top we have a headset we have a
ambient light sensor and a proximity
sensor and a 2.1 megapixel front-facing
sure going down to the bottom below the
huge screen we have the home button
which resembles almost every Samsung and
LG phone and next to them we have a
android back button and a menu button
rolling it to the side we have a power
button and absolutely nothing else but
we do have the place where you can peel
the back battery cover off despite the
fact that we've been told that this is
included and embedded now hopping up to
the back we have a 13 megapixel camera
with an LED flash you'll notice the U
plus this is a Korean version but the
international version will have the
exact same specifications going down
towards the bottom we have the LG logo
of course we just covered up plus the
micro USB port and a microphone which
will pick up mainly your voice popping
in to the other side I'll talk more
about this button in a second we have a
volume rocker for volume up and volume
down and on the top we have a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack with an iron
blaster and the secondary microphone for
noise cancellation but let's talk about
software and I'll tell you more about
this button right now so the Jeepers
running Android 4.1 at the moment of
LG's proprietary user interface on top
of it and it doesn't have a stylist but
in this case your fingers the stylist
just like it was with the optimist view
and to demonstrate that will go into for
instance messaging and here's this
button which you will press and the user
interface will change so that you can
select your tools for instance this
color and this pen we have several types
of brushes and you can use your finger
to write or annotate and you can of
course use the eraser and everything you
note on that page will be saved and it
will be available for your later
reference now hopping back before we do
that there's an interesting feature for
instance say you're in a phone
conversation with somebody or you're
having an email or you're writing
something down using the cue memo and
you write down the number it will he
will hit that button and basically your
whole note on that screen will remain
visible you hop out back of the
application you'll still have your note
there for instance you'll go into
contacts or your phone and dial in the
phone number which you have just noted
call away press the button once again
and it will disappear and now let's take
a look at qslide which is LG's mode of
making multiple windows happen we've
seen videos running in the background
for previous devices but in this
particular case there are a couple of
applications which allow you to have
them in a window state let's try that
out with for instance calculator right
here as you can see right now it is full
screen but you can hit that button right
there and it will give you a cue slide
activation of course it's a guide and it
will have the window right there loading
on top it is of course resizable so you
can change the size of that and you can
mess around with the transparency so
you'll see what's beneath that let's get
back to the home screen
and kill that
just two words about build quality it
feels good in hand it's of course made
out of plastic it's that kind of plastic
which resembles the nexus 4 i'm trying
to get the light on it in a proper way
LCD next is for like squares shining and
different light conditions it's of
course plastic but it feels good it's
not cheap so this much about the LG
optimus g pro we'll be back with you
with a comparison between the LG optimus
g pro and the samsung galaxy note 2
anthem front pocket now Michael behind

watching stay tuned for more
