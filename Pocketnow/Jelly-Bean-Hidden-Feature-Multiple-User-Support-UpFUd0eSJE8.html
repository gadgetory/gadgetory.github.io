pocketnow.com and i'll try to say my
name a little bit slower hey guys this
is Brandon minimun from pocketnow.com I
know some of you have asked me to save
solar and this is a look at multiple
user support and Android jellybean let's
take a look so this is a third-party
ramen I'll talk about what ramen is in a
minute so some developers a while back
discovered that an Android jelly bean
there's multiple user support which is
great if you have kids or friends that
you don't want getting into your stuff
let me show you how it might work this
is one developers implementation of it
so I'm going to go into the settings
here and I'm going to go to users and
restrictions and I'm going to add a new
user and this person's name is pesky kid
let's call it pesky kid - kind of funny
name actually click OK and you go
through and you check off the things
that you don't want pesky kid to to see
so I don't want them to see the browser
I don't want them getting into you know
crazy things I don't want them to go
into youtube I don't want them to see
any crazy videos and that's about it so
I'm gonna save it pesky kid - now to
switch users you do a tap in hold of the
power button we're to go to pesky kid -
and then it does something really
awesome it basically brings you back to
a stock implementation of Android with
nothing on it in fact this is the
introduction screen it creates a new set
of files and folders and if we go into
the app tray you'll see that there's no
browser there there's no YouTube there
and none of my files or settings or
anything like that are within this
installation of Android so I don't have
to worry about pesky kid - looking at my
calendar looking at my email looking at
my photos or anything like that it's
just a clean installation with the apps
that I only want pesky kid to to be
seeing really cool let me show you the
ROM that allows this to happen so if I
go into settings and again these are the
introduction screens here if we go into
settings well you'll see that in
settings you can't do very much because
this is multiple user support where the
other users shouldn't be able to do
anything and obviously what you would do
is you would set up the main user the
primary user to have a pass
or something like that so only you could
get into the settings and every single
lot so if we go into the settings now
we'll go to the about screen I'll show
you what ROM this is and various
different developers are doing this and
some of the roms some are not it's kind
of a useful feature again if you have
kids or friends that want to use your
phone but not everyone would find it
useful so what we're running here is a
ROM called domination and this is
running on Android 4.1.1 I'll put a link
in the description so if you have a One
X and you're running a third-party
bootloader you can get this running on
your HTC One X so really cool around has
a lot of other cool features not going
to talk about in this video just wanted
to talk about the multiple user support
because it's really really cool anyway
if you'll take this video please give me
a thumbs up and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
