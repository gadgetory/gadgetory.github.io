yeah we're live guys yeah crit alive
okay well that means that I have to play
the dog music except now it's on Twitter
why is it on Twitter okay guess this is
how this show is going to go we go
hands-on with the Moto Z and Z Force
does motorola have the right recipe for
modular phones what is google's project
tango and what is augmented reality
doing on the lenovo fab to pro also will
cover some of the rumors surrounding
wwdd WWDC this year if I can get any of
this language out of my face what might
Apple have up its leaves make sure
you're charged and ready for episode 204
of the pocket now weekly others weekly
podcast is where we dissect and discuss
those gadgets and make our lives mobile
smart phones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and your modular gadgets
were Legos I'm one Carlos Becnel senior
editor of pocketnow.com blasting the
signal from sunny Southern California
and rounding out our techie trio this
week I am joined by also senior editor
at pocketnow.com mr. Adam doubt talking
it's hard time I'm going to have I'm
gonna have to insist that you can call
me mr. Kutcher for the rest of this
podcast yeah we offer some stuff to talk
about their I'm sure and of course
podcast producer mr. Jules walling how's
it out on the East Coast for you today
let's do it all right you know talking
as hard as actually the name of the
great wish me the name of this podcast
we watched most of that audio Jules it's
gonna be a fun show ladies and gentlemen
but we've had some cool stuff to cover
and so hopefully we'll we'll keep it all
on track the time on the west coast is
11am now guys I'm excited we have a new
sponsor this week atlassian atlassian
produces collaboration software for
teams from startup to enterprise size
atlassian offers
solutions for tracking complex tasks
with their JIRA management software and
atlassian confluence provides a platform
for creating content and sharing assets
between various team members and while
creating collaborators can discuss in
real time through instant message or
video chat on their hip chat service and
lastly bitbucket provides a powerful
platform to test manage and review code
in real time now we work in a
collaborative environment here at
pocketnow.com but we're spread out all
over the world and so we have all of
these disparate and separate solutions
for trying to manage information and
trying to coordinate on projects and I'm
and actually Adam I'm kind of happy that
we have you on this week especially with
the sponsor is you you mentioned in an
email chain that you've actually worked
with atlassian in a job that you
recently you were recently on and I was
hoping that you could share some
thoughts on what they brought to the
table for streamlining your workflow
sure yeah at my day job we use a lot of
Atlantean projects products excuse me a
hip chat we use JIRA for our project
management we're a software developers
so a lot of our bug tracking and a lot
of our tasks that need to get done go
straight into JIRA so that we can you
know knock them out and knock them off
the list as we need to but we use
hipchat to stay in touch because a lot
of our team is also remote not not
dissimilar to pocket now right so you
know if we need to send each other you
know files or links or you know cat
pictures whatever if that is a hip chad
is our medium of choice so yeah we use a
I think we use bitbucket that's a little
bit outside my purview but yeah we use a
lot of their products so yeah it's
actually pretty cool that they're a
sponsor of our pocket no show here yeah
love is I was stoked to uh to get the
message on them jumping in this is
something that we're definitely we've
been taking a look at behind the scenes
here and I think for a lot of companies
a lot of businesses especially people
starting startups especially where the
notion of having a giant monolithic
office building where everybody trudges
in in a white short sleeve shirt and a
black tie and sits at their cubicle and
pounds out stuff on a keyboard is is an
antiquated idea and so coordinating this
data is becoming a more precious
situation for a lot of companies out
there so
an organization like atlassian which can
sort of provide you a number of
different tools and packages like
individual tool kits to help you manage
your products and manage your projects
better i think is going to be a very
interesting solution moving forward for
a lot of companies into the future so
see how your team might benefit from
this platform in collaboration atlassian
has to offer see how JIRA confluence
HipChat and bitbucket can give your team
everything you need to organize discuss
and complete shared work you can find
more information at ww atlassian calm
and we thank them for sponsoring this
week's episode of the pocket now weekly
so uh we should probably jump into some
actual tech news let's talk some tech
guys well do it let's hold up on let's
up on that because we also have to get
people on the conversation right you
know what we probably should I'm see I'm
jumping the gun here being excited and
we've got a ton of people in the QA
already that are already jumping in
understand step 2 because one went to
the lenovo tech world events and he had
his fill their he was up all night
building videos four our coverage here
at Pocket now and then he was also up
the night before and yeah that's not a
little EA guys but that i think will add
to the fun and enjoyment of loopy
podcast hoes exactly if you're we're all
at the end of the week so hey you might
want to hop in our youtube page if we're
broadcasting live and i hit the hangouts
little bar that says hey you want to
happen to hangout top into hangouts and
ask your questions in our Q &amp;amp; A panel
you can about other people's questions
so that they can easily get theirs
answered hopefully yours will be
answered 2 and if time does not allow
for it to be answered well you just hit
us up at podcast at pocketnow.com so
email podcasting blah blah blah hangouts
it's it's great it's all good but we've
got okay now we've got some cool stuff
to talk about yes and it starts off with
this Lenovo tech Newark you were there
you were just there yes yeah yeah I flew
up it was in San Francisco is lonavala
know
Bowtech world um everything about the
tech products are going to be talking
about this week are bad tongue twisters
for me so we should do a drinking game
on how often 1-1 tie somethin up and
then like Jules was so kind to mention
you know this was a one day trip for me
I had to fly up there cut video fly back
I'm a little wasted but then I was
sitting on the the runway at SFO for
almost an hour and a half before we
actually got into the air and sitting
right next to me in the middle seat is
this tiny little woman who was just dry
hack coughing all over everybody around
her for the entire time this little and
so now i also like i'm pretty sure i'm
sick so if my voice just suddenly dies
in the middle of this that's why guys
i'll finish the podcast out through sign
language and interpretive dance sure
doll can definitely see that in audio
right so motorola we've got all of the
scoops that you would like to scoop on
the moto z we got to check them out
first hand go hands-on with the Moto Z
and the Z Force this is an exciting new
push from from Motorola this really does
feel like the first proper moto lenovo
phone so when lenovo originally sort of
optioned and bought out motorola we
pretty sure that they that motorola had
products in the pipeline this really
feels like that that first product that
is coming directly from this partnership
a fresh new approach to combining the
talents of both of these companies and
so we went hands-on with the moto z it
is shockingly thin it is that they're
saying it's the thinnest premium
smartphone on the market and I'm
inclined to believe them because it it
makes a galaxy s7 feel a little on the
chunky side when you hold them
side-by-side and we've got the the
standard suite of Motorola sensors you
can wave your hand over the screen and
it lights up part of the screen we've
got this fingerprint sensor which is
going to divide a lot of people down
below the screen it's a it's not a home
but it's just a fingerprint sensor and
you have on-screen navigation controls
so there is I know
especially people in our audience who
care about design and ergonomics they're
going to be a lot of very critical
responses to that and then I the of
course the big talking points are no
headphone jack you know we are dumping
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack and
everything's going to be going over
either us bc or bluetooth and that this
is the first phone of a platform of
devices for motorola where we're going
to have modular pieces so these little
magnetic pins on the bottom of the phone
and motorola executives had a lot of fun
taking shots at LG solution for modular
devices oh you mean on our phones you
don't need to pull out the battery or
reboot the phone if you just want to add
more you know battery life or a camera
grasping Zeya notice that yeah so there
were a lot of shots fired moments
throughout this this press conference
and throughout the show but I mean again
it's at least I think a step in the
right direction for what we might be
able to do tailor-fit phones for
specific people so you get this basic
phone it's skinny it's pretty it's got a
good camera it's got a great screen and
then if you want to have the much better
speaker playback you don't have to have
boomsound speakers built into your phone
you can add a speaker a speaker dock to
the back or if you want to have a
projector if you want to have just you
know a double sized battery you can make
that choice based on your usage for what
it is that you value on your phone so I
think it's a step in the right direction
for for this conversation because we're
going to have a number of these devices
coming down the pipe I think especially
with rumors pointing to a project ara
release early next year this is setting
the stage and I think Motorola at least
has a solution here which I think will
be a bit more appealing to third-party
developers I think that they'll probably
gained a bit more traction on this then
LG has with their LG friends in fact you
know one of the launch partners is JBL
so they already have a name brand coming
out for a speaker dock one of their
primary battery solutions is coming from
incipio and to me and so you've got two
companies building batteries right there
and then you've got a kate spade so you
even have like this fashion brand that's
going to be associated with the product
already at launch with a number of other
products i'm down the pipeline rumors
about camera grips they're actually
showing this on video right now thanks
Jules where they had this like a laser
keyboard demo which just looks super
cool in a very Tron kind of way and so I
think we'll see some really cool stuff
from from Motorola and Lenovo with with
this product line that seems it seems
really cool though the only thing that
I'm really super concerned about is the
connection between the phone and the
modular pieces you actually want ads on
with that so can you can you speak to
like how secure the connection is
because the motorola website says quote
super-strong magnets which i don't know
about you but you know that so it makes
me okay well they are the weakest
gravitating attractive forces in the
universe so well yeah but iiii don't
have a basis of comparison or study they
claim something super you know like i
know when when goku becomes a Super
Saiyan there's a significant change in
his appearance I can't speak to what a
super strong magnet might be / Motorola
ok but how strong is a connection i
guess is mike so so it takes both hands
to pry off the speaker dock like you
can't just get a thumbnail in there and
pop it you have to be holding on to both
devices and it's a deliberate action to
peel them apart and these once you snap
something on it feels like a an attached
part of that phony like your phone okay
it doesn't feel like something's
wiggling or wobbling back there um so
you know obviously with some of the back
plates they have custom back plates
where you can use wood panels or
different types of materials to make the
back of your phone fancy um those have
more flexibility those have more give so
they're a little easier to peel off but
the projector dock that snaps onto the
back feels like one cohesive unit with
the phone I think it's very well
implemented and it's easily able to
handle the weight of the phone so as
you're holding from like this speaker
dock or you're holding from the
projector dock the phone doesn't feel
like it's ever going to slide out or in
a flop off or anything like that again I
think it's very well implemented in
those things that us what sorry those
motor mods uh they run on their own
power
they have their own batteries which is
why the soap some of them do I so the
the speaker dock I don't think all moto
mods will work this way but it's me
doctor what I mean you gotta say that 20
the motors is 2600 milliamp battery is
not going to be able to run as such a
projector or like rice and so there's
there's there was definitely some
forethought when it came to the JBL
speaker dock I think has a battery that
can that can run for two or three hours
of playback before it affects your phone
battery because it'll eventually start
pulling power from your phone right and
the projector doc I think they said had
like up to 10 hours of playback off the
battery built into that could be the
other way around I think or those might
be swapped you're right yeah but but
even so the thing that really concerned
me was if the connection was going to be
strong enough it seemed like it would be
too strong for human hands but it was
going to be weak enough for human hands
it didn't seem like it would be strong
enough but I guess that's a you're the
only one that had hands on time so
that's why we have to I think all about
finding that that balance I think it's
all about finding that that that spot in
between right cuz I mean there are
industrial magnets that human hands will
never pry them off of a metal surface
once they attach to something like you
like like an MRI if you have any metal
here in MRI that's a deadly situation um
so what what I think Motorola has found
a good balance for is a is that it
requires a deliberate action they're not
difficult to remove but you're not
likely to do this accidentally Jojo this
this goes along with in the QA from
Panzers e you know how strong the videos
make it seem like you can take these
covers off pretty easily and and when
looking at the covers I think the covers
are easier to take off because the
covers themselves will flex so you can
pry and kind of peel a little bit easier
but that speaker dock is not flexible at
all so right it requires you to kind of
pop all of the magnets at once and it is
a much more deliberate action to remove
that one of those harder docks or one of
the battery docks i should say um for
for how those magnets attach in a line
the other thing I wanted to ask was a in
your in your hands on video it almost
seemed like the it's
seems like that the Moto Z is designed
to have some type of moto mod attached
to it it almost seems like the phone
looks like it's missing a piece until
you attach one of those mods to it until
like all the seams seem to come together
and just from a design standpoint can
you speak to that I absolutely agree I I
think this is still sort of playing into
the so I think when it comes to the
motorola Z of the Moto's II sorry I this
really does seem to be to be a lenovo
influence device I mean we've seen a
number of those lenovo thinkpads where
maybe the battery life's a little lean
but they were trying to make the
thinnest sleekest most portable device
ever and that came at the expense of
extra battery and for people who want an
extra battery life they've got quick
charging solutions or you can find some
kind of you know additional battery or
backup battery solution and that really
does speak to me what the Lindo the Moto
Z was built around we made this the
thinnest possible phone and then you
it's up to you to make it the phone you
want it to be and for some people if you
have to sort of very basic usage you
just need to cover the basics on a
smartphone and maybe you're fine just
slapping a cover on there and then that
plays into the motorola aesthetic of you
designing the phone that you that fits
your personal style and so maybe it's a
wood panel back maybe it's a carbon
fiber back or maybe it's a leatherback
whatever whatever backs that they
initially release or what color options
that they have you can make it that fit
for you and then for other people out
there if you have very specific usage
concerns i hope to see a recording
interface built into a moto mod i hope
to see camera equipment they there was
no camera equipment for show there's
this one little quick tease of what
looked like a camera grip during the the
keynote but they didn't have anything
hands-on to show what their their
photography or video solutions might be
yeah i noticed that i heard rumors about
like the 10x optical zoom edition stuff
like that was really interested in
seeing something like that but there was
this the other there were people on the
show floor talking about these like
really left-field outlandish rumors like
well maybe hassle blod you know medium
format camera manufacturer might partner
up with motorola and lenovo just like
like I did with Huawei and I don't know
how likely that is but I do believe that
very quickly after the release
this phone will probably start hearing
word about some kind of photography
battery grip I mean even if it's just
that to start I think that'll get the
ball rolling on maybe another company I
would love to see an olympus walk in and
develop a moto mod so that you can
attach olympus lenses to your camera I i
think there's every possibility for some
really interesting work to happen and
there MDK there moto mod developer kit
seems to be pretty accessible they're
there they're hosting a million-dollar
prize for the their favorite I moto mod
and it's going to be partly judged by
Ashton Kutcher ryan has to draw people
in right that's a big deal so super big
deal I'm so I tweeted yesterday I said
you can just go ahead and make the check
out to me cuz I'm gonna develop a moto
mod with a headphone jack boom hahaha oh
I mean like you know if we're going to
continue the whole shots fired thing we
don't have the LG friends DAC here in
the United States there's there's a huge
opportunity for motorola to appeal to
audio files develop a really high
quality DAC amp combo that then doesn't
live as a separate lump in your pocket
it just attaches to the back of your
phone yeah so so i did i did feel bad
for Ashton during the the keynote though
because there were a couple transitions
that didn't seem very well-rehearsed
there's this is what mom I felt bad form
I really did there's this one moment
where they were sort of done with him
but Yellen said anything and so he just
stood there then look then just wandered
off stage like I've been in situations
like that on a much much smaller scale
it was somewhat tough see the CEO of
lenovo yuan Ching yang be up there and
you know there are differences between
the presentation with Chinese and
American audiences and he makes that
very very clear yes yes he does every
single time talking about oh well my
Silicon Valley friends tell me that I
should introduce this person onto the
stage so uh why not introduce them and
in presentation-wise I mean it could
have gone better but you know what the
devil is what we want to see on stage
and or off stage in the case of the
pendant
uh bendable phones but um they well and
I have to say though purple
east-meets-west company like Lenovo I
think they actually did a very good job
you know there wasn't a lot of fat on
this there were just some awkward
transitions and like you're right Jules
we got great looks at a number of
forward facing strategies coming from
Lenovo they're very interested in
becoming services solution um that their
Hardware should serve an actual
application or applic app or product or
some kind of data service not just be a
solution unto itself and I didn't
realize a center in this market
especially you know he was very frank
about talking about how the pc market is
is becoming extinct and how we need to
be moving into a better interactions
with products and services moving into
the future and you know this this really
did showcase a number of potential
strategies and potential technologies
that people could use to take advantage
of this yeah a lot of that show a lot of
the beginning of the show was like the
future is gonna be really great and
we're just like okay move on let's
announce a how we were to bring the
future was like yeah are we gonna ever
get a taste of that like today are you
just gonna you know show us I don't know
futurama for the next you know hour and
a half or so well but I was good at
getting a little long so no they're
they're definitely an earthy some
moments where it's like I we get the
point we can move on from here but i
have to say considering some of the
things that they needed to announce and
they needed to address for the most part
I thought it was handled well especially
being in the audience um little things
like when those moto mod videos were
popping up the crowd was really getting
into that stuff it's hard to tell when
you're watching the keynote remotely but
um there were a couple like stand up in
applause moments when people were
showing some of these new setups and and
then also for from the business I there
were a number of their businesses there
at the Lenovo tech world to talk about
like server infrastructure and stuff
like that there was some really key
developer stuff which really is an hour
beat on pocketnow.com that had people
out of their chairs to you know again
there was a really good energy for the
crowd there people there were really
interested in what was going on I'm
going through a few more of these uh
questions and comments in the in the QA
here Joel GJ I'm happy that Lenovo is
staying stock plus from what I see is
there anything otherwise it's really
difficult for us to comment on
pre-release software but it really does
seem that Motorola is going to be
holding to that aesthetic of utilizing a
largely stock Android interface with a
couple sort of tweaks and additional
benefits that live on top like the
sensors on the front face of the phone
that you can use to interact with
gestures and the camera app actually got
a pretty sweet little update as far as
I'm concerned because Motorola cameras
are typically pretty terrible this one
seemed eminently more usable even though
it was a pre-release demo unit a
question about those sensors to the
front panel of the phone there are those
two little hot marks that are like two
left or right of the sensor the
fingerprint sensor oh yeah top it's a
vamp out of my thing oh well how do you
think there's answers all over the front
row there's this kind of a thing there
we go yeah it kind of had a feel of like
incomplete hardware with those with
those sense reports on the front I don't
know maybe that's how it's ultimately
going to look but um yeah I wasn't a fan
and of the the four ports the four dots
in the four corners of the phone what
I'm what I'm hoping that they might be
able to address or just subtly refine is
the look of the shape of the fingerprint
sensor that I think is going to draw a
lot of Eire from from the people on our
channel because we have on-screen
controls and then we have this square
under the screen you need the extra
bezel at the bottom if you have all
these sensors built into the phone you
can't just eliminate bezel space i right
that needs to be there but we don't have
capacitive controls and this fingerprint
sensor doesn't seem to act as any kind
of home button um so it does stick out
and it feels like it should click like
the entire first couple minutes and I'm
holding this phone trying to demo it and
I keep going back to the home button I'm
doing that really obnoxious likes a
magnification thing where I've been
trained by another company to like click
in as like oh that doesn't work I have
to reshoot this this part of the video
yeah I actually the same thing with the
HTC 10 because
see the home button that doesn't click
exactly ladies a well used to that at
least with the HTC 10 it's an always-on
sensor that takes you home right all the
Moto isn't like that no the moto doesn't
take you home is that like just on the
off chance that you need to unlock your
phone or buy something well in and it's
emmie it's by design in that they can't
put the fingerprint sensor on the back
and the phone is way too thin to build
it into a side-mounted power button
right so the only place left is under
the screen and it's it's against me with
enough room for capacitive keys no no
well I I don't think they I really don't
think they can build capacitive keys and
keep those chin mounted sensors so I
think the on-screen controls are
necessity but if you're gonna have that
home button out there I got to go home
it's got to go home that's where I mean
I shouldn't even be caught as he and
look at that i'm calling it a home
button it's not all but well on a button
it's a fingerprint sensor yeah edward
sharpe and we are the bit it makes me
wonder if there's gonna be like a
software setting in their kind of like a
1 plus a you know one plus one Esk type
of thing where you can set the home you
can set the fingerprint sensor to go
home or you can maybe even set it to do
something else you know media and I
really hope that we do see like on
Huawei's where you can use it as a
gesture to pull your notification shade
yeah you know if you could use it as a
shortcut for something like that or a
way to easily toggle a voice assist or
now on tap or something like that yeah
there's there's potential and I hope
they expand on it but there wasn't
anything for us to report from the show
floor as to how that functioned so I've
had another QA from John Matthews he
says hey dibs on first question where is
the speaker on the Moto Z and will there
be a gsm version coming to the US and
the fall or is it just global besides
the u.s. so it's good question the first
one actually both the questions both
good questions John you're on point
you're keeping us on point John yeah I'm
sorry I didn't actually answer your
question first cuz you did have first
dibs so when the the speaker on the the
moto is doing exactly what I've been
asking manufacturers to do for years now
where the top earpiece speaker is the
front facing speakers on the phone there
is no sighs
okay is it just the one front the one
press again we don't have room in and
we'd have to build in a double chin if
we prided stereo speakers but it is
compromised the Russian buddy yeah they
prob sorry owner I was fine but but it
really goes to your point Adam that it's
just good enough you know everything
about the Moto Z is this is the base
smartphone so it was really difficult to
get any sense of what that speaker could
do on the show floor cuz there's you
know there's a lot of stuff happening
all around you but even for like trying
to play videos or music you know I would
I would worry just a little bit about
the power of that speaker for things
like notifications in ringtones you just
like this is the bass speaker and we're
gonna have other solutions like this
speaker dock if you really want to blast
out your audio so there there are some
concerns are that will have to address
once we actually have one of these
things in-house to review it during the
hands-on video I actually was able to
fire up one of our videos and I'm
pointing the phone at my camera so that
you should be able to hear and you can't
hear me at all when I slap on the
speaker dock and and even facing
backwards it was noticeably louder
facing backwards it was immediately
picked up by my camera camera microphone
so again we've got some some pretty
pretty important questions to answer
when it comes to that kind of hardware
and lifestyle features but um the one
thing that I don't have a very clear
grip on right now is going to be their
release strategy as far as I know we're
starting off with the droids and so in
the United States when this thing
finally does launch it's going to be a
moto Z and Z Force droid edition going
to verizon and i'm pretty sure that for
the united states the first ones we're
going to get are going to be unlocked
units I don't know what other
relationships they might have with like
other carriers like AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile all
right droids it really seems like there
are only going to be gsm versions of
this phone i don't think there's going
to be a sprint version of this phone
being manufactured is it's not going to
be a droid and I don't think Motorola
has any intention of offering up I I
could totally be wrong here so this is
speculation but I don't think Motorola
has intentions of building out
brit cdma model specifically for sprint
yeah okay so were there any other any
other phones there that were worth
talking about or was it just mosey well
you know there were there a couple
others okay interestingly enough the the
the before oh sorry Jules before we move
on to the fab we should mention that the
Z Force um is probably going to be a
phone that a number of people in our
audience are really going to be
interested in simply because it's a
little bit thicker yeah that's a bigger
one nificant Lee larger battery and it's
got the the durable screen technology
that we saw in the droid 2 so they're
they're claiming it's a shatterproof
screen was great as I was sitting at
this this table they had these like
Globox tables where we they had all the
reviews and it really screwed with my
camera's exposure um it was really
difficult issue but I'm sitting next to
this guy from from India and he's taking
Moto's easy forces he's just whipping
them into the table I want to find I
mean I'm there have to be youtube videos
out there I want to find what channel
this guy's on because it's like we're
all trying to review or trying to go
hands-on a true video of these devices
and like no compunction no decorum he's
talking into this little like lavell ear
mic plugged into like a point-and-shoot
camera as he's just like and you can see
and the screen it's not shattered and
you're like oh my god what are you doing
well they're not that type of damn ok I
this is not that type of way they have
that kind of compunction so good on him
/ try but if you gets the exclusive I
mean more power to them but one of the
other interesting things is is in
addition to all these specs getting just
a little bit bigger obviously the phone
design can't change significantly
because they all have to use the same
moto mods and that means that we can be
pretty confident that we know what next
year's Moto's are going to look like to
if they have to use the same hardware
yes definitely building phones around
what accessory compatibility there is
but the the Moto z-force also bumps up
to a higher resolution camera which I
thought was interesting we go from a 13
megapixel camera on the z to a 21
megapixel camera on the z4s wave
just more room because it's thicker or
something or like I think with some of
these 12 megapixel sensors we've worked
out some of the the shenanigans and the
issues for for depth for how deep these
lens and camera modules are and maybe we
just haven't done that with the higher
resolution sensors I don't know um
whatever reason they thought they
motorola you know maeda made an effort
to bump up the specs on that one on that
point too so it could be interesting
coming down the pipe but again with all
the popularity that we've seen from the
the droid turbo to UM at least it looks
like Motorola fans not on verizon will
soon not not at lunch but will soon have
options to also get the benefits of that
shatterproof screen and I know a lot of
people are going to be stoked about that
that'll be nice that will be very nice
can't we until the fall yeah and you
should be it should be pretty exciting
so or as a somebody put it we're going
to we're gonna launch on verizon
exclusively in the summer and then
everywhere else in the fall when nobody
cares well we have um i'm trying to dig
through the through the a the QA here
but joel g joel GJ rights he thinks the
verizon exclusivity will increase demand
for the phone when it becomes unlocked
and what do you think what do you think
your thoughts on that Adam do you think
that if the droid Edition comes out and
gets a bunch of positive buzz that that
sets the stage and the talking points
for gsm models to follow well there's a
couple of things there first of all hi
mayor very yesterday I don't know i I
can't verify this maybe he's got
something i don't but apparently
something with verizon phones have to be
forced unlocked so or can be for so much
or they are all for some they're all
supposedly unlocked so you can pick up a
verizon phone pop it AT&amp;amp;T sim into it
and go to town I can't confirm that so
oh is that is that the true okay awesome
I don't that's true for every phone I
don't um but starting back behind like
glow when I was reviewing the Lumia icon
it was a very quiet like hush-hush and
if you put like your tmobile sim in
there it works too he fell okay all
right yeah I'd never heard
that before so awesome I'm is the only
one that still does the whole walking
thing but no I can't really speak to
whether or not all LTE bands are
supported but for that the other thing
is you know sure you're building up this
anticipation with this verizon only
lunch but you're also going to be
launching this phone after the the next
Nexus you're going to be launching after
the galaxy note you're going to be
launching it after potentially the next
iPhone I mean not it how is that a good
strategy i look i know there was money
involved and i know that you know fine i
just i just wish that to me carrier
exclusivity is right in that same
ballpark as you know invites invite
systems for buying and you know just can
we just please sit at the big kids table
for a while can we not do this
exclusively and we already know we can
already predict what a number of our
viewers are going to say about that i
mean we're in the process of wrapping up
our galaxy s7 active review that's a
phone that worldwide would be a very
popular unit but it's an eighteen t and
and not just that it that there's a
flavor of it which is exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T
it's that the rugged galaxy s is
worldwide only available t you know so
it's not like you can get a galaxy s7
tough edition or something like that in
the UK it's that this thing is is
properly i'm stuck on one carrier in the
united states yes that's all so messed
up but anyway ugh didn't um am I am I
wrong but didn't the S active line have
a different carrier variant one year
wasn't it like the vibe sport for the s5
sport for spring okay yes I wasn't crazy
on that so there's lots of an s7 support
for spring as well so so then what those
typically are made out of different
materials like the S the S 5 sport was a
metal back phone just like the s4 active
was i right well that's true that's true
again i think i think it's because i
think we have the active because 18t is
commissioning samsung to do this not
because Sam
is making this phone and ATT has signed
them to an exclusivity deal on that and
I'm splitting hairs on this but you know
if like orange in the UK wanted to carry
an exclusive Samsung durable phone I'm
sure they could strike out a deal with
Samsung to achieve that it's just
whether or not they feel they can make
money on that based on how much they're
going to paper model unit on a on a
niche phone um that's not going to be
one of their more popular sellers but
18t has this vested interest in catering
to corporate job site construction you
know they have to have a solution for
those markets and increasingly you can't
get away with just like well here's a
fifty-dollar kyocera you know like you
need to have something that can actually
step on an geocachers don't leave out
geocachers and all the palms remember
you got that sin goggled collar I can't
tell them how many galaxy s6 actives I
sold for 80 and Samsung by showing that
phone off to parents that was a super
popular phone in my circle of friends
last year I sort of those on ATT when I
was showing them like yeah it's this and
it's a bit more durable and it's
water-resistant and like you have kids
and they get sticky damn good phone but
anyway um so can we transition over to
the tippy toe let's transition over to
the to the fab just one more from the QA
from Joel GJ are the Moto mods are
abased and I can't believe that they are
I think the sections that are used in
the era are unipro they're universal and
they have like some sort of 11.9 gigabit
per second connection speed i'm not sure
what these the 16 connection dots are
supposed to be supposed to bring but
yeah when you give it a shot man yeah
but no but I mean completely different
platform then also project are is going
to usher in an era of Android wear
Android will start to handle hardware
like your PC does you know drivers that
allow you to plug and play things in run
to it in a very organic way this is
still very much Motorola has to develop
the solution where the hardware talks to
the phone uniquely and specifically um
so I don't believe that this is
even loosely based on what Motorola's
skunkworks division was doing with our I
think this is a separate solution and to
winning author writes do you think in a
few years we will build phones like we
build pcs I think next year we'll have
the ability to do that with project ara
so I think that's very high in here you
go down to microcenter and do it but hey
you're gonna lunch wagon do it go to a
lunch for questioning portal we go so no
I'm not gonna come oh yeah that's work
so one of the the most fascinating
things about this this Lenovo tech world
was a we of course knew we had we were
under embargo so we knew that the fab to
pro was going to be coming down the pipe
we knew a lot of the talking points
about project tango the Google's
augmented reality it's no longer project
tango it's just tango that this was all
going to be coming for lenovo tech world
immediately one of the first things that
i want to bring up and i'd love to hear
your thoughts on this adam i thought it
was fascinating that their initial
discussion of the fab to pro was
centered on the fact that this is going
to be coming to united states sellers
that an unlocked model is going to be
going to bestbuy they have a partnership
with lows for augmented reality uh you
know decorating services and right
auction services that lenovo is making a
push with the new lenovo brand into
north america at the same time as
they're leveraging the moto brand to
reach customers that are already here
and i was wondering what you thought
about lenovo trying to make inroads like
that well it's interesting especially
for lenovo which is a company that's not
really known for phones in the united
states so i think i think this is
centered around a couple of different
things first of all lenovo does want to
establish a sort of a beachhead in the
united states and you know well they
should and also i think this is also to
push a lot of project tango or excuse me
tengo this is this is meant to push this
tango technology out into places like
Lowe's and into you know this augmented
reality type stuff that that people are
going to be using and they're doing a
lot of things right they're doing you
know the price
mine on this gigantic monster of a phone
um you know like 499 for this afford the
unlocked version for a six point I mean
just just affect it's a six point four
th screen good God oh it's going to get
a little more six point four inches
that's look as it's gigantic and now was
that that 499 price point which fab to
was that for wasn't that too broad
product and that was the throw that's
crazy the rest of them there are two
others the fab to in the fab 2 plus and
they're all standard non tango phones
and there are six point four inches but
ones at Full HD and ones at 720p
actually I missed that part of the I
miss that part of the demo so the other
two up to the other two fab 2's are not
tango enabled yeah the pros on that is
indus mango and moves us up to a quad HD
screen oh that's an awful idea but
anyway alright so I take it back do I
mean this I mean they spent most of
their stage time talking about the fab
oh yeah up to pro not the fat / 02 yeah
I'm tangentially aware of the other two
phones if you know until I read in a
pocket oh but anyway so but just the
fact that they're putting it out there
at such a great price point for such a
you know looks like a really great phone
a tango aside I think they're doing
they're doing a lot of those right
regard look at that one colors soon that
nerf good with ya so they had these
these I mean like so this is something
that I've been I've been you know sort
of very vocal about especially after we
started seeing hollow lens demos is that
while virtual reality is very very cool
today and it creates this awesome
immersive experience that once you start
playing with augmented reality it's
there just so many more immediate
practical applications practical
applications but then gaming stuff is is
a different kind yeah really cool so the
hell what were you seeing at that nerf
that nerf tournament psychic were you
shooting virtual nerf darts no so so
they had these these nerf guns that they
converted with cradles that when you
pull the trigger would activate the
blaster in in your in your
aim and you know it's using tango and
it's using the camera to inform the
visuals that you're looking around and
then built into the depth of that space
these aliens would sort of like like
predator style uncloak and you would
have to find them in track them all
that's awesome in real space in real
time and then when you pull the trigger
you would shoot these lightning bolts
that would either hit the alien and
you'd kill the alien or then a sort of
lightly ricochet off of the real walls
and structures that you were walking and
awesome we're talking about a
five-hundred-dollar phone that is
running this demo on pre-release
software and it's running really well I
mean there are occasional little lags
and stutters and the game's not super
complex but it's instantly engaging
because you're looking for these little
cloaked warbles of like of alien life
and then you start blasting at them in a
young cloak and they try and attack you
and semi like it it's it's instantly
captivating it's almost like you had
like a like a like a scanner and that's
how you were gonna view the world
through this like this filter this lens
so I wrote an editorial about about
project tango or sorry tango although
actually I might maintain I might
maintain my stance by calling it project
tango just in sort of a protest but
anyway read the article to find out why
but I wrote it and it seemed like it
seems like project tango is a lot like
hololens and have you done how long's
demo one I have yes okay so can you
having done both can you kind of layout
are they the basically the same are the
other major differences between the two
or I'd say sorry excuse me I'm might my
voice might actually die on it's your
guys um i would say we're looking at
tango compared to hollow lens it's a
little synonymous to the comparison we
might levy between a really nice google
cardboard or samsung gear vr headset and
then an HTC vive okay oh so all right so
you can create a very interesting and
immersive experience i think like
you know like gaming is kind of fun on
on cardboard and I think the gear takes
it to a higher level but it's not going
to be the same kind of of completely
immersive high end gaming experience
that you can get from an HTC vive right
there's no a headset or anything yet no
it's that you you view everything
through the phone and and that still has
immediately amazing and fascinating
implications for how we can interact
with data and services and I think
automatically the next step is can we
now build this into a pair of glasses
and succeed where Google glass really
failed us for you know discreet
notifications and stuff like yeah okay
so but I kind of I mean like it's not a
perfect analogy but I think that's a
similar analogy that that cardboard very
easily engages a consumer base with
virtual reality and starts a discussion
and I think tango will do the same we'll
continue we're going to have a hard time
explaining augmented reality to the
masses but if you can discreetly build
the stuff into phones that people were
going to buy anyway so once it starts
spreading even just a little bit wider
and i'm sure google has you know designs
to be building this into a future nexus
working with samsung or HTC or other
carriers and partners to start including
this hardware so that it becomes a
broader platform when it's just in your
phone anyway and you don't even think
about it you just take it for granted
that you can pick up your phone and scan
your living room and say I want a coffee
table there how big a coffee table
should I get and it automatically draws
the volume of a coffee table in the
middle of your living room you need have
to think about it yeah summers won't
need to be explained to a stock fits in
reality is they'll just start using it
and that's what I think it's exciting I
think hololens is going to have that
top-down approach just like the vibe
businesses and corporations engineering
firms graphic design they're gonna
launch on to this in because they get it
they know what they can do with this
already gamers are going to be
interested in like you know I want a
minecraft all over my living room that's
a that's awesome that's totally what I
want to do but the general consumers out
there I think are still going to be a
little hesitant to strap a computer to
their head into their face but their
phones are
instantly excessive for any conversation
so was there any talk there from anyone
from google about their various
partnerships with other OEMs I mean the
fab to is the only one that's going to
be is the only phone that's going to be
they actually the fab to pro is the only
one that's going to be taking on tango
properties but what about other phones
in the future because that's basically
the crux of my article is unless there's
other OEM support here project tango is
probably going to be labeled a gimmick
if not worse yeah uh you know in in
talking with people at the event most of
the people there really novo so um you
know I didn't get any face time with
Google engineers on this one I got to
speak to a lot of people at Qualcomm I
got to speak to a lot of people at
Motorola and Lenovo and it was is like
this is a motorola lenovo event so why
would I ask them so uh so Jeffrey at
lenovo will this also show up on a
samsung yeah right but one well one
third and third one third of their their
presentation there was all about project
tango so I mean presumably they should
be ready to talk about it and how
they're gonna push this forward granted
a five-hundred-dollar super phablet is a
great great way to push it forward but
it's a phone that I mean it's a phone
that what one percent two percent of the
smartphone market is gonna buy Oh
probably less than that probably lice i
think i think this is and again this is
why i can't really comment beyond you
know beyond who i did get to speak to
because I from Google's perspective I'm
sure they are probably working on what
other deals they can arrange to start
utilizing this hardware and other
devices um but you know you're not gonna
I'm not going to get the scoop on that
unfortunately at a Lenovo branding and
and um I'd been able to speak to a
Google engineer I think they'd be more
inclined to say this is the product
that's actually coming out and one other
things who are coming up in the pipeline
then we can discuss Gus more than you
know like we'll get that our spin but I
think what's interesting here again
taking it back to that original point is
that there is going to be a significant
presence where if you go to a best buy
you'll
be able to play with one Lo's wants to
set up kiosks where you can actually
utilize these services in real time so
that people can see what the benefits
might be and that's something that we've
talked about you I'm we talked about
this with you in the past on a podcast
to Adam that you know for a huawei to
make an amazing phone and then never put
boots on the ground to show Americans
what it can do means that the phone is
irrelevant and here I novo striking and
it's not even like what we're planning
on doing this and we might do that maybe
we'll set up a mall kiosk or lenovo
store in you know a mall in New York
it's no work we've got partnerships set
with best by lowes so that people will
instantly see what it is that this
brings to the table and and I think that
could actually spur on a lot more mind
share from for lenovo in this space I
sure hope said that there's the
bifurcation between moto which is work
super oriented and then you have well
it's not necessarily you know business
enterprise but I mean for those that are
who assigned a specific use productivity
sort of i mean like they're pitching it
as a home improvement kind of thing
where you're taking measurements etc etc
I mean there's there is that part of the
consumer segment I'm not sure with a
call it though but they're like it's
business plus is what I'm saying yeah oh
yeah but but but again it's it's it's
finding a number of solutions and a
number of opportunities to really
present and pitch this thing
appropriately and again like I was
saying this is one of those technologies
I really think while VR is super cool
and like I said it's immersive and it
closes you off to the world around you
and you you enter a new world I think
that's that's slick I think augmented
reality is going to impact every single
service that we interact with and it's
going to do it in a much more organic
way than other things like you know you
kind of have to learn how to acclimate
to a SmartWatch I really do believe that
when you can organically pick up a phone
and the phone just start scanning
information around you like depth
location in motion tracking and you
didn't have to teach it or train it or
set up sense
around your home so that it could track
points you know more accurately that is
going to be one of those it just works
situation consumers are gonna pick up
and they're going to just do this and
like I can check out my bedroom and I
want to put a poster on the wall I want
to see what this does now my kids going
to pick it up and they want to learn
about velociraptor so a little
Velociraptor pops up on the kitchen
table and they can spin it around and
they can interact with it you know
that's gonna be just a very easy
transition into getting two people to
think about some of these different
opportunities to interact with a
software and service yeah absolutely one
hundred percent agree I might actually I
saw a I saw a demo a long time ago
actually in my web OS days of an
augmented reality type of software where
you could open up a magazine aim your
phone at it and the the article of the
magazine would actually come alive and
play like a video stuff like that it's
gonna be one of those things where it's
gonna integrate into your daily lives
and it's gonna be it's gonna be pretty
awesome when it gets here and i got i
hope it gets here soon and tango looks
like it's a good good is hitting the
right first step I had a lootcrate where
they had this little sensor on the box
and wasn't a sensor this little icon on
the box and you you loaded this app and
it would create this little like
cityscape and you could look through
your phone window and it would blow
things up and that was really cool tango
takes us to that level where you don't
have to have any location points or
special sensors or special icons for
that stuff to happen so a Kyle Ruggles
in our QA rights imagine 3d scanning or
fitness you can scan yourself in 3d
using your phone and compare two months
later from now I mean imagine that
information tying into like your Fitbit
or yes awful it anyway a lot of us are
all of us on the paulino team are
probably Karen just a little extra punch
than we should be and I think also all
three of us simultaneous adjust I'm a
second in zone so I again yeah and once
this thing is just sort of neck
naturally and organically built into the
cameras that we're going to be using
anyway I think it just catches on like
wildfire so I'd be very surprised if we
didn't see tango style projects from
major manufacturers over the next year
I'll be shocked if Samsung doesn't have
some
thing out the door uh sometime next year
you know what I can honestly see a note
being a tango type enabled phone
absolutely where you know the the next
note maybe not the next one that might
be a little bit too soon but you know
the note noting what are we on seven
eight nine I bet then the note 8 next
year comes out I could see that being a
tango enabled phone just because it
would be awesome yeah so uh so I mean
like there there are definitely some
questions that we have to ask about the
the fab to pro I'm not as familiar with
the Qualcomm 652 processor a lot of
people have been asking about that as
far as i know it benchmarks very
similarly to a Qualcomm 808 which i
think is fine from a performance
standard it's not going to be a hardcore
gaming monster but it tackles just about
every sort of lifestyle use that you
could throw at it fine now it's got the
right amount of RAM it's got big storage
64 gigabytes of storage on tap the
higher resolution screen which on that
screen size I think actually does
provide a little bit more of a benefit
with a quad HD display and so like Kyle
Ruggles in the Q&amp;amp;A rights you know judge
it without tango alone is it worth it
for five hundred dollars and without
tango it's not going to be a
five-hundred-dollar phone so I would say
it's probably appropriately priced
considering the bleeding edge technology
that we've got on board and when you
separate out the bleeding edge
technology well then you've got a fab 2
plus not a fab to pro right there really
a lower price point for that I'm excited
for it I'm really stuck I'm really
hoping that will be a will be in early
on some cuz even to some of the silly
demos and and if you know for anyone
who's listening to this podcast or
checking checking the show out because
this phone is huge it's so big um you
have to check out our hands-on video
because I'm in the middle of I'm setting
up a tripod and I'm trying to use this
phone and you know I've got my tiny
little hot at hands and and I'm holding
this monster 6.4 inch screen and I'm
trying to do like stuff on the display
while showing the augmented reality
features and I'm kind of struggling a
little I mean like it's hard to balance
all of that and make a good looking
video and this tiny little asian woman
who barely spoke any English just comes
running up and like grabs the phone
and while I'm holding with one hand
she's holding it with another and then
he was being hurt her and to interact
with stuff on the screen and it it was
maybe the most hysterical moment I've
had on a show for since I started
talking about in covering technology
products it's just ridiculous um and so
that's that's a part of the video that
we put out for our hands on so you
definitely have to check that out I will
so that's it that's all it's happening
right yeah um I don't think anything
else in the world happened uh we we have
out editorials on on pocketnow.com we do
we did get a couple sneak peeks at
things like some of their bendable
screen tech but one of the two shift
gears pretty majorly one of the things
that I wanted to kind of pick your
guys's brain about is what ramble might
have coming down the pipe so this is a
hard transition guys and thank you
everyone for folks writing messages and
questions in the Q&amp;amp;A we might not be
able to get to all of them obviously but
if there's something really pressing
that you want to know about the phone
drop us a comment on our hands on videos
I'm going to be picking through comments
over the weekend hit our comments on
pocketnow.com or hit our podcast at
pocket nail com email address and we'll
probably be doing a light follow up on
next week's podcast is to answer any
other additional questions that people
think we missed but WWDC apples
developer conference and what we might
see coming down the pipe from apple on
on this this preview from Adrian here
that Adrian wrote up this preview spot
immediately and one of the things that
he didn't really write about we just
posted it on the show right now I wanted
to get your guys's reactions to the
rumor that we might see some form of I
message show up on Android devices my
reaction is oh that's good so actually
that would be really interesting and I
think it would be a good counter move to
to Google's messenger apps whose names
completely escape all I know and fellow
that's ready yeah well that was
embarrassing it's only been like four
weeks and safe but yeah I honestly I
think that's going to be a major major
point of competition to to Google's new
messaging services if
I message can come to Android even
facetime come to Android I don't know
maybe III I mean I hate that I'm gonna
say this but I really wish facetime
would come to han cho babe well you have
it it's called skype now get using I
don't want to have to explain to my
grandmother like why some people can
FaceTime and some people can skype and
so I would very much rather it just be
you know again this is what I think is
fascinating right well the apple site
which is having a solution for it this
is what I think is amazing you've got
companies like um like Google and
Microsoft that our services companies
that dabble in hardware and then you've
got companies like Lenovo that I think
are trying to transition they're trying
to transition from just being you know
pc manufacturers into beings you know
like all kinds of solutions for any type
of hardware with the idea that they're
also pushing into more services run any
Apple which is still I think that apple
would consider themselves a hardware
company but now they're starting to
loosen the leash a little bit on some of
these services which drive sales for
iPhones because we're seeing growth in
revenue for them on things like Apple
music you know you can't ignore Android
if you're going to make money on a
service um it only makes sense to have a
part of that service be available to a
phone platform that you don't sell right
absolutely so man it'll be it would be
interesting to see honestly i I just I
get the sense that that WWDC is going to
be as was as I mentioned in the in the
collaborative post we did and was
reiterated on this article here I think
it's just going to be a snooze fest I
think it's going to be I think Apple has
kind of you know iOS has painted itself
into a corner where there's really only
so much more functionality that they can
introduce I think a lot of what we're
going to see is probably going to be or
they say hope a lot of what we're going
to see is going to be based around Siri
and based around the personal assistant
to sort of counter what Google and in
the Amazon are doing so maybe we'll
I don't know that we'll see and I guess
it would be called an ihome but what
that names already taken so I don't know
if we'll see a Google home type of
equivalent I doubt it that seems to be
the type of thing that apple would want
to can see how it goes and then maybe
it'll develop its own thing later but I
just I just really hope that we can see
a lot of marked improvements in how Siri
interi accent and becomes more of a like
a personal assistant rather than just a
an answer spitter yeah to be honest I am
more looking forward to whatever Siri
can do beyond her ethereal reach and
ultimately I think it like somehow
Sierra has to work with ness Siri has to
work with well I mean this home can but
yeah you have to put it all under one
umbrella and just run with it Apple
because too many I was going to make an
analogy but I can't well no Jules I
think that's a great point though
because isn't one of the reasons that
people buy into the apple ecosystem is
because it's supposed to be this really
well-put-together ecosystem and so when
they're coming out with new products and
services and they're also trying to
incorporate what their partners their
manufacturers part manufacturing
partners are doing that this has been a
difficult transition for a lot of
companies almost all companies out there
and trying to tie all of these pieces
together were at the very beginning
stages of Internet of Things and stuff
like that and so iOS like you were
saying Adam iOS is is kind of locked in
this one yo sort of usage scenario and
we see Apple really struggling to open
up the platform so that it can be used
more professionally or or make the
platform more flexible so it can
interact with other apps and services
that need to move files around or will
it be able to communicate with all of
these IOT devices that are going to be
coming out and you know for apples very
strict control over their product lines
to maintain their own ecosystem it makes
the cut it delivers challenges for the
company when that that ecosystem needs
to build more broadly over devices they
don't have complete control over
yeah and that's it's it's it's a
challenge and apples going to have to
overcome and I did it this is the WWDC
that's it's going to have to happen that
I think because it doesn't happen here
then we're going to be waiting another
year and by that point it's going to be
so mature elsewhere that there won't be
any point anything anymore at least how
I see it no I completely agree well and
I'll never I'll never count Apple out
for what for whatever reason they have
developed a corporate culture a
corporate ethic which communicates to
consumers very easily that it's okay if
they're not right on the pulse that they
can be like Apple is allowed to be late
to the market in ways that no other
company would ever be allowed to do it's
okay if we're not first cuz we'll just
say we were anyway I am and will will
will do it better I can't wait for the
people who are out there claiming that
Motorola copied apple and getting rid of
the the headphone jack you know like it
might know it's coming someone's gonna
make that comment what everybody has
along too yeah I mean like the notion
that we're not all influenced by design
and stuff but I was like I was wearing
an a Suzanne watch before the Apple
watch came out and if you're like all
these android copy cats are like but not
know I oh no Bad Monkey and so there is
potentially word that we might be seeing
watch os3 coming out from Apple I what
do we think that we're going to see an
Apple watch too sometime this year do we
think that this is just going to be
software optimizations for the product
that's already out on the market well if
we see an Apple watch too i don't think
it'll be at WWDC that's all separately
pur that's typically more of a software
type cadet although I am I crazy or did
they release the new macbook last year
at WWDC the 12 inch with the one port I
wanna tell you don't remember that might
it might have been a WWDC and someone in
our in our QA or comments will hopefully
school us on this as we've stumbled our
way through release dates on fri make
honestly the number of Apple of events
that they have every year has increased
by Allah by a pretty big number a used
to be just like a couple every year and
now it's like they're having then
every almost every other month it seems
like but so I mean if there's going to
be any hardware there I think it's going
to be more of the macbook / imac type
territory you know new imacs new
macbooks that type of thing I we're
definitely not going to see the iphone 7
absolutely not we're definitely not
going to see any type of ipad so from
from our in in pocket now's wheelhouse
the stuff that we're going to be seeing
a software yeah well venture was
released in a March event I think I was
okay sorry like the iPhone se Oh got you
got you yeah that kind of makes sense
actually now that you say that that does
actually but I I totally agree though
there Adam because I think where we see
apples growth opportunities have been on
services so I holy expect that we're
going to be hearing word on updates to
Apple pay probably won't be anything
revolutionary Lee exciting but you know
opening up new markets you know new
business deals probably new
relationships with banks and credit card
suppliers and and then um maybe even
potentially some some word on updates to
Apple music like we can a kind of
improve on that platform to because
that's still a very competitive market
when the apples doing well in I mean you
have a you know an easy way to get users
of iphones on to that service but you
know I think you have a long ways to go
before you can kind of combat the
mindshare that services like Spotify
have in that space with music fans
another 20 minutes of trent reznor
talking that'll be great Oh what musical
act will we see this year I wonder oh
good call someone drop us a comment
below what musical act do you think
we'll see a WWDC this year I'm going to
say kings of leon that's my guess I got
I got nothing because the most the most
recent music that I listen to is
probably like I don't know what Billy
Joel oh I was so lovely I'm not that bad
um I would kill to see like a young
agent Billy Joel like rock up with like
a new york state of mine or piano man at
the end of the mom as piano man that's
right I love it
hey mr. cook I'm the iphone man I could
work we get this question a lot and I'm
trying to find it again from Joel GJ we
don't get it a lot from Joel GJ we just
got this questionable haha this coming
from the QA is Apple innovation slowing
down since the death of jobs jobs was
strict on Apple's sticking to
exclusivity do we think that opening up
the the market for Apple services is a
sign of innovation slowing down I
actually kind of go the other way with
this I think that Apple is trying a lot
more ever since Steve Jobs unfortunately
left us yeah I think apples branching
out more I think they're responding to
the market a lot more yeah absolutely is
in charge um and which I mean you know
they both have their their solid
arguments you know for you know sticking
with you know what you want to give the
consumer versus what the market is
dictating but yeah I gotta go the other
way on that one I got to think that
Apple has become actually more not so
much innovative but just more expansive
since uh since Steve Jobs passed away no
I I'd agree with that I think I think
what we've been seeing is a company I I
say you know I i think they are more apt
to respond to market trends than then
jobs ever would have let them like I
think Jobs was probably a bit more
dictatorial and this is what we're
focusing on and this is how will execute
I think that's come at the expense of
some of the product lines like the mac
pro I you know I really wish we would
see an apple that would be a bit more
competitive in markets for professionals
like that kind of hardware even though I
know that that's like that that's that's
sort of a a dying market there are still
solutions like I need a workstation to
get this done and I kind of have very
specific requirements for how that
things put together well I pro you could
just get 9.7 inch tablet right there you
go is like I love coming back because uh
for our iPad pro 9.7 review we did a
challenge can can I shoot and edit an
iPad pro review on an iPad pro and I got
really close to finish
but I only had to fundamentally change
everything about how I shoot and edit
video but I almost managed to finish
that video I so stay with that you know
I I think you know the service is what
you're saying like opening up OS so that
iOS can I can tackle some of these
challenges this is going to be a good
year for Apple to focus on those types
of solutions and those types of services
so that consumers will will be more
likely to lean on iOS for that kind of
work and I think it's a great
opportunity for them to if they can
execute on it well right hmm so um I had
one more Q&amp;amp;A that I wanted to get your
guys thoughts on and then we'll knock
out a couple quick viewer males this one
comes from Zane Wynter do you think it's
smart for manufacturers to sell cell
phones in carrier stores or just sell
them in their own store like the one
plus and Motorola a lot of people won't
buy phones out right because of the
costs up front what do you think Adam do
you think that we're starting to uh to
our consumer starting to look at buying
phones unlocked we're seeing a lot of
traction on phone sales on Amazon B&amp;amp;H
things like that has the carrier dom is
the carrier dominance starting to erode
i hope so because that's kind of where
we need to be we need to start
retraining consumers is in that these
phones actually do cost you know between
25 and seven hundred dollars and also I
think by doing that we're also giving a
much better a much easier time to
mid-range phones which are actually
becoming really good these days so
people are starting to realize that you
know these phones that cost six seven
hundred eighty six seven hundred dollars
you can get a similar value for
significantly less so that's opening up
the floor for a lot more competition in
the in the mid-range space which is also
driving innovation in the in the
flagship space as well because the
flagships have to do that much more yeah
to get people interested so is it a good
idea yes I I mean I is it is it a good
thing yes is that a good idea I don't
know
yeah oh the jury's still out on that one
oh yes it is a very good thing up there
that that they're doing it and I think
the carriers are starting to realize
that these these contracts are their
days are numbered I don't think it'll be
long before we find you know all major
carriers completely dropping contracts
and just going with these dyes file
button and most of them have already
sort of dried up I i think what what
carriers weren't prepared for is once
consumers are empowered to understand
how much these things cost with these
new payment plans it's like a zero
interest loan essentially but you pay
like 20 bucks a month or 30 bucks a
month depending on how expensive your
phone was once that phones paid off
consumers are far more inclined to stick
with that phone for longer than if they
were on a two-year contract right that's
what I think you know the the big
players in this market weren't prepared
for everything a lot more of these like
trading deals you know leasing programs
you can do that's your stuff like that I
wonder what that's going to mean for
those fast upgrade programs like the 18
next and the verizon is it well that's
it what I that's that's I think
eventually we're just gonna call those
leasing just like you would own a car or
lease a car yeah just leasing your phone
every year you've put so many miles on
your phone you trade it in for a newer
model and then you're still just paying
but you'll never own it which was
actually you're like payment programs
like once you pay it off and your bill
drops by 30 bucks a month I don't know I
mean people are inclined to like just
kind of hang out for thirty bucks yeah
yeah now that's that's a mean I think
that's actually an interesting I would
like a phone leasing program you know
just paid X amount of dollars and you
know every whatever how many of our many
times a year you get a upgrade or you
get to replace your phone which you
dropped and broke or whatever right I'm
paying more than ever with without a
contract than with I'll just say that
yeah well and in the math on that gets
really tricky too because the initial
plans look like one thing and then
become something else once you add oh my
it looks a successfully yeah oh show us
listener mails here real quick I've got
unicorn workhorse up first he says hey
pocket dear pocket bros hey unicorn
workout
workhorse okay talk / crap he says let's
face it android ads as in ads for the
operating operating system totally suck
if i were a customer and saw this ad it
would expose me to the exists exists in
some android and that's all people
aren't going to get an android phone
because of now on tap or android pay we
buy android phones because of the
customizable interface and options which
brings me to my question how can google
advertise things like launchers and
skins or show how there is a plethora of
hardware options will this deteriorate
the Nexus campaign does Google even
consider launchers a part of androids
goodness um with love a unicorn work 10
you have to you have to include that
line come on say it no II together at
the same now by the way android is BAE
oh yeah I was gonna help him preserve
some dignity a lot of the a lot of the
Android commercials that are out there
right now are kind of pushing this there
the tagline is be together not the same
so I think that actually is kind of
pointing to the edge of the the idea
that you can make an android phone your
own now they're not they're not
specifically focusing on skins or on lon
chargers or any back yeah it's
specifically on devices because I redid
you I also means a commercial with it
now on the same key and it's yeah yeah
that's what I'm that's what I'm talking
about but at the same time I think we
need to take a step back and realize
that the the fact that people buy
android phones because of the customer a
customizable interface and options it's
kind of a myth the rates and people buy
android is because of samsung yes I mean
let's just be a let's just be completely
atmosphere you know the reason that
people are buying the reason that
Android is so dominant in the market is
because of Samsung and and be also the
reason a lot of peep it I can talk
really i can so your vocal issues came
at the beginning I'm going to round out
the end eyebrow drop it off on all you
guys and that's yeah
crazy drive excited out loud so i think
android is also the not my phone
alternative yeah so you know it's like I
don't want and I know I don't want an
iphone so which android phone should I
get um and it's long been that so maybe
at first Android was highly customizable
and we can route our phone and we can do
everything we want to it and you know
all that other fun stuff but i honestly
think today that android is just as
mainstream and it's and has just as many
users who don't care about customizing
as those users that want to tweak
everything that android a lot so i
definitely agree because i think we're
seeing a lot of that traction on
especially on advertising coming
directly from google is trying to appeal
to that emotional side of the purchasing
decision it's it's less focused on
trying to appeal to us text and geeks
can i already have us you know they
don't really need to advertise to us but
you know that really cute commercial
with the paper rock scissors kids you
know working together and they're a team
but they're not the same and they come
from different places you know like
that's an emotional appeal to the
consumer base that isn't already it's
also a shot at apple i mean let's be
honest yeah it's also a major shot at
apple but anything I could say is that
they should be helping co-branding some
advertisements with some of the smaller
wheels because they're not making money
on Android and most of them are not then
well they may want to just you know run
away or find something else and I'm just
so they have to stop being the Samsung
train and start being well the HTC LG
string of letters put right here right
but that being said I think it's
important unicorn workers that we that
we emphasize that Google isn't
necessarily advertising to you we we've
got you so what Google is and this is
probably why you think the ads suck is
because they're not geared towards you
maybe they could be maybe they should be
but right now Google is trying to entice
other you know the same customers to be
together but not the same
they're trying to you know pull over
some iphone folks over into the android
so we're running a little longer than i
expected this show to lasso
unfortunately the email from Haneke oh
i'll write you a reply honey go but we
won't be able to get to it on the air
