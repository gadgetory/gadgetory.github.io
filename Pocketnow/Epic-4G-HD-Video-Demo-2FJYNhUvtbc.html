showing you the video camera on the
sprint samsung epic 4g what I'm looking
at here is it's not quite a double
rainbow so Brandon's going to be a
little bit sad because I know how much
he likes double rainbows all the way oh
my gosh but what I do want to show you
is how it looks in an outside
environment and I also want to show you
how it looks when trying to track little
kids this is Spencer he's being my model
for the day he's three years old so if
you're a parent using this video you can
see how catching those precious moments
would be and what the quality is this is
not the default quality this is all the
way bumped up to the 720p resolution and
what I'm looking at here it looks pretty
good now let's go look at some stuff
close-up so we're going to come over
here and I know I'm going to get slammed
for this in the comments for showing you
flowers but flowers have a lot of detail
in them and generally a lot of color
contrast so hopefully by showing you up
close you know what this looks like you
can infer what it's going to look like
when you're looking at other stuff up
close come over here show you a pink
flower so you can flame me for that one
to see that will pull back a little bit
show you some detail in the rocks now
this is being shot in the evening and it
really the optimal time for lighting so
it's not terribly bright outside so you
could tell it it's kind of windy here's
grass detail looking up at the house
with the dryer vent I need to fix and
the wind turbine that I need to put
blades on all kinds of fun stuff so all
in all it's not bad we'll see what this
looks like I'm not going to take it
through rendering process i'm just going
to dump it straight up to youtube so you
can see exactly what it's like but if
it's anything like what I'm seeing on
screen this should just be gorgeous so
hope you liked it hope it turns out well
if you have any questions of course
leave those in the comments and if you
like the video and shooting high def
video on your phone give this video a
thumbs up subscribe to our channel and
visit us over at pocket now calm
so for pocket now I'm Joe and that
Spencer with the samsung sprint epic 4g
