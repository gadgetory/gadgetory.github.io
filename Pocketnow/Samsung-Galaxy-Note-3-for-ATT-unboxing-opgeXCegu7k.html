latest smartphone but now it's headed to
the US I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is our unboxing of
the AT&amp;amp;T Samsung Galaxy Note 3 so this
is the device we all have been waiting
for it is a follow up to the original
Galaxy Note and of course the Galaxy
Note 2 both of which were surprisingly
very very popular phones but without too
much delay let's get into this box and
see what it's about because the box
itself obviously is very very boring not
a lot going on out here
so let's open this up of course on top
we've got our Quick Start Guide which is
great cuz there's a lot to know about
this phone there's so many features so
that's good we probably don't care about
that we'll set the phone to the side for
a very short moment while we look
underneath in here we've got a health
and safety warranty guide of course
something else we really don't care that
much about this is not your standard
micro USB but USB 3.0 so you've got an
additional port there if we can get a
little focus on it really quickly
so it's big ugly some people say it's
not necessary like our own Joe Levi will
see in the future it might be very very
useful later on not so much right now
and because most of our computers don't
even have USB 3.0 so your wall adapter
and this which I imagine these are spare
tips for your s-pen so that's all there
is in the box no headphones nothing too
fancy let's move this to the side and
take a look at the phone because that's
what we really care about right
it can wait texting and driving yes it
can if you have to go to New York and do
one of those little pull off things that
they're gonna build that nobody's ever
going to use so here is the device it's
definitely a major upgrade at least in
design and hardware from the Galaxy Note
2 they've traded the hyper glaze finish
back with a faux leather and it's still
plastic there's no doubt about that
still the same flimsy plastic as before
but it definitely feels nicer and that's
really what we were complaining about
before the slick hyper glaze finish made
it feel very cheap yes
so 3200 milliamp hour battery inside
here you've got your micro SIM with your
micro SD card slot atop that so it's one
of those designs where the SD card sits
right above your SIM get this pop back
on and of course this is a 13 megapixel
camera around back your s pin has been
changed its now square and it can go in
either way there is no problem with that
it goes in either way which is awesome
definitely an awesome upgrade your USB
3.0 slot so yes it's big and we don't
know exactly what we're gonna use it for
yet your loudspeaker is also on the
bottom edge power button on the right
edge volume rocker on the left so same
thing works either way
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and an IR
blaster up top and of course the most
important thing your 5.7 inch 1080p
Super AMOLED display Michael said it was
gorgeous I take his word for it and I
can't wait to see it myself in person
because this is the first time I've
touched the no three inside we have a
snapdragon 800 and you might be asking
why are we reviewing this again and
that's because this is the US model
Michael reviewed the international model
would be octa inside we had the
Snapdragon 800 model 418 T so it's got
the Snapdragon 800 this one I imagine
has 16 gigabytes and it has three
gigabytes of RAM so we're definitely
looking forward to seeing how this thing
does not sure if we're gonna pay much
attention to benchmarks but other than
that we look forward to seeing how this
phone stacks up is it better is it the
same as the International model and is
it better than the competition so stay
tuned to PocketNow for more on this
phone some comparisons and the full
review for the AT&amp;amp;T US model so stay
tuned for that and we will see you very
soon
