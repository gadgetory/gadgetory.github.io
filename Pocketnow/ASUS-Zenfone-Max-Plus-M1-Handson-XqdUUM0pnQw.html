lately and mobile but that doesn't mean
that the company isn't bringing its own
innovation appointing them CES 2018 I'm
Metta Lavetta and jewls Wong with pocket
now and this is the azuz zenfone max
plus m1 yeah I know that's a long one
but fine let's not put your such a long
name as big names can have big
responsibilities this is a Souza's main
smartphone push in North America this
year and it comes after appearances in
Russia and Europe it looks to bring in
all of the recent innovations and
flagship smartphones down to an
affordable price tag which is
commendable specification have been
shifted around we do appreciate seeing a
5.7 inch two by one aspect ratio display
at 1080p resolution and having a 4000
plus milliamp hour battery really helps
keep this film let AF now with that said
we really do know that this is
definitely a mid-range Android phone
that runs on new gift and it does middle
with a mediatek processor there's also a
16 megapixel main camera in a second 8
megapixel sensor on the back that's
equipped with a 6 element lens and my
favorite aspects 120 degrees of wide
field of view there's also tests that
the 16 megapixel selfie sensor is also
enabled for face on lock just like more
expensive smartphones all of this comes
back to the price tag remarkable 230
dollars as of February that's pretty
much in moto G territory whether the Max
Plus um one can compare to that and
other experiences in the lower end is
left to be seen but we're pretty curious
about that ourselves in the meantime
