new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all on to the next
big thing already so let's do something
about it let's take a look at a device
several months after its release but
it's not shiny and new anymore I'm
Taylor Martin with pocket now this is
pebble steel and this is episode 34 of
after the bus when we reviewed pebble
steel back in March we caught it a
SmartWatch in disguise unlike other
smartwatches which are often
unapologetic about their visibly nerdy
appearance pebble steel was designed to
hide its true nature under the guise of
a standard timepiece we still feel
pebble did a great job with what they
were working with frankly it's difficult
to disguise a wrist-mounted device that
incessantly buzzes all day as anything
but a SmartWatch but if you're not
looking closely and choose the right
style of watch face the pebble steel at
a glance looks like your run-of-the-mill
legacy watch the only visual cues
hinting at something else going on are
the pebble branding located at the
bottom of the face and the magnetic
charging port along the left side over
the last few months our personal pebble
steel unit has held up exceptionally
well the gorilla glass screen has fared
much better than the original pebble
which was an all plastic scratch magnet
there's only a single hairline scratch
on the glass which is impressive
considering how many times we managed to
smack the pebble steel on table corners
walls doors and practically everything
else every day on our map black model
other signs of wear are just as minor
the PVD coating has surpassed all our
expectations there are slight signs of
wear on the outside half the band where
our wrist often rests on abrasive
surfaces the clasp has a few minor
scratches on it while the inside part of
the band is more like new under close
inspection you can find other small
blemishes but they're virtually
invisible to the naked eye at more than
a nose length away if you're worried
about minor blemishes you might fare
better with a brush steel model or the
black
they're strapped but we're happy with
how well the PVD coating has held up
everything else has stood the test of
time quite well the buttons are just as
snappy and tactile as they were to start
with the clasp has somehow managed to
withstand our incessant opening and
closing a personal fidgeting tick of
mind that I can't seem to shake and the
display in the pebble still seems more
reliable than its predecessors visual
distortion light refraction and
discoloration are no longer issues still
we would have liked to have seen a
display upgrade but we understand why
pebble passed on bumping resolution or
switching to an RGB panel we're sure
developers are thankful after a few
months the biggest complaint we have
with hardware is and we want to stress
how minor this is how we still struggle
with the magnetic charging connection at
times sometimes it appears to snap into
place and the LED will come on but
charging will stop if you slightly bump
the pebble it's fixed by an ever so
slight adjustment the catch is you have
to see that you disconnected the charger
so instead of having a fully charged
pebble like you thought you would it's
still nearly dead when you disconnect
the charger this has only happened a
handful of times since April if
connected properly the first time the
magnet is easily strong enough to stay
connected and continue charging after
all this time we're still just as
impressed with pebble steel as we were
when seeing it the first time at CES
that said the honeymoon phase is over
it's faded into the background and just
become a piece of a tire we throw on our
wrists every morning and we think that's
exactly what pebble was going for a
really nifty and useful gadget that
doesn't get in the way of your daily
life kudos pebble software has only
improved on pebble steel the
accompanying Android and iOS apps are
fully functioning with pebble appstore
in tow what you'll find in the App Store
has improved as well the number of
applications has grown from nearly 1,000
in March to now more than 3,200 with
over 15,000 registered developers
evidence of the strong development
community comes in the form of some big
names such as Evernote having an
official pebble app forswear Yelp ESPN
and many other well-known brands have
pebble apps as well and the
functionality only continues to grow
apps like music boss which allow the
user to totally control the audio and
even switch music apps on the flash
straight from the watch show the
potential of a device like pebble the
application situation will only continue
to get better but it's not all about
work or fitness there are plenty of
games too if
your thing we've been stuck on tiny bird
a flappy bird port and Petrus a Tetris
clone but what about the actual pebble
software it's improved to quite a lot
actually there's now a notification
history don't like the order of the apps
on your pebble long press the select
button and order the items how you want
want to change the volume of the music
playing on your phone without taking it
out of your pocket long press the select
button in the music app and the up and
down button switch from skip to volume
control each tiny revision of the
software has brought stability and a
better user experience the one negative
note we have to give pebble steel is
battery life after the 2.0 update when
paired with some newer versions of
Android like KitKat battery life on
pebble steel is dramatically worse we
used to only charge pebble steel every
seven or eight days now we charge every
two or three days we took pebble steel
off the charger two days ago around 5pm
currently the battery level is sitting
at approximately thirty percent at
two-fifteen p.m. less than 48 hours
later it will most likely die before
midnight some people are forms are
claiming to have fixes or workarounds
for the battery issues but the issue
still affects many pebble owners today
despite the battery life concerns pebble
steel is just as impressive today as it
was when it was announced in January the
software has only become more functional
and the application support is growing
rapidly users now have more control over
pebble steel than ever and surprisingly
the hardware is held up better than we
would have expected especially
considering how rough we are on watches
here at Pocket now if you're in the
market for a SmartWatch and simply
cannot wait pebble steel is still
definitely worth a look the 249 dollar
price tag still stings a little but we
have no problem recommending it as a
solid SmartWatch go to work on iOS and
Android how it will compare to the
competition once Android wear watches or
the rumored iWatch land is currently the
biggest calls for concern the pebble
says it is willing and ready to take the
challenge of tough competition head on
