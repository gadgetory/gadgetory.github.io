and today we're going to take a quick
look at a tip that will help you
navigate the web easier on your tmobile
shadow as well as a quick look at live
search for windows mobile and how it can
be useful to you now go ahead and pull
out your shadow unlock the screen if
it's locked and we're going to go down
and select browse the web and the thing
about browsing the web on a cell phone
is when it comes time to enter an
address into the address bar sometimes
it can be tedious pushing this back
button depending on the length of the
address to clear it out so one thing you
can do is just go ahead and hold down
this back button and it clears it all
the way out for HTTP and you're ready
ready to put in your new address this
phone already comes with live search on
it but we want you to have the beta
version installed because it has a voice
recognition built-in so go ahead and
enter mlive.com on your phone
go ahead and push go that's going to
navigate to the MLive my of calm website
now what we want to do is go ahead and
download interactive maps for windows
mobile and select this first choice
download live search now it's going to
ask you if you want to download it go
ahead and push yes here i'm using a wire
a Wi-Fi connection right now so that's
why it went so quickly all right go
ahead push done should ask you if you
want to install this all right if it
didn't ask you if you want to install it
go ahead and we're going to go out and
we're going to push start from the home
screen and come down to the file
explorer and i'm on the storage card so
go to your documents my documents on the
device and select live search it's going
to install live search to the phone it's
going to ask you where you want to
install it you have a choice you
installed to a storage card if you have
that installed or the device and you see
that there's a ton of space available on
the tmobile shadow and it only requires
a little bit so go ahead and install it
to the phone in case you switch out your
storage card later you don't have to go
without this very useful program alright
let's go ahead and push done should
automatically launch it you can see map
data by navteq and so on it's really
cool about Microsoft Live searches beta
is it has the ability that you can push
speak
when you're entering addresses or what
you want to search for now here we have
locations that we can go through
locations that we can go through or we
can choose a new location and from there
you can actually speak it there and it's
really great at understanding what
you're saying as long as you're in a
reasonably moderate environment when it
comes to noise all right so we're just
going to go back out there and wanted
things here we got Symphony Hall let's
see what else let's look for restaurants
near New York New York so I'm going to
push speak and go ahead and tell it
restaurants or Italian restaurants
Italian restaurants now it's thinking
there you go it brings up italian
restaurants comes with the whole list of
italian restaurants now that will work
for pretty much every everything you say
you can even use people's names certain
topics and so on it also does traffic
maps for a map here New York the great
thing about this is you use this all in
one hand so you can actually zoom in on
parts of the map
let's take a look at this river here I
depending on your connection speed when
it'll be updated you switch the view to
aerial can also take a look at traffic
here okay traffic doesn't look that bad
at this time of day all right or you
could search from near here another
great thing about live search is if you
have a gps a Bluetooth GPS you can turn
it on and it'll actually follow you
around and you can get your directions
based on that if you want to turn off
this speech recognition you go to the
settings screen and turn it off change
where how much of a cache size you want
to spend on how much travel you have
it'll speed up downloading the maps and
data alright so that was our quick look
at a quick tip as well as a quick look
at live search and how useful that can
be to you I hope you enjoyed that and
come back to all shadow calm soon thank
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
