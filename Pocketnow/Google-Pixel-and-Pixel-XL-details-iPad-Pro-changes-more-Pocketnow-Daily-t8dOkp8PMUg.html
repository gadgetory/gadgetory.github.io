with the Google pixel lineup reports of
the ipad pro future paint more than one
or two tablets and USB type-c might also
want to place a nail in the headphone
jack coffin I'm hi mera Rivera and as
disappointed as I could be about today
being Monday tomorrow's Google pixel day
I can't wait to see what we get this is
parking out daily the official news
today have to do with Facebook and even
though we rarely talk about this company
mainly because of how lost it's become
over the last couple of years now it
just gets worse as the company has just
launched facebook marketplace mainly
because it is very common for people to
try to sell you things on Facebook so
why not just create a marketplace for it
i mean the company is looking for ways
to monetize isn't it we can't wait for
the new facebook viral video section
coming after this just you know and
another official news let's talk about
the future the mess of the headphone
jack as now USB type-c wants to do the
same the organization in charge of the
protocol and i'm not even gonna try to
name it because the name is huge is
pushing a new USB audio protocol through
point O that has the idea of obviously
making it official that everybody should
make USB type-c headphones it makes all
the sense of the world obviously we're
moving to digital here there will be any
need for a deck in the future or
whatever it is that they're going to
implement here the only interesting
question we have is if you would prefer
to have two USB type-c connectors so
that you don't have to be carrying a
dongle on that mobile phone that you
don't want to carry a dongle for don't
you think that's what i would want house
will the spotlight over to apple and its
ipad lineup usually we get ipads by the
end of the year but apparently we won't
until early next year because ever wants
to revamp its pro line up yet again it
seems that we're getting an ipad mini
pro at seven point nine inches will also
be getting the same behemoth 12.9 inch
ipad pro that i use as a TV currently
and then the third one will be a 10.1
inch model for those of you asking where
is the 9.7 inch apparently either that's
going to be a separate line up or it's
just going to die that's actually rather
sad as the 9.7 inch model is my favorite
but let's see what we get now in some
very interesting turn of news today
we've got trusted sources talking about
the pixels
films in huawei and even though we know
that HTC is the OEM in charge of these
smartphones apparently Huawei was the
company that was approached by Google
originally and Google and Huawei did not
come to terms over the lineup because
Huawei pretty much turned it down why
because there wasn't going to be any
Huawei branding on these smartphones
that this is rather interesting it makes
more sense for hcc as HTC used to be an
odm for many years before it went to
building its own brand for smartphones
but yeah always seems to have turned it
down and finally the very hot news that
they have to do with the Google pixel
smartphones tomorrow we're going to try
to launch a separate video that covers
everything that's announced at the event
and a separate pocket out daily so that
we don't bore you with google news and
we'll try to do that daily early by the
way but yeah we have an event tomorrow
and we've got leaks today from carphone
warehouse that tell us a couple of
things number one is that apparently
both devices will share the same
specifications for gigs of RAM
Snapdragon 801 processor 32 and 128
gigabyte storage options which is
interesting as obviously it follows a
trend that we already know but yeah it
seems that both devices won't really
differentiate themselves in anything but
sighs which makes all the sense in the
world but it leads me to the question of
the day if Google ends up launching two
separate smartphones with the same
specifications which one are you picking
the small one or the large one in my
case because I went with the iphone 7
plus and I carry two smartphones I
probably will go for the small one who
believed us a comment down below we'd
