expensive cameras to making expensive
Android smartphones
Samsung has reportedly made more money
than even Apple this quarter and one
plus and the EXO's partnership finally
gets a number
I'm hi Marietta and yesterday our
Spanish website when live would love it
if you followed us and also today my
blog went live as well would appreciate
your feedback this it sparking out daily
the official loose today have to do with
events just like we saw Moto's event
announcement yesterday to be happening
sometime in July
obviously lenovo takes a great spotlight
at 'if I'm already buying plane tickets
for Berlin by the way so yeah August
31st set your calendars we're not
exactly sure what to expect from Lenovo
but last year we saw a ton of innovation
can't wait to see what we get now let's
talk about the oneplus 5 you remember
the company bragged about its
partnership with the XO mark these were
going to be the clearest photos ever and
our real camera proves that this camera
is great but it's interesting as the
braiding ended up being 87 which is
actually three numbers below the HTC u
11 and it's not that I'm saying that the
camera is not as great as the u 11 I
actually can't really tell much of a
difference but anyways you can learn
more on that description now let's talk
about LG as the company is pretty much
predicting that we should not expect
high numbers from the g6 sales its
quarter results are coming up and the
company is already predicting that
because of all the expenses that had
with marketing and everything it's not
going to paint a pretty picture mainly
because remember after the market share
numbers this phone is pretty much
considered a flop so yeah which is kind
of sad I mean I love the g6 I
continuously drift back to it I was told
the spotlight over to Samsung the theme
for this company for the past couple of
years has been that it hasn't been able
to sell more than it did with the galaxy
s4 this has definitely changed with the
Galaxy s8 the company's profits are 40
percent up up to the point where for the
first time ever or at least that I can
remember the company is posting a
billion dollars in profits over Apple we
know that Apple is the most profitable
company would comes to the smartphone
space so yeah this proves that the
Galaxy s8 is s hot as Samsung claims it
to be and finally the very interesting
news that they have to do with camera
maker red and no we're not going to talk
about cameras but expect a very weird
name for its latest smartphone it's
called the hydrogen one there is a
titanium and an aluminum variant there
are $400 in difference between one phone
other meaning when is $1,200 the other
one is a crazier price tag again this is
one thing that red does now one thing
that we're all so used to seeing from
red is crazy things and one of the
things that makes this phone unique is a
holographic display it's going to be a
5.7 inches and I'm so scratching my head
over what the purpose of this
holographic display is we do know that
the phone will be able to record
holographic video through some sort of
modularity but it leads me to the
question of the day I mean what do you
think color graphic video is going to be
for what do you think the purpose is
going to be of this phone because in my
case I'm just hoping that this is not
another flop like 3d was and smartphones
years ago it was a comment down below I
would love to know your opinion
Brens you know the way it goes if you
want to get to looser layer before the
videos filmed well it wasn't out
