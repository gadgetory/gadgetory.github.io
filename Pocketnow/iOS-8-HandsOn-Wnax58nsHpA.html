iOS update ever iOS 8 and earlier today
it went live to the public so what does
it entail I'm Taylor Martin this is
pocket now and here is our iOS 8 hands
on back in June Apple announced its
latest version of iOS iOS 8 we quickly
downloaded the Developer Preview and
gave you an in-depth hands-on showing
all the new features what changed and
what didn't now iOS 8 has gone through
several beta stages hit the gold master
release and now just two days before
iphone 6 day has been officially
released to the public we're going
hands-on once more to see what the
official update is all about to see how
its improved and to explore all the
features that work live before the very
first thing i noticed that has changed
since beta 1 is the appearance of
control center its appearance has been
even further flattened it's cleaner and
it's brighter than before that as well
as some other visual changes were
introduced throughout the various beta
releases such as a toggle for predictive
text suggestions in the keyboard
settings the tips app and a few other
odds and ends in other words the UI has
barely changed at all since beta 1 and
also since iOS 7 the brunt of the
changes are behind the scenes but that
doesn't mean they're small meaningless
features quite the contrary possibly one
of the biggest updates is for soft
keyboards Apple updated its own iOS
keyboard with intelligent predictive
text not only will it learn the way you
type over time it will learn how you
talk with different people as well it's
sort of contextually aware and it adapts
to you but if you don't like the stock
keyboard iOS 8 brings a long desired
ability to install third-party keyboards
and that's finally live today for the
public popular Android keyboards like
swype minumum and flexi are already
available and SwiftKey should be
available later today hopefully by the
time this video is uploaded simply head
over to the keyboard settings select add
new keyboard and choose any third-party
keyboards you have installed when typing
tap the globe to switch between all
activated keyboards this update was huge
for third-party developers not only for
keyboard options but for sharing as well
this was a feature we discussed in our
first hands-on video but it wasn't live
yet now from within any application
which uses the native iOS sharing menu
you can share to any third party
applications that support sharing for
instance you can save articles directly
to pocket or evernote straight from
safari this is a huge step forward for
the platform and users alike thanks to
the extensibility api's third-party
widgets can now be added to the today
view in Notification Center as well
simply pull down the shade scroll to the
bottom and tap edit any third-party apps
with widgets can easily be added and
rearranged I've added Yahoo weather
Evernote in day one widgets we're sure
more will begin to pop up over the
coming weeks and months in Notification
Center items can quickly be deleted
individually by swiping them to the left
you can also swipe messages and emails
to the left to reply instantly without
leaving the app you're in or you can
pull down on a better notification to do
the same these are what Apple calls
actionable notifications continuity was
also one of the cooler features
announced at WWDC start typing a message
on your phone and finish it from the
iPad this aptly named hand all feature
is baked into this release of iOS 8 but
it's not fully functioning and it won't
be until Yosemite is released for mac so
no SMS on the iPad until October
spotlight in Syria also have new tricks
up their sleeve both are powered by bing
and spotlight will now provide cards of
information when you begin to type like
near I events movies playing Wikipedia
articles etc and Siri can now provide
song information using Shazam's music
recognition service and it can be
activated hands-free from stand by using
the hey Siri command so long as your iOS
device is plugged in and charging the
last major iOS 8 feature we're going to
cover here is a built-in photo editor in
the Photos app it comes with several
different filters and options to tweak
your photos it takes a lot from iPhoto
and it reminds us a little bit of
Snapseed we'll just say we're mighty
impressed with how powerful this editor
is all remaining pretty lightweight
other great features can be found
throughout iOS 8 it's a huge update that
brings a ton of much needed change in
improvements to an operating system that
was otherwise growing very long in the
tooth things like better usage by app
third-party touch ID support health kit
family sharing and the shortcut to
favorite in recent contacts in the
recent apps menu are all welcome changes
we just can't wait to try out these new
features on bigger hardware
