the media after the review period is
done there are a few that stand out
gadgets that people still ask about
months later some that we even decides
to hold on to as daily drivers and then
we get to see age over time the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 is one of them
the king of phablets is almost due for a
refresh so if you're wondering if it's
still worth buying months later this
video is for you
I'm hiya metal even out with pocket now
and it's time for another episode of
after the buzz
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 reminds me of
a muscle car they're gorgeous they're
powerful they turn heads and yet they
are larger than most sports cars they
are gas guzzlers and you'll rarely ever
take advantage of everything they're
capable of so in a nutshell I love my
Galaxy Note 8 as much as I hated it I
made it my daily driver for about three
months and during this time at aged well
I mean there are really no significant
scratches on it it spent most of its
time in this Rhino shield bumper that I
still use which is both good and bad
see I love being able to protect my
phone and I minimalistic way but it
seems the oleophobic coating on the
glass wore off quick making it even more
of a smudge magnet and well it also
seems that genes don't really enjoy such
a large phone on a case on my pocket
because they tore up pretty quick as
well this sadly still is a major problem
with the Galaxy Note 8 it is literally
the largest phone I've ever used and the
sharper than normal corners don't help
and seriously don't even get me started
about the cumbersome placement of the
fingerprint scanner and how unreliable
the IR scanner is in most cases want to
know it's funny but even with my whole
drama story of complaints I still love
this phone I think that this is the
first ever galaxy note to age gracefully
thanks to the powerful internals the
qualcomm snapdragon 835 continues to be
plenty capable
we've got 2018 amounts of RAM and also
great storage the infinity display
continues to be one of the most vibrant
and bright in the market and really the
only thing this phone needs for 2018
specs are stereo speakers
this is also the first case I see where
Samsung updates its phone to a newer
version of Android way before its
successor Android ate Oreo on this phone
is mimicking pretty much every single
thing that we see on the galaxy s 9 plus
so we've got great fluidness
functionality with the addition of its
uniqueness because this is a galaxy note
its size along with the s-pen serve the
purpose of replacing a portable note pad
and it has I love being able to write a
note while my screen is off by just
pulling the s-pen out
I love applications like write on PDF
for me to send documents signed on the
go I'm also a huge fan of Microsoft apps
like OneNote and this is the only phone
I can truly use to review and Mark my
notes on the go I still believe that the
S Pen is something you don't really need
but that can really become handy every
now and then probably the only irony in
using a digital notepad is that you'd
wish it would last the day because a
regular notepad simply doesn't die but
this phone has really hit or miss I've
even had cases where I leave the phone
on the table without touching it for
hours and the phone gradually loses 10
to 20% of battery life just out of the
blue if your usage is moderate you'll
probably be fine and getting through the
day but I honestly find the battery life
to be very disappointing for such a
large phone one thing I'm not
disappointed with is the camera nearly a
year later the Galaxy Note 8 is still
one of the best smartphone cameras in
the market great color saturation detail
and contrast
great low-light performance up to the
point where even if you see the
viewfinder grainy just take the shot
don't worry about it the results will
look even better than portrayed I also
consider this phone to bring the most
versatile portrait mode in the market
where you can keep whichever version of
the photo you'd like either the portrait
shot or the white shot and then you can
dial down the background blur after the
fact we've also got great stabilization
on video recording on both the primary
and selfie camera really the only thing
you'll be missing out when it comes to
the newer trends of 2018 or things like
4k video at 60 frames per second or
super slo-mo which I'll admit I rarely
use
to conclude I have to say that the same
feelings I had in my initial review
continued today the Samsung Galaxy Note
8 is not a phone for everyone given its
size and feature set but it's those
particular differences that give this
phone that crown as the best phablet
that money can buy this is not just a
large phone for the sake of being large
it actually serves a purpose this is a
workhorse with tools galore to help you
be productive while on the go what I
still buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 today
that's actually a tough one
I would if I found a good deal on places
like swap ah it's just not worth it to
pay the price of a new no date today
given the benefits that the qualcomm
snapdragon 845 brings to the galaxy note
9 in cases like network performance
photography and battery life and if
you're still holding on to a note 8 and
are considering upgrading this is
actually the best time to list it on
swap ax resale value is proven to be
highest before the next announcement and
we're just a few weeks away the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 is probably one of the
best ever galaxy notes to age over time
but again it's not a perfect phone my
personal advice is that you might want
to wait for the Galaxy Note 9 right now
