speaker but trust me this isn't your
average accessory
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is a quick look at the Sony smart
Bluetooth speaker where the bsp 60 the
PSP 60 takes the form of a kind of black
croquet ball about a hundred millimeters
in diameter and massing 349 grams
it's slick and smooth and nearly
featureless until you flip the switch on
the bottom to wake it up that's when
things get a little less round and a lot
more fun the deploy to ear stalks open
up to reveal two two and a half watt
stereo speakers whose internal lighting
can change color and intensity to match
the beat of whatever music you're
listening to
motion is also a big part of the
listening experience with the ear pods
moving up and down in time with the beat
sony tells us the speaker can also dance
on its own using some kind of internal
motor system it's a lot like the old
Sony roli from 2007 except much sleeker
and dare I say cuter the wheels on the
bottom give it the ability to randomly
wander around your bedside table when
its alarm goes off in the morning making
it a little tougher to snooze since it's
constantly dodging your swipes
unfortunately these features aren't yet
ready to show and couldn't be
demonstrated on the very early sample we
took a look at sony was showing off some
other features though like the always
listening mode it's similar to Amazon
echo or some of the smartphone personal
assistance we've seen recently saying
okay speaker wakes the unit so it can
listen for a voice command ask it the
weather in Tokyo or tell it to play some
tunes and presumably everything in
between you can also tap your phone to
the NFC point on the back to use the bsp
60 as a speakerphone the display up
front relays call information and is
controlled by the capacitive soft keys
surrounding it there are some
limitations here as well the Sony is
only committing to bluetooth 3.0 at this
point which might have something to do
with the estimated battery life only
being about a day in the regular
assistant mode it's pretty clear Sony
expects you to use it at your desk
mainly plugged into the wall but it's
not clear yet how much that would impair
dancing and in order for the lights and
motion to line up properly with the
beats you need to use the Walkman app on
your phone or tablet rather than a third
party solution like Spotify we'll find
out more about the BSB 60s ups and downs
when we review it later this year and I
can't wait it's not every day I get
excited about a Bluetooth speaker and my
hats off to Sony for building something
so strangely endearing for such a
pedestrian category now all it has to do
is give it a nicer name to match the bsp
60 is planned to go on sale this summer
with pricing falling somewhere between
200 and 300 euro be sure to follow us on
social media and subscribe to pocket now
for all the news coming out of MWC 2015
till next time there's been michael
fisher captain two phones on twitter
with jaime rivera and anton dean Nagy
backing me up from Barcelona for pocket
