chair and their best-in-class program
doctor phone which is a leader in data
recovery backup and restore options for
Android and iOS devices check out the
links in the description below for more
info on dr. phone we honestly weren't
planning on revisiting this roundup but
if 2016 is remembered for anything no
not that
if 2016 is remembered for anything
positive it'll be the absolutely
terrific mid-range er options which can
be found around the $400 price point and
we've got a few more phones to add to
that list now high performance beautiful
aesthetics and easy on the wallet here's
our top 5 picks in no particular order
number five the iPhone se many people
will complain about the starting 16
gigabytes of storage but the fact of the
matter is Apple makes a new phone with a
very good camera a great processor great
battery life a very good headphone amp
and it's crammed into arguably the most
attractive shell Apple has ever created
the iPhone se is a pint-sized powerhouse
for folks on the go looking for a true
one thumb experience for all hand sizes
number four the 1+3
the former flagship killer had a
terrific outing this year
oneplus still demands that you never
settle and for the most part they hold
true to that marketing moniker this
phone likely represents the best
all-rounder of the group you start off
with plenty of storage the camera is
respectable producing some of the best
video of the bunch good audio great
performance and oneplus has worked to
make sure it's well accessorized with
these nifty back plates there's little
fall to find and most people will be
well served by this hardware though some
might find it a bit vanilla which is why
it's nice to have a few other options
number three the Alcatel idol 4s in a
year with so many excellent options it
might have been easy to overlook the
idol 4s Alcatel made a move up the food
chain this year with a sleek attractive
phone focused on entertainment and
virtual reality I mean heck it ships
with a pretty nice headset in the box
it's not quite as powerful as the other
Android options on this list but Alcatel
continues to impress by delivering a
discreet look for forehead and chin
mounted speakers add in a quad HD AMOLED
display and FM radio JBL headphones in
incipio case and a dedicated VR app
portal and you've got a solid recipe for
media junkies who want a complete
experience right out of the box number
two the ZTE axon 7 ZTE
definitely delivers the most ambitious
handset of the year for specs junkies
there's really no other place to look as
this phone is a powerhouse on paper top
to your performance big storage the
other phone in this list to deliver a
quad HD display and the loudest audio of
the bunch no joke we had to completely
revised how we test headphone output
after getting the axon 7 in-house to
play with the camera performance falls
slightly behind the other entries on
this list and we're still waiting to
hear back from ZTE on some of the radio
issues our review unit faced but it's
tough not getting excited about what
this phone has to offer
number one the Huawei honor 8 last but
certainly not least honor has maybe the
most unique solution for convincing
consumers to part with four of their
Benjamins
it's smaller than the other Android
handsets on this list with its 5-inch
screen uses a less familiar processor
which didn't come from Qualcomm and it
inherits the dual camera system first
introduced by the Leica branded Huawei
p9 Huawei's custom launcher will be
unfamiliar to Android fans sharing more
with iOS in terms of layout and
Bluetooth connections on our review unit
were kind of flaky but there's a lot to
like about this little phone the
fingerprint sensor is one of the best
we've ever tested the dual cameras
aren't terrific for video but this phone
produces some of the best still photos
we've ever seen an honor has produced
one of the most attractive glass backs
for phone at any price it's difficult
for a smartphone to turn heads these
days but out in public folks have been
genuinely curious about this blue glass
gadget there you have it folks
a quintet of options sure to satisfy
most people out there looking for a good
deal increasingly the line that
separates these devices from more
expensive offerings is drifting away
from processor technology and more
towards lifestyle features like enhanced
durability and water resistance bleeding
edge camera tech security options or
wireless charging actual real-world
performance between premium phones and
these mid-priced handsets is largely
similar these days so which phone does
