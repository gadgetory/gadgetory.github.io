packing.com and today we're looking at
zoom bar plus for the HTC touch pro2 and
diamond to what it does or at least aims
to do is extend the capabilities of the
hardware zoom bar by allowing it to
mimic some of the functions of a
directional pad many users of these
devices also previously owned the
original touch pro and touch diamond so
they often mention how much they miss
having a physical d-pad for their newer
devices so let me just jump right into
it and show you how easily it works we
can swipe right on the zoom bar to go
down and swipe left to move up let's go
to the calendar tab and we can move down
move down move up and move down again so
as you can see it's very easy to use now
with an actual d-pad you can press and
hold on a direction to continuously
scroll which we can also emulate using
zoom bar plus all you have to do is
slide and hold and as you can see it
just continuously Scrolls down until you
let go of course so let me show you what
this looks like in an application like
File Explorer we can move down I down
slowly we can jump items by swiping
quickly and of course we can scroll
continuously by sliding and holding and
finally a traditional d-pad usually has
a center button that acts as enter we
can also do this with zoom bar plus by
double tapping on the bar so say we
wanted to look in my documents we can
double tap
as you can see it went right into the
folder and say we wanted to go to my
ringtones you can double tap again and
in case you're wondering you still
retain default functions of the zoom bar
for apps that actually support it so let
me show you this quickly in an Excel
spreadsheet let's go out of here go to
excel and as you can see when you slide
on the zoom bar it'll zoom in and out as
it's supposed to and zoom bar plus will
not interfere with this function so
overall I think zoom bar plus will make
many users happy to have some d-pad
functions on devices that don't actually
have a physical d-pad hopefully the
developer will figure out how to work
left and right functions into the
equation but as it is right now it's
very handy there are also some registry
edits for advanced users who want to
customize some of these functions and
I'm sure in the future we'll see a
refined version of zoom bar plus with a
user interface for settings and also
maybe some new features I'll post more
