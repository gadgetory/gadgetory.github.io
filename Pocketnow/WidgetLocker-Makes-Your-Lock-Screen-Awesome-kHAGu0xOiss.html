pocketnow.com if you have an android
phone and are looking to expand the
functionality and usefulness of your
lockscreen and we've got just the thing
let's get to it so we're gonna be
talking about widget Locker here it's a
really fantastic tool if you have an
Android phone and you want to actually
bring some functionality to your
lockscreen whether you want to launch an
application instantly whether you want
to see a widget without having to unlock
your phone there's so much you can do
with widget Locker
it cost a dollar ninety nine cents in
the Android Market I think it's totally
worth it especially if you have a device
like the galaxy s2 which comes with the
most boring plain lock screen on the
planet with no options to customize HTC
is thinking over along the right lines
they have a lock screen out for the
sensation and for the flyer where you
drag a program shortcut into the little
oval allowing you to instantly launch
for applications of your choice
widget Locker takes it to the next level
so let's go back to the lock screen
you'll see how I have it set up it's
very basic very simple I've got the time
here which you can customize change the
size of and three launchers here so I
can launch so knows instantly boom it
jumps right into the application or I
also have email and Google Voice but
let's let's talk about how you can
customize this and by the way a cool
feature of widget Locker on devices with
hardware keys on the front like the
Galaxy S 2 is I can unlock my mice my
device by two taps of the home button
boom I don't even have to slide to
unlock anymore it goes right into the
home screen in two quick taps of the
home button when I want to get into my
phone so let's talk about the
configuration options here we're going
to go over here to widget Locker and the
configuration looks just like a lock
screen except now you can do stuff so
you can tap and hold you can make the
clock bigger smaller move it around tap
when you're done if you want to change
any of these sliders here when you tap
in a fold and you click on the little
Settings thing and what we can do is we
can add a slider to the right so we go
over there we can choose to launch an
application so let's say we want to
launch
calculator alright and we'll click back
we can change the theme to an iPhone
like theme you can make it look like the
stock Android I kind of like the
Motorola look so click Save that's what
it looks like now we have two sliders we
can tap and hold to move them around you
can even change the size of them make
them bigger if you've got a shortcut
that you want to launch and have it have
a bigger target you can also add widgets
kind of like a homescreen so let's say I
want to have the accuweather.com widget
here and there's not enough space so go
make it smaller and that actually looks
pretty bad perhaps there's another
widget we could add that would have a
better utilization of space so we go to
quick battery which is cool so you can
see the battery life and percentage
right on your homescreen and then again
with these guys we can tap and hold and
go to the settings we can slide that and
add an application shortcut say we want
to launch the camera real quick and
actually didn't save that properly so
again go in there real quick slide it
over applications camera you can change
the icon to if you'd like to do that
click Save boom there's the camera icon
and now when you're done you just go
back to your home screen you put your
device to sleep wake it up and boom
here's the new lock screen you can
instantly launch the camera instantly
launch the calculator just a really
really great application that takes
advantage of the homescreen in a way
that really wasn't possible before now
it'll work a lot better if you have root
permission if your device is rooted
because then you can easily suppress the
homescreen or the lock screen that comes
on your device so it doesn't pop up
accidentally so again it's called widget
Locker and it's available on the Android
Market for $1.99 really gives a lot of
life back to your lockscreen if you
liked this video please give us a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
