and this is the HTC touch the phone
which was launched in June 2007 so it's
almost five years old now it's running
Windows Mobile 6.0 Professional and it's
what we call the foundation for HTC
Sense because
HTC featured HTC touch below a key in
the Cuba so stay with us we're about to
get a little bit nostalgic it is always
interesting to talk about best devices
especially if they're preparing for
their fifth birthday you will find no
gigabyte of RAM no quad core processor
and you will definitely not find a 720p
screen on it like you have on the HTC
One X which is almost twice as tall but
almost twice as then the screens what
you see here on the One X is probably
the best screen on the market at the
moment compared to what HTC could do
back in 2007 you all know the specs of
the One X so let's take a look at the
touch at the top you have your speaker
grille and just underneath it there's an
LED light for notifications something
missing from most of today's devices
luckily HTC is bringing it back on the
One X and it's also there on the galaxy
s3 just below the screen you have your
call start and call and hardware buttons
in the middle you'll find your d-pad but
it's for directional buttons and the
enter dead center on the Left there's
your volume rocker and nothing else
while the right side has a dedicated
camera button this shiny chrome strip
here can be lifted to reveal the SIM and
the microSD card the top only has a
power button and your stylus while the
bottom holds your USB port microphone
and yes a reset hole on the back there
is your camera with a self-portrait
mirror and your speaker the battery
inside the HTC touch is one of eleven
hundred million powers but it offered
excellent battery life
HTC back then back to a Texas
Instruments processor in the touch an
ohm app 850 clocking at 200 megahertz
yes
200 there is 64 Meg's of RAM and 128
Meg's of ROM but there were also
versions with 128 Meg's of RAM and 256
Meg's of ROM take that those who find 8
or even 16 gig versions to be lacking
storage space
however it also packed a microSD
expansion slot
you know because Windows Mobile actually
supported it and the HTC threw in a 1
gigabyte card inside the box
the screen is 2.8 inches large or with
today's measures 2.8 inches small and
has a qvg resolution of 240 by 320
pixels we have to tell you that the
screen on this device is terrible that's
what technology does to us with all the
Super AMOLED plus s LCD ClearBlack
AMOLED monikers and technologies the
viewing angle on this little phone is
horrified even while staring at at that
center you will see different shades at
the top and at the bottom the camera has
2 megapixels with no flash and back in
the day HTC was struggling with camera
quality this thing takes horrible
pictures but back in the day we were in
so connected digital social network wise
and probably with didn't mind carrying
an actual camera when needed that aside
there was also Wi-Fi BG 2 2.0 and I
almost said GPS there was no GPS on the
HTC touch but there was Windows Mobile 6
point out professional and the stylist
before Apple and the followers killed it
and way before Samsung can its own
followers are trying to bring it back it
takes anywhere between 50 seconds and 1
minute for this phone to boot to a
rather usable state which is the windows
mobile home screen called today screen
with HTC's home item at the top showing
you the clock counters and shortcuts for
messages email and call history as well
as 3
one for home one for the weather and one
for the launcher with its 10
configurable shortcuts back in the day
we had a start button just like pcs had
and they still do settings were divided
in three tabs one where you set your
personal settings one for system and one
for connectivity settings the programs
menu was just the list of icons sorted
alphabetically but there was Windows
Media Player and the File Explorer it's
safe to assume looking back in time that
HTC sends all started with this phone
they tried to make Windows Mobile more
friendly and usable with the finger so
HTC came up with pledge flow aka the
cube which was finger swipe navigation
this later turned to touchflo 3d and
then to cents while still on the windows
mobile powered HTC Touch HD you bring
the cube up by swiping from the bottom
of the screen it brings you three
sections this one is for shortcuts to
email SMS Internet tasks and your
communications manager as well as your
calendar it was the easy way to launch
applications without seeking out the
stylus or trying to use your fingernails
to hit the small text inside the Start
menu the second spring to the left is a
list of your favorite contacts as well
as some shortcuts while the third one is
where all your multimedia shortcuts are
for music photos and videos and that's
pretty much it
swiping from the top makes that flow go
away other things to note while talking
about the software
there was Office Mobile and it was quite
usable while not specifically on this
small QVGA screen but the apps alone
were good and did the job
Internet Explorer also did a great job
rendering mobile versions of pages
because back in 2007 we couldn't be that
crazy to dream a full site full
resolution flash enabled navigation the
phone dialer was also skinned to match
HTC's black grey design from the Today
screen and there was a quick call
functionality with the help of smart
dialing
did we like the HTC touch we loved it
can you believe it now looking at what
the companies are putting on the market
it depends on probably your age and when
you jumped on the smartphones ring
the HTC touch was later followed by the
touch 3G and then everything changed
with the touch diamond the first with
VGA resolution screen as smartphones
evolved so this was it this was the HTC
touch a phone which was launched in 2007
the five year old phone running Windows
Mobile 6.0 professional specs as you've
seen them of course you can all get back
to your Samsung Galaxy S breeze to your
HTC One X's iPhones Lumias will just
stay on this nostalgic note a little bit
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up this wasn't in the united
front pocket now thank you very much for
