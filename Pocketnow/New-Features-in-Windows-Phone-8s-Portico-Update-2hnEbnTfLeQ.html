packing.com and this week mark sucked
released their first over-the-air update
for Windows Phone 8 so in this video
we're gonna take a look at some of the
new features let's check it out
so first off one of the new features is
a ability to reply to phone calls with
text messages so when you're someone
calls we see a new option down here text
reply and you can choose from some
preset ones so it's a quick touch and
text or you can type a message so that
goes straight into the text messaging
interface now here I can say I can type
something and maybe I back out of it
like so and it's gone on Windows Phone 8
that would just be gone but if I go back
over here there's now a drafts option in
the messaging app so I can see right
here I can finish that draft I have
something else that's new we have to
select before or we can select
individual threads and delete them I am
after we've multiple select and the
delete button still there but now
there's a select all so now we can
delete everything all the text messages
all at once very easy to do the select
all has not come to the email programs
or any of the other lists really so
that's kind of inconsistent but it's
cool it's there next we'll look at the
Wi-Fi there's some new settings here
this is Windows Phone 8 on the Nokia if
I go to the advanced button you can see
some differences here we have a new
option for keep Wi-Fi on when the screen
times out so if normally with Windows
Phone 8 and other Windows Phone versions
if your screen shuts
down it turns off y5 to save battery but
that means it's going to use your data
connection for whatever it might be
wanting to download with notifications
of what not if you keep Wi-Fi on it'll
keep Wi-Fi connected so that's a great
new feature another new thing is in the
notifications we can now you can now see
the tweet that you might have been
mentioned in you can see the full thing
right here you only see if that you were
mentioned a bug that has not been fixed
is with the facebook albums say I have
like 600 photos in a in a photo album
only a hundred of them appear so that's
still bug still annoying and lastly
let's just look at the build number
where is it right there
and we see it's ten-to-one 18.0 and this
is a nine 903 so just a incremental
upgrade so that's a available now on the
HTC Windows Phone 8x and probably coming
to other windows phones shortly so
there's your Windows Phone eight portico
update be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
