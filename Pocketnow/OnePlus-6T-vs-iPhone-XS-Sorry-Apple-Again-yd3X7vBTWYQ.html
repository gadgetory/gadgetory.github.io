got a few comments claiming that it was
unfair that I was comparing the 2018 one
plus six versus of 2017 iPhone 10 to
that I thought well it was unfair in
both ways yes the iPhone 10 was six
months older but the one plus six was
half the price so now that the models
have been updated dates have changed and
prices have not how about if we try this
one more time I'm high amenity bet I
will pocket now and this is one plus 60
vs. iPhone 10's the United States
iPhones are popular all it takes is to
see a product launch to notice just how
much people will line up in a store and
buy them but what I wasn't really
prepared for was to see just how popular
oneplus was as well I had the chance to
spend some time at the t-mobile launch
on Monday and boy was it packed the
biggest question is if you're really
getting $500 more of a phone in the
iPhone 10's when compared to the oneplus
60 and from a hardware perspective I say
you aren't apple claims that you'd get
the hardest class on a phone on its
iPhone 10s but then provides no
certification information for us to
measure it
while the oneplus sixty sports the
latest and greatest Gorilla Glass six
yes I will give Apple points for its
stainless steel chassis which we know is
stronger than the aluminum on the 60
I'll also give Apple points for the
color options like gold silver and Space
Gray with a 60 only offering two
different shades of black at the time of
this comparison even if I do prefer the
matte finish on the midnight black
variants of the latter I'd still
recommend that you use a case on both on
the iPhone mainly because its side
camera bump is a design aberration
that'll wobble on a table in the most
annoying way and in the case of the 60
simply because oneplus has some of the
coolest case options that really
complement the phone
the oneplus 60 is a larger phone when
compared to the 10s it's actually 14
millimeters taller 4 millimeters wider
one millimeter thicker and 8 grams
heavier it also has a larger 6.41 inch
display versus 5.8 though both devices
support OLED technology it's hard to
call any of these displays better but I
will call the one plus more saturated
while the iPhone is more natural the
iPhone also has more pixel density at
458 PPI versus 400 and 260 the iPhone
also sports more certifications and
features like Dolby vision HDR 10 the
DCI p3 color gannets true tone
capability 3d touch and 120 hertz touch
sensing while the oneplus 60 only claims
the DCI p3 color gamut and that's it the
iPhone also has some of the loudest dual
firing speakers in the industry which
you can't easily muffle while in the
case of the oneplus 60 it's very easy to
cover the speaker by accident and kill
content consumption just as much as it
is easy to forget the dongle on both
phones as neither has a headphone jack
that same hurdle in consuming content
can be found in watching videos in full
screen with the horrible notch on the
iPhone with the 60 offering a more
subtle approach yes I know there is a
purpose for the notch in the case of
face ID for the iPhone 10s but I
honestly prefer the on display
fingerprint scanner on the 60 as a less
intrusive solution and with face to
unlock only serving as a compliment
comparing specifications is probably not
worth it we know iPhones aren't famous
for numbers as much as they are for
efficiency the iPhone 10 has does pack a
punch with the 812 which is the world's
first 7 nanometer processor on a phone
which is a good technical term for
Theoretical faster performance and more
efficiency but which I haven't really
been able to notice in real-world use
the oneplus 60 on the other hand sports
the 10 nanometer Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
which is already quite proven in both
departments the 60 wins with more RAM a
better starting storage at 128 gigabytes
and a larger battery size while the 10's
wins and going up to 512 gigs of storage
an IP rating and wireless
charging fear in the United States both
devices technically only work as single
sim phones mainly because the iPhones
Isan is still not supported by major
carriers and going dual sim on the one
+60 actually requires the international
variant the t-mobile variant is single
sim only when it comes to the
conversation of iOS versus Android let's
avoid the sort fight let me just say
that these two phones offer the best
experience out of their respective
operating systems iOS 12 is now far
leaner than before the crazy-fast
interface and some of my favorite
gestures to operate a phone
the oneplus 60 is no slouch though
project boost allows all the extra RAM
to be used to help speed up applications
and I have to say that it has better
gestures for navigation mainly because
they have flexibility if you want
buttons or the pixel pillow or swipes
you can pick your favorite way to
interact I also like the features like
game mode where notifications don't
bother your experience playing with the
oneplus 60 or the iPhone has mostly
hit-or-miss about the experience though
I will praise iOS for having earlier
access to hot gaming titles in some
cases but going back to the topic of
flexibility this is really the beauty of
the oneplus 60 Android is more versatile
and less boring than the grid of icons
that Apple has been reluctant to change
since 2007 sure your iPhone will get
software updates quicker but oneplus has
proven it can do a better job than other
OEMs at delivering quick updates for
Android as well I call the oneplus 60 a
winner on this one though honestly when
it comes to software that's just a
matter of taste
another spot writes say the oneplus 60
wins is in the overall experience of
using both phones as daily drivers for
starters the only device that ends the
day on a charge is the oneplus 60 it
also includes the fastest charging in
the industry in the box which the iPhone
lacks sure the tennis max has a better
battery but we chose not to do that fun
for the comparison because it was even
more expensive another spot where the
oneplus 60 wins is in data speeds sure
both devices are technically capable of
Gigabit LTE but I recently ran tests on
57th and 7th in New York City using the
same t-mobile network on both devices
and
60 just demolishes the iPhone by at
least 40 megabits down on all six of the
tests that I conducted phone calls are
about the same in quality though I do
consider the iPhone to do a better job
with the speakerphone now in the camera
Department one plus one the last
comparison by a long shot but Apple has
clearly worked hard on getting the
iPhone 10s up to speed this newer iPhone
brings significant improvements dynamic
range in detail things I actually
praised about the oneplus 6 in my
previous comparison the iPhone does tend
to be warmer in photography during the
day but I can't really declare a winner
when the scenarios are bright it's when
we go into low-light that both photos
look good on the display once you pulled
them into the computer you do notice
added lens flaring and artifacts on the
oneplus 60 which are things that are
really not a problem on the 10s I'm not
saying that the photos aren't a 60 are
bad but the 10s is doing a better job in
my opinion portrait mode is good on both
with a 60 bringing a more natural result
in my opinion even if the iPhone has the
advantage of letting you tone down the
bouquet after the fact I'd give points
to the 60 on selfies for the crop but I
find results to be a 10 watched out when
compared to the iPhone in low-light now
where the iPhone 10s just obliterates
the one plus 60 is in video recording
both devices have the same options for
4k at 60 super slow-mo great
stabilization etc but the iPhone is able
to provide way more detail and less
sharpening in the video and I'll say the
same about selfie video where the iPhone
provides far better results in skin
tones
now let's definitely raise the bar when
it comes to the camera but the oneplus
60 again is no slouch for the most part
it just doesn't win in every single
scenario to conclude let me just say
that this comparison is asked tough as
it is easy see both devices excel in
hardware they support the best versions
of software of the respective operating
systems and with everything else being
relatively similar between both devices
for the most part so let's go back to
that initial premise when we began the
video are you really getting $500 more
of a phone with the iPhone 10s when
compared to the 1 plus 60 my answer is
no you aren't if you were to narrow down
to things that every user cares about
like battery
data connectivity and storage the iPhone
10 s is even inferior to the one plus 60
now don't get me wrong I get it there
are people out there that love their
iPhones and the iPhone 10s is a great
phone in many ways I just have to admit
that the one plus 60 is proof that you
don't need to pay so much for a great
phone
my conclusion continues to be the same
as in my previous comparison if it were
my money I would definitely buy the
oneplus 60 instead how about you which
one would you pick out of these to chime
