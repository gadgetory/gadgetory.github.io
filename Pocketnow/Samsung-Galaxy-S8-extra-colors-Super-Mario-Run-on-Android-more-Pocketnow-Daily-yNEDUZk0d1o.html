golden samsung galaxy s aid continue to
emerge fossil group is working on truly
pushing androidwear off the ground and
have you begun playing your round of
Super Mario run I'm high metal Yvette I
end up yes I know that I owe you a daily
from yesterday how about if I pay with a
version for Saturday
this is pocket out daily official news
today begin with deals that you still
cannot get believe it or not we already
know what target is planning to do for
the launch of the Samsung Galaxy s8 set
your calendars
apparently pre-orders will begin on
April 2nd and if you get the phone on
target you will get a free gear VR and
in addition to that you will also be
getting a one hundred and fifty dollar
coupon or coupons I'm still not sure
exactly how that's going to be but it's
still a lot of deal for a product that
you're buying unless you've been living
under a bubble Super Mario run has
already become official for Android if
you caught my HTC u ultra rare yesterday
yeah I actually been playing with it
quite a bit on Android it performs just
as well as it does on iOS if not better
it's really hard to judge yet as the
game is obviously new and obviously the
server's getting jammed so it could come
and go you know that these online games
can be kind of tricky but yeah finally
Super Mario run is up we're just waiting
for all the rest of the mobile Nintendo
games Nintendo absolutely spotlight over
to the fossil group you know I was very
surprised
back at Aoife last year when I
discovered that fossil group was pretty
much in charge of building a ton of
smartwatches for a lot of companies I
had no clue that fossil was a no DM we
saw Michael Kors smartwatches we saw the
company acquired misfit and obviously
working on that a company doing Skagen
and everything and we've got some very
trusted information that says the
company is working on building as many
as 300 smartwatches running Android wear
from 14 brands if that's not going to
make Android wear take off I don't know
what will I just hope that Google
figures out that whole battery
life issue by them and speaking have
missed it and speaking of androidwear
we've got a new one official today the
mystic vapor and even though I usually
don't mention list it because it didn't
have an operating system do we cover it
now does as this will be running Android
wear too dotto
the only problem is we're going to have
to wait for it until pretty much the
summer but then again desire is great
it's not going to be that pricey $1.99
and is supposedly going to be a fitness
powerhouse I can't wait to see and
finally is very hot you see they have to
do with the Samsung Galaxy s8 and famous
tipster Evan blast
we've heard that there are only three
color variants but evidence is trusted
he knows what he's doing and well it
seems that there will be a gold variant
we've got some press renders of that
gold variant all that is great the
question is which carrier is going to
get that exclusively because if this is
not part of the other leagues that it
could just be an exclusive or whatever
the case may be anyways the renders are
gorgeous I love golden Samsung Galaxy
smartphones they look amazing but it
leads me to the question of the day have
you decided which color option would you
pick for the Samsung Galaxy s8 or are
you picking another smartphone
altogether in my case I have to review
it I hopefully get it in black I really
love the onyx black of the s7 but then
again we'll see what we get leave us a
comment down below we look to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
