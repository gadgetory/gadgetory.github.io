favorite keyboard replacements for
android is called swype it's really fast
really convenient and really kind of fun
you drag your finger across the letters
and connect the dots to type what you
want on the screen really cool really
fun and really not compatible with ice
cream sandwich that is until this beta
was released let's go take a look this
is my galaxy nexus running android 4.3
and 'which and as you can tell I've got
swype running down on it first of all
you'll notice that the little swipe path
down here is orange instead of a kind of
a light blue that helps you recognize
that this is the latest version how does
it work just like all the others this is
very cool very simple very easy very
fast just like you're used to now one
thing that's relatively new is the
integration of Dragon NaturallySpeaking
for its voice recognition now this is
not the voice recognition that comes
with Android Ice Cream Sandwich or the
voice type as it's called this is its
own thing and there's no way at least in
this current build to switch between the
Google version and the version that
comes with swype which I'm really not
that fond of I like having options just
how good is this voice recognition let's
take a look just how good is the voice
recognition that comes with swype for
ice cream sandwich so looking at this it
says just how good is the voice
recognition that comes with swype for
ice cream sandwich that's a perfect
recognition and I didn't have to really
slow down or over enunciate my words
it's kind of like the old voice
recognition that came with android the
the pre ice cream sandwich stuff where
you had to speak your entire sentence
and then it would think for a while and
recognize not necessarily a bad thing in
fact that kind of helps with the
well with the recognition because it can
put the words into into syntax to
determine what they should be rather
than determining the word all by itself
like that the new voice dictation mode
kind of does overall very good if you
would like a copy of swype beta that
works with ice cream sandwich you don't
have to run it on Ice Cream Sandwich
it'll run on all the other androids that
swype would run on you can go ahead and
get that from swype com if you want to
link over to the beta site head over to
pocketnow.com so you can download it
directly from there if you like this
kind of stuff sure you give the video a
big thumbs up and of course leave your
comments about what you think about
