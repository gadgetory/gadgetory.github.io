pocketnow.com and so much is going on we
just filmed an awesome announcement
which you'll see on Monday there's a
pocket now live show happening right now
there's a blizzard outside and I've got
a blackberry z10 review to write there's
a lot happening but none of it in this
very moment is as exciting as the fact
that Windows Phone 8 just got Spotify
let's check it out okay so this is gonna
be less exciting news for anybody who's
been running Windows Phone 7 because
Spotify has been running on Windows
Phone 7 for quite some time but it just
made the port to Windows Phone 8 before
today you couldn't get Spotify running
on Windows Phone 8 so this is huge it
was a huge gap in functionality and it's
especially big news for anybody who uses
more than one mobile platform on a
regular basis ie most of us have pocket
now and in the tech reporting world in
general because now we can access our
playlists on one more major platform
Windows Phone 8 so the user interface is
very similar to what you've already seen
on Windows Phone 7 we launch into the
app and we have the Spotify title up top
there's a search bar where you can
search for artists here your playlists
are aggregated thusly and if you want to
just start playing a playlist you can
just tap go ahead and tap on a song and
it does that you can also see the queue
of music that you've queued up to play
from various playlists and you can see
your list of people which is really cool
if you have friends on Spotify you can
see what they're currently listening to
you can see what they've a granade it in
terms of what their favorite songs are
their favorite playlists top artists and
so on and you can always see what
they're playing currently if they are in
fact listening to Spotify
ma is busy in a pocket now live hangout
right now which you should go do after
you're done watching this video when
music is playing you can hop back to the
home screen and it will continue to play
in the background the Spotify shortcut
is in fact a live tile so it will flip
periodically to show you what album
you're listening to or what album is
currently paused and if you are in
another application so you're just
playing around you're setting an alarm
clock whatever you want to adjust the
volume Spotify does use the Windows
Phone 8 player controls up top so you
can pause resume and skip tracks from
here as well from within the app you can
skip tracks just by sliding from track
to track in the album view and here is
also where you can share the
you're listening to using Facebook using
SMS using email and so on you can also
add a song to an existing playlist or
generate a new playlist right from
within the app as always and the app of
course also supports downloadable
playlists for offline listening and
finally under settings there are options
for high quality low quality streaming
and syncing and other such preferences
and once again in case you're looking
for a specific artist there is search
functionality which works just as well
as it does on any other Spotify version
it looks like in this quick look once
again that's just a quick look at
Spotify for Windows Phone 8 newly
released just today everybody have fun
tonight that's gonna do it for a quick
look of Spotify beta for Windows Phone 8
follow us in the links in the
description below so you don't miss
future videos stay tuned for a lot more
on this very very busy weekend leading
up to a busy week leading up to a busy
month like the video with the thumbs up
if you did enjoy it thanks for watching
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
