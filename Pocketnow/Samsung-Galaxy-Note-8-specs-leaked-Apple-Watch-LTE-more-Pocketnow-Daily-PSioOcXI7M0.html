the possible specifications of the
Galaxy Note 8 the Apple watch series 3
has just been rumored to include
possible LTE capabilities and do not
prepare your wallets for the price tag
of the essential phone in certain
markets
I'm Jaime Rivera and the 1 and I have
just recorded the next episode of tech
debates it should go live very soon for
now this is PocketNow daily the official
news today has to do with nothing that
has to do with deals actually the
complete opposite tell us is just
published the price tag of the essential
phone in Canada oh my god that thing is
going to cost $1,050 if you get it
outright and if you finance the phone
you'll end up paying $2,500 over 24
months for phone that is just ridiculous
I'm sorry but I just have to say it it's
a ridiculous way to finance a product
completely the opposite to what we see
in certain markets like the United
States lately but again if you're in
Canada you can learn more in the
description hopefully that is not going
to be the case in the US now let's talk
about Apple's home pod we still don't
have a fixed release date nor do we have
more information than predictions and
most of these have to do with the fact
that apparently Apple is not going to
build very many of these it seems that
it's going to be very scarce on its
launch by the end of the year and
apparently the company is actually not
even preparing to be ready to produce
more until 2018 because it seems that
the company just wants to do things that
way stay tuned we should learn more very
soon in the next batch of Apple events
as well as spotlight over to the Apple
watch Series 3 we hear two things number
one that apparently there is going to be
an LTE variant so we launched them but
KGI is predicting as many as 2.8 million
units to be sold initially of that LTE
model and that's just to complement the
rest of the sales of the Apple watch
family series 3 is not going to be the
biggest seller it seems that series 2 is
going to stick around for a little
longer
which is not necessarily a bad idea
let's just see what the price tag of
that LT variant is going to be and
speaking of smart watches Evan Blass has
just unveiled certain photographs of the
Samsung gear fit bro apparently that's
going to be the case I used to be
customer of the gear fit in the year 52
actually elect the gear fit - a lot but
the gear fit three apparently brings
capabilities for you to be able to track
swimming in addition to have Spotify
offline and just for Spotify offline
alone
I am completely sold on this watch I
even hope that gear whatever product
that we're going to see it Aoife also
brings his capability apparently we
should learn about both of these
products at Eve as well and finally the
very hot rumors today have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 well we've got
linked benchmarks that pretty much
confirmed the specifications that we've
heard six gigs of RAM Snapdragon 835 Rex
and O's eighty eight 95 64 gigs of
storage we don't see another variant but
that could just be the one that just got
benchmark in addition we hear things
like the 6.4 inch display and quad HD
resolution plus because of the whole
infinity display all this is great the
only problem is we can't really figure
out what the cameras are or at least
it's not really that evidence on the
benchmarks but anyways it leads me to
the question today what do you think
about the specifications do you think
the Galaxy Note 8 should be just an
iterative update to the galaxy s 8 plus
because that's pretty much what it is
with the exception of the RAM in my case
I wish we got some sort of a bump in the
processor of some sort of efficiency in
the battery but anyways we should learn
more on August 23rd and the impact we
would love to know your opinion the
comments down below and friends you know
the way it goes if you want to get the
news earlier before the video was filmed
all of us I'm talking outcomes disrupt
our channel as well for more videos like
this one you can also follow me on
twitter hang out decoder you better run
Instagram but hiding that way better
