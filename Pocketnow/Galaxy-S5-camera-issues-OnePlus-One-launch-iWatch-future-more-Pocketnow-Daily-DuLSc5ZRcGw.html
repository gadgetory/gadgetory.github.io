up for the iWatch Google to help pay for
Samsung's patent damages in case apple
wins and the one plus one smartphone
gets announced and it's got some really
great specifications I'm hi Mary vetta
and please nobody talked to me about the
web Champions League I am on denial
right now this is parking out daily
let's start today off by knocking the
official stuff first of all because
Google has just confirmed that they will
be in charge of paying Samsung's legal
fees and damages in case Apple wins the
trial in two specific patents first of
all the Universal Search and the other
is background syncing as these are
Android features and necessarily think
that TouchWiz brought to the table and
it's great to see Google supporting the
company but we do hope this comes out
and some sort of happy ending and guys
the power just went out you're not going
to believe this so please apologize the
noise of the generator I have to get you
the new somehow now let's talk about
Samsung let's talk about the galaxy cave
that's going to be the final name for
this product as this will be the future
s5 zoom with lower specific Asians like
if this was an asst five mini though it
brings a 20 megapixel camera and the
design seems much slimmer than the
galaxy s4 zoom that we saw last year
though obviously we need to get
something official feature but so far
the design looks quite good let's see
what we get in the review now the
biggest oddity is that you think that
the company that brings is the Galaxy K
will bring us a good camera on its
galaxy s5 but a lot of people have been
complaining and as it turns out there
are some reports that on xda-developers
people say that whenever they launch the
camera they get this warning and they
can't launch the application now
obviously this most likely is a software
issue that should be fixed soon but the
phone has been flagged a lot lately we
don't know why hopefully they figure it
out now let's move on over to Apple as
first of all we know that Apple has not
revamp its ipod line up in two years and
the analysts are already predicting that
the company will ditch the ipod line up
eventually not now but apparently there
is no refresh for the ipod and
apparently what we're getting is the I
wats and eventually the iWatch will
supersede the ipod which is really
interesting and we even get more rumors
of the fact that because nike just ditch
this whole FuelBand
line up the idea is that some stem
cookies and the board of my key but
apparently they have come to an
agreement where nike+ will make a big
part of what the iWatch can do it was
really interesting let's see what we get
in the end and finally for the very hot
news of the day the 1+1 cyanogenmod
phone gets denounced the day and guys
I'm sure you've noticed but I've kind of
been ignoring the stone because there
were tons of rumors but nothing really
specific and I am surprised this phone
has great specifications I'm talking
about a Snapdragon 801 three gigs of ram
options for 16 and 64 gigs we've got a
lot of power on this phone 13 megapixel
camera we've got an IPS display 5.5
inches but you're not going to believe
this this phone just costs three hundred
dollars $300 so well it's definitely
gonna be sold in the United States aside
from your we have no specifics on base
there is a black and a white option but
that leads you to the question of the
day what do you think about this one
plus one smartphone because in my case I
cannot wait for Michael Fisher to get as
the review unit and for us to see what
this phone is capable of doing because
honestly I'm hooked I really like this
thing I want to buy it leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is so mushy follow us on Parker no
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well you'll also follow me on Twitter
Jaime underscored iveta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am high never better thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
