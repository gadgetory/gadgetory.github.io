fine final product benchmarks of the
regular Galaxy Note point to a US launch
whether we like it or not and sales
figures for the LG g5 don't paint a
pretty picture in quarter results I'm hi
meri behna and somebody told me to keep
calm today as if they actually noticed
what day it was this is parking out
daily as we try to do every day the
official news today beginning with deals
those of you in the market for the
Galaxy s7 you might want to consider a
listing in the lingo description there
is a seller on ebay selling devices new
other their new just the packaging is
wrong or new other means a lot of things
on ebay but the point is that these
phones are pristine and they're
currently four hundred and thirty
dollars for a galaxy s7 that's a steal I
highly suggest you look at bowling and
speaking of the things that make devices
like the Galaxy s7 powerful Qualcomm has
just detailed what to expect from the
Snapdragon 801 we should expect the
processor to reach devices later this
year which is interesting because we
were waiting for the Snapdragon e23 and
apparently the differences between these
is pretty much nothing to the point
where the difference is between the
Snapdragon 821 and the Snapdragon 820
are just ten percent then are going to
be considered 10% I've been already very
powerful very capable processor ten
percent is ten percent and obviously
it's not like if it's gonna make the
phones more expensive cannot wait to see
the first product now one company that
went all out with specifications and
unique design and didn't really pay off
was lgpl gt5 is probably one of our
favorite phones but it hasn't really
been the favorite of the market up to
the point where Alice are already
claiming that only 2.5 million uses sold
alastair not predicting more sales than
5 million units by the end of the year
so if you do the math over how many
galaxy s seven units have been sold how
many iPhones have been sold it's a
really really bad number and it's very
sad the LG g5 is a really good phone
there could have been so much better if
it had a little more time in the
manufacturing process and everything one
of the things that we've covered
extensively lately are benchmarks for
the galaxy note 7 we've seen that
there's an edge variant we've seen that
there's a possible
regular variant with lesser
specifications we were expecting for
these variants to reach other markets
but then we saw leagues for verizon and
today's benchmarks also claim it can
come to other US carriers meaning don't
think they were going to be saved by the
regular galaxy note 7 and it doesn't
necessarily need this is going to be a
chump phone apparently it's just going
to be a galaxy s7 larger chassis of the
note it will still be a good phone we
were just waiting for more and finally
the very hot news today have to be the
leaked chassis of the iphone 7 we were
kind of skeptical over the larger camera
hole over the change in the antenna
lines over everything else that we could
expect from this phone but you've got to
notice two things number one it looks
really good it pretty much looks like an
iphone 6s but with a better more refined
back to where is the smart connector
apparently these leaks are for the 4.7
inch model meaning that the larger
variant could bring the no holds bar
specifications the sins of the 4.7 inch
model is not going to bring these which
leads me to the question of today would
you be okay with the iphone 7 buying the
4.7 inch model and not having all the
features or you prefer to go for the
plus or the pro just because of those
ads in our case it will really depend on
what features these are because so far
hey if the Apple pencil works on that
thing then fine I'll go for it for that
and the extra battery life but then
again and everything else I always
prefer the smaller iPhone leave us a
