Galaxy F will be even more expensive
that we thought LG just trademark
weirder names than huawei for their
upcoming foldable smartphone tablet and
Google is now testing fusia OS in a
consumer product with an honored device
I'm Jaime Rivera and I hope everybody
woke up well from their food comas from
Thanksgiving in addition to also making
it out alive from Best Buy
this is marking out daily sponsored by
swap on the official news today I have
to do with the most ridiculous Black
Friday deal I have ever seen coming from
Apple where you have to buy a gift card
if you want the deal and depending on
the gift card size meaning from 25 to 50
200 bucks is what you're eligible to get
on a deal and so before you complicate
yourself and buy yourself the wrong gift
card and the first link in the
description is the full list of what
you're getting depending on what you buy
and no there are no iPhones or Apple
watch Series fours in that list and
let's continue talking about Apple and
some interesting turns in events as a
clearly iPhone 10 our sales are not good
up to the point where we hear that the
company is subsidizing this really
high-end Japan just to be able to
continue the amount of demand that they
were expecting subsidies that had never
been seen from Apple but even more
interesting is that the company is
apparently strutting production of the
iPhone 10 one more time yes the iPhone
10 because apparently it's cheaper to
manufacture and they could probably
boost up numbers that way so cool Apple
I mean why not just sell the phone at a
reasonable price I think that would like
really spruce up demand now let's talk
about Google and Huawei as this is
interesting we hear that there is now
testing on a consumer device for the
fusia OS that we will get at some point
the most interesting part is that it's
currently running on an honor play and
surely yes I know honor and Huawei are
separate companies but they pretty much
I mean Huawei makes the cur√© 970 that
powers this honor play and well this is
I find it interesting for Google and
way to be collaborating in this let's
see when we get to see more information
on this or what other devices will it be
tested on and how about if we discuss
the most ridiculous names we've heard
when it comes to devices duplex foldy
and flex are the probable names that LG
just trademarked for their possible
foldable smartphone tablet or whatever
cuz yeah it seems that companies are all
looking for a solution in search of a
problem
watch today's parking our weekly podcast
it was great we had a long conversation
over these foldable products oh and
let's see how early we get them and
finally the hot news today have to do
with Samsung and foldable devices yet
again we talked about the trademark
names yesterday but let's talk about
price tags as they continue to get more
ridiculous we're hearing almost up until
two thousand pounds British pounds which
in exchange rates is a lot of money and
I know it's probably let's not apply the
exchange rate because I know that
usually companies because of taxation
and everything well under charging the
same number only in different currencies
like the Euro like the dollar and like
the British Pound two thousand dollars
two thousand euros two thousand British
pounds what exactly do you think of
Samsung is planning here and let us know
in the comments I mean do you think that
this I think that it will be deal way if
it launches it's such a crazy price
because it's not like if the world is
right now dying in need of a foldable
product the selling point of this
product would have to be crazy
I mean iPad pros right now if you max it
out you could end up paying almost two
thousand dollars and it's still an iPad
so it's it's a nice way to watch Netflix
and sure you can do some pro stuff if
you're an artist but it still is not
worth so much money in my opinion leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know what you think and friends before
