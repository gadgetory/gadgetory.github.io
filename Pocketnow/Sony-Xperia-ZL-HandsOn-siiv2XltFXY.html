pocketnow.com we're here at CES 2013 and
I'm standing next to what Barry might be
my next daily driver this is the Xperia
Z L and it's got some really cool
features that differentiate it from the
Xperia Z let's check it out okay so
putting the Sony what makes this one
interesting
there are a few ways that the Xperia Z L
is different than the Xperia Z first of
all it is non waterproof and it also
does not have a glass back which I
really like because I don't like having
a glass back it makes it less durable
another reason another way that this is
different is that the front-facing
camera is on the bottom what's up with
that a very interesting design element
that really doesn't matter much reason
that they did that is because they max
out the screen in the face of the phone
and sony claims that it has the highest
ratio of screen phone face
that's hard to say but as you can see
the bezels are crazily been I feel I
know the sentiment I feel something when
I look at this bone it just is so
futuristic looking around the back we've
got the same 13 megapixel camera we've
got a little butt flap which has a space
with a micro SIM card and the micro SD
card which is great expandable storage
now the battery on this is a little bit
smaller than the Xperia Z the Xperia Z
was 24 million 2,400 million hours we
really didn't mention that so this is
about 23 or 24 37 23 70 milliamp hours
and so everything else is the same here
compared to the Xperia Z we've got the
1080p screen which is 1920 down by 1080
across the same amount of pixels it's on
the TV and hanging in your living room
most likely it's got a 440 PPI and I've
got to say the screen actually oddly
looks better on this and maybe it's just
because I'm freaking out about this
phone but it just seems that better
viewing angle is slightly better
contrast now another thing we notice
here is that we get an LED notification
look at it it's it's like this line and
maybe that changes to multiple colors
which would be really cool you can use a
program like light flow with it so
inside we've got the same specs as the
Xperia Z I mean after this gene and the
Nexus heart that awesome combination of
the s4 probe with two cubes of RAM which
means that this guy is fast
we don't have an internet connection so
we can't go crazy showing you stuff
we've got Android 4.1 we've got the
jelly bean in the house and let's jump
into the camera and you'll see what I
mean
the position of the front easing camera
really doesn't matter because look the
hold your hand here you hold your hand
here yeah that might happen once in a
while we're here your hands covering it
up say hi to everyone hi hi I and back
to the front and as we know from
previous phone that's really cool I was
gonna say as I know from previous Sony
devices Sony devices haven't awesome
I have very awesome cameras here's
something that's really interesting and
I'll be it's not doing it now let's go
back into the camera app check this out
it takes up the entire frame and we get
these three dots after you tap the three
dots boom that little guy pops out with
those on-screen Android buttons so this
is the Xperia Z out I'm really looking
forward to it because damn look at it a
lot of screen on a phone lines or
something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
