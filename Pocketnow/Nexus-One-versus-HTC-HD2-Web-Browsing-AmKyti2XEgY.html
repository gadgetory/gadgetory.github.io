pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to compare the internet browsing
experience of probably the best android
phone on the market right now the google
nexus one with that of the best windows
mobile phone on the market right now the
HTC hd2 both of these devices are
packing a Qualcomm Snapdragon one
gigahertz processor plus a lot of RAM so
they're very powerful devices we're
going to see how fast they load webpages
how they do with rendering fidelity and
other things like that so let's get
started we'll turn on the nexus one by
doing a little pattern here and we'll
turn on the hd2 just a little slide and
here we are and i'm going to go over to
the browser and launch both browsers
should tell you that both browsers are
currently hibernating so they should
open very fast on both devices nexus one
was a little bit faster you can really
get a sense for how much contrast there
is with the AMOLED screen on the nexus
one even though it looks a little bit
small compared to the massive screen on
the hd2 the quality is just really
fantastic on the screen another thing
you'll notice right off the bed is that
on the nexus one you still get the
notification area at the top whereas on
the hd2 and opera mobile 9.7 all of that
is hidden so you get the maximum view so
let's go to a website we're going to go
to pocketnow.com and on both devices
will see which one loads faster and
we're gonna hit go on both one two three
go they both have capacitive displays
same resolution 800 down and 480 across
the screen on the nexus one is 3.7
inches on the hd2 it is 4.3 inches so
I'm just watching the progress bar here
looks like the nexus one has already
finished loading pocketnow.com they are
on the same Wi-Fi network and we'll wait
for the hd2 to finish ok so the hd2
finished about 10 seconds behind how the
nexus one we'll have to see if that's
always the case when we load other web
pages and of course the nexus one does
not have multitouch but the hd2 does so
we can zoom in that way on the nexus one
you have to double tap to zoom in let's
take a look at how the nexus one does
with resizing columns so I'm going to
try to bring up the little zoom here and
zoom all the way out and I will do
likewise on the hd2 and let's zoom into
this column of text here so I'm going to
double tap okay it wraps it nicely and
double tap over here a little bit slower
let's double tap again and it zoomed out
not quite not quite correct there and
we'll have to try this with other
websites too to see if it works let's
zoom all the way out and check screen
rotation speed that's always important
both of these devices obviously have an
accelerometer so we're going to try to
do this at the same time one two three
so the hd2 was slower there and let's do
it the other way both of these screens
are very very nice by the way and the
nexus one was definitely faster though
perhaps I didn't turn the screen enough
on the hd2 let's go to another site
let's go to TechnoBuffalo calm now all
right and on three one two three here
they go nexus one is off to a fast start
hd2 is not too far behind nexus one beat
vhd too okay so that time was about five
seconds faster not as slow as the
previous page load and of course these
devices aren't loading loading the flash
video we can zoom in multi-touch here or
to double double tap to get closer in on
the screen let's see how they do with
screen rotation ok so the nexus one was
once again a little bit faster than the
hd2 looks like it just went into standby
let's bring it back here
alright let's stay in landscape and open
up a new tab let's say we want to browse
to another website on the nexus one we
tap on the menu button here and then we
go to windows and we press new window
here and let's go to amazon.com get the
nice large on-screen keyboard and we'll
do the same thing with the hd2 will open
up a new window and we'll see how fast
that goes we're going to press one here
new tab they call it a tab and let's go
to Amazon ok and I'm going to tap on
both of these and we'll see how fast
they they go one two three go all right
and it looks like we're getting actually
a mobile version here on the on the
nexus one which is ok and I can see says
get the amazon app for android there is
no amazon app yet for windows mobile but
there is for android and iphone and
other operating systems let's see how it
easy it is to pan between two different
open web sites it's going to try to tap
on the menu button here on the nexus one
let's go into portrait maybe that'll
make it work a little bit easier so ok
so we got the little window selector
here we can tap on windows and we can
quickly switch back to technobuffalo and
over here we tap on the little too icon
and we're back so really easy way to do
kind of multiple tabbed browsing let's
go to one more website and see how it
renders that ok let's go to engadget.com
this time and i have it loaded there and
all right here we go one two three go
looks like the nexus one is probably
going to win this time again
okay the nexus one is finished let's
wait for the hd2 to finish okay an hd2
finished about four seconds behind so
we've got both devices although this
starts with this this area kind of
expanded which is kind of strange we can
flick through both of them let's see how
fast they scroll down pretty smooth both
of them are smooth it looks like the
nexus one is a little bit more movement
when you flick rather than the hd2 and
that may be good or bad for you and
we'll go into landscape let's sort of
get to the same area so that we can see
the same place okay here we are and
let's go into landscape one two three at
that time they were very close to each
other and now we are in landscape of
course although I may have tapped on
something actually there I am so overall
both of these devices have a really
great internet experience and they both
have pros and cons the hd2 has the pinch
to zoom which is very helpful in sort of
getting close to a subject or a body of
text it also has this much larger screen
and a more full screen view than the
nexus one that said the nexus one has
the AMOLED screen which makes everything
really pop even looking at this picture
together you can see how the flesh of
this person here looks much more lively
than it does up here the his suit is
very black up here it's kind of grey the
amyloid screen really helps and also the
nexus one is several seconds faster in
loading all sorts of web pages so
they're both very capable but it
definitely looks like the nexus one has
the superior web experience compared to
the hd2 that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
