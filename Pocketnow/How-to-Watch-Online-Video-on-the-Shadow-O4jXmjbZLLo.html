and I am excited to show you a solution
for actually viewing online video on
your tmobile shadows of them so if you
go to all shadow calm and download the
these two files flash video bundle or
the core pocket media players for
smartphones make sure you have released
client one first things first install
the smartphone software for the core
pocket media player install to the
device or if you choose to install it to
the storage card be sure that you also
installed the video flash video bundle
to the same location so we have this
installed nano and it was successful
okay let ignore that and then go back to
our file explorer and install the next
file a flash video bundle and select
that
okay that was successfully installed
let's install the flash video bundle and
we're going to install this to the
device just like we installed the core
pocket media player again if you intrude
if you chose to install it's the storage
card and make sure you install the video
bundled error as well okay the message
that this was successfully installed all
right so now we're going to actually go
to the Internet however what this did
was it installed several things on your
device you have the core pocket media
player will make which will make it
possible to walk all kinds of different
file formats on your device a little
hard to see here because there's nothing
on the screen bag they also installed
video sites into your file explorer that
are your programs that you can access
for the start there go ahead select that
it opens up the page and internet
explorer and you can see it has YouTube
Google vo as various different websites
on here it also includes some adult
websites that you can visit instructions
on how to remove that from this screen
on all shadowkhan so we're just going to
go to youtube and they have quick links
through squeezer and mobile leaf so if
you don't want to view the full site
from pocket interest for Nexo want to
see the smaller one you can do that that
we're just going to go down here and see
what we can grab just going to do a
search here real quick
see if we can find an all shadow com
video on youtube so you can actually
view the larger file sizes over a wire
over the included t mobile internet
connection might not be fast enough here
we go exclusive unboxing of the t-mobile
shadow now that's selected and click
this and you can see it here it asks if
I want to play the video save the video
or go to the link to page so since we're
on Wi-Fi here I'm just going to say play
the video device does a little bit of
thinking and immediately the video
starts playing amazing for martial arts
honest now this whole thing about this
is that you can actually go for a screen
just push this Center selects and their
cause and press it again in the coastal
screen so cool thing about this is is
that this solution enables us to watch
video on all the almost every online
video website out there unlike our
iPhone brothers that can only watch
youtube videos this allows us to watch
vo google and so on so be sure to go to
all shadow calm and download those files
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
