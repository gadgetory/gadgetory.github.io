having to deal with more and more on our
smartphones I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and here are a few ways you can free up
storage space on your Android phone
after the first boot when you boot your
Android device for the very first time
you are taken to a relatively simple and
quick setup process once you get through
that the floodgates are open for
personalization and customization but
over the last few years two things have
happened the Android operating system
has grown nearly tripling in size custom
strains of Android such as TouchWiz and
since or up to five times larger than
that in fact TouchWiz atop 4.2.2 on the
Galaxy s4 was found to be 1.5 gigabytes
in size versus the 328 megabyte stock
4.2.2 image on the Nexus 4 the problem
is built-in storage has only slightly
increased two years ago two gigabytes
and four gigabytes was all some phones
had inside now 16 gigabytes is standard
but many manufacturers have decided to
move away from expandable storage
meaning those 16 gigabytes are more
important than ever yet manufacturers
continue to add more and more bloat to
their system images making storage space
a bit cramped for anyone who loves to
store content apps games movies music
podcasts and pictures fortunately there
are some things you can do to free up
space after your first boot mini phones
come with samples in the form of
high-res pictures and possibly a video
to show off how great the display is I'm
not talking about wallpapers either but
pictures that are preloaded in the
gallery application most of the time
these are easily removed long press
select all and delete just in case I
ever need them again though I generally
send them to Dropbox first demonstration
videos can be removed just as easily
these won't save a whole lot of storage
space but every bit counts especially if
you're never going to use any of the
pictures of videos chances are you won't
some devices also come with
documentation how-to guides and other
information stored on PDF files like the
pictures is not a bad idea to send those
to the cloud and free up onboard storage
a lot of the Android devices these days
come with a horde of pre-loaded
applications or bloatware these come
from both the carrier and the
manufacturer
some of these pre-loaded applications
overlap built-in apps or services making
things a bit redundant depending on
carrier and manufacturer preferences
however some preinstalled applications
can be removed simply navigate to
application manager in the Settings app
locate the application you want to
remove and hit the uninstall button you
may notice that when you hit the
uninstall button on some applications
they still appear to be on the device
what this means is the application
itself wasn't uninstalled but the last
update was unfortunately not all these
applications can be removed without
gaining root access in my last video I
explained that with root you can use an
application called titanium backup to
remove pre installed applications that
couldn't otherwise be removed but since
not everyone is quite so gung-ho about
rooting their device the best thing you
can do in this situation is disable the
application once again navigate to
application manager locate the
application and hit the disable button
well it doesn't free up storage it
prevents the application from running
and likewise prevents it from accruing
any more data in the background a
precautionary measure if you will some
phones come with desktop software
install files on the internal storage
when you plug the device into a PC the
file will run and install sync software
on your computer you can simply move
this file over to your computer if you
don't want to delete it or install it
first then delete chances are the
software is available for download
online and it's probably a newer version
anyway by leaving on your device it's
just another one of the hundreds of
random unused files taking up space
another option to try and save space is
to uncheck the Google restore option
after logging into your primary Google
account by default assuming the
manufacturer or carrier didn't disable
the restore process Google will load all
the applications you had installed on
your last android device automatically
over time it's very likely that you
acquired a handful of applications that
you only used once if ever by disabling
this sure you will have to download
every application manually but you can
pick and choose what you have on the
device if you already let the restore
process run however you can simply go
through your applications and remove any
restored apps that you don't think
you'll need there are a ton of ways you
can save storage space through learning
new habits for instance you can set up
an automatic upload of
pictures on your device to a cloud
account so you can free up onboard
storage or you can simply get into the
habit of deleting anything and
everything as soon as you're done with
it like apps and games
sadly until 32 gigabytes of inbuilt
storage becomes the standard low device
storage will be a constant battle we all
have to fight so that's all for now if
