could soon decide the fate of the 18
teen time warner acquisition google
pulls YouTube off of Amazon devices
again will the Huawei P 11 have a 40
mega pickle triple rear camera and we've
got the full scoop on the qual comes on
qual combs upcoming snapdragon 845
chipset we've got a lot to talk about so
make sure you're charged and ready for
episode 2 8 2 of the pocket noun weekly
recorded December 8 that noon pacific
this weekly podcast is where we dissect
and discuss those gadgets that make our
lives mobile smartphones tablets and
wearables it's all the stuff you wished
existed when you were a kid and business
news like corporate acquisitions were
super boring I'm Juan Carlos bag now
senior editor pocketnow.com joined as
always by plucky podcast producer mr.
Jules Wong on the East Coast how's it
going buddy boy well I guess if I were
20 years younger I would have I would
have treated many travelbee with the
same kind of weights I and and yet I
kind of feel like it's those younger
members of our audience and younger
generation that are probably way more
tuned in and tapped into this kind of
stuff today than I was when I was their
age we are driving the conversation and
like all the sites that they go to or
telling them hang this is bad I got them
to sign up to call their Congress people
and just getting riled up so I mean it's
an issue in this development of what we
call the World Wide Web it's kind of
important
hello we've spent some time talking
about it I also just recently um I
guessed it on Adam Dowd it's a podcast
tech beard
we had a he produced a whole episode on
net neutrality and then a friend of mine
snaked my delegate position I actually
put in my paperwork to be a Bernie
delegate for the 2016 election but I'm
friends with mr. Dan Gordon
I just recently shared on my Facebook
page a video he produced on net
neutrality we're coming up on that vote
and we're not going to dedicate time in
this episode to talking about it we've
like I said we've covered it in past
podcasts but definitely the votes coming
up next week
maybe we'll talk about next week but
until though I wanna hear comes out
definitely oh yeah definitely
we'll talk about its with you the viewer
the listener that is participating in
this show today we're live right now at
3 p.m. Eastern and if you want to get in
on the conversation that we're having
today just go to Twitter and hit up and
weekly and you'll be able to find all
the comments there going around what
we're talking about got a whole slate of
topics including Qualcomm that's gonna
be interesting
we're talking about the next flagships
for 2018 and even part of 2019 too so
let's move on over to the emails too we
also have that I forgot about and when
it comes to those you can send them
along and talk to us that way too we
view a mailbag episode every end of the
month and to get to our email you can do
so at podcast of pocketnow.com so
podcast upon it now calm
hashtag P and weekly apparently to my
live audience it sounds like I'm a
little bit lower today I'm a very very
deepening I think I've actually taken
like a Lauzon or something to make this
happen well I mean you just got that new
super bass e Mike you know the music
make me sound good filter on your audio
recording gear right apparently it's
just one magic button all this time that
was our problem you just needed the
magic sound good filter and now
everything is perfect and now it sounds
like mr. robot yay
and we just got a tweet using the PN
weekly hashtag from Andrew Wallace Wow
plot twist Jules your voice is super
deep today I'm gonna be a little
scratchy voice today because my in the
valley were still were well surrounded
by all the fact fires all the smoke yeah
yeah that was pretty amazing yeah it was
pretty I think it's this mic is also on
me the
that the latency or the the speed of
which I'm talking is going to be pretty
slow today yeah again it's well we
finally got you upgraded on a better
recording equipment but apparently just
like anything else audio related to our
show Google Hangouts is gonna flip out
so let's jump into some news that's
actually kick this puppy off and see I
see what we've got to talk about this
week let's see if we can make this
bearable here for the week of December 3
2017 this is all the news that is fit to
podcast maybe I should compensate by
going up a little bit the dates for the
tryout nabina the trial against AT&amp;amp;T has
been set the Justice Department will
make its antitrust case against the
telecom on March 19 over concerns an
eighty five billion dollar acquisition
of Time Warner would hurt the content
and distribution market places in the US
Time Warner owned CNN has been a
contentious piece in this matter as
president Trump has criticized its fake
news coverage throughout his campaign it
was also supposedly a marketing ship
behind the scenes as the Justice
Department was trying to rein in some
scrutiny on the deal 300 units of the
LGV thirty
signature edition are on sale in Korea
for a whopping eighteen hundred dollars
equivalent u.s. the phone takes off from
the glossy finish of the regular v30
with ceramic and bumps up the memory to
six gigabytes of RAM in 256 gigabytes of
storage
the HTC harmony device that has been in
the rumor mill for some time is being
reported out by Evan Blass HTC you 11
eyes that's a ye s the 2014 HTC Desire
iPhone the first in its portfolio was
one that put an emphasis on selfies it's
not clear if we'll see this carry the
same weight and we might say this in the
same time frame that the HTC u ultra
came in this year that would be early in
the year the Huawei PCE is also being
reported out by blasts
to bring about three rear cameras with
24 megapixel selfies five times hybrid
zoom and 40 mega pixel pictures all of
this in conjunction with like a
technology we'll get into more of that
in just a little bit the galaxy X 9
according to an inside source at Samsung
will not be making an appearance at CES
2018 it had been rumored for a while
this is in contention with a whole other
slew of announcements expected from
Huawei and from Lenovo as well so there
could have been some smarting pressure
apparently some design issues with the
fingerprint sensor could still be
holding back the actual showcase of the
design of the film Google is pulling off
YouTube from all of amazon's devices
including the echo show and the fire TV
over retaliation that's the Amazon isn't
back of selling nest products as well as
delivering on its prime video service on
Google's services co-founder of vine at
Don Hoffman is also now tweeting about a
new vine the six-second social video
sharing service was killed off earlier
this year by Twitter which had acquired
it in 2013
there's talk now that this side project
of Hoffman is gonna be coming soon so
with all that going about so let's
starts with AT&amp;amp;T Time Warner and why
this has to go through because we're
talking about a content distributor AT&amp;amp;T
with its pipes wire lines and wireless
mediums and then there's Time Warner
with CNN Cartoon Network all the other
kinds of media channels that a provides
these are this would be a vertical
integration this ends be like half a
century or so since the government has
come down on a vertical integration like
this talk to me about what's going on
with the Trump factor here with CNN and
how this all relates yeah this has
definitely become one of the more
politicized stories involving major
corporations acquiring other major
corporations in part we just recently
saw the FCC Whittle back protections on
buying up media outlets this is a law
that's been on the books for 42 years as
to you know what policy and what what
media companies a single company can own
in any given area and it's interesting
that from a conservative standpoint
typically this kind of thing would be
supported but it's been caught up in in
a lot of presidential news Donald Trump
regularly pointing to outlets like cen
CNN as fake news and so there is sort of
a mounting discussion on whether or not
the president's influence over this is
extending into the Department of Justice
so I when we're talking about manure
concerned about media conglomerates
becoming bigger media conglomerates I
think there are a number of people who
were concerned about 18t blurring lines
between a telecommunication service and
an information service by providing both
the pipes to content and the content
that is supposed to flow on those pipes
but right now it seems like this this
merger could be held up so long as
there's some stipulation that AT&amp;amp;T or
Time Warner's sell off CNN before
dumping their catalog on AT&amp;amp;T s network
yeah so with all those considerations
Fox might want to consider buying it and
we know that Rupert Murdoch has been
wanting to continue to bolster his media
properties around the world including in
Australia and but in especially this
case here we're right wake bring
supporter ever since the Reagan days and
now it's just you
he's been shifting around a whole bunch
of other opportunities with his
cinematic properties of 21st Century Fox
trying to make sure that
you know there's a talk that Disney
might be able to buy a property such as
x-men and all the other studios and
cameras and equipment like that
so lots of agendas swirling around here
I just want to hand this quickly so that
we knew what was going on with yes I'm
sure this is also gonna be a story that
we continue to see evolve I mean you're
you bringing up Disney and Fox main I
think that's a perfect example of just
how many mega IPs are being you know
sort of a hot potato to around from
company to company and it seems like at
least as it pertains to 18 T's
involvement with Time Warner that we
should be getting I think it's some sort
of summary or final judgment March of
next year so it we're in a we're in a
period now of I think more debate and
people joining the public conversation
how how we're going to handle sort of
future acquisitions like this but at
some point they're eventually just gonna
have to say this is the answer yes or no
and we'll see if 18 T and Time Warner
are able to satisfy the current
administration that comes down in March
all this comes to a point where we've
been seeing unlimited data come into
play at the carriers and faster network
technology has come in and they want a
site like that they have been with cable
channels they just want to load in as
much media as possible gobbling all all
these properties so um yeah this this
has end in packs for every single person
that has a cell phone out there so we
have lots of time to go through that
again March 19 is when the trial starts
and we don't expect that to end until
maybe May or so and 18 to time order or
to deal though they'll stick it out even
with like a 500 million dollar fee if
like if the deal doesn't get closed at
the state but right you know I got half
a billion dollars to multi-billion
dollar companies I mean that that's
that's not even like a blink they're not
gonna be do said about that but you know
it's more fun than this time war
acquisition is talking about a phone
that is amazing for consuming content
and one that I think is it's an
interesting move this is something that
I've actually I've actually wanted to
see more companies doing is putting
syrup and addition no nuts ceramic I
mean that's paramah kliebert why not
have a limited edition version of a
phone I mean we've seen it occasionally
like Olympics editions or the the Batman
version of the galaxy s7 I think this
kind of stuff is fun and if any company
were to gonna we're going to shake up
the look of their products
I think LG is definitely in line for
doing something outlandish you know even
if it's just to garner some headlines we
always talk about these OEMs of what
kind of audience they wanted Taylor
oneplus has always been catering to the
tech enthusiasts and that we've kind of
been stuck in that red they've been
trying to transition out of that for a
while whereas mainstream LG Samsung
Apple they have they're kind of main me
matei toes that they can set out there
for the masses and then for their side
interests Apple has product red Samsung
of course those media franchises and
here LG just wants to treat it super
fans I'm not sure if they could have
done anything a little bit different to
spice it up with a media franchise on a
cause or something like that but just
this 300 units Korea they're home home
markets and $1,800 for I would say
marginal improvements with the six gigs
of RAM and 256 gigabytes of storage I
mean that's kind of just kind of $100
kind of a great deal that's you would
wants anyway this also falls in line
though with the same argument that
essential was trying to make you know
building a phone out of a more expensive
material isn't something that I think
general consumers really gravitate
towards it seems many people are fine
buying brittle glass on the back of
their phones and not engaging in any
kind of different conversation or acting
get some kind of downgrade if your phone
is made out of something not shiny and
flashy right you know like Kevlar would
be a premium material carbon fiber would
be a premium material to build your
phone with but you can't really have
that conversation on a flagship because
then everyone gets their undies in a
twist this this is I think exactly the
right way to do it you have a limited
set of devices 300 devices manufacturing
and machining only 300 phones to be put
out as premium you know that also
affects the price but you're not doing
this because it's you're trying to get
your bang for but you're doing this
because it's supposed to be exclusive
and something kind of gaudy or something
kind of extreme for that commentary you
pull out your phone is this is a $2,000
smartphones because really you do at
least get some marginal speck bumps this
isn't like a virtue where they use a
Qualcomm 400 series processor but they
cover it in Swarovski crystals
this is actual you know an actual
durability upgrade an actual premium
material upgrade a couple little speck
bumps but you get the conversation topic
you get the conversation point of saying
your phone is super exclusive so it's
not I I don't think this is the same
argument that we would make with a
Galaxy Note 8 being almost $1000 or an
iPhone 10 being over $1000 in many
markets this is a completely different
animal this is a this is trying to do
none of this of what virtu used to do
back in the day this is the animal that
screaming help LG mobile get out of its
deficits is one thing but to each their
own does the same thing with Porsche
design right the porsche design phones
you like like doesn't mean to be made by
releasing an ultra premium variant which
doesn't make general consumers feel like
they got shafted right well you know
delicate balance to walk there there's a
whole weights to it there's the biggest
Porsche design it's an it
they're known for designing their cars
to be streamlined and we yet
sassy enough to bring the personality
when you're going from zero to sixty and
there's Pantone - they are supposed to
know all the colors in the world and
even make up new ones when you think
that they've got like the last the
billion dfq that they have out there
they have purple as their color of the
year this year I hope they have a purple
phone out Huawei hello and this you know
I feel I could have used a little bit
more firepower or if not just yes III
think this is actually the right way to
play it I think you know trying to make
people feel like their regular phones
are somehow less desirable is a huge
mistake especially for a company in LG's
position right now you come out with
something ridiculously over-the-top and
then you you batter people with
advertising on that that would be a huge
misstep so I think this it's quiet its
subtle its refined its sophisticated
it's the LG signature edition limited
edition phone and it's not so much
better or so much different than the
standard phone that the people who own V
30s or g6 is aren't gonna feel like oh
well now you're just making an obscene
cash grab and making my phone worse just
so you can put out this better phone for
rich people this actually goes to a
comment in the in the from Twitter using
the PA and weekly hash tag from at fat
produce you think LG is maybe testing
the waters of different materials and
losing as little investment as possible
with this move so maybe a future
v-series phone might be made out of
ceramic instead of glass but this is how
you start that machining and
manufacturing process you'd kind of dip
your toe in the water you see what
people are willing to pay for it and
then you also get the experience of
working with this material again I think
this is the right way to do something
silly and outlandish well I want to I've
been bringing up huawei and speaking of
silly and ridiculous and outlandish
um yeah three cameras 40 megapixels
print what I you know and and we're all
over the place on this story we there
there are several different theories
hypotheses as to what Huawei might be
doing with this kind of marketing here
saying you get a forty megapixel image
doesn't necessarily mean that it's
coming from a forty megapixel camera
yeah because we've done this before with
ace deuce and oneplus pixel compositing
from even just one camera numerous
phones will will do this like super
scaling right exactly so what I'd be
curious to see is if we get a triple
sensor rear back phone what the
relationship between those sensors will
be and I'm willing to bet that there is
probably gonna be a matched twelve and
twenty similar to the to the current
kwame Leica cameras that we have now and
then some kind of different focal
lengths if they go ultra wide or if they
go with the zoom sensor but that all
three of these cameras would work
together so I could imagine so imagine
that is always language right there
totally so imagine imagine a huawei with
an ultra wide maybe even if it's just
like an 8 megapixel ultra wide camera
sensor but the image detailing is
composited with the normal focal length
so that the center of your ultra wide
sensor of your ultra wide shot is super
super clear you know very very detailed
very crispy that's something that Huawei
already does a very good job with in
enhancing clarity texture contrast
that's what those two cameras work well
together or by contrast let's say you
had a zoom sensor as that third camera
sensor you could still draw on the depth
information and the clarity and detail
information for low-light shots so you
wouldn't sacrifice that performance like
you do on an iPhone or a galaxy with
that zoom sensor where they don't even
use the zoom sensor when you're trying
to shoot at night with that smaller
sensor they just give up they they just
go back to the main camera sensor so I
did see some potential for for some
flexibility in that system and then it's
all just an exercise in computational
photography and computational
post-processing to merge the output from
these three different sensors so that
you get something really interesting in
that like a price processing which you
know an association with like I know
they're they're not the ones that are
doing all the the maths to make this
happen but this is probably as high-tech
as like a gets around these parts
because they're more known for B's
individually for these old-school kind
of things and that kind of brings me to
what I'm preemptively disappointed about
which is the the lack of 3d scanning
that pets that we might do on the rear
camera if we're going to go into the
augmented reality or virtual reality age
going forward and you just want to see
that and I know that what he's been
gunning for Samsung and Apple for this
front and I feel like this was a missed
opportunity for them at least well
potentially see this is also where we've
got to start playing with if we're
playing the 2018 roadmap game you're not
wrong on this on the face of it because
I I seriously doubt any phone company is
going to be delivering tango great
hardware in any significant way but what
we know from a our kit and a our core
this is something that we're fairly
confident Huawei is looking to add to
their neural processing chip
capabilities in the future where they're
gonna instead of trying to get
developers to code things specifically
for their their separate processing unit
they're NPU they're looking at making
the MP you do all the heavy lifting for
this AR core style computational
processing so if you had a triple camera
setup you would at least be able to feed
the NPU depth information which could
then the NP you could do the translation
into the software for a our core and
then you could end up with a nicer
overall augmented reality result then if
you just had one single camera it I mean
I am completely speculating there
but it would make sense to me that
Huawei's position moving forward here
would be how can we feed as much good
raw data from imaging sensors into
something that can then translate and
make sense of that especially playing
with the may 10 pro camera it is stupid
fast at recognizing your subject I this
this this is a functional benefit of
having a separate processing unit doing
your thinking for you so you hold up
your camera you look at a flower through
your camera almost instantaneously the
the phone goes oh that's a flower and
it's already making adjustments to your
image capturing and to what the image
processing is gonna look like once it's
produced to the shot for that flower
it's really compelling so a next-gen
system triple camera fed into an AR core
setup that could be a good step forward
for augmented reality
well one bit of genocide quality always
here to hear from you about the camera
product is the green that you put in
there that makes it more cinematic or
just in enhances mood a little bit I'm
wondering if texture texture of and I'm
wondering how that might play into
things because when it comes especially
to edges that can get a little bit
tricky and I mean they want to play
around with that and you know add it in
afterwards and just go for the clearest
kind of optics that you can it's all
those and cons I mean you're not wrong
there and and when you shoot full auto
on the may 10 I think that they've
scaled up their noise reduction in a way
that can look really plasticky and you
see it you'll see that in if you use the
depth of field mode the bouquet blur
background mode on a hallway now that is
significantly more processed but you can
really use it into in much lower light
conditions than you can Apple or Samsung
it's always going to be a balance and a
trade-off but one of the things that
while we might be able to benefit from
since I doubt anyone's going to be going
to a 2/3 inch or
inch sensor like we had on the the Lumia
1020 a much bigger surface area to soak
up light instead having three smaller
sensors if you can combine the output in
a meaningful way from all three you're
making up the difference in terms of
physics you are acquiring more light per
capture to do that so again there's
going to be a compromise and how the
stitched together and how that image
data is merged but there's potential
there and if any company I think can do
that in an interesting way I think it's
Huawei right now I think they're well
ahead of the curve on multiple image
sensor computational photography now
when this is on Huawei and in the
meantime I want to introduce this next
topic here by being the fuddy-duddy of
the group in saying that I don't really
watch TV I I don't understand how people
don't get it get into live tea I
understand that they don't have the time
for the whole scheduling aspect of it
where you know this live event happens
and you get DVR and whatever there
whereas opposed actually Netflix as all
the content I want
Kulu to yeah sure but I just I don't
know like so I just make no time for for
a TV at all and just watch YouTube clips
two minutes three so you're welling all
the mean ecosystem if you see all the
meetings right yeah exactly
so five is that real is that really like
a thing amazon's ecosystem is a lot more
fleshed out and formidable than I would
have guessed I mean because we spend so
much time digging into smartphones so in
the smartphone ecosystems it's far more
likely that we're gonna encounter or or
need to add Apple TV or Google products
into the discussion so because I'm
tasked with reviewing a ton of Android
phones it kind of just makes sense for
me to stick with chromecast for example
as one of my primary TV distribution
methods but taking one step outside of
our
fandom our buh-ba-ba-bah bias when it
comes to what we need to talk about
Amazon is a really BFD I am shocked at
the adoption of fire products and Alexa
products and how people are genuinely
happy with those which makes stories
like this one all the more frustrating
when again major corporations are
playing gotcha with their customers to
leverage preferable business solutions
from other major corporations and this
isn't a situation of well I'm happy
Gogol's doing this because or I'm upset
for Amazon because I'm pissed with both
Google Emmas and ant and Amazon because
this is a terrible way to use your
customer base this is a stupid splash
this is a stupid splash fight in a
kiddie pool here and with the oh hey
you're not selling nest oh hey you're
not you're not doing the whole YouTube
interface right so that we can't show
ads and whatnot like those all those I
don't I don't because it's a really bad
look for two companies that have
consumer facing solutions that people
really enjoy you know I say to that the
echo show like even blackish air which
you know only has tens of thousands of
units out like I think the Verge's Casey
Newton had a point in that are someone
out there pardon me Casey but someone
but out there had a point that's the how
the echo show is putting out YouTube
they're doing it via web interface
they're cheating really and at that
point YouTube was like no you're not
allowed to do even that which is kind of
all right so you're blocking your
blocking access to to like that and
that's that's part of the terms of for
the terms of use and like what you're
breaking here well in the really cynical
part of me to is sort of acknowledged
the fact that Google doesn't seem to
have any significant designs for YouTube
it's just a place where tons of people
go but they're not really doing a very
good job of investing in that
infrastructure or finding better ways to
monetize that user base so it's kind of
a win-win for Google Google really does
seem to be focused on trying to be a
proper competitor to traditional cable
broadcast and outlets like Netflix and
Hulu like everything that we've seen
from them that were that has been a
significant step in improving content
catalog or distribution has been focused
on either YouTube bread or YouTube TV
not traditional YouTube YouTube
traditional YouTube is going through
this dearth of monetization problems and
community outreach problems and it's a
really bad look so because we know a ton
of people still traffic YouTube you can
hurt Amazon users by not letting them go
there but even if they don't go there
it's not really terrible because Google
is focused on growth in other areas
outside of user-generated video so again
if I'm playing the cynic it makes me
doubly upset if Google on this one
because of how they're sort of holding
us as hostage or ransom for Amazon to do
business the way that Google wants them
to and I'm not entirely thrilled with
Amazon right now either in terms of
those sort of global economy that we're
looking at but this is a fight where
basically no one wins all consumers will
pretty much lose regardless of who comes
out on top
Amazon I mean their scales are smaller
so I think that gives them someone in
the past whereas Google's pretty much
just the Internet's well Amazon's
distribution content services are
smaller but again we're watching Amazon
leverage brick-and-mortar again buying
out Whole Foods and they are a deciding
factor for a lot of consumers around the
world as to what products they buy even
just what products they have access to
so given a little time and some leverage
Amazon could make some preferred deals
that could also hurt
Google's distribution of services again
it's it's all it's all a bad look and
this is also why I feel like not not
that I feel like the government needs to
get involved but I think that there
should be some growing discussion on
these mega digital corporations and some
kind of examination for consumer
protection services or the FTC you know
I don't want write-ins again yeah yeah I
don't want to jump right into like
saying all we needs a vestige or we need
to break up the bells with Google and
Facebook but we need to examine these
business practices to see if they really
are in the consumers best interest to
have a consolidation of power with a
very few top players in each industry
this is coming from Peter hatin on
Twitter using the P n weekly hashtag it
really shouldn't matter which device we
invest in to watch these core services
because in the end all this will do is
hurt sales for both companies and we
would think so but we can't really make
these companies adjust their business
practices if there's no competition and
that's unfortunately where they're yeah
I mean like the only top competitors are
you know Microsoft isn't really super
relevant in this conversation Facebook
wouldn't watch all my content of them
you know now well I was gonna say vid me
but they shut my channel down so that's
no good
oh yeah they closed they closed up shop
too so again consumer generated video is
in a very very precarious state on the
internet if you're not supporting your
favorite producers he's getting of
consumer generated video are you excited
am i are you excited about mine i I
don't know that I could physically care
less a very good know that it's possible
I am I just the fact that I'm aware of
someone talking about vine again has
driven me even more negative caring than
I thought I could achieve before so
linked off of the last story here are
the the content because we've been
talking about these content work we are
content distributors talking about I
mean most of the reason that I directed
my rage a Google is because we're on the
platform right now and what better way
to poke the eyes then you just do that
but um we've seen a lot of these
so-called vine stars migrate over to you
to when you know their bread and butter
content was six seconds long and they
had to really adapt to figure out okay
are we really going to continue that or
is white will sustain stay nest in this
kind of stupid machine that has that
Google that you put oh this stupid
machine no I I was one year off in
calling the demise of fine I did a there
are these like conferences you can go to
and one is called a social media week
and I actually taught a workshop talking
about pre-production and someone like
super into the vine ecosystem was asking
me my thoughts on it and I you know I
being honest I don't think any any
platform that builds its core service on
basically just a single mechanic it can
be sustainable in the long term and I
think we've seen the same thing with
snapchat you know snapchat still exists
through a momentum of very passionate
and hardcore diehard users but every
other platform in social has replicated
what made snapchat initially compelling
especially the stories feature there's
even gonna be a Youtube version of this
so you can you can tell your quick pithy
little story videos share those in a in
YouTube's platform like I just recently
turned on the community tab on my
personal YouTube channel like you know
everyone's already building a story
function into their service so why do
you want to go to a solitary
distribution platform only to do that
one thing and vine is this and if I want
to shoot a six second video I have
numerous
places where I can already share that
with an audience that's engaged why do I
want to yet sign up for your snapchat
and Instagram audiences are really that
engaged or are you you're you you don't
have as you have the personal profiles
of each of each platform that you have
and then you have the content stuff and
sometimes you have to set up a because
you have it the fake insta
to kind of it's you can toy around with
all this stuff whereas vine you do it
for the vine and it's just like what
will star hip hop where it's like you do
it for the fame and that's all you do
that's all you focus on you know just oh
hey six second video of me talking to my
friends and they start you know doing
that I feel like this is more conducive
to just a agnostic of brand agnostic
social maybe I mean yeah I mean you're
not wrong it's just I I wonder what the
audience capacity will be for following
people on differing and smaller and less
impactful social networks going into the
future I kind of feel like that web 3.0
notion of social is already on the
decline and that we're looking for
what's going to be the hot new way to
interact or engage with the community um
but also we just got a tweet from Andrew
Wallace using the p-n weekly hashtag
doesn't vine have the same core problem
that snapchat has where any features
that they can make can be easily copied
by a competitor with a larger built-in
audience so I'm pretty confident if we
got a new vine it wouldn't be just the
same setup as the old vine but a new
startup right now trying to play with
social and trying to do stuff with media
and content distribution anything they
do if there's any spark of popularity in
it will instantly be ripped off by
Instagram Facebook YouTube snapchat
manure gonna see that immediately
carried right into platforms that are
already way better staffed funded and
have
much larger user bases well I mean yeah
there's only so much content that you
can share in just six seconds that
pretty much all the profitability that
you could bring from from big-time
publishers and it does end with that it
doesn't make it seem likely that YouTube
and snapchat and all the other built up
platforms would be more willing to go
back to what vine once was so in terms
of mmm if they're not gonna expend too
much effort on R&amp;amp;D on this then the big
players don't even have to look at this
world it's the freedom of whether or not
they want to expend R&amp;amp;D on this I just
don't think they can all this time
you're you're already started it's why
the former one of the former co-founders
in vine that's using his money to play
around right now so I mean if they find
some if he finds something then his best
hope is to build some little popularity
and then sell immediately if someone Oh
rusty Paul was all know when that
happened and then we saw that Scott
Rakowski of HQ and you know that that
was fun so a couple tweets I don't want
to get to before we hit the sponsor
break from Peter hatin do you think we
really need any more social networks
vines first failing says it all doesn't
it I'm all for competition but do we
really need this and to a point I mean
we don't really need any of the sort of
social fun features that we've got I
just think anything that's novel will be
swallowed up by a bigger player before
you can really leverage it to build an
audience
well Peter hate and I just think you're
hating on vine that's all guys that's a
name pun
and Peter also asked we saw a Ark or
brought up on stage with the May 10
announcement do you think that this
represents presents an opportunity for
Huawei to work closely with Google to
attempt to position more accurate
results from services like Google ends
and support VPS with future pixels um I
don't know how closely
I think Huawei still has there's just
that little bit of distance between
kwame and Google as we look at
especially as we look at like a North
American market but any kind of insight
on this I think Huawei has some really
cool tech to leverage that could make
the AR core discussion a lot more
interesting especially if Huawei can
utilize NPU for AR without having to
make other developers support the the
hardware that you can only find on one
line of phones so that that's a really
big if but it's a that I see that
there's a lot of potential for it and I
think that could be something really
interesting and even as Huawei tries to
go beyond its bounds and attaining that
number one global shipments spots in
China there's still number one and you
still need back-end services to help
things out these days with machine
learning and Wow there might be
something going on behind the scenes I
haven't seen that kind of one popular
app that has popped up or that one
popular service that has a come out of
there yet so so I would bother or or
whatever I'll be curious to see if like
if we can leverage something you know we
know like an ingress to is on the
horizon and that yeah if something like
that has a true a our core or a our kit
component to it if that helps further
the discussion on this but I want to
wrap up just this this little section
here I just can't wait for the anime
yeah this is from DMV listener 42 PN
weekly looking at nations like China
when it comes to censorship why would
more government intrusion in America's
Internet be good from what I see access
regulation is the reason why is P seemed
to be monopolistic so could more regular
regulations hurt the net and this is
when I do want to comment on just to
kind of drift into the net neutrality
discussion for just a second as I see
this brought up a lot and you'll see it
brought up a lot under the guise of a
discussion like I don't want the
government picking winners and losers so
first of all regulation needs to be
defined what are we talking about in
terms of regulations for example if you
do business with t-mobile with Verizon
with Sprint with US Cellular or any
other company other than AT&amp;amp;T proper
well the only reason you have that
competition is because of government
involvement when we had monopolistic
business practices through mom Paw Belle
so that's one aspect that's one very
real tangible benefit that government
intrusion can bring into a market if the
market is starting to become stagnant so
when we're talking about net neutrality
we're not talking about regulating
content on the Internet
that's not a part of the discussion it's
the the the discussion of net neutrality
really hinges on the definition of the
Internet do you consider it to be a
telecommunication service or do you
consider it to be an information service
and the reason why this is a difficult
conversation is because ISPs now now can
occupy both they are responsible for
getting you on to the Internet the
actual pipes the on-ramps that get you
onto the Internet and they fulfill
content they distribute content
information on the Internet so they can
blur the lines as to what it is that
they're actually doing the reason this
is different than Chinese censorship is
because net neutrality really has no
design / censoring websites and it
really has almost everything to do with
making sure your access to the Internet
is priced fairly in in a way that
resembles like water or power or
you know the telephone network I mean it
or if you're complaining about landline
telephones that would be a similar
complaint to title 2 regulation over
over the internet I guess the the
simpler because I hear the determine
winners and losers and who chooses them
whether it's the government I know it's
the ISPs that do so because if these
regulations are not in place they might
have the ISPs will choose what sites
it'll cost choose the levers that do so
and that you know in the end it should
be that's the traffic you know the
traffic is the passengers the viewers
everyone that is using the Internet turn
win who gets more popular and who gets
less so just to wrap up and team be
listener 42 and I really appreciate the
way that you phrased this question to
wrap up my feelings on the notion of
competition cuz obviously a lot of this
would be better if every municipality
every community had real choices for who
they wanted to do business with
so most markets you only have one player
in very few markets you'll have two or
three solutions for getting on the
internet and it's only in places where
you've got community funded broadband or
Google Google Fiber that you see real
competition where ISPs are actually
having to compete against a proper 21st
century Network so I agree that there is
too much regulation which prevents
competition but this is not regulation
at the federal level this is the laws
and the the zoning issues that companies
face at the city and state level we're a
major player a major ISP can go in can
influence smaller local city and state
politicians and get favorable
legislation to prevent them having to
compete so a Verizon can go into a town
and and help them write legislation
which prevents competition so if we're
looking at improving the situation for
competition we need to start from the
bottom up if we deregulate the market
now from the top down companies like
Verizon and
caste are already huge winners and are
already looking at buying up smaller
players you will have less competition
but the major tenants of net neutrality
don't necessarily directly influence
competition at the state and city level
so if we gut if we gut net neutrality
you will have less competition for
content and it will not address
competition for service and these
companies like I said I mentioned
earlier in the podcast these companies
already managed to help the FCC strike
down a law that would allow companies to
buy up more media outlets so you will
have more merging more conglomerates
more oligopolies you will have a chain
snowball effect a chain reaction of less
competition for service less competition
for content and everyone paying more
because there is less competition if you
want to fix competition you need to
start fighting at the local level you
need to start fighting at the state and
city level and if we could get to that
point I feel we could do a better job a
fulfilling free-market at the federal
level and backing off regulations from
the FCC but right now those regulations
at the FCC title to control over the
Internet calling it common carrier is
necessary to protect competition of
content and this is why this stuff gets
super heady because all that time I
spend explaining it someone else is
gonna walk around and go but I still
don't think government pick winners and
losers and that's bad and that's all
they have to know and then we've lost
the discussion that person is is is lost
in the discussion there they are a lost
cause to try and reach but it took me or
all of that time to untangle the issue
to properly explain what's actually
happening when we're talking about net
neutrality well I mean the simple way
that you could say it is government is
stopping the ISPs from choosing the
winners and losers so that you can
choose the winners and losers but I
think that's too soon government you'd
be picking winners and losers that's the
high speed god man is
bad is be people people I government to
pick you can see all of these stories in
full detail at pocketnow.com and look
for the podcast section to get to this
episode's rundown you can chat with us
about what you have been reading up on
with hashtag P and weekly also be sure
to check out Jaime Rivera
illy on our youtube channel even though
Jaime Rivera has been has not been I
think he has been I'm surprised he has
the time to be able to do so since he's
looking at the science I know his mobile
setup he's gonna call consonant yeah but
the Qualcomm text tell me is taking up a
bunch of his time we're gonna talk about
that in just a few minutes but first
this sponsor message and I'm really
excited about this sponsor this is this
is a new one for us I this is coming
from the author James Rollins and
they're promoting the new book the demon
crown from the number one New York Times
bestselling author James Rollins comes
the thrilling new novel the demon crown
often compared to Clive Cussler and
Michael Crichton
Rollins combines real science and
history with cutting-edge military
action off the coast of Brazil a team of
scientists discovers a horror like no
other an island where all life has been
eradicated consumed and possessed by a
species beyond imagination to save
mankind's future the members of Sigma
Force must make a devil's bargain and
join forces with their most hated enemy
even if it means sacrificing one of
their own it's a great place to join in
on the wildly successful Sigma 4 series
Rollins latest Sigma Force novel is one
of the best in the series the mix of
science history and high concept
adventure is always first-rate in a
Rollins novel says book lists and
publishers weekly calls it bone-chilling
so you can get started go check out
James Rollins comm where not only can
you get the full scoop on the Sigma 4
series his entire catalogue his library
of novels he's also got a ton of stuff
up there I went and checked it out
before we jumped into the show he's also
got a ton of stuff up audio clips video
clips and just other content that you
can download so
his books and surrounding his stories
it's pretty cool so once again go check
out James Rollins dot-com check out the
demon crown number one time number one
New York Times bestselling author James
Rollins and we thank them for supporting
we thank him for supporting the
PocketNow weekly thank you James you
really make a difference in their lives
all right um let's talk about Qualcomm
for a sec shall we yeah we should so
they had their big Tech Summit this week
and it was all in advancements of their
latest chipset the Snapdragon e45
obviously successor to the 8:35 we got
all these improved specs we also had
time for a couple of always connected
PCs but we'll get to those in just a
second so if we want to dive into this
mess we have its 2.8 gigahertz on the 4
power cores and the for efficiency
courses excuse me 2.6 a Hertz and the
for efficiency cause it's 1.8 blah blah
blah about GPUs and artificial
intelligence because there's there's
just a whole bunch of integration that I
have with the jargon all right so I
guess down here so more artificial
intelligence in graphics processing
thanks to arv our computational makovan
that is more integrated into the chipset
now which is the processing for your
current line of sights while decreasing
the processing power needed to produce
the rest of the image in your
environment I'm trying to wrap my brain
about how to explain it it's hard for me
and I can't explain things which is one
on this podcast alone we have better
color gamut we have a wider common color
gamut that can be supported now the REC
2020 which is way above DCI p3 that
everyone's making a big deal about X 20
LTE bringing us to 1.2 gigabits per
second per second on LT
connection really love that gigabit LTE
termed that they are keen on coining and
just that they have a dedicated secure
coprocessor as well because much more
importance as we've gone into mobile
payments and all these transactional
deals just by having the phone in
contact with something else so there's
that and just a whole bunch of other
stuffs too so um first impressions on
the chip before we move on to the wider
picture here well this is actually just
kind of helping us flesh out we we had a
discussion on this before talking about
the different aspects of the new chipset
and what we hope manufacturers will
really take advantage of it sounds like
cual comes on the right I think they're
they're on the right path with some of
the future consumer facing services the
AI services these neural learning
services and hopefully the what will
soon see rolling out you know
fifth-generation g 5g networks come on
sorry i lost my place in my notes and
then tried to dance back and it didn't
work at all
but but it's also what i'll be really
curious to see is what manufacturers
really start taking advantage of some of
this some of some of these benefits so
for example the isp on the Qualcomm 845
can capture 16 megapixel images up to 60
frames per second so that that could
technically mean bursts of like 5k video
if you wanted to jump in on that and the
same thing 480 frames per second 720p
video but do we really think that a
galaxy s 9 using a Qualcomm 845 is going
to do this when we haven't necessarily
seen Samsung for example take advantage
of everything the 835 could do and
that's where I get a little twitchy like
I think quoi comes offered up all the
right bits now it's who's actually going
to take advantage of it all who's really
gonna produce hardware and software that
will
use of all of this cool new tech or are
we just gonna see another year of phone
manufacturers kind of coasting on this
stuff because it's all good enough I
mean do you really want better slow
motion video probably not even though
all of us on the ground are saying yes
we do want better stuff and you've got
Apple out there doing some really crazy
cool things with their own in-house chip
development I mean let's not forget that
SOC stands for systems multiple systems
on a chip and that many manufacturers
don't even ought to turn a lot of those
those systems on that are on the
currents and previous chips so I mean I
want to go codec the the aptX
HD which allows you to stream multiple
different tracks of music on two
different Bluetooth speakers which you
know you could DJ a whole house if you
wanted to that'd be cool without having
to have a Smart Hub or whatever so but
you have to have the aptX HD codec
enabled and you also have to be working
with an 8:45 work board so it's these
kinds of proprietary things that and you
have to dig into them
it doesn't I mean in manufacturers might
not even often look into them anyway so
yeah cuz again I want to give Qualcomm
the thumbs-up here like I said I think
they're on the pulse I think these are
definitely the types of systems the type
of benefits and features that make a ton
of sense when you're looking at where
you think the future of consumer
computing is gonna go I think
qual comes on point but now we just need
to see what actual manufacturers do with
this tech once once it starts what start
shipping and speaking of this tech this
prior tech that we're talking about the
Snapdragon 835 we're seeing it being
repurposed for different uses such as
pcs were actually seeing the first
always connected pcs out
with ASUS and the Nova go and also HP
with the MVX - these are coming out
sometime within the next six months or
so and they're coming up with an
attorney 35 of course but always at the
LTE modem the x16 LTE which is on a 35
so that they're able to do connected
standby while the device is asleep
supposedly they've been hammering home
the battery life point because as we
know cell your operations do take quite
a bit of veggies to run and then there's
the the rest of the specs which they're
all right but the interesting part of
this is that what runs from full Windows
10 the I mean you can so that's the
thing is that their Windows 10s but
users are able to upgrade free to
Windows 10 Pro which you know comes to
the idea alright so what kind of
experience am I going to get if I do end
up upgrading to Windows 10 Pro it sounds
like that this is the 10s experience
which is app you know more Windows app
oriented as opposed to executable files
and all the other things so I mean first
take on that well I'd be really curious
I'll be really curious to see because I
mean we're talking you know what is it 4
gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of storage
for $5.99 8 gigabytes of RAM and 256
gigabytes of storage for $7.99 $7.99
ultra-low power of battery life focused
mobility player but I will still be very
curious to see how that you know this
chipset supports legacy x86 software
that to me becomes one of those big
discussion one of those big talking
point issues if the experience is kind
of painful then we're kind of all the
way back to where we were with netbooks
again as they're increasingly more
expensive
when so much else about this brings some
great benefit yeah over the whole LTE
connection is huge yeah at $7.99 am I
really getting a mobile road warrior
that can handle my IT departments custom
software for the Windows environment or
am i limited to you know like it can
kind of run this but it's gonna be
painful so you really just want to use
apps and if that's the case then this
this is a poor demonstration of what the
845 should be able to deliver well to be
fair I mean the whole bridge between arm
64 and x86 has been in the works for at
least a couple of years we've seen test
beds on the Snapdragon 820 that's not to
say that we'll get an automatic
improvement on the 8:35 just by having
more horsepower to it but it's just you
would hope that they got their emulation
layer down pat at this point well I mean
you would hope but again I the thing
that makes me nervous is while we would
hope we have that emulation emulation
down if we did why do we still see such
significant leverage on an app based
version of Windows 10 why have Windows
10 as if the emulation is good enough
just to deliver regular Windows 10
that's why I'm nervous I'm not I'm not
saying like they haven't done it it's
just I need to see I want to see and I'm
apprehensive about apps in their current
state if we're talking about emulation
but one of the other things that they
did show off we should probably talk
about this this HP Envy as another yeah
yes so it was the Asus no ago and the HP
Envy x2 which is the I mean I guess when
we're cutting our expectations because
the no video is a bonafide laptop even
though we you know you can swing around
full 360 degrees this is the HP Envy x2
which we got fewer details on it's more
it's more nebulous product at this point
scheduled for spring launch but it's
it's a tablet it's a convertible tablet
with a detachable keyboard and you would
hope you know we've seen
the market would share for this kind of
product for a while now so HP should be
able to make a decent keyboard and
decent tablet the unit
talking to more about the actual body
itself and less about the software and
yeah that's their want but in terms of
just being able to show it off if you
were like Qualcomm should have done a
better job of advent of reminding us
just how you know good it is and as
opposed to a twenty see what happens
with a thirty five let's see what
happens on this the updated and test ban
or on the HPE the H the the shots the HP
showing off I was really happy to see
because I kind of missed the idea of the
surface you remember there was a surface
pro and then there was the regular there
wasn't it wasn't regular what did they
call that like the surface it was three
yeah yeah it was just like the surface
three so having something in that space
so you'd have the surface laptop a
surface tablet and then the surface pro
which is a full-fledged computer in a
tablet I kind of like the idea of that
so if HP can pull it off
I think that could be pretty cool III
think that there's room in a market for
I mean if Apple can put out commercials
of kids using the iPad what's the
computer
I feel like Microsoft has a room here in
this market to also like make a
streamlined lean and mean maybe more app
focused machine but just so that
consumers understand that's what the
thing is
and if HP can deliver some really cool
hardware they're touting their
relationship with vno audio then that
could be really cool I think that could
be a good presentation of what a mobile
chipset could do for a more mainstream
computing environment so they're
threatening this feature as one of the
many ways they can deliver on output but
the rear-facing camera on this tablet 13
megapixels and they're intending
for VR a art related programming is that
is that going to tilt the edge on
anything are we going to be able to code
is there gonna be a our apps that we can
develop on the tablets yeah I guess
that's the question I mean even even if
there's just some a our consumption on
the tablet that I think could be a
positive benefit you think that a win at
this I know we're talking about wins and
losses here but do you think that would
be stolen I well yeah I think that would
still be a win right now I think AR and
VR are in danger of becoming the the
next generation of consumer buzz terms
like 3d TV and until we see compelling
hardware consumer desirable hardware and
services to really take advantage of
that hardware then this stuff has the
there's the danger the stuff withers on
the vine while we're all waiting I'm
gonna wait for it to get good and then
I'll buy in that's a bad place to be for
new tech right now no one wants to be
first
everyone slow playing they're their
consumer releases until they see more
adoption but there's not more adoption
because everyone's slow playing their
releases and a move like that where it
just becomes ubiquitous that you can
easily and affordably build this into
like I think Apple played the right move
the way that they they showed off a Ark
it
there wasn't an AR version of the iPhone
it's just built into the iPhone you
didn't really have a choice it's there
you can choose not to use it but
developers know that they have an
audience that they can reach out to
standardized hardware that they can
develop for this is where we need to go
so to see some of this gain a little bit
more traction in Windows Land because
think about just like the you know like
if we think they are compatible hardware
and software is lean in Android land
like there's none Microsoft aligned
moral items in Linux so you know
therefore makers and like the low end
like the low end Apple products are for
consumers it just feeds into this
narrative of yeah this is Windows are
for merits whereas apples for everyone
and the you know VR is kind of just made
into that kind of thing and doesn't in
that notion make it more imperative
that's the Snapdragon 805 being able to
process developing AR and VR apps I I
don't know that it makes it more
necessary but I don't think you will get
any AR apps for a Microsoft environment
unless there's hardware that can use it
and they don't have phones so you need
to put that hardware on something so
that's why I would still consider like
if HP came out with a tablet it's
running a Windows 10 S or you know you
can do a full Windows 10 on it but it's
got a are capable hardware that's the
first baby step in addressing a glaring
hole in microsoft's hololens and VR
strategy they're trying to do this mixed
reality thing which is good but it's
basically just VR plus it's not gonna
get us this AR stuff that is gonna come
to most of the Android ecosystem and all
of the future iPhones coming out and
that's a bad place for Microsoft to be
since they showed off the the most
interesting aspects of AR with hololens
like they've completely given up this
amazing advantage that they could have
had in the market and now they have to
play catch-up again and I'm not
surprised because it's Microsoft oh this
is probably the biggest pressed the
biggest press offensive that I've seen
from Qualcomm in promoting one of its
chips they had this huge conference in
Hawaii and basically paid for everyone
to ship them out there mr. Mobile
Michael Fisher was had top-rated
interview with a top rated top executive
for snapdragon business and there's just
a whole bunch of buzz and a whole bunch
of terms again the gigabyte LTE and the
SPU and
other words that just as the third the
Snapdragon 805 was the third-generation
AI related or AI driven chip that they
have implying that stay 35 in the 820
were designated the first and second gen
but that I mean I don't know is that
really like that would be retro actively
painting them as focused on AI when they
were still trying to recover from a
whole bunch of other things such as
overheating such as the basic operations
of a chipset that's supposed to drive
mobile applications without going
catching on fire
so I mean well and I think they've got I
think they've got other discussion
points below did our chipset catch you
no you're not wrong it's just I kind of
feel you know I'm sure companies are
looking at their products beyond just do
they explode no okay cool those were
distracting factors they have you know
and with Apple moving off of Qualcomm
they've been having their little spats
in court over modems and over power
management ships and with but that you
know that there and that and that's
where I think you're you're you're spot
on bringing this up like this is because
Qualcomm is trying to build more
mindshare around their involvement in
the mobile industry I think they're
trying to raise their own visibility
profile up for two reasons the first of
which we're talking about now in the
story with Apple trying to break away
from Qualcomm as much as they can power
management radios antennas LTE
capabilities going with any other vendor
that can potentially fulfill that as
Apple Inc welcome are still in court but
the second story that also ties into
this is the next one that we've got here
is the continued attempts at acquisition
from Broadcom and again I think if
Qualcomm has
is higher visibility there's more
business mind chair and a little bit
more consumer mind chair I think they've
got a better job playing defense against
Broadcom while they're going on offense
against Apple well it's just the fact
that Broadcom is still sitting still and
saying that we're gonna stay here at $70
per share which is their offer and no
more where many people who have been
holding on to Qualcomm for a long time
what at least $80 a share and this this
public announcement that they had this
campaign on multiple transit systems on
billboards everywhere that was like
we're the reason why you love taking
pictures so much and all these esoteric
kind of things and every ten point four
seconds this happens this is why your
grandma calls you or something like then
it's just you know text on text on
gradient or something and then this is
all in a bid to just say there's a
reason that we're still around and and
or that they have over the industry and
kind of the helplessness that there with
Broadcom taking over whether they get
their offer or not it just it boggles
the mind to think that's that this is
kind of a stand of some sorts well about
way I mean because you summing up all of
all of this these sort of shenanigans
it's roundabout way of saying that
Broadcom is is kind of making a play at
a hostile takeover by setting the the
pricing on on the stock the way that
they have and then by not really
negotiating what what this acquisition
would look like well the news is that
yeah they're they're nominating their
own board of directors for Qualcomm and
shareholders will get to decide during
the next annual shareholders meeting and
like March or April or something so
that's that's the choice they have right
there
but I'm not sure how much this will play
into it and especially with that there's
also a pending acquisition of Qualcomm
taking over NXP Semiconductors for like
30 billion dollars and even that's not
supposed to make any difference at all
so so I I think I think it's just
getting back to the original point that
you were making is we we looked at their
their continuing shenanigans with Apple
and they're continuing shenanigans with
Broadcom it makes a lot of sense to me
that they would be trying to get out
ahead of the discussion raise their
visibility do more outreach and more
involvement with what products and
services they actually offer and how
that influences the things that
consumers buy so flying a bunch of tech
bloggers out for some extra coverage
makes a lot of sense from that business
perspective if you want to make the
claim that your stock is worth more
during this this kind of hostile action
from Broadcom you can demonstrate that
look at the coverage that we got look at
what people are talking about look at
how we influence the market and this is
why we're worth more that to me makes a
lot of PR sense like that's PR savvy as
far as I'm concerned mmhmm yeah yeah I'm
gay I mean uh I'm guessing that the
payoff will be when things actually get
into motion with integration at the OEM
level and just how many of these
features will get put out there and if
these things get really popular in the
end because smart speakers they're still
going up in the you know holiday gift
guides they're gonna get they're getting
more popular wearables less so although
it's I mean Apple watch is kind of its
own isolated area and you were just
wondering where Qualcomm can fit itself
into the specific narratives
so that's just my event so I mean you
know you can definitely catch the rest
of our coverage on that and I would also
recommend hitting up the the pocket now
Instagram talk about Instagram yeah look
at the coverage that jerk went to Hawaii
I want to cover one more viewer comment
here live this is coming from Peter
hatin guessing this is relevant now what
do you think of this sudden announcement
just a stir after we've seen the launch
of the always connected PC which brings
more full Windows apps and what he's
linked to is your story Jules about
Google killing Chrome apps so I you know
for those of you who use the Chrome web
browser that you could get these sort of
built-in applications it was sort of I
think it was an attempt at Google's part
to make Chrome OS that worked with in OS
10 or Windows and you could use these
little applets within your browser but
it looks like that's gonna go away and
these are separate stories I think
because first of all Google first
announced that Chrome apps were gonna
die for non chrome OS platforms last
year so this was then was coming it was
just the fact that the App Store
actually closed down and right just
what's weak so that's what's condoling
it's just the timing on this is lining
right up with Microsoft actually trying
to make a bigger play for mobility with
Windows 10 s and partnering with mobile
chipset makers and with yeah they want
to turn the web into more more like
applets they're calling them progressive
web apps and it's not just Google it's
the other browser makers too and they're
just trying to make sure that you know
we've come to use the phone as our main
conduits for the Internet these days and
they just want to be a little bit more
friendly for mobile beyond what's been
provided with html5 and like adaptive
there you go the only thing that kind of
makes me sad is I was really hoping to
see back in Windows 8 days if you loaded
the Developer Preview of Chrome it was
essentially a nearly fully complete
version of Chrome OS I was kind of
hoping to see them continue doing that
especially now that Android apps are
becoming compatible with Chromebooks
this is think about it like you load the
Chrome web browser and you have a nearly
perfect emulation space to run Android
apps in that space could have been a
really interesting way to fight
Microsoft a Trojan horse literally build
a Trojan horse for Google services and
products right into that operating
system but this is also why I think this
is so interesting is because Microsoft's
making this mobility play Windows 10s
does not have the app ecosystem that
Android does and Chrome s Chrome OS is
quickly adopting that so conceivably on
a chrome OS notebook for example I could
use my favorite Microsoft services I
could write my script in Microsoft Word
because there's a great app for that I
could do all of my audio recording in
what does that I use tape machine is one
of the apps that I use in Android do all
my cutting splice and get that all set
shoot all of the the footage from a
phone import it directly into that
Chrome OS into the Chromebook and then
use something like PowerDirector on my
laptop screen to assemble the video put
it all together output it in 4k and
upload it directly to YouTube and I'm
not entirely sure
I could do the same thing in Windows 10
s that's fair although you could do the
same thing to the T with an Android
phone as I'm saying is like saying from
Microsoft's perspective Windows 10 S
brings the streamlined more efficient
you're not having to support legacy
software idea but at the same time even
though we're losing Chrome apps outside
of Chrome OS Android apps have gotten
pretty good like I think Apple was too
early in calling the iPad pro a pro
we just didn't have the software people
weren't really utilizing apps to fulfill
more mainstream mainstream computing
program solutions but we're getting
pretty close now
oh yeah it's Android apps are getting
better which you know leads to more of
the question of what is the purpose of
Chrome apps because you know we've it's
always been crush terrible that the
web-based app let's that is kind of
full-featured and not and a lot of these
are just packet like glorified redirects
to sites with app features like before
flash based even which is kind of in
that solvent that's core to the
hopefully address that to where you fire
it up in a more of a browser type setup
but then it's actually installing a
component of what would have been a
standalone app again it's it's I think
it's kind of a little fractured right
now but this is one of those I'm
actually happy to see Google focusing
like like clean up Chrome because I've
stopped using chrome chrome has kind of
become a bit of a mess get back to do I
mean well and then put that developer
talent towards improving other products
so you don't have to keep playing this
game of there's Chrome and we've got
Chrome apps and then there's Chrome OS
and there are Chrome OS apps and there's
Android and Android
like this is all this too much whittle
this down and streamline it and I think
everyone's gonna be happier
Android apps are not meant to supplement
Chrome apps they're meant to supplant
them is what I'm saying that's all yeah
but why so anyway um I want to thank
everybody who joined the conversation
Peter Hayden Andrew Wallace tmb listener
some great questions coming in there so
we really appreciate the chatter I think
it's time to wrap this puppy up it
weekends but they to it might not be the
weekend so it's the work so there you
have it folks another episode of the

Rollins com get a closer look at the
demon crown I'm actually tweeting with a
friend of the podcast
Andrew Wallace to see if we want to
cover a Sigma Force book on our book
review podcast the geek book club stay
tuned we might try and work it into our
schedule but ultimately there wouldn't
be a show on pocket now if it weren't
for our listeners and subscribers who
have kept us on the air since 2012 the
PocketNow weekly we'll be back next week
with all kinds of delicious Technology
goodness so make sure you tune back in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
