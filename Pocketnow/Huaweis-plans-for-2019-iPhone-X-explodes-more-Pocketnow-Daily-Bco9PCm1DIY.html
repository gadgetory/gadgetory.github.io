60 is already available for purchase if
you're looking for great flagship
features at half the price this is the
way to go
follow pocketnow.com / 1 + 60 for more
information in the first link in the
description while way plans to have a
heavy 2019 with a foldable phone a quad
camera phone among other things if you
have an iPhone 10 and haven't upgraded
to iOS 12.1 we don't really recommend
that you do after a recent incident and
all of googles smartphones will
shouldn't be updated to night sight in
the camera i'm hi mary that i still in
taipei still enjoying a lot of this
amazing culture this is PocketNow daily
the official news today we'll begin with
a Samsung announcement we now have the
new Exynos 98 20 processor being
announced which we assume will power the
international variants of the samsung
galaxy s 10 galaxy note 10 and whatever
the company launches as a flagship next
year
the most interesting part is that it
doesn't follow on the 7 nanometer
process that we clearly see with Apple
and with Huawei this is an 8 nanometer
process that apparently is made by
Samsung just like they came up with a 10
nanometer is it better or not there's
only one way to find out now let's talk
about AT&amp;amp;T and 5g and the future of
connectivity as the company has pretty
much spilled the beans that if you want
a 5g iPhone it'll happen in 2020 not
specific as to when and 2020 we assume
by the end of year so yeah the company
is going to take a little time in
rolling out 5g there's a lot of
complexity here and they're pretty much
letting us know that this is the way to
go but we also hear the Verizon and
Sprint's are being more aggressive about
this so let's see what we get now let's
talk about Google and nitesite if you're
not following us on Instagram please do
as the company has just launched the
feature that was pending on the ghoul
pixel 3-3 accel to pretty much every
pixel meaning if you have a first
generation or even the latest one you
have access to nitesite and there's a
lot of technology here to be able to
take great photography in low-light
it is not perfect I've tried it out but
it's definitely better than a lot of the
other feature
that I've seen out there again follow us
on Instagram and you can see some of the
photography that we've been testing with
the phone so far again I love the fact
that it's a work in progress and it's so
far so good now for those of you rocking
an iPhone 10 on iOS 12 you might want to
wait for iOS 12.1 this is not a verified
thing because there's only one case
right now with a phone that exploded
right after making the update obviously
if you've noticed whenever you do a
software update on your iPhone it does
take a toll on the phone and you do feel
that it overheats a little so we assume
that that's what the cause that what's
caused the the whole explosion but
obviously we'll wait for Apple to chime
in and tell us more and finally the hot
news that they have to do with Huawei
and the company's president of their
business group
he came on record to confirm that the
company is working on a ton of Vanguard
stuff for next year starting with a
foldable product that he claims will
arrive before Samsung's great that
they're also working on a four camera
array for a smart phone because they
want to work on an even better version
of zoom which already they made twenty
throw in the p20 pro our epic at that
and that yeah we should expect the
company to be even bolder than they have
this year about smartphones I'll tell
this much I've been using the mid-20 Pro
all week since I got here to Taipei
there's actually gonna be a video about
that very soon and Wow like this camera
is really really good but let us know in
the comments down below do you what do
you think about Huawei lately with all
that the company has been doing do you
think that this is a good approach for
the company to try to beat all
competitors and come up with an even
more powerful phone more powerful I was
weird but anyways leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion I do like what I see so far

news earlier follow us on packing out
