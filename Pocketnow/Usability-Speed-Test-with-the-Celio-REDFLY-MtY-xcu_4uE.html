pocketnow.com and today we're going to
use Adams usability test with the red
fly and my trusty verizon samsung i760 I
i also created a cheat sheet with the
six usability items from adams test so
the first one is to switch between email
contacts and calendar applications
obviously in this pc like environment
this is very simple just use alt tab
will go to the calendar application the
contact application and email all very
simple back to the today's screen second
test is to open a third party
application here we hit the start menu p
for programs and select the program we
want we'll use life search and that
brings up the live search application
this truly makes the windows mobile
experience very easy to use now we'll
open a website this is extremely simple
just hit the internet explorer key and
you can see it's almost instantaneous
and here you have a website we're using
verizon's e video network will close
that out and now we'll go to the music
application will go back to today's
screen and hit the Start programs
windows media go to my music pick a song
and hit play also all very fast and the
music is obviously playing through the
speakers on the i760 stop that and go to
the next test the fifth test is to add a
new contact so the contact application
is already up we can actually alt tab to
it go to new type in the name John Doe
tab to the phone number it's
800
555 one two one two add to the email
address test at example.com and then all
we have to do is click OK and the
contact has been added now we're going
to do the email and just alt tab to the
messaging application go to menu type
the letter n type John Doe automatically
selects it tab to the subject line the
subject line is test tab to the body
type in the quick
brown fox
jumped
over
talk
and we can click send obviously this'll
error because it's not a valid message
but that's how simple it is to use the
red fly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
