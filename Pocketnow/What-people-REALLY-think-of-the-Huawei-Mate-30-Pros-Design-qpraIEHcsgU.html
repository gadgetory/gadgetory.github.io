Huawei now daily hosted by hi metadata
funny very funny
props dude you didn't introduce yourself
ten times this video oh man so I've got
nine more times to make up for all right
I meant I'm hungry Homer Simpson you
need donuts getting like some thumbs up
on a comment here is harder than
becoming the US president well you
probably have the wrong connections man
that's right it's that time of the week
I am Haim editing that I've this is
parking man this is parking our daily
recap your comments for this week so on
Monday the topic was the Huawei Band the
fact that over the weekend the Trump
president Trump pretty much confirmed
that he was going to lift the ban on
huawei products and so well that was
said but nothing really happened after
that and so I asked you I mean what if
the ban lifted would you buy huawei
products we had 594 comments
Trump made the biggest advertisement in
history for any company yeah I think
that there are other people that are
more popular lift it or not I still
think Huawei's should finish and use
their own OS you got 142 likes to it and
I am with you with a situation like this
one what makes you think that it won't
happen again in the rear in the near
future so if Huawei doesn't learn from
this I don't know what's wrong with them
apart from choosing a Huawei device
would love to see OCO s emerging in
Korea competition I do feel that there's
a need for competition right now I do
feel that consumers should have more
options I still don't feel that Android
and iOS are the best solutions I just
hope this ban lift will make other
companies innovate harder and give us
better phones I also do hope for that
but the only way to achieve that is if
you continue having competition which
means that's not ban companies like
Huawei that on Tuesday we had teasers of
the Galaxy Note 10 and we received our
invite and obviously we saw that stylus
drawing a camera there was a ton of
speculation over what that meant I asked
you what you thought it man we had 530
comments okay but hear me out
and s-pen with a 3.5 millimeter
Oh jack oh man keep dreaming I wouldn't
mind having a selfie camera on the s-pen
and no cutout on the screen it's
actually not a crazy idea but you
wouldn't be able to see yourself so what
how is that different from just flipping
the phone around and using the standard
camera to look at yourself
the teaser is symbolism of an arrow
pointing to a hole in your wallet the
note template
alright 30 likes me you deserve those
this means that an extra zero will be
added to the existing price truthful
well that's the possibility yes I was
about to say true that fine whatever
on Wednesday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy fold I mean we've been waiting
for it we've got rumors that now it's
going to be delayed probably until after
unpack acts you know 10 and I asked you
I mean after everything that's happened
what would make you buy that thing we
had 434 comments drop the price to a
note level at an S Pen for God's sake oh
man that would be the hottest Galaxy
Note ever that would make the Galaxy
Note line up be even hotter than it
already is a week if that would be the
note Pro that would be a great device if
Samsung lowered the foldable phone at
$1500 most people will purchase it
including me 1500 is still a lot of
money I mean what computers could you
buy for that money but max what you're
already expensive could you buy for that
money cuz it's a first-time product I
think pretty expensive and they need to
work out all the little kinks true I
mean we kind of were expecting this to
happen I just didn't feel that it would
happen this bad but it did if it can run
full Photoshop and include an S Pen then
I might see it as a tool dream on buddy
but on Thursday we had a couple of hot
leaks of the wall we make 30 Pro with a
weird different camera ray that's
completely different to what we
currently have on them 8:20 Pro I asked
you if you like this possible design we
had 417 comments at least it looks
different unlike most of the iPhone
clones out there but then you've got the
iPhone coming with a stove that's pretty
much a clone of the made 20 pro just
like seriously I'm not a fan of Huawei
devices at least not yet but I have to
give them credit when it comes to design
I have to give them credit too I was not
a fan of Huawei devices when it came to
design
up until what could I say I think that
my favorite one was the made 20 pro I
think that that design was completely
unique I loved it but we know how that
ended
this huawei made 30 pro design is better
the one from Nokia is looking a bit
creepy
yeah the following day we actually
talked about a possible Nokia phone that
already got leaked in its full glory
that showed a similar circular camera
right at the back and yeah I mean the
thing about it is the Huawei phone has
what four cameras at the back I don't
know if I like May 30 camera housing but
it's unique I have to agree I mean it's
not unique it follows the Motorola
design follows of Nokia Lumia 1020
design but still I mean you get the
point and then finally on Friday the
topic was a possible foldable iPad there
are rumors that there's a possible
device that would fold like pretty much
flip this iPad design in half and
therefore allow you to have likes
keyboard space and you know the top to
be able to work
we've got analysts predicting that this
product is actually going to happen I
asked you what you thought about the
whole concept we had 405 comments so
Apple wants to make their folding iPad
even more foldable MLM fao way to get
there Tim Apple well true fine I get it
I know that you can fold this product
and half pretty quickly so can you any
computer or any other tablet in the
world buddy tablets we're not designed
to be folded and they're carried in your
pocket or any like that so it's one of
the main reasons why we didn't do any
sort of sensationalist content over
folding iPads because just trying to
fold an iPad doesn't make any sense
foldable iPad knowing Apple they would
be waiting for the fifth generation
galaxy fold before making one yes Apple
is not the most famous company in doing
what other companies do or in doing it
in the same time line so you do have a
point maybe they'll take your time but
according to the analysts it's going to
happen next year so whoa I mean yeah
we'll see it would be nice but Apple is
working on it they might give it
airpower treatment yes I mean I could
give you so many cases of products that
Apple prototype it didn't come to market
if you see the first mock-ups of the
first generation iPhone or the first
devices that were tested they're
completely different to the final
product that ended up in the market
and a lot of the changes happened over
the last couple of months even if it was
a project that happened over two and a
half years so yeah Apple is famous for
prototyping a lot and either deciding to
keep or not deciding to launch airpower
is probably the first time where they
announce something that they don't in
the blunting I feel that they did it out
of desperation for the stock going down
the foldable iPad will cost $4,000 with
that design are you saying that because
of the cost of a Mac Pro or the stand
yeah I got Apple is so famous for their
price tags and just the treatment that
they give that it's really hard to know
exactly what they're gonna do I don't
think it's in Apple's best interest I
mean the company did something
disruptive once when they launched the
first generation iPad everybody was
expecting that thing to cost a thousand
bucks and then when Apple was like yeah
it's gonna be costing $4.99 that took
the world by storm so I don't think that
tablet should be priced so high
I mean Apple's got a crazy amount of
tablets available right now from iPad
pro they could cost you $2,000 to one
that starts at 249 I believe so it's a
good question over where Apple is going
to lay the price tag to this product but
I don't think it's in the company's best
interest to go too expensive that's it
