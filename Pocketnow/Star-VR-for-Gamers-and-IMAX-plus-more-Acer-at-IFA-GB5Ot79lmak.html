take an early spotlight with its new
products announced a my memory that I
would pocket now and let's take a quick
look at them all of PocketNow Ziva 2016
coverage is brought to you by ex-con
global after a very lengthy presentation
that discussed a ton of new products
ranging from pet cameras to a broad line
of Swift laptops acer announced the few
products that fit our scopes starting
with the new liquid z6 these X plus
smartphones and the Iconia Talk s 7-inch
tablet the z6 lineup is mainly slated
for the mid-range with the larger one
having specifications that range from a
full HD display three gigs of ram a
gigantic 4080 milliamp hour battery in
the case again of the z6 plus and then
the specs drop in the case of the
regular z6 with a 720p display one gig
of ram and so on but the price points
range from 119 to 250 euros the Iconia
talked s tablet is mainly that a tablet

mid-range specifications 4G LTE and a
price point that begins at 169 euros now
even though we don't really cover
laptops the Acer spends 7 is more of a
convertible that includes a Gorilla
Glass touch screen and even plants to
compete at a very low price point the
hottest product announced is actually a
joint venture between Starbreeze Google
and even IMAX star VR is the first a5k
resolution VR headset that provides an
insane 210 degrees of field of view
compared to the standard 110 degrees
which is the reason for its odd shape on
the sides the idea is to bring star VR
not only to gaming but also to the film
in the street with IMAX VR now getting a
demo was kind of difficult because it
was really packed here but if you want
