thing I've seen so far it's a yes 2018
you're actually looking at it yeah I
know it's kind of early for that claim
but what you're seeing is not a laptop
no it's something else entirely
this is hi mary that i'm jules wong with
pocket now and let's talk about razors
project Linda
so before we begin do any of you
remember the asou spat phone yeah I
don't blame you if you don't but this is
just to show that the concept of
extending the use of a smartphone dates
back years ago it makes sense for one
device to serve all your needs and
Samsung and Huawei have given it a stab
last year even if to a lukewarm
reception
I'd say the PadFone failed because
Android was just not ready and Dex
requires just too many gadgets for you
to jump in only to kill your mobility
project Linda is a different animal
Android is all grown up and we've seen
the power of the clock on Snapdragon 835
imagine the chassis of the Razer stealth
carve out a slot for a trackpad and turn
your razor phone into a laptop yes we're
talking about an aluminium body which
almost feels too light because inside
you've got less internals there's a
battery here to charge your razor phone
there's built-in storage in case you
want to offload some of your files from
the phone to the dock best of all there
is a ton of i/o here as well from a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack to USB C and
USB a there's even a 720p webcam and
dual array microphones for communication
and you could say you've also have a
fingerprint scanner as the design of the
dark allows the phone's biometrics to be
accessible the coolest party trick is
the button at the top right corner
presents it here a cool drilling noise
which is actually the USBC connector
recessing into the chassis to allow you
to access the razor phone to undock you
simply lift the phone out and that's it
and then to dock back you just follow
the same procedure backwards and the
connection to the laptop screen only
takes one or two seconds this is a full
size keyboard with backlit keys that you
could customize just like you can with
pretty much every razer computer and the
top row serves to bring the usual
Android navigation keys and there's also
a key at the bottom to launch the
applications heck even the Razer logo at
the back lights up for those of you that
complained at the razer phone didn't
have this functionality oh and if you're
asking yourself where the speakers are
well the razer phone has more than
enough of that and they're actually
pointing in the right direction
but it comes to the user-interface
yeah it actually gets better razors
launcher adopts the functionality that
pretty much reminds us of Windows with
an alternative to a Start button for
apps and a navbar at the bottom your
phone now becomes your track pad so it
dims so that you can control the display
and yes I found myself trying to press
the button on the trackpad repeatedly
just to remember was a phone you know
what I think the reason for that is
because this actually feels natural the
idea makes so much logical sense to me
razer claims that this is still a work
in progress we're plans are for the
screen to support touch which is still
not available at the moment and also for
the phone to allow dual app launching
with both screens serving different
purposes so what's the catch well I'm
shocked to see that this is just the
concept racer has garnered a lot of fame
for showing off concepts of CES and I'm
just hoping that this is one that
actually gets launched when compared to
others project Linda is here at the show
to grab some feedback from consumers in
our thoughts and I have to say so long
as Razer finds an aggressive price tag
for this I'd be willing to buy it just
as it is
even without the touchscreen let us know
what you think in the comments down
below and while you're at that make sure
you subscribe to our channel for more
videos like this one you can follow
Jules at Pointe Jules on Twitter me and
Jaime underscore that are on Instagram

coverage from CES 2018 coming soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
