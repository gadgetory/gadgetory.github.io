that google i/o is today which means a
whole new version of Android right
around the corner they're calling an
Android hem for now and what we don't
know is dessert name just yet Google did
take us through some of its new features
I'm I on to Houston of the pocket now
and these are our top five features of
Android am number one is offline app
support Google put a big emphasis today
on reducing data usage and one of the
biggest ways is doing that is by
bringing offline support to youtube and
maps we'd save videos locally did watch
for up to two days you can even download
match those long road trips including
full turn by turn navigation and even
local suggestions number two is doze
mode now it's so secret that Android
falls behind iOS and Windows Phone when
it comes to device standby time and
Google is working to improve that with
Android M with the help of motion
detection if you go for a while without
touching your phone it'll slow down
background singing rates with all the
high priority apps and again as one just
double your battery life number three is
standardized support for fingerprints
and USB type-c supporting devices like
the galaxy s6 will not be able to
approve mobile payments and app
purchases using your fingerprint instead
of a password and an open API will allow
developers to build support into their
abs number four is Android pay this
works a lot like Google Wallet where you
can store your credit cards and make NFC
payments but you're no longer going to
need to open an app to do this it's give
me an open platform it'll be supported
by nearly every major bank and it's
already going to work at over 700,000
stores our fifth and favorite feature of
Android M is google now on tap on tap is
one of the many improvements that Google
is making to the nap platform its launch
with a simple press and hold of the home
button google now ones have is
contextual a to wear and it parses
through whatever app that you're
currently in to give you information
like who's playing in that band that
you're listening to or who is in that
movie that wraps up our top 5 list for
Android M they were plenty more features
discuss at i/o today and so I want to
ask you what were your favorite features
of android app you can leave your
answers in the comments below or tweet
