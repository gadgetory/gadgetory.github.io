from Google but it's a little bit laggy
after the Android 4.2 update I'm Joe
Levi for PocketNow and this is how you
can eliminate some of that lag and
extend your battery life at the same
time with the franco kernel this is my
nexus 7 and as you can tell up here by
my battery status indicator I've been
using this guy a lot mainly streaming
some Netflix videos if you would listen
to our podcast a few days ago that's
because I've been trying to catch up on
caprica no spoiler alerts these I'm
still on like episode 5 or 6 so getting
through it now Netflix is a unique app
it uses not only your screen to display
what you're watching but it also uses
your network connection to stream that
information in in short it's very very
battery and resource intensive so I had
to do something with this to get me a
better battery life I also came across
something somewhat interesting things
are significantly more fluid stuff opens
up quicker
it's just all-around faster and a lot of
the lag that people have been
complaining about with the the Nexus 7
Android 4.2 update is gone when I'm
running this franco kernel it's
wonderful so let me get into that just a
little bit this is CyanogenMod 10.1 m 1
that means it is a rooted device that is
running a custom wrong it still has a
lot of that same lag that people
complain about but Franco kernel updater
this is the app it's available in the
App Store and it costs a few bucks this
lets you do a bunch of things first of
all it lets you go out and update your
kernel and it says here that my
installed version is 42 and the latest
stable version is our 42 so I'm doing
that the first time you run the app
you'll want to tap on this to download
the latest stable kernel that'll
download it install it you'll have to
reboot for the changes to take effect
once you do that things are gonna be a
lot faster a lot smoother and you'll
have better battery life like I said
that up there that's hours and hours and
hours longer than what I normally get so
keep that in mind
once that's installed that's all you got
to do however if you want to go in and
do more you can you can come in here and
mess with frequencies and voltages it
does require Super User permission which
of course requires route you can change
your maximum frequency up to in this
case 1300 megahertz
that's 1.3 gig or all the way down to
100 megahertz I've kind of capped that
down at 400 the governor is interactive
that's the one that it's selected by
default and then you can go in and mess
around with the GPU I haven't done any
of that and in all honesty other than
doing those couple things I haven't
messed with any settings in here other
than setting those CPU settings at boot
you can just install this and let it run
and it's very very nice next let's look
at custom kernel settings we'll open
that up again granted super user
permissions you can change your i/o
scheduler i/o turning turn on F saying I
have left this mainly alone one thing
that I did do is I've noticed that with
this new router I'm using Wi-Fi is a
little bit spotty so I ticked that
checkbox right there to to basically
help out you enable this option I'll
read it for you to boost the Wi-Fi
signal at some battery cost it's also
helpful when your screen is off so I've
done that and since then I haven't had
any more Wi-Fi problems you can also
enable or disable the Tegra screen
dimmer this goes through and it saves a
lot of battery life when you're watching
video by smoothing out the video taking
out some of the more bright scenes and
making it more more Universal if you
don't like that if you think it causes
some weirdness in your video just
uncheck that and it's good to go it
comes unchecked I went ahead and checked
it because honestly I haven't noticed
all that much I also changed my teep TCP
congestion avoidance algorithm over here
to Vegas I've seen that before I don't
know exactly what it does but I like
Vegas so I put that in there if you want
to you can change your kernel boot
animation to be the the franko kernel
boot
I like the CyanogenMod one so I will
leave that off and really that's all
you've got to do there are other things
you can do in here you can set power
modes you can backup and restore your
kernel settings it's really really nice
and here's one of the coolest things
it's your monitor so you can see exactly
what this is do
right now you can see that I'm running
at thirteen hundred megahertz down to
three hundred up to seven hundred I can
see my voltages not being responded to
and then if you look down here this
shows you this is a quad-core device my
first two cores are online and working
and then the next two are not and then
in fact core number one just offline
because I don't need it there's not
enough stuff going on right now for me
to use all three of the all four of the
core so it's just using that one so
really kind of cool what you can do the
app is called Franco kernel updater it
is available not for every device in the
the Google Play Store if it's not
available for your device it either
won't show up or won't let you download
it if you do download it and can't do
stuff with it it's probably because
you're not rooted you do need root for
that overall very impressed reduces lag
significantly increases battery life
significantly lets you do a whole bunch
of cool stuff very quick very easy
install it run it you'll love it if you
like what you saw here why not share
this with your friends on Facebook
Twitter and Google+ give the video a
thumbs up for pocket now showing off
Franco kernel I'm Joe Levi thanks for
