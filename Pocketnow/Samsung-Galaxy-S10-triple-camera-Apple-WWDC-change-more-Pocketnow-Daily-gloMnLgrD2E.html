will bring triple cameras because that's
a thing apparently we'll have to wait
for the iPhone s e2 s WWDC will be about
software and Samsung is delaying the
Galaxy Note 9 for a pretty good reason
I'm Jaime Rivera it's Friday it's great
we're giving away a huawei mate 10 pro
because of that you can learn more in
the description
this is pocket out daily
the official nurse today begin with
deals for a limited time if you're in
the market for a new Sony or new phone
for that matter
Amazon currently has the ex a one for a
hundred and eighty bucks and chirp it's
not flagship territory but Sony has done
an amazing job with their new phones
lately and for one hundred eighty bucks
that's really a good deal but it's
limited to you to learn more in the
description as well now let's talk about
Apple home pods and speakers that could
actually sell that are not home pods
we've heard that the company is working
on a beat speaker that's going to pretty
much match the home pod to a certain
degree and cost less the funny part is
that according to our sources that
speaker is going to be costing 250 bucks
how is it going to be different I don't
know and 250 bucks Apple like seriously
you plan to compete with that let's see
what we get now let's talk about Samsung
and the Galaxy Note 9 as we've had some
separated rumors around that we're
getting it early that we're not gonna
wait until the fall that apparently it's
going to happen earlier like it around
July now we hear that the company is
going to be announcing it late July that
we're gonna have a launch weeks later
and the reason why it's gonna take weeks
after that is because they're actually
making it slimmer and we're getting a
larger battery I can't wait to see how
that happens stay tuned we'll keep you
posted now let's talk about Apple's WWDC
particularly because we've been waiting
for cheaper MacBook we've been waiting
for that beep speaker we've been waiting
for the iPhone se 2 but according to
sources there won't be any hardware with
the exception of the speaker
apparently all we're getting is software
at this event and I hope that the
software is going to be grand and great
because it makes no sense for Apple to
hold back on product announcements right
now unless they want to perfect
something it seems that there will be a
separate event for Hardware what usually
happens in the fall we'll see and
finally the most interesting news that
they have to do with the Samsung Galaxy
S 10 as we hear that it's going to have
triple cameras according to the source
we're getting an early Galaxy S 10 but
Samsung is a bit worried with the low
sales of the galaxy s 9 up to the point
where they've realized that they can't
the design another year that something
great has to be brought with this phone
and so triple cameras is the thing 3d
sensing technology other things up in
today's question let us know what do you
think I mean does it make sense for you
for Samsung to launch a triple camera
phone and if so what features would you
like because in my case give me a wide
angle and a telephoto and I'll be happy
Samsung that's just me leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends again if you want
to get the news earlier flow was I'm
