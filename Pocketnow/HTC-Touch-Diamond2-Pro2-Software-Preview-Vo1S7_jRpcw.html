pocketnow.com coming up this spring HTC
will release the touch diamond2 and the
touch pro 2 which are the successors to
two very popular windows mobile devices
the touch pro and the touch of diamond
when these devices come out they will
have a new version of touchflo 3d that
will bring some new features like
calendar facebook integration a better
contacts application and a lot of other
things and what i have now is a rom that
includes many of these enhancements it
comes from XDA developers and i want to
show you some of these i think a lot of
them are very interesting and very
compelling and will make you look
forward a lot to these new devices when
they come out in the spring so here we
are touch flo 3d nothing interesting
about this main screen you know you
flick upward to see your next
appointment and that sort of thing but
if we go one to the right we are taken
to the people tab and on the people tab
something has changed if I tap on one of
the people here I am taken to kind of a
mini touchflo 3d application that will
show me all of my interaction with this
person in one screen or actually several
screens but in one place so I have their
home address or phone number or anything
associated with our contact if I go over
to the right I can see SMS history with
this person if I've sent them any text
messages I can actually go ahead and
send them a text message right from here
by the way this is a new keyboard we'll
talk about that in a second we can go
over to the right for email to the right
is facebook linking so you can actually
link the person with their Facebook
account so you can keep tabs on when
they update their status and that sort
of thing and to the right of that is
call so I'll see the history of clause
that I've had with this person how long
they were when they took place and this
is the actual same screen that shows up
when you have a call with the person so
think about the uses you're talking to
someone and you're wondering if they
received an email or if you even sent
them an email about a certain report
that's due tomorrow so you could quickly
go to the email tab you could quickly
reference whether you actually sent them
that email and you could just keep
talking to them on the phone so a really
great way to to kind of keep tabs on the
interaction
that you have with people that you talk
to your email or text message if we go
to the next stab we have SMS we've seen
that before then we have messaging seen
that before too here's something new
calendar and it's a really nice calendar
and again it keeps you out of the kind
of drab windows mobile interface so if
we tap on any of these days so let's go
to the 19th will be taken to this nice
slick interface that keeps everything
inside of this that the screen that
you're looking at and we can go up to
the previous day or down to the next day
with a nice animation and zoom back out
to the month with this nice fade going
over to the right we have the internet
tab and the touch pro 2 and touch
diamond2 will have what's HTC is calling
push internet which means that it will
queue up certain favorites that you have
selected at certain time so if we go to
frequency settings we can determine when
our favorites are queued up ready to go
so if you look at a certain website
Monday through Friday at a certain time
this is where you would set it and this
is just a nice little interface that HTC
is added to set the time going over to
the next step we have stocks and it's
been retooled a little bit before you
had a little chart of the stock and you
would flick through it through with your
finger like you would do in the context
application but here we just have a
linear listing of the stocks we can tap
on one of them and see stock details
with a chart high-low that sort of thing
moving on we have pictures so we can
flick through our pictures we've seen
this before and then we have music we've
seen that before as well whether and so
it will download weather data you can
flick through the animations of course
I'm going over to the right we have some
settings and finally on the right is the
program launcher which we've seen before
and of course you can add your own
programs now if you remember landscape
touchflo 3d really doesn't exist so if
we look at a device like the touch pro
and we flip out the keyboard this
happens nothing I mean you get a bunch
of buttons well with the new touchflo 3d
we do have a landscape version let me
show you what it looks like there it
goes so HTC solved the problem of how do
we fit touchflo 3d in a landscape screen
they did it by placing a button here
which will expand the entire touchflo 3d
menu on any screen and
you get to one of the screens it will
then collapse away to a little button
which is really great because it takes
up a lot of screen space so we finally
have or we finally we'll have touchflo
3d in landscape though I hope they find
a way to stretch the wallpaper to the
right because that's a little bit ugly
something else that has changed is the
notification area if you remember in the
old touchflo 3d if you were to tap the
notification area up at the top you
would get large sized icons on the
screen not like this a little bit
different but in the case of the new
touchflo 3d if you tap up here you will
get this notification screen which will
only show you if you've got a new
message or a new call or a missed call
so it's a nice handy way to see all of
your notifications right in one screen
so i mentioned that new keyboard let me
show you that now HTC has made a lot of
changes to the keyboard it actually a
sound now and haptic feedback which is
quite useful when you're typing with an
on-screen keyboard so here we are
comparison the old HTC keyboard with a
new one the new one has a much larger
space bar compared to the old one we
also have a easier way to switch between
xt9 and ABC before it was a switch that
was kind of in the way that you would
accidentally press sometimes and as I
mentioned it has sound which you can
turn off of course and there is a little
bit of vibration that comes through when
you use this keyboard and I've been
playing with a little bit and I think it
is significantly better than the
previous keyboard the sound the
vibration the larger space bar they all
help to make a better typing experience
and of course we can flip through to the
other keyboards down here we can do the
phone keypad which is like 89 style
keypad and then we have the other shirt
type style keyboard which i think is on
the other panel here it's actually I
don't think it's included on this this
particular rom but it probably will be
on shipping roms now something else that
has been revamped is all of the softkey
menus now in windows mobile 6.5 they
will have new soft key menus that will
allow you to use your finger to access
all the functions of the program well
HTC has brought this to you sooner so if
i do menu down here i get this large
finger friendly
animated menu and this applies in every
program in every soft soft key menu that
you use so it's implemented throughout
the operating system and it's a really
good change I think to make it more
finger friendly and here's something
else that has been added to the phone
application the ability to quickly
conference call with certain people now
the HTC touch pro2 will actually have
two microphones and two speakers to be
conducive to really great high quality
conference calling so I'm assuming the
touch diamond is going to have this
feature to its not gonna have the micro
dual microphones and dual speakers but
it will probably have this one about to
show you if you check off the conference
call button you can go down and select
different people to have on the
conference call and then if you press
Start conference it will basically step
you through the process of connecting
each additional caller and of course I
don't know if you know this but on your
cell phone you can have a conference
call with many many people and this is
kind of like a conference call wizard it
actually doesn't call out to five people
at one time like you think it may it
just steps you through the process of
connecting each additional person so
that's pretty much it for this video
really looking forward to the new HTC
devices and the new changes that they
will bring to win its mobile devices
something I didn't get to test on this
video was the Facebook integration so
that if you have a contact bob jones and
you sign in to your YouTube account you
can link Bob Jones with his facebook
profile so that you can see when they
have updates update their profile when
they've added new pictures and then that
way you can also reference pictures that
Bob Jones has associated to his name
rather than having to load on 100
friends worth of pictures onto your
device which could be quite annoying so
that is it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
