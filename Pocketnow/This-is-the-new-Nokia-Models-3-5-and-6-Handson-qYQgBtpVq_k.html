with a 3310 relaunch but its recent
approach to Android has also proven to
be quite interesting I'm high memory I
will it now here with the Nokia
three five and six from the VC 2017 that
folks when how does a look at Nokia
making a comeback we have to remember
what the company stood for in its glory
days and that was designed as such the
Nokia 3 5 and even the global relaunch
of the Nokia 6 follow that trend we
haven't Alec beautiful designs here on
the 6 and the 5 and then the 3 is a
blend of polycarbonate and metal the
result is both striking but at the same
time conservative which is great
Nokia is mainly focusing its relaunch in
the premium entry-level sector these
devices aren't all screamers from the
spec department as a result then I'll
get three being the least powerful as
the bunch is immediate tech producer
two gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of
expandable storage but an insane and
crazy $150 price tag and ok 5 stands in
the middle with a snapdragon 430 three
gigs of ram 32 gigs of storage that's
also expandable with a 5.5 inch full HD
display and yes the price also continues
to be aggressive at $199 and then we
have the note gift 6 which was the first
product of the company launched in China
which is now expanding we have the same
snapdragon 430 three gigs of ram and 32
gigs of storage and the 5.5 inch full HD
display though the price tag is a little
around the $300 depending on the market
nokia has now extended color options for
the nokia 6 with a gorgeous blue and
also a limited edition model and
polished aluminum but yeah it reminds us
of the word jet and the fruit overall
none of these devices is designed to
allow anyone from the spec department
but the company has done an amazing job
at choosing stock Android as its mobile
operating system and this is actually
the first time that I see the full pixel
launcher on another phone it's hard to
predict that these products will ever
reach the United States but I'd be
definitely on board giving them a try
mainly at this price and while that
