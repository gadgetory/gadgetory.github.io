with a new shopping card Microsoft's
next to them couldn't help and veal the
surface mini and if you want to get
yourself an iphone 6 dummy get them
while they're hot I'm high never leave
it I and please raise your hand how many
of you are drunk already by all the
margaritas and beer and Cinco de Mayo
this is parking out daily let's begin
today with the official news as
Microsoft has just begun to send out
press invitations for an event to happen
on May twentieth and according to the
event tag wine it says join us for a
small gathering now Microsoft is not
much for small gathering so the only
thing we can assume from this is that we
will get a small product and small
products coming from Microsoft mean a
smaller tablet they're not going to sell
you a smaller phone so interesting could
this be the time that we will be getting
the surface mini and a lot of people are
waiting for it and speaking of official
google now keeps getting better the
company has just launched a new shopping
card in its recent update and by
shopping car the thing means that if
you've been searching for something that
you want to buy or something will
detects that you'll be getting emails as
well and what it does is actually tell
you if what you're looking for is at the
store nearby yeah Google is doing a
really great job with Google now it's
becoming more and more useful obviously
this won't work everywhere but it's
great to see that it's taking a step
further hopefully this will be ported to
other countries soon nokia is up next
but not the microsoft nokia mobile
division we're actually talking about
the nokia company which kept is services
like here maps your service is
everything is still nokia and apparently
the company is planning to make this big
launch for ios and android these
services have been available for these
platforms in beta for the longest time
and a lot of people don't really like
them but apparently they are gonna bake
something big out of them hopefully
it'll happen soon we'll keep you posted
as we are interested hopefully they are
good up next we have ian's iphone 6 i
wish i could say let's talk about apple
but this is not really apple apparently
some manufacturers in china have figured
out a way to use the schematics and
actually build you a dummy iphone 6
which is obviously not going to work but
it looks exactly like the schematics for
you to actually be able to see what the
iphone 6 looks like it'll cost you
around sixty dollars obviously not all
these retailers or something that you
can trust week
I'm tell you to trust them but legs on
the sugar for full details yeah let's
see if this is actually going to be the
future Eiffel and I mean how bad can it
get and finally for the interesting and
broad news of the day let's talk about
HCC we've got a lot of information
number one the HTC one mini two lovely
name has been leagues and press renders
and an images lhasa into the description
for full photos of what to get though
I'm not really looking forward to this
stone but those of you that are actually
looking forward to the HTC One m8 well
apparently the company has sold a
significant amount of phones not
something great the company has not
provided substantial numbers yet or
official ones at least but apparently
things are going well but one thing that
is official is the price tag for the 24
karat gold model there are actually
three models up again links to those are
in full details on that but apparently
you can get one of these for 2,800 bucks
which is really not expensive
considering the amount of gimmick behind
Google glass for 1500 but how did you
say the question of the day uh what do
you think HTC is doing with this
24-carat gold phone is it something
interesting for you I mean if you had
twenty eight hundred dollars right now
when you pay for 24 karat gold phone in
my particular case I wouldn't it's a
phone it will be obsolete in the next
couple of months unless the company
would give me an upgrade process or a
way to upgrade my phone in the future
it's a lot of investment for nothing but
