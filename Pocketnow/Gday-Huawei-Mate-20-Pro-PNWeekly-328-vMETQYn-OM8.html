intelligence careers gov slash NSA all
right this is London and calling hello
and welcome to episode three 2/8 of the
weekly brought to you by pocket now and
xda-developers recorded on Friday the
19th of October 2018 from Huawei to
Huawei yeah that's what we're talking
about today pretty clear that the May
twenty minae ting the conversation but
we'll also take a few visits to the
Huawei watch GT the wali band reap throw
and there's some other little tidbits
along the way
I'm Jules Wong your host for today Josh
Vergara and Jaime Rivera still working
on up in London that's where the Huawei
Ben was this week I was about to say
that Taylor Martin is off today but
apparently he was able to rush in and
take over our friend Mario Seraphin
hello to you Taylor hello how's it going
pretty cool pretty cool I heard that you
had some wood chips and your beard that
you have to get out yeah pause from from
chopping up some trees in the woods to
come podcast No well I'm very grateful
for that making that transition from
what to Wyatt
yeah let's see if we get Brandon
Minnemann in here hey man long time no
see actually it's been a while and he is
not audible at this point I don't know
why it's because of these hangouts
things that we clear up at the start of
the show and then it's like oh hey we're
out wearing the free show and then
everything's okay and everyone says yes
we're okay and then
somehow when you turn on the switch for
the show it just goes kaput
there right now it works there you go
Hey hello you are in living color in
living vibrations to the years I would
like the here you talk a little bit
well here's the thing back in the day I
would use a simple microphone and then
you guys complain about my audio quality
so I got this very fancy cardioid
microphone which sometimes misbehaves
it's kind of like the Ferrari that
breaks down all the time I just wanted I
just want a Toyota but I mean I wanted a
Porsche instead right anyways we had
another frequent fly around here and
that is from Android police the best
person to have his calls hello how's it
going hope that didn't interfere in
because in the freaking you know intro
and now like I look stupid if it doesn't
get kept in so please any at all when
you said that to me I hope it did but
it's good to be here I haven't been in a
while
that was a pixel ringtone which must
mean you've a pixel three there right no
actually that was probably the delivery
notification for the pixel three I'm
waiting for that's downstairs as we
speak oh well you'll be distracted right
I know exactly I mean you shouldn't
really let it lie there in the pile
because I've been to your apartment at
work every single notification now
everyone put your phone in the basket
and turn it off okay for the whole 90
minutes it's just gonna be me turning up
the alarm on this phone and then playing
it into the mic so breaking the cast
rule here every single podcast should
probably set up a few rules right now
let's talk about Huawei and only qua way
for the next maybe 30 minutes does that
sound good to you go
we have no other choice that's what is
happening this week right could you put
on the doctor that's what you put on the
packet that's what I put on the docket
so let's go for it
all right so obviously the big story
here was that on Tuesday we had this
whole smorgasbord from London Huawei and
it's May 28th May 2000 vents and quite
the scene here if I could pull up the
screen and tell you about it so let's
talk about the gap between these two
phones because the May 20 m 823 it used
to be only that we had a few
differentiations between the two from
what the what you paid for it and I
believe it's always been a very minimal
maybe 50 or 100 euros you had just like
an extra camera on that P 20 crowd well
people be proud that's what it is
and then Kier things have kind of shift
around so we have the 1080p screen on
the May 20 it's at six and a half inches
and then you have to mate 20 pros 6.4
inch which the size I mean it might not
correspond to anything but you have that
OLED display and you have that 2k
resolution you have the typical memory
disparaging differences with the four
gigs six gigs of ram Hanabi 20 versus
six gigs standard I believe there is an
8 gig option as well for the v20 Pro
this year's kind of a little interesting
here because there are a few things that
have widened the gap so to speak so we
have if I can forward down to the screen
and the notches that are apparent on
these phones unfortunately though the
post here does not have front-facing
photos of the phones but the mate 20
does have a dewdrop knotch
as they say it's a very minimal notch
it's only for the selfie camera and then
you have them 820 Pro with its full-on
face ID ish kind of thing with
time flight centers or 3d sensors and
it's that it goes the Holborn that you
have battery charging which is different
twenty-two and a half watts on the May
twenty and forty Watts on the week
twenty prowl and there was a couple of
other things that kind of shed the
difference here so you do have this
triple camera on both devices but the
maximum resolution akanda make 20 is 60
megapixels and then you have that
freaking huge turrets of a 40 megapixel
sensor on the new 20 pro so I was
wondering do you buy the differences
here I mean we're sorry talking about
$7.99 and 849 between two is does that
what do you feel about that difference I
think it's too arty I think it's I think
it's totally worth it I mean the it's
like the mate 20 pro takes every feature
every innovation that mattered in 2018
bigger batteries better cameras better
screens faster charging and puts it all
in one and I wish jaime was here because
I've known Jaime for a very long time
and he's never been this excited about a
phone like ever use the freaking you
know cracking clip like he just you know
did the whole thing with you know
release the Kraken and that was part of
this video so it was quite an amazing
tailor what do you think yeah I mean if
you're gonna expend $800 on a phone to
begin with and it's another 50 for
something that's it's not just a slight
margin better it's better in just about
every single aspect why not no question
well that there was even a made 20 this
year right right well I don't know about
that but I know that like if I work
while way I would question why the may
20 was even made hmm
and that ya know humans it's just a
fifty dollar difference when he made a a
more stinted version I guess and charged
you know maybe a hundred and fifty less
or 200 less I would understand maybe you
wouldn't even be able to carry the may
20 name but
for a $50 difference it just doesn't
make a ton of sense did you just make up
a word stunted stilted I was looking for
I don't know I'm bad with words I've got
it and it means to be economical or
frugal about spending or providing
something so yeah good job Taylor I mean
it's also like the fact that there is a
May 20 light out there which is
completely like in a different category
in itself it's like 500 ish so I mean
we're really talking about splitting up
a layer cake here Ryan what do you think
about this um I do think that the price
difference is definitely worth the
upgrade to the may 20 Pro for most
people unfortunately I also kind of feel
like it's the difference is gonna be in
a material for a lot of us because this
isn't coming to the US yet is it
I think they hopefully announced
availability for Asia and Europe right
yeah UK the United Arab Emirates because
of course the Dubai gets all the pretty
stuff and yeah just Europe France Italy
so well I would dig see in may 20 Pro
doesn't really matter to me just get it
on eBay yeah eBay I mean that's your
only option
work on eBay I mean Amazon has
traditionally carried it about a few
weeks out of its launch time so and of
course you take the risk of you know
carrier bans and whatnot not working
fully with a TTS Network routing tables
but I mean that's in order to have a
statement piece if you really want that
statement piece in your pocket and that
I mean that's the perspective that you
might be coming from right then this is
what you might want um but in terms of
just here kind of specs here I mean this
is just so much to handle here and in
there are some of the software features
too that really make this up they've
been really pushing AI with that tear in
the 980 with seven anomie of chip many
more transition transitioners
transistors I should probably do too
the hell and talking about transitioners
but yeah they're using it for many
different uses mostly in the camera with
features like a eye detection for
subjects they're able to record video
with background but a black and white
monochrome thing and then you have your
subject you tap on the subject and it
remains in color so that's one of the
uses that they're putting into all that
hard-wearing all of that you know
computing are these phones really
artificially intelligent like is that
actual AI or is it just like programming
that the text detects things based on
you know being programmed with millions
of images and detecting trees and cars
yeah that's exactly what it is but we've
we've decided that we call that a I know
it sounds better I guess it's something
that you can promote in this age where
you have the head shoe in the way at all
the bits um that's what the you know
picture was with the qat at least but
some yeah like there is just so many
cycles now because of the you know the
how much hardware is in there that can
be used for this kind of thing I'm
wondering what you think because we
can't see anything about the quality of
it but just like the fact the gumption
that's you know Huawei is like pushing
this out and perhaps you know they made
him out I may not turn out but I'm what
do you think of just getting out there
I'll start with you Taylor nothing like
the only thing I can even think of while
looking at these specs is how in the
hell is the camera 40 megapixel camera
are they using some janky trick like I
think it was Huawei who did it back in
the past where it was 40 megapixels but
it was like an 8 megapixel camera with
almost like pixel shift technology yeah
that's what it's doing it's actually
it's actually 10 megapixels isn't it but
it it bends them together to make a so
it takes four yeah yeah well I was
wondering about that haven't you sorry
go ahead
now I was just a saying that the p20
Prayer was marketed with the same 40
megatons and very good results according
to our ad Lane so like we're kind of you
know good day they they did this back in
the day there was an app for iOS I
cannot remember the name of it but it
does it does the same thing and my Sony
the a7 r3 also does it and it works
really really well technically Google's
doing it with the new zoom functionality
on the pixel 3 and 3 Excel it uses a
shift to try to interpolate it a sub
pixel look resolution for that added
zoom effect so it's so cool I love it
it's the same technology they used to
photograph the stars like NASA not like
a normal person but but NASA because it
takes a lot of technology to do that
with a moving target but yeah I just
wasn't sure if that's what was happening
here I'm still so far out of the loop
I've not caught up yet still four years
behind guys yeah I mean you're getting
there you're getting there somehow
so yeah there's a lot of information to
parse there's a lot of new phones so it
is it's crazy I mean so let's go into
the sensor I think it's an e tail the
main xx has its ultra wide angle sensor
at 17 millimeters I assuming that's a
full-frame equivalent and it's 60
megapixels so you know they did the good
idea of putting the most megapixels to
the most area that you'll be able to see
you have the standard 27 millimeter 12
megapixel thing going on and then you
have the 2 times zoom which is 8
megapixels and that's your make 2020 bro
with 8 megapixels you have that three
times in now I'm not its optically
stabilized so I think they're doing the
right thing in terms of
in the right hardware to where it needs
to be because when you're going out that
far you obviously need a little bit more
stabilization to make sure it doesn't
all go wacky the standard thing here is
the 20 megapixel 16 million no that's an
ultra wide-angle excuse me pardon me
that's an ultra wide-angle try megapixel
which is great it's there there's no
monochrome sensor this time around like
a is their longtime partner in this sort
of thing in terms of imaging and they've
always stood with that monochrome and
color combination with dual cameras
because that produced a lot more detail
and they were able to hybrid create a
hybrid image and that would give a
little bit more pop a little bit more
artful grooming as I would like to say
for their images and then you have the
phonemic megapixel standard thing which
is just the bazooka you know you just
shoot it out f-18 it's ultra bright it's
nice there you go so you got everything
you got everything
what do you think about a little full
photographers kit and one one phone it
kind of is it's like you're using
multiple lenses on the same device kind
of like the LGP 40 shoot if I'm running
gunning I usually take one lens but it's
typically a zoom lens and it ranges from
anywhere from 16 to 24 all the way up to
77 so this is roughly that in three
different again right the cameras in the
phone yeah it's quite versatile too you
know it's just again one found so I mean
what this I mean is this a practical
replacement or would you still want that
insurance of having a reliable you know
dedicated camera at this point me I was
gonna go for an actual camera yeah just
because but I've gotten more into using
my phone especially I don't have the
lens with me but this is the cover for
the moment lens I use this on my iPhone
in the galaxy s 8 plus and this
theoretically if this is as good or can
provide as good of results as a moment
lens then I think that's a valid valid
alternative because these things are
bulky and I hate carrying them and I
don't always like I don't have that case
on here I don't like having this case on
my phone all the time to only use the
lenses every you know every so that's
your benchmark in terms of that you know
not we need to put words this but apples
to apples yeah I mean that's the closest
comparison I guess you could have is its
tossing a lens on your phone and most
lenses for smartphones are trash
these moment lenses you've got to spend
80 to 90 dollars actually the anamorphic
is 130 so you've got to spend that
purlins and how that's on top of them
you know thousand-dollar phone if you
will really want it right Brandon go
ahead how far do you think we are from a
phone being able to take a picture that
is as good as the best DSLR or do you
think that I'm only long way why do you
say that because you don't have true
depth of field and something that's
turned me off really bad lately is is
the pho depth of field that you get the
profile or portrait portrait so that to
me looks fake I can spot it as soon as I
see it because there's no variation to
the depth of field it's there's
something in focus and everything else
is out of focus and that's not how it
works
depth of field is the further you are
the more out of focus you are right yeah
it graduates it's it's physics on a
phone it's like almost photoshopping the
background like blurring it you know
yeah and it just looks fake to me so
they're trying to fake that if they can
get that to look better and use that
depth information to gradiate maybe but
it's still faking it but the real thing
is is your sensor size I mean the sensor
size on my a 7r3 it's like a dinner
plate I mean it's so Kate Winslet's
Earth sensor it's huge whereas these the
sensors are
very very very small thank you guys
Orphanage like really small and that
that's always going to affect your your
light intake more than anything and your
depth of field that's one thing that
will always hinder the true depth of
field is this in size yep
I want to get to you a couple of
emissions obviously the headphone jack
has been out for at least a month and
generation now so you know it can you
play it all you want there is a it's a
benefit that's just an interesting to
know about the audio and that's one of
the speakers is actually tucked inside
the or at least encased around the USB C
port at the bottom because I as opposed
to like having it chewed out you know
just like farting out literally so
there's that and then there's the
expandable storage situation and like
you have one of the deadly sentence you
know no headphone jack and that's for
these tech enthusiasts that have you
know all really been invested in these
uh you know sorts of expandability and
when you have the headphone jack on you
really shouldn't be touching that
microSD slot and for these people and
yet we're talking about a new nm card
which is it fits inside and nanometer
not an enemy
nano SIM slot it's like the same exact
shape so Huawei doesn't have to carve
out a specific shape for the micro SD
card anymore but at this point they have
not really they have not released the
cards so you can't expand that 128
gigabytes which I mean if that's our
base for most people know like in flat
alright cuz you know what do people do
with 128 gigs on their phone like I have
I think I 128 gig iPhone and I have
6,000 pictures in like 200 videos and
I'm still like 50%
I still have 50% of my storage need to
have your whole lossless audio library
with you to listen to on your cheap
earbuds
yeah so you're like they've fooled is
Sony here in terms of you know
proprietary memory cards out there you
know PSPs and whatnot and every single
console has a new proprietary card and
you know this this has no practical
advantage over an SD card because just
getting the same practical transfer
speeds not a megabyte negative 90
megabytes per second which you know it's
about the same as a good high-capacity
micro SD card so like why now what what
is going on here what do you think I
always play is a I'll start with you
bruh
I think they're trying to pull Sony like
you said I mean this is completely
unnecessary you know always so big that
they're like hmm how can we make more
money
oh we can come out with a proprietary
memory format and not license it to
anyone so SanDisk know anyone else that
makes memory no and you have to come to
us to buy huawei nano SD card which like
you know micro SD cards are so small I
mean they're the size of your thumbnail
I mean but this is even smaller it's so
you don't even have to carve out like
the extra spot in the sub tray no thanks
I mean if I've already got micro SD
cards from all of my other devices I
don't need a new four memory format
sorry while we just gonna just gonna buy
oh and then they know they know you're
gonna say that so then then people are
like alright I'll just get the higher
capacity model you see what we're doing
here we're inching up that price no
matter what I mean
it's always been that advantage having
that as a ufs a presumably using ufs 2.1
but that's already a fastened of thing
it's much preferable to us the emmc
anyways ya know what you think well
asset because I actually am not super
familiar with the details what was
announced is it verifiably a proprietary
format they're not licensing it to
anyone else it's not an open standard so
let's see here it's a proprietary memory
card that
they have not really like the event was
kind of closed off so we don't have like
direct quotes here because getting it
from you know you know secondhand word
but there that's like we're not getting
any licensing details at all okay it's
technically not even an SD card which I
think belongs to
SanDisk it's just called nm card it's
not nm SD card so that would suggest
that's entirely secure digital yeah my
crest tears are the SC Association is in
charge of that and it has a bunch of
licensees and members and performance
right yeah I'll say it is there a
picture if I did anywhere that I can see
yeah yeah let me pull it up here on this
just show you that boom right there look
at that 15 years ago they're talking
about
oh hey micro SD believe of the future
now this is the wave of the future it's
45% smaller and it's red but microwave
it's red so small I lose them yep to a
point where you know diminishing returns
like how much space are your going to
recoup on this yeah they're gonna make
them so small you need tweezers to
install and then don't you already mean
tweezers like place the freaking nano
sim down without having it pop out of
the tray for some reason like you know
its fingers and I can do it oh good for
you I guess maybe yeah there was one
interesting other tidbit that I feel to
mention while we were back on the
20-week Pony Prairie I believe in the
may 20 Pro housing and that's the in
display fingerprints on Syria but this
one's a little different this one's more
it detects pressure it's nuanced on that
level so I suppose you have that extra
layer of not necessarily biometric
because that's already that's that's
what sound you're hearing but kind of a
user factor X Factor kind of thing in
terms of security I believe the number
is 4,000
pressure levels detected but in terms of
adding that on as a layer of complexity
I mean Jaime Rivera posted in this video
on heads up hands on on this thing and
he found it not to be that reliable even
though it's I believe it was
pre-production software or Hardware just
pre-production everything but what do
you think of that added factor in terms
of security and I'll start with you
right um well I had heard there was a
little bit faster than previous
solutions some of these in display if
fingerprint readers are pretty slow but
my understanding is that no matter what
the resolution you get the effective
resolution for the fingerprint is lower
on these in display readers unless
they're of the ultrasonic variety I
might have that mixed up but if this is
one of the ultrasonic ones I don't know
security may be fine I don't know enough
of the details about precisely the
solution that they're using here if it's
one of the optical ones my understanding
is that they are pretty low resolution
they don't work too great they're not
super reliable and in which case it
could be concerning you know it could be
one of the things that they might be
compensating or goran petrovic says and
it is optical but demonstrated yeah
there have been demonstrated
you know improvements in terms of just
getting everyone over to the ultrasonic
side and perhaps some other things going
on including increases in resolution
it's early days still we don't know
early days but you know the production
cycles or just you know quicker during
the early days to so hopefully you know
there's some resolution on that in terms
of adding pressure to the whole mix of
things branding
how's that going to make it better is it
going to be like a separate factor and
like do you have to be consistent you
know medium pressure press er in order
to get access to the phone like what da
like you can't just you know if you're
sleeping you can't just someone else
can't just smush your finger on there
and then have it like I think that it
could add some tech Atilla t so that you
can more easily know like how much
pressure to put so if you do like a
medium pressure you get a little bit of
a buzz and you know oh I did it because
some people you know capacitive screens
require slate it's such a light touch
that you might be inclined to just like
kind of peck it a little bit but this
way if there's some pressure sensitivity
you can really get your finger in there
for it to read your the notches and the
edges a little bit better because the
current solutions are terrible like vivo
necks I mean it just basically doesn't
work and all the other in display finger
it's just way too early like Ryan said
I'm gonna throw a curve ball to you
Taylor so listen closely so if you
already have this in displayed
fingerprint sensor and then you have I'm
gonna make 24 now this you know face ID
system with the whole kit and kaboodle
going on there
what do you think and this you know is
is this going to compromise okay maybe
I'll choose one over the other and if
the quality is as such as we've heard
about from Jaime what do you think might
happen in terms of preferences I mean
just having used fingerprint sensors and
face I mean I have an iPhone which I use
a lot and the Samsung it the face I'm
like what that works really well I'm not
necessarily as concerned about the
actual security of it I don't have
anything too sensitive on my phone you
might I don't know but I mean though the
only thing is in practice whichever one
works faster and more reliably I'm gonna
use I don't care if it's a fingerprint
face unlock whatever a thing that kills
me and nobody's addressing this no one
is that the the trusted networks and the
trusted locations and all those things
do they even exist because that was my
favorite ever motorola did that so well
like if i have my watch on and it's
within the vicinity of a phone i don't
have to unlock my phone
that was an android feature right i
think there's built-in android it it was
originally most devices is on android
yeah yeah it was originally motorola
google purchase motorola they acquired
some of those features and then they
were like buy moto we don't need you
anymore and those features were done so
well and now it's like they they don't
even work like you can add a trusted
network my phone automatically connects
to the network when I walk in the door
and I still have to unlock my phone
there have been a ton of complaints that
none of the trusted stuff works anymore
right now right yet so why not just fix
that please I don't care about my face
unlocking the phone or my thumbprint
I'll put in a pin code but if I'm at
home just let it stay unlocked
understand that so that's it I don't
care do something
it's literally she might be just you
know know as oh I'm just doing their own
thing because I and I know a lot of you
do stay at home a lot I'm at home and
Brandon you're at your office a lot but
I am at home eighty percent of the time
I still have to unlock my phone it's so
frustrating like jenna is crying after
more friends you up here anybody within
eight hours of me please be my friend
I mean I'll fly down do that like six
bucks it's like six bucks you know you
get your Raisinets and your soda it's
great you have to drive a tractor to it
so it's a driving tractors only you
southerners god I'll be drinking them
alright anyways um just a couple more
things before we get to some of more of
the conversation that we want to have
and I'll talk about the may 20 X here
because of course gaming is such a big
deal these days so
course and Holly wants to know I mean
it's sub-brand honor which is supposedly
more youth focused is already you know
tailoring all their stuff to that
audience with the honor play and other
things and then this okay you know we're
just gonna toss it out for our mean
audience I guess because you like the
game too apparently we're talking about
a 7.2 inch tablet I'll say it again 7.2
inch tablet and it doesn't matter I
don't care how like yeah the aspect
ratio or anything that gets to a point
where it's like okay now you're just
you're reaching beyond my you know my
last knuckle here and I don't know how
this is gonna be not a two-hand device
all the time so that's just my quick
take on that you have a five thousand
milliamp hour of battery and full HD
screen and then you have vapor cooling
vapor chamber cooling which the chamber
expands to roughly you know a large
portion of the device so you have that
similarity with the razor film - it also
has that and then there is one other
factor here that I try to I'm trying to
remember here I believe it's a graphene
graphene film which I'm not familiar in
terms of how that actually gives lights
perhaps it's just insulation thing so
there you go
is this kind of is the right tack to
take in terms of the gaming where do
they have the formula right here I'll
start off with you Brandon
I'm having deja vu because um I did a
video about the honor note 10 which is
very similar to this phone it's slightly
smaller screen it's 7 inches it's got
the five thousand milliamp hour battery
and you know you know we live in the
future and like a 7-inch phone with a
tall aspect screen and small bezels is
not that bad and so like 7.2 is pretty
much the same thing it's really not that
bad it's totally a two-handed phone
unless you're like Michael Jordan or
something
and how big is that X Z ultra tailor
that you keep I don't know I was
taunting you with it it's hilarious
because that's all it's all it's like
6.4 inches which back in the day was
like incredibly big but the bezels on
this thing are like an inch on either
side so really it's the same size as
this new phone yeah probably
it's you know it's felt so ridiculous
it's not that bad with the problem with
that is that's a that's a wider a
shorter aspect ratio like 16 by 9 so
it's truly you know very wide and very
tall instead of just very tall but I
want to I want to just be honest about
something regarding this phone I think
it's awesome and I think the gaming
movement is awesome these gaming phones
with extra extra power better cooling
bigger screens but guys I think I missed
the boat on this one I don't I don't
game on my phone like in the beginning I
did you know when new games came out
that were awesome like the Monument
Valley was awesome and Titor of course
all right do you guys do you just sell
it do you guys game on your phone I have
especially in pub G mobile dropped
I was I was slaying noobs I played it on
the computer so much and I was traveling
I actually the day had dropped I was in
San Francisco and I played it on my
iPhone and my actually I cheated I
played it on a 12 point 9 inch iPad pro
it's nice it is yes yes but yeah I
played it on my phone a lot and it's a
lot of fun I think in order for gaming
on a mobile device to really actually
solidify or be solidified finally after
what two decades you're gonna need
something like the joy cons on a
Nintendo switch something that slides on
the side of your phone and lets you hold
it like a gaming device and these mocha
controllers and all the things like it
it still kind of suck just losing them
they suck well I mean funny that you
mention through the Nintendo switch
the speaker on deck I don't know whether
or not it was a Richard you which is who
is the CEO but the speaker mentioned the
Nintendo switch in comparison with its
battery which I feel like is totally
unfair because you know there's a
console dude there's it's not one-to-one
here but you know five thousand milliamp
hour battery versus the switches four
thousand three hundred million power
battery and then that's it you know
that's that's the only thing that's
really you know that was worth comparing
between the two apparently so there was
that I don't know if the comparisons
totally disingenuous because the switch
uses a nvidia tegra SOC right so it's a
mobile device in a certain way
Oh NVIDIA made a tablet whatever their
gaming temple yeah the shield tablet yet
I had that it worked really really well
but really truly I think there needs to
be a few changes that make I guess a few
innovations one has to be a better
controller system because touchscreen
controls suck nobody likes playing with
touchscreen controls yeah - you need a
manufacturer on board a gaming company
Sony Microsoft Nintendo which Nintendo
is making mobile games but they really
don't do well with making mobile games
but the platform's there the switch runs
really well it plays great games they
are down scaled-down resolution versions
of your standard console games I don't
care
I played Zelda I played it it's 75 80
hours and Zelda on my switch Wow
and I mean that's Alex's put in like
twice that but but I've played games I
play games like broforce and Binding of
Isaac all these games are available on
mobile
broforce isn't but Binding of Isaac is
and it plays just as well on mobile and
I think it's we're almost there but we
need somebody to actually publish these
and not just keep pushing them out and
it kind of petering out because right
now it's a disorganized thing like every
publisher is in charge of publishing
their own thing you know and
what you get is this on the Nintendo
switch you get a very specific
experience if you play those games that
work on the switch and on iOS it's a
totally different ballgame because
everybody's gonna it's a free-for-all so
that and there was one more thing the
streaming the steam link streaming you
can stream PC games to your phone yeah
that works well it actually works really
well the problem is the screens are too
small so something like this main to any
else another screen that you can use
that's basically what you're using it
for if that's the case it doesn't have
to be you know it doesn't have to have
LTE radios it just needs to serve its
purpose I guess um you were shaking your
head Ryan when you were talking about
knowest I was nodding my head vigorously
I'm pretty sure yeah yeah totally
everything he says now I was always
talking about personal you know usage
because that I think you said you might
have said that you're not really a
mobile gamer that you prefer to you know
more that indoors yeah I do it more on
PC than anything else but I agree with
him I think that the best approach is or
a good approach would be for major
backing of a couple publishers or if a
company like Sony or Nintendo would be
like hey guys let's make a phone I would
have there would be a great way to
approach mobile gaming as opposed to the
like he described the smattering
mishmash of mediocre controls and sort
of untargeted or loosely targeted
developer focus like that would be a
good idea I don't know what's gonna
happen but if yeah it's only ones to
approach steam would be a great way to
make that happen
yeah if that was to be like let's make a
phone well or or just like well you
could never really have an app store
technically because you wouldn't be able
to buy the games like on your iPhone and
I think does Google regulate that now I
don't know so if you buy yeah so if my
phone can't be preloaded with an app
store from another competitor if they've
licensed a Google Play package but
that's changing now with the II
regulations although it's still going to
be exclus
if you licensing google play it's it's a
whole thing I could go on about a
fraction the mess but the point is I
mean you could buy the games or show the
games like in your steam account buy
them from your computer and have them
automatically download to your phone
yeah you know it could be offered as a
service like that with me make a few
numbers or like the only ones that work
in the Steam Play Store Steam games
store whatever for your phone they would
say have to be compatible with you know
certain controllers like the steam
controller or something you know that's
really the only way I see mobile gaming
actually being taken seriously I mean
it's it is taken seriously because it's
a multi-billion dollar industry every
single year but it's also not taken
seriously by the actual gaming yeah for
to be of the same quality as console or
PC gaming yeah what really matters in
terms of you know just making sure that
experience is on point I do want to wrap
this but quickly just quick comment
about that may 20 RS which is basically
make 20 Pro except it has leather on it
and costs 20 100 euros so and I read
that are you thinking it was this week
that virtue but actually yeah
invitations in China for event so it's
like okay great timing and that's pretty
much all I have to contribute on this um
do you have like just a few words on
this I'll start with you the tailor it's
ridiculous it's nothing but but just you
know showing off that you have money if
you own this it's just for the money and
that's it and no one's going to know
yeah no one cares I don't even like it
give me some real I mean I got some real
leather here like actual good like this
is not good leather I don't like it I do
a lot of leather working myself actually
I made my camera strap I made all the
sleeves for all of my computers I made
my wallet and my key holder this is
green corrected Chrome tan junk I'm a
man you're something you guys are such
leather snobs real leather right I think
I should take you down to Taylor's place
and you guys could just like talk about
other for hours we could probably talk
about leather for a while you can't
smell it and if it doesn't do anything
when you smell it then it's not good
leather I love the smell of Horan's
chrome Excel man mm-hmm geez you guys
hover a phone-in Horine leather it's
mine up by I'll rock that shit for years
you guys take this offline okay what
happened to you learn more I'm sorry
I know bring it back all right I'm with
that we're gonna get we're just gonna
talk quickly about the watch GTE and the
band three Pro but not before we get
into some sponsors so we'll be right
back
this episode of the pocket net weekly is

well connected and you can trust that
works because it's firmly Tron the
company behind the first electronic
dimmer with nearly 60 years of
experience now I've been playing around
with some switches the company has sent
me and actually put one in the living
room and it's nice to be able to not
have to go to that little alcove in the
dark to flip the switch because it's
very Krantz
you know I should be cleaning you know a
little bit more often but just being
able to call out to my speaker and I
could say that to get to full brightness
swelling preparing dinner or turn it
down for when I'm watching
American Psycho for the 15th time just
saying it's not convenient get smart
lighting and get the smart way with
casino pilot Ron you can see a s ETA or

announcement and we are back alright so
just a quick word from all yeah I want
to keep the spirit of Joshua Vergara
going on in at least one way so I want
to do a check-in it's basically just you
know tell me how you'd be Gleek spin or
one thing that you really want to talk
about um I hear that you have a red
ribbon so I'll start with here um the
thought third was going to be a
conversation with Jaime but since he is
not here
as for the the little check-in that we
do I got the I got my pixel three XL two
days ago two days ago white is
definitely the color to get because I
hear that I mean the black looks really
nice but I hear that the black is so
fingerprinting that for one of the first
times in phone history you cannot wipe
the fingerprints off you have to wash
the phone which is okay because it's you
know water-resistant but you know as
nice as the black looks just don't do it
I mean and also you get all those micro
scratches with the white you don't see
it the fingerprints this might be
covered with fingerprints I have no idea
because it's white and my fingerprints
are you know I guess they're whitish
just you know the oily fingerprints so
how do they leave a print you don't know
anything about me Taylor my fingers
aren't that smart
let's like use each other of having
small hands here that's that's where
another debate um I want to get over to
Brian see how he's doing this week
pretty good gonna go see him over there
they did it was that off air Gordon I
think that was off air that was off
there where we going to watch play yeah
I'm gonna go see a boarder at the
Brattle theater in Harvard Square hey
hey yeah that's gonna be amusing Toronto
International Film Festival Award winner
so I guess can you make an endorsement
here on the pocket our weekly I just you
know in Norse movies or give it like two
thumbs up or something like that I
couldn't offer that's that's copyrighted
by Roger Ebert whatever anyways uh let's
say finish up with you Taylor what's
going on this week what what were you
doing with the the whole the sharpen the
forest dam so there was a hurricane that
rolled through here ah and we were
clearing out trees last week and another
tree fell and I was about seven feet
around at the base and we had no way to
move it so we've been out there and saw
that it for hours and hours and finally
got it cleared up I almost got thrown
off a tractor so I see fun stuff
well that that at least you and yours
are safe and that you know getting
things back to normal and I'm just gonna
I'm just gonna throw this out there I've
never even used a pixel phone ever whoa
just throw that out there dropping
things down anybody want to feel bad for
me uh okay I can feel bad for you right
now because Matthew in Greece apparently
has called you a number sexual which I
just found you know yeah it's not the
first time I've been called a
lumbersexual it sounds nice lumper
sexuals don't actually like the outdoors
I would live in the woods with no
neighbors if I could we're going to lose
our PG rating on this podcast if you
guys keep this up
pg-rated I think so we could not keep a
PG rating when I was here before it's
gonna be the same now sorry we gave up
at Android police I drop f-bombs like
every day between me and Michael Fisher
every time I crushed a Segway there's an
f-bomb you know well I mean last week's
episode had any bomb just like trashing
all over the pixel three and he was just
I couldn't like I was not gonna bleep
those enough so it's kind of happy
I had the e that's fine II Thunder E has
to eat that's fine
let's get things back into order here
just a quick moment for quality watch GT
which comes in finishes although
effectively it's just the band's one
silicon one's leather and then the big
thing though is where OS where is it not
there you got this Huawei late OS which
I'm not sure it's the one that they've
been working on as a potential backup to
Android but you know and maybe perhaps
there were some influences from Tizen
because you know sounds like Huawei got
together for a little bit but from what
Jaime has said white LS works a lot like
where OS in terms of you know scrolling
in terms of interface and it's mostly
tailored towards health improved health
metrics with more Hardware in it but I'm
just wondering what the direction is
here with this thing here and I'll
straight with the had nothing to say
it's not anger so I have no idea it's
Android bully it's not like the West
exactly I was going to say the same
thing as Ryan except I was thinking
about Samsung's recent watches with
Tizen they're actually really really
good that sort of hurt so fast the
navigations brilliant in some ways it's
significantly better than where OS
actually and I think one of the reasons
is because Samsung is controlling it end
to end
Apple style so it's optimized
so you know while we making their own
operating system could turn out really
really well actually
and for you Taylor I'm supposing that
there's gonna be a lot of the same no
comment here actually I shot a video
this week about my everyday carry which
will be uploaded I think tomorrow
Brandon I'm not sure yes system are
sorry yes guess I went to channel the
the the best day of my year and I had
some commentary about smart watches I've
not worn one in about a year and a half
two years and part of the reason is I
hate the fact that if I look at my phone
when I'm talking with someone they think
I'm in a hurry or I'm wasted or wasting
my time or something and I just hated
that and I've completely stepped away
from them I don't use them or wear them
I've got to hear that hi Mae sent me
there's one that's just really a fitness
tracker AG shock and the other is the
tip watch pro so I'll throw it back on
I'll try it for a while but really it's
gonna take a lot of convincing to move
the needle for me for a SmartWatch again
I think you'll like the tick watch Pro
because it's kind of like a real watch
kind of like a SmartWatch yeah and the
thing is when I wore my Apple watch I
ended up wearing it with Do Not Disturb
on all the time so it it was really just
a watch just too much at that point yeah
well I wanted to take this opportunity
to kind of pivot and talk about where
West is in general because it's been
we've seen its design changes over the
past several months and you know what
the name change and now there was more
simplified just home based gestures and
you know getting all the notifications
in one screen and even then like we've
seen a steady drop off in terms of the
traditional Multi multi multi level tech
manufacturers adaptive wear or less and
still we've got a lot of the traditional
watchmakers like wear a fossil excuse me
muscle group with its multiple brands
here I'm wondering what this move means
in terms of
like is while we able to or school able
to grow from this our is this some
another stumbling block for the company
I'm so I'm so excited about non tech
companies making watches like the the
Skagen watch the fossa watch maybe less
and then there's this new Montblanc
watch which is so cool it's a thousand
bucks but it is so nice and it's first
watch with the way 3100 platform it is
yes it's it's gonna be awesome if I mean
it's so so expensive but like it
actually looks like a real watch so I'm
so excited about these non tech
companies making quashes in there
watching silo
but can you imagine a Rolex and put the
way go as a be gangsta I don't know if I
could see that yeah I mean you know it's
not gonna really routine but it's always
been the case with these kind of very
things and circuitry inside of it like
if it's not a quartz watch inside then
it's not really in a retain its value
once the screen is darkened forever so
that's you know something that's you
have to be worried about but I mean
where OS is still kind of this
burgeoning thing that it's not it's
still in this box
whereas Apple has just run away Fitbit
has just run away just taking over and
making sure that I feel like you know
it's more utilitarian that's more if
they've been targeting the fitness crowd
for a long time it's just now they are
kind of expanding on that software based
on the features that you can do cellular
has really helped out on that and you
know they're now they're kind of I'm not
sure if it's just direct marketing or if
it's word of mouth but there's some
influence in terms of hey this is not
just the thing for you know running
buffs but this is the thing for me and I
can use in my daily life so yeah alright
mr. pebble bring that couple I'm really
really like I was so stirred
for the the Pebble watch that actually
didn't come out was the time of to yeah
yeah I was actually going through my
Kickstarter the other day and I saw the
return for that and I'm like you know
pebble was the best I gave up using
Android wear even though we cover
Android I think it's terrible I think
it's a terrible operating system with a
really bad interface but I don't like it
I was I was actually scrolling through
the TIC watch and just trying to go
through one notification to the next
like oh my god right high-bay didn't I
guess he didn't wipe the watch he didn't
disconnect it from his phone so when I
got there there were just hundreds of
notifications and I was just I wasn't
reading them because you can't really
see anything but I was just scrolling
through just trying to go one by one and
I would swipe and it would jump to the
bottom and I was like okay I'll go back
up and it jumped all the way to the top
I could never get to the middle
notifications it's where it's terrible
it's terrible so yeah I I personally am
looking for something sort of similar to
what Jaime got which was the he got the
garment watch but I that I got for him
because like he couldn't get to the
meeting
yeah so the ones I would be looking at
most would be something from like Casio
because I wear a Pathfinder a Phe 240
for my outdoor watch to wear one night
where I am working something that's just
barely a SmartWatch like just mostly not
is what 384 something that will track my
steps just because I don't wanna have to
wear that and a Fitbit so something
that'll track my steps and maybe won't
buzz you know from time to time if I
want it to but not I don't need GPS I
don't need a touch interface really I
don't I just want like two or three
features otherwise why even have a phone
you know like I won't either a watch
that doubles as a phone I just don't
have to have a phone or I want you want
to be alpha which has itself you know
wraparound screen or do you want the
Withings the new within some steal a
charm something yeah so either that
or some futuristic SmartWatch that
doesn't exist that's all I'm saying
yeah what's that device that turns a
dumb watch into a smart watch by putting
like a Bluetooth disc under you know and
then it vibrates I ain't heard about
that I don't remember but I think I
might be doing what you're talking about
but I'm not sure so well I mean there's
just another complicating factor for
where less I guess and meantime while we
goes its own way so it goes the walk way
anyways nice I think the band 3 Pro I
mean I've tested it before and I think
was the band to like in 2015 and you
know did I write I feel like with the
improved sensors on here they're using
infrared to help out it in terms of
heart heart metrics at the moment I
sleep tracking they're gonna get decent
results the OLED the color OLED is a
nice addition in yeah that's pretty much
all I have to say about that
I'm not sure about the rest to you
because maybe you haven't tried the moon
maybe you don't care but it's nothing
that's worthy upgrade I guess laughs all
right I think it's about time that we
look forward to next week and the week
after that too why not so we have show
me with two events in China I believe
Joshua is gonna be there because of
course torture is something that is not
really condoned so they're just gonna
fly them over and it's each this month
has been a wreck on us it's just been
tiring and so we have a me mix three and
a black shark to lecture I being chummy
is gaming brand they're already coming
out with a second edition device and
it's only been a few months since the
first one and that's the one that's
gonna have like RGB chroma and like
radiated lights and and then we may
explore use just like oh we're going to
do the Apple find X thing have a sliding
deck with the cameras and also push the
bezels all the way out and I guess
so there's that and then the week after
one plus sixty happening on October 30th
in New York and then this week or I
think yesterday even we just had the
announcement from Apple that oh hey
we're gonna be in New York - on October
30th in New York across the East River
so of course this is gonna you know
really and they have iPad pro they have
max come in a MacBook Air I believe
maybe the air power wireless charging
pad that has gone pretty much
unmentioned for the past year plus at
this point Apple what's going on come on
step it up so I'm wandering out of the
all these events including the ones from
the past you know just this whole month
what has been the most um you know what
has most appeal to you or what is real
most appealing to you and I shall start
off with right uh well the only one that
really applies to me is one plus sixty
the others are either not going to end
up deploying in the United States or
they're not Android products I'm
interested in seeing the new Macs I
probably too early for Apple to be
releasing an AR empowered MacBook as was
previously rumored to be in development
earlier this year
that'll probably be something we see in
the coming years but nonetheless I like
seeing the way that their hardware
develops I use a Mac on the go generally
even though I'm not a very big fan of
the company's behavior towards
developers or to consumers it's just the
easiest and the best to go with but so I
though I have some personal interest in
that I'm really just focusing on the one
+62 you brim I'm going to steal yours
right
every time you know I'll use a pixel to
and then leaves a note 9 then I'll use
the iPhone 10s and then I'll go back to
the 1 plus 6 and every time I go back to
the 1 plus 6 I'm like holy crap this
phone is so fast
yeah and so it's just it's so good it's
so fast and then the camera doesn't suck
which it you know has in the past on
someone + phones so I'm so excited for
the 60 it sounds like it's gonna be
really really really great ant how about
you Taylor
be probably a toss-up between the
oneplus 60 or the they make 20 Perot if
if I could get my hands on the mate 20
pro only because I'm so interested in
the cameras I'd like to actually try
that out but I've not had a new Android
phone since the si+ and this thing has
been dormant for like the last two three
months I'd like to try android now
especially either in its pixel form like
pure unadulterated Android or oneplus
because I'm not used I'm not used to one
plus ever not one I got out of the game
like right when oneplus was coming into
it so scarring up and you had that like
investigative piece back before you left
you know figuring out a pose connection
to one plus and all that stuff like
everyone was trying to figure that out
so yeah that was that was a good job and
then and now it's the one plus 60 which
is amazing
all right to wrap it up and finally we
have I film ten are coming out today
pre-orders launching today with
shipments coming out next week
I'm gonna give Brandon minimum the
opportunity to mic drop and ask him if
he only had to use three words to
describe it what would they be
three words colors are popular colors
are popular that's true you said three
words I have none I have to go I have to
pick up my little girl to bus stop and I
don't get exciting so I drop commenced
mine yes yes see you next week alright
how about you Taylor the one that's
using the iPhone 10 right now what's the
iPhone 10 are to you in three words what
it do I don't really I don't really know
what it is I don't know how it's
differentiated because I was traveling
when the announcement hit so I've never
even read up on it after that apparently
once coming my way but
I'm not really blown away with any of
the new changes so a little teasing your
coverage on it and you're gonna find out
soon enough so hey look at that looking
forward to that
and Ryan Hager the the person that
covers Android and only Android and you
know I mean it's totally the wrong but I
want to get something that was off your
base for a second so three words man
Apple's winning strategy I think the XR
is gonna totally kill it to getting the
full iPhone experience the same flagship
level esos a diminished resolution
screen which everybody seems to point
out as some huge defect but people deal
with it with the oneplus 6 it's not that
big of a deal and it's cheap you get all
of the high-end experience for much
cheaper price you get the fun colors I
think that the XR is gonna be a runaway
success I mean they are expecting
somewhere around like two-thirds of all
new model sales going to the 10r I
wouldn't be surprised at all if it
wasn't more yeah and it's like David
wrote an op-ed that he was of the
opinion this was gonna totally destroy
Google's pixel sales and I agree with
the XR you get the full camera
experience you get if you're not really
into the Android ecosystem on see what
you'd buy pixel man well there's no
there's no depth sensor though right so
wondering oh yeah yeah yeah so there's
it's only one camera but yeah but you
know let's you know I mean you still
have the face idea anyways and that's
good and then whatever key things
portrait mode sucks
so yeah it's not that big of a loss in
my mind you're still getting the primary
shooter you're getting most of the same
experience well I mean there's only one
way to find data and we're looking
forward to getting our shipments in so
stay tuned for our review stay tuned for
taylor martin and stay tuned them for
ryan hagar uh what's going on at android
police right now what do you think
because i want to be able to give you
less of dues here um well we've been
covering a couple of the I mean pixels
pickle threes they've been being
delivered over the last few days so
we've been covering as is always the
case
issues start cropping up Google's
quality control and they're questionable
design decisions have been a thing for
years and years and years and it's it's
a thing again as everyone expected so
we're going through figuring out what's
wrong with the current crop pixels
do you think it's just the noise
generated that's like the most headline
catching or because like there are there
been a lot of other issues regarding
galaxies you know it was like you know
is the most popular smartphone only end
in the world and doesn't seem like we're
getting as many call-outs you're
definitely right we're just in a
position to hear more about it when it's
the pixels the people who buy pixels or
people who are picky they're people who
are really into Android they're picky
about what they want and software and
what drives them to the Google
experience but it also means when
something's wrong they're more vocal
about it and due to our position we're
more likely to hear it yeah I don't
doubt that other phones have as many or
more problems we just we end up hearing
mostly about pixel issues yeah well
hopefully more that feedback feedback is
public and therefore perhaps Google
might be able to attend to them quicker
so that we can only hope but that no we
should probably have this yeah that is
it for now
