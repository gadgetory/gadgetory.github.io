you good evening to all of you as well
this is a I'm every benefit market now
we are at our editorial round table for
WWDC 2015 which just ended a couple of
minutes ago there are a ton of things to
talk about and as always we're pressure
good time we're going to try to keep
this under 30 minutes so that you can
all get more coverage as obviously iOS 9
the Developer Preview is already live
right now a whistle on developer preview
is also live and you can that were
downloading that to be able to test it
out and give you full coverage and all
the content and on and on the updates
that are available so let's just start
with a little roll call to our
contributing editor mr. higher our human
how are you sir I'm doing good do good
awesome awesome we also got in the black
miss sure our editorial director mr.
Michael Fisher how are you well I'm
wonderful hi may I have excellent
internet speeds and a wonderfully
expensive computer and even a sound
booth but google hangouts well doesn't
work regardless so that's why I'm a
glowing orb on your screen good to see
you everybody but we can't see you so it
would be good to see you to see you and
our Chiefs new at chief news editor mr.
Stephen Schenk how are you sir I'm
excited to talk about Drake and only
about a Drake so I hope okay look let me
try to understand i was i was meaning to
ask you are you a trick fan i only like
Drake as the actor on Degrassi which I
am very sad to see he's going off the
air after 14 seasons but apparently
makes music to these days it was I am
NOT a Drake fan but I I am aspiring to
be and my son is in front of me he just
looked at me funny what's wrong I mean I
mean how can you not be a Drake fan
after the performance today he was so
eloquent on stage he only used as many
words as he needed and it was so
succinct to talk about his life
experiences and say nothing that was
amazing that was really amazing but that
vintage jacket was pretty sweet we all
want to live it was yeah yeah there's no
denying that okay so disclaimer guys
since we are so short in time please
give us your q and A's we would love to
hear what you think and we promise we'll
be able to cover you know as many as
we'd like mainly because of our
difficulties right now but you can bet
we will
try to do as well as we can and if not
we've got a ton of coverage later this
week to go through these so why do we
start with mr. Stephen shank let's talk
about OST sure Apple led us into the
event and wasted no time at all I jumped
right into the desktop side of things
the next version of OS X its building
off that Yosemite name from the previous
generation giving us El Capitan that big
rock formation the primary focuses on
the el capitan announcement were about
performance and the user interface and
Apple first started telling us about
some of the UI changes it's going to
we're going to get to a minute some of
the iOS 9 stuff with the split screen
view but split screen was also a big
part of the desktop experience here and
how you arrange apps on screen Apple
talked about the split view to allow
side-by-side interaction with apps and
if just getting two things on screen at
the same time isn't enough for you
you're going to be able to set up these
things called spaces by dragging apps up
into your mission control bar you'll be
able to group them together and sort of
have like a virtual desktop experience
switching between them there was a lot
to cover here talking about little you I
things new gestures and certain apps
like in mail deleting messages multiple
messages at once cool little stuff like
shaking the mouse to me wiggle to see
where your cursor is will get bigger
become a little more visually prominent
we're all over the place here we saw the
introduction of the the new notes app
and that's going to be on OS X as well
as on I believe on the iOS OS X you'll
use to gather together information from
multiple apps is dragging stuff into
place dumping it into notes and you can
see reviews as a checklist and go back
and make sure you're getting a tasks
done it you need to a UI changes we're
all around talked about like spotlight
you've been able to resize the window
spotlight itself is getting a little bit
of a feature tweak learning to pull
information from data sources giving
information not just about content
that's stored on your computer locally
within your apps people to pull up
things like news and weather sports
scores sort of think we've seen from
virtual assistants in the past besides
the UI changes
a lot more I'm brushing the surface
there we heard about the performance
stuff in general you know it's the
latest and greatest so we should expect
things to be faster more responsive
Apple talked about upload times
transition times between active apps is
being improved in particular and a lot
of this some of they got very Deb
focused so it's not going to be as
interesting to you know more non viscous
user-focused people out there but metal
okay already heard about last year WWDC
for iOS is going to be front and center
with OS X El Capitan metal gives
developers very low level access to CPU
especially GPU hardware allowing game to
do some very impressive things and we're
probably doing these impressive things
while not making the system crawl to a
halt as a result us we'll be seeing
metal baked into the OS so general UI is
going to benefit from this switching
away from OpenGL towards metal so to
improve draw times to screen getting
away things will look smoother more
fluid and you can all appreciate that
availability they just make you working
to try to get our hands on this ASAP
it's starting today as the dev preview
Apple introduced it's been building upon
a public availability of previews iOS
just made that big step forward earlier
this year but it was already around the
desktop for a while and I was going to
continue that with El Capitan the public
of beta won't be available until a
little later this summer and then
finally by fall everything we ready to
go live for everyone of course free
upgrades to existing users and we're
going to be learning more about this in
the weeks to come as we play with the
dev preview of elevate ourselves we
bring you more and more news about all
these improvements changes and great
things look forward to now tell me
something is it just me or that Apple
borrow a little from Windows 8 and now
and everyone's Oh what the whole
snapping of windows all around what do
you guys think of that look I've been
downloading so many tools on both my max
trying to get similar functions like the
snap feature so I'm just really glad to
see that that's finally making its way
here see I really hate that snap feature
I I like to drag my windows so they
they're mostly off screen and sort of
like a virtual desktop that's bigger
my actual screen and when things click
into the side I find it distracting but
at least is there as an option or if you
guys like it he'll be here built into
definitely wanted if you wanted a sample
of some world-class trolling all you
have to do is follow Adam doubt on
Twitter every single thing Apple
unveiled it was like wow this was seen
on another six months ago or two years
ago radio that's like from the nineteen
I don't know I I guess I have been so
frustrated by OS sent over the years
that I've been using it over the way it
handles windows that I'm actually happy
that they did this update because you
never know what size the windows are
gonna pop up whereas in Windows it's
always been smarter to do it and that's
my opinion so maybe there is a little
connection up going on here but it still
seems like a worthwhile improvement that
Apple users will be happy to see dr
definitely definitely another major
update that got announced today and we
were definitely waiting for it was iOS 9
I was nine it brings a lot of major
changes to the core OSS foundation and
it focuses on three specific points
number one extending battery life number
to improving performance and number
three enhancing security but it also
brings some added intelligence Apple has
really neglected Siri over the last
couple of years ever since it was
announced by us six and then just
completely ignored or sorry not iOS 6
but with the iphone 4s years ago um Siri
gets a lot of major improvements with
intelligence throughout the UI without
compromising privacy Apple made a big
issue about everything that's between
for privacy but for example they're
mentioning that it's forty percent
faster when it comes to responses it
also hasn't tracked the responses like
for example you could tell it you could
ask a detailed information like give me
information give me the photos that I
took in Utah three weeks ago and it'll
give you those specific photos on your
album which is extremely cool so it is
also contact sensitive once you get a
response you can also dig deeper within
and keep asking silly questions out of
it this context feature has been
existence in not since iOS 7 but it's
getting better with iOS 9 another thing
is that and I know that a lot of you're
waiting for this yes it looks like
Google now and the fact that you can now
swipe to the left
home screen yes even I know I could see
you there you're doing that you can
listen they're all wasn't that already
in iOS 6 or something couldn't you
already swipe left into directly into
the spotlight search or something with
it it ended with iOS 5 I believe ok ok
then when I was 5 so it was something
that came out with iOS three I believe
it was and then it got removed with iOS
5 and so now it's back and then for me
it was a smarter idea but what up the
reason why I'm saying this looks a lot
like Google mouse because it's proactive
so you swipe from the left it gives you
your frequent context that you always
contact and I apologize for the knows
everybody I'm at a coffee shop because
of power integrate yeah you're doing
your power and you're doing great honey
my size but yeah so for example it's
proactive and things like giving you
contact information giving you place
information from wherever you are for
example if you plug in your headphones
it'll give you the option to start a
playlist you can automatically add
compounder information if you get a male
appointment which is something Google
now currently does and for example
Turner is also an API for search which
is really cool so this allows
third-party developers to use the API
and give Cirie different commands to be
able to provide you with information so
it's just being called the proactive
feature it's not really I don't think
that's a final name I don't know if you
guys felt it that way but that's that's
pretty much what proactive is I don't
know if you guys have any insight on or
thoughts about it yeah I mean I think
it's so it's very important that Apple
get proactive right it looks like this
is one of those things that that that
Apple was doing playing some major catch
up on because Google was so far out
ahead of this predictive intelligence
graphing stuff with with Google now that
Apple really needed to come back and
kind of hit hard on this and it looks
like they have if everything works as
well as apple says it will which
actually is you know i mean it is
possible Apple tends to Apple does
release stuff that works as advertised a
lot of the time then proactive will will
sort of level the playing field i also
had somebody on twitter mentioned to me
very helpfully that this can index the
device whereas google now cannot which
is sort of helpful in a way that's a
generalized way of putting it but it's
helpful in terms of like hey read me
that last text which you can do on
Windows Phone you can do on iOS but
Google now we'll just sort of stare at
your dumb bleh unless I'm thinking okay
get somebody remind me what medication
is proactive because hi Otto is asking
you to get Neutrogena what the hell is
that okay yes that's like an acne
medication right it's one of Mandy Moore
and uh right no wonder you know about
this stuff I Otto you're still in that
phase oh yeah dick burn but anyway it's
like a me there's a lot more with iOS 9
first of all what Steven already
mentioned the nose updates we're not
going to go through that but Apple maps
gets updated uh this is also applies to
OS 10 it get it gets public transit it
gets a but not for all cities they're
only 12 cities to start but this whole
Syria active thing digs deep into Apple
maps it allows you to get contact
information and what's cool about it is
like for example if you want to come if
you want to commute through the subway
and you ask it for directions it'll give
you walking directions and it will tell
you if you will arrive on time to catch
a train for example which proves to be
useful it's something we're gonna have
to prove something else that's new is
Apple's new it's a new application it's
got a couple of publishers it's even got
free articles from New York Times which
you have to pay for uh it's it's adding
a lot of curated content and yes you can
bet we're going to figure out a way to
get on Apple news just to give you
another option to read our content the
biggest update to iOS 9 was really iPad
uses um finally Apple brings different
improvements the iPad and I'm surprised
that Apple didn't do this for the iphone
6 plus but for example uh because I
don't know if I'm if I'm mistaken but I
have been really so so for example you
can now multitask on the iPad you can
now you're now allowed to have a
split-screen multitasking and at the
same time this works in real time so it
works pretty much like sands and tablets
only the advantages this is dug deep
into the OS so you're not limited to
specific applications being able to do
this apparently you'll be able to do it
with every single application that
allowed core layout as part of the
developer tools so it really prints on
developers but I'm sure that they'll get
on the wagon immediately if they've
already adopted auto layout and size
classes than the yeah just wrkn require
go another thing that's there is fiction
picture video surf example you're
playing a video you can just snap it out
and watch your video as your as you're
doing something else which is really
cool and the only problem with this is
that sadly it's a only going to be
available on the iPad air 2 and comes to
the side by side snapping you can pull
out your notes application for example
from the side and write notes as you're
doing things but you won't be able to
snap things if you have a if you have an
older iPad and I'm surprised that the
ipad mini 2 did not get the the ipad
mini with retina display the newer one
didn't get this feature it seems that
it's only available in the ipad air 2
right I wonder because of the red isn't
the mini 3 not have the land 512 it no I
thought the mini 3 I thought that's the
minute gigabytes oh I see what you're
saying okay that's the difference in
yeah that's probably it other word
that's that's all right you were just
saying like that video snap feature is
so so compelling it on your when you get
a notification in a video and you tap it
in the video just auto minimizes the
fact that that is going to work on all
of the almost all of the iPads is is a
turtle working on four of them is the
problem air air too many 82 and mini
three yeah yes oh yeah three way split
here with iPads that can upgrade to iOS
9 those that get the side column and
picture and picture and then just the
air to getting the full on split screen
yeah yeah that is a bit of a
fragmentation thing yeah that's true
exactly another thing that we're getting
with the ipad keyboard and I find this
to be really cool is that now you can
turn the ipad keyboard into a touchpad
so you can pretty much navigate I just I
didn't see a mouse cursor anywhere in
the way you can navigate by using this
as a track that you can select things
really quickly and just it turns into a
gesture keyboard I really can't wait to
give it a try and I know you're gonna be
looking at this in your in your video
Michael tomorrow with a comparing it
comparing it yeah are you are you doing
a hands-on I'm doing the hands-on you're
doing the the comparison with with
Android app with Android M yeah that's
right thank you that's gonna be really
cool so yes everyone we have a lot of
coverage coming up other enhancements
with iowa's and I'm going to try to
close us down quickly we have
improvements battery life we finally get
a low-power
this is something that I phones at
needed but have desperately not had for
the longest time apparently the battery
improvements on their own give you an
extra one hour battery which is grateful
give it a try and and this low power
mode apparently extends your battery up
to three hours other things like for
example two steps of authentication for
iCloud are coming for security and even
better what software updates you will
now not need to start deleting
applications to have up to four point
six a good bites available if you have
1.3 gigs available on your devices
you'll be able to apply software updates
immediately so the developer figure is
out today you will be getting a consumer
preview in July and you can expect iOS 9
by later in the fall and that's all of
iOS 9 anything else Wow slow clap knows
a lot of material to get through there
have a nice work we have no time to stop
and reflect on that sadly i think is it
my turn to talk about the watch yes
please yes please go ahead very good
well Apple kicked off its discussion of
watch OS 2.0 with a retrospective of the
App Store there have been 100 billion
apps downloaded from the apple app store
100 + 1.5 million app titles total
exists in the app store apple cited a
figure of 30 billion dollars paid out to
devs and an interesting figure from the
video ninety-eight percent of all
fortune 500 companies have an iOS app so
Apple once again reminding us of how
important their their app store is to
them and sort of everyone else Tim Cook
had a great quote he said for us this is
a giant moment this is how we felt when
we launched the App Store and that was
in 2008 and this is of course referring
to the apple watch we believe in
technology designed for the wrist in
this notion that apps will somehow
legitimize the the notion of the
SmartWatch is something that I'm going
to be thinking about next week and maybe
writing about we can talk about it on
the podcast as well I want to divide
this into three categories things that
should have been there already things
that are actually pretty cool and some
new developer access so things that
should have been there already coming in
watch OS two point O native apps
formerly the watch had to rely on the
phone to run the logic portion of the
app which I do a lot of lag and
sluggishness whatever
we're going to move a lot of that a
pelagic from the phone to the watch in
this version so lag be gone probably
should have happened with version 1
because then it would have saved it a
lot of bad reviews with laggy slow apps
on the watch new watch faces will also
be available including apps where you
can watch face where you can put your
photo up there and you know your photo
album let it cycle through photos not
terribly exciting but good to have it
there time lapse face as well if you
take a lot of time lapses developers can
now make their own complications so you
can show your flight time show your home
entertainment system and status your car
charge status or an electric car sports
scores you can put all those you can add
those to the already existent
complications such as you know whether
sunrise and sunset times and all that
kind of stuff put it right on the face
where you want it to go on the face and
it'll be a variety of faces will support
these new complications so they'll be
also be a variety of templates still not
it's going to be a while for the Apple
watch to catch up to the variety of
watch faces on Android wear but and
pebble for that matter I think but it
this it's always good to have more tools
there those one-night stand mode when
charging this is all still stuff that
should have been there at launch if you
ask me but you can stick the thing on
its side and you've got a little alarm
clock face and what when it's charging
you know that's great friends you can
add a friend right from the watch you
can reply to a mail using your voice
FaceTime audio support comes in
alongside phone calls and now the
transit app updates will also hit the
watch to so right on your wrist you'll
be able to if you're a mass transit user
like I am you'll be able to see transit
times and departure times navigating
step by step and so on those are the
things that should have been there from
the beginning I thought things that are
actually pretty cool new feature called
time travel that'll allow you to when
you're looking at your watch face rotate
the digital crown and shows you more if
you rotate it forward it'll show you
calendar appointments that are in the
near future if you rotate it backward
it'll show you appointments you had
earlier today and earlier this week and
all that stuff it'll also move all the
other complications on the face so you
spend the digital crown and you can see
what the time will be and say Barcelona
not just now but in six hours from now
what the temperature will be then and so
on in addition to that bedside mode
you've got an alarm
lock and when the watch is lying on its
side if you don't have a charging
pedestal for it which it's boggles my
mind that Apple hasn't built one of
those the winners lying on its side its
buttons are up top so these digital
crown becomes the snooze button the
other button becomes a off button which
is cool Siri triggered glances say Siri
show me the Instagram glance which is
pretty cool the wallet view will make
its way to the watch as well Apple pay
support well that's already there but
now with the new well at view it'll all
come together into a nice little other
reason you don't have to pull your phone
out of your pocket which is the whole
point and you can now connect to you
will be able to connect to known Wi-Fi
networks automatically that's the kind
of the rundown of the the two main
categories of stuff and finally
developers will get access to a whole
lot of other stuff and watch os/2 to
build way cooler stuff they'll get
access to the watch speaker phone
bluetooth audio video playback health
kit access home kit access accelerometer
access all that it's going to be in the
dev is in beta today it is available for
download to devs today the beta version
it'll be available in the fold everybody
fo free and I'm really excited to try it
out except I have to buy an Apple watch
first cuz hi Mei Yu of mine where yours
I know I know but at least out of
everything that was announced I'm
literally looking forward to the health
and fitness updates particularly because
if you're not using Apple watches or
Apple's own health and fitness apps
everything is just terrible like Nike+
is terrible everything is terrible and
they will now be able to create in
applications that don't really rely on
the phone which is great really right oh
yeah having that bad man is to the heart
rate sensor data should empower some
interesting new apps to all right yeah
procedure baby go ahead good I'm just
I'm just really excited the digital
crown is getting more action cuz i do
think that's one of the hardware
elements of the watch and it didn't
really under you so far and I'm really
glad they're starting to leverage that
for more stuff I heard them announce
that a beyond you see Michaels eyes
lighting up you know that's right ya
know the Apple watch is bringing a lot
of cool stuff but Apple decided to
finish things with Apple music how about
if you run as quickly through that hi
out
yes so Apple music is I basically it's
it's going to be a new subscription
service kind of taking on services like
Spotify with a pretty similar price tag
it's going to be ten dollars a month for
the one user subscription and then it'll
be another five dollars a month so total
of fifteen dollars can get you up to six
people on the same account so everybody
can you know you can save some money
there and versus Spotify where I think
the fifteen dollar plan is just to users
and with Apple music you're basically
getting access to any of the music on
the iTunes Store as well as any of your
own rip cds and then there's the new
feature that they're introducing called
beats one which is basically a lie of 24
hour radio service where they have
curated a couple of that they've
gathered a couple of the top name djs
across the world that just kind of put
together these stations they host a
couple radio shows there will be some
exclusive music some interviews with
artists and things like that going on so
sort of a little public radio kind of
thing going on there and then they're
also introducing a kind of read
reintroducing ping from a couple of
years ago in a way and basically it's
going to be a platform where artists can
upload exclusive things to the service
like say their lyrics or some photos
from the backstage and when their shows
and fans can you interact with the with
the things that the Irish post on there
so they can share them across social
media they can comment on them and the
artist can reply back so it's just a
little interaction between the artists
and the actual listeners themselves so a
lot of a lot of the apple music idea is
just to sort of make music a bit more
accessible a bit more social and then
also just to give you a bit more of a
human sort of a mix instead of just
giving a shuffle system like iTunes or
Spotify does there's no there's no
virtual radio it's the all the stations
you're listening to are actually being
handpicked by these djs and the Apple
music will be launching for iOS devices
june thirtieth coming to android devices
later i said i think they said this fall
and windows as well i believe and
windows as well and this is going to be
their first this is gonna be apple's
first android app actually so they'll be
kind of interesting see not sure if
they're gonna do anything like material
design on there or maybe they'll just
stick with sort of their own iOS style
design who knows retinoic apple is gonna
be iOS design it probably will be yeah
yeah no yeah i know you touched on this
before but this is the question that's
been burning a hole in my head ever
since they talked about this for a half
hour on stage what is is this gonna tear
you away from Spotify at you personally
and if not why who is it going to take
away from Spotify who's gonna sign up
for this who's already using Spotify
who's gonna ditch Spotify for this is
there any other way I can phrase that
question no so why don't you just answer
I don't think I'm gonna switch away from
it I obviously haven't used it yet so I
can't say for sure but if it's the same
price to Spotify and I'm already
accustomed to it i've already got all my
all my music and my playlist on Spotify
I'm probably just gonna stick with what
I've got I'm really happy with it and it
works across all the sort of the
different platforms and services that I
use um but I think Apple music is going
to be a really good way to get a lot of
people to switch either from Spotify or
you know for new users to choose Apple
music versus Spotify mostly because it's
it's got a free three month trial at the
beginning so a lot of people who are
still kind of shaky on the whole idea of
paying a monthly subscription for music
streaming then kind of get some exposure
to that for three months without having
to pay anything and also because of the
family plan i mean like i said the yeah
definitely dollars for for two people on
spotify versus fifteen dollars for six
people it's no I'm serious even even
rhythmic wrote me recently he's like hey
are we gonna have a pocket now like
family account is like oh you know
that's not a bad idea but yeah I mean I
could see a lot of people doing that I
mean six people for fifteen bucks is
crazy yeah but that's that's a really
awesome price can I just ask one more
question before we move off of Apple
music that the radio stations are going
to be exclusive to Apple music
there's going to be no way to get them
aside from having an apple music
subscription is that right now they
mentioned that the beats one is going to
be able even without paying for the
Apple music subscription yeah I believe
so and that's really that's really what
I'm so the big question that I have left
is okay is Apple views it going to be a
separate app from your music application
or will this music application would
receive more functionality of you pay
that's what I'm I'm waiting to see the
beta to see what what exactly I think
it's gonna be the latter because I've
seen I saw a couple of little
screenshots and images of the home
screen before they actually launch the
app and it just says music on there so I
I doubt they would just make a second
app called music on the home screen just
kind of make it confusing i'm asleep
Marcus can could be could be yeah but
but um sorry anything else that's that
you got left the only the only thing I'm
wondering something I really like about
Spotify and I'm sure there are other
services like our do that probably do
this as well Spotify has a sort of a
collaborative way of making playlists so
I can create a public playlist or just a
private one between say my fiancé and I
and if you know if I want to throw some
songs on there then she wants to add
some extra things than you know it's
it's all going to be on to one list and
I don't know if I haven't seen anything
pointing to whether or not Apple music
will do the same thing and I really like
having that features that'd be pretty
sad to see that missing yeah yeah and
most likely Spotify will bring the heat
I mean if Apple is allowed to drop price
for family options and you know bring
all these features then I'm sure because
it truly is a cool service you know I
lap I love Spotify it's it's I use it
every single day so it's gonna be tough
to replace it for me jmeter standing
though I think Apple has its work cut
out for it in convincing users that it
has a more pure packed alternative than
the spa defies and the Pandora's out
there because maybe doing things a
little bit differently or putting a spin
on what other services offer but it
still sounds a lot like we're hearing
things we've heard
over and over again yeah anyways any
good helping of deja vu as well Stephen
so I'm with you on that and guys we are
clear what was the more the tribal that
just launched a few months back a title
title title yeah which is you know it
made a big point we're doing things
differently but everyone's hearing it
sounds exactly the same and it's pretty
much crashed and burned so well its
twenty dollars a month most people are
gonna pay that Apple better wake up
there personally gentlemen can we we are
running out of time so why don't we get
some final thoughts of what are your
impressions with your with the event
what things that you lack most released
and how about if we begin with Steven
for me the iPad multitasking was the the
biggest deal by far I know it been
rumored for over and over by now but I
still didn't really have it on my short
list of things I really expected Apple
to announce so when they did I was
impressed the way that it's going to
easily support software without you know
this the way we see it I'm Android yes
there are some multi window options
available but they're just not very
attractive because of the limitations
involves I think Apple has really blown
away the competition with the the broad
support that apps are going to have for
this even if the hardware support is
limited it's only going to get better
I'm sure the next generation of iPad
hardware all of them hopefully even the
mini included will support this maybe
this might even be setting the stage for
that you know plus sized version that
we've been talking about forever but
clearly as Apple Apple's establish that
it doesn't need a 12 something Inc iPad
in order to make this work so I'm really
curious to see how this works in action
if it says functional as Apple's made it
out to be but it's easily the most
impressive thing here nice nice how
about you Michael yeah mine's a bit more
of a tactical observation Steven sort of
stole mine in terms of the the feature
load but there's there's a broader one
here which is interesting Apple is
really doubling down and sort of
retrenching in its in its positioning
itself as the anti google it used this
event to reinforce the fact that it you
know it says it cares about your privacy
in this sort of direct affront to to
Google's information
feathering tactics that have that that
Tim Cook's started out I think a week
ago at another event just just slamming
google all over the place for for its
perceived privacy invasions in specific
it was talking about the proactive
assistant which i think is one of the
coolest things announced here and about
how it is going to function much like
google now but without associating with
your Apple ID all the stuff will stay on
device like Microsoft already did with
Cortana and it'll stay on device is not
going to go to the cloud it's not linked
to other Apple services it's not shared
with third-parties and your Apple ID
it's it's random aight uses randomized
IDs for sorry i just got distracted by
an i am but the point is oh shut up
whoever you are shut up it's me two to
three some so yeah no no just just just
another opportunity for Tim Cook to come
out and say or the whole Apple team to
come out and say hey you know those guys
in Mountain View who sell all your data
well we're not them and that's why you
should buy our stuff and not theirs and
I things can be really interesting to
see not only what Apple does with that
going forward but also how um
consistently they're going to be able to
deliver on that promise of being your
new best friend for privacy's sake
particularly after the whole scandal
with the whole Apple ID links remember
that so I think that they'd write up
need to do something any wicket but
anyways thanks and how about you high up
on a less philosophical note I'm gonna
have to kind of level with Steven there
i think that the multitasking was sort
of a blindside for me i really didn't
expect that at all to be announced today
so i'm really glad that they did that i
was a very impressed with the
implementation i'm also looking forward
to checking out apple music the only
thing i was really disappointed about
today was they they when they showed the
the new features with the keyboard I was
kind of excited thinking that they were
gonna finally add some gesture typing
like swype onto onto the stock iOS
keyboard because I've I had an iphone 6
for a couple of days and and was messing
around with some keyboards and SwiftKey
for iOS doesn't do it for me I don't
like
any of the any of the third-party
keyboards I've used so i'd really like
to see gesture typing make its way to
just the stock iOS keyboard and it's
it's still out there but you know it's a
my our complaint I'm still pretty uh
pretty impressed with with what happened
today so I can't really complain too
much and nice and you know actually I
follow you on that take away to end with
my final notes I guess we were expecting
a very conservative iOS tonight and
actually I find this to be ten times
cooler than iOS 8 and I feel that it's
even more featured pack that I'm Android
am but you can expect Michael Fisher's
full comparison acid tomorrow you're
definitely gonna have a hands-on video
very soon as well we have to the service
or jam that's gonna be a little
difficult but we are working on it
addition you can obviously expect the
pocket out daily with a full coverage of
everything we saw today our website is
already packed with as much news as you
can imagine with all the details of
everything that got announced and you
can expect that the pocket now weekly
will cover everything in depth later
this week so we've got a ton of coverage
