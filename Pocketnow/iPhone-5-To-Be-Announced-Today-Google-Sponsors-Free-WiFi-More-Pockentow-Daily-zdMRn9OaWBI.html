just a couple of hours nokia provides
details of all the software upgrades
coming to parent Lumia devices and
Google now sponsors public Wi-Fi but
obviously only for Android I'm high
metairie better waiting for some cook to
come on stage and this is parking out
daily probably the only thing that's
better than to have an iPhone announced
today is to see what the competition is
willing to do to deter your attention
from it amazonwireless has just
published a discount for the galaxy s3
where they're slicing the price in half
so you get the device after 2-year
contract for just a hundred bucks you
can even pay as low as five hundred and
fifty bucks for the device odd contract
I know many of you are going to wait for
the iphone to be announced but if there
are any broken hearts here this is the
way to go speaking of the galaxy s3
those of you interested in getting the
Android 4.1 jelly bean software upgrade
which pretty much makes all of you have
just got a release date Samsung came
clear on the fact that you'll get the
upgrade next month but they weren't
clear on when they just said next month
that's sadly far better than what Sony
does making you wait three months for
what next month means but still those of
you on the US carrier variance will most
likely have to wait but hopefully
Samsung will change that and hey Android
customers are in for a treat Google just
teamed up with a Boingo Wireless which
owns almost 4,000 Wi-Fi hotspots across
the United States to give you free
public Wi-Fi from here until the end of
the month all you have to do is log into
Google Play and owned an Android device
obviously for that to work talk about a
way to compete with Apple because this
does not work with the iphone or ipad
now Nokia just came on record to tell
current Lumia customers that they're not
being left out on the blue there weren't
specific as to window beginning windows
phone 7.8 but they were clear that all
for lumia handsets are getting the
upgrade and they'll also be getting
other enhancements that Lumia 920
customers will be getting like for
example city lens and cinemagraph now
obviously the list is quite big so hit
the look at the description for details
and let's hope the upgrade comes sooner
than later and finally yes that's right
is the day Apple will be announcing
their next-generation iphone in San
Francisco at ten a.m. pacific time and
the biggest question is what are we
going to get the leaks work great the
iphone 5 details were coming but the
problem is some of us don't believe in
them and that leads me to the question
of the day do you believe in all the
iphone 5 leaks or not I personally don't
I think that this was just Tim Cook's
new strategy on driving us away from the
real iphone just like they did last year
and hopefully we will be getting
something good but obviously this
question will self-destruct as of ten
a.m. pacific time on the device gets
announced and let's see what we get make
sure you leave us a comment down below
for now now if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on Parker now calm please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm hi Mary venom thanks
