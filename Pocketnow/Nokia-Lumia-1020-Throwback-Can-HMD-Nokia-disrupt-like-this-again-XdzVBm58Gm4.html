Just Don’t Make ‘em Like they used to”
but let’s be frank, no one ever made em
like this.
HMD is doing a solid job reviving the Nokia
label by delivering attractive handsets, with
the appropriate feature sets at competitive
prices.
Looking forward to the future of this company,
there are some old school Nokia philosophies
we hope HMD will revive.
The more daring experiments.
The more audacious designs, and the bigger
specs.
We want to see a few more risks.
Nokia is responsible for so many warm fuzzy
nostalgic smartphone memories, but in our
current camera obsessed culture, the Lumia
1020 is one of our favorite phones to revisit.
The mega sensor smartphone that actually got
a proper release here in the united states,
and got some real marketing muscle from Microsoft,
while managing to maintain a reasonable phone
form factor.
Not just a resolution champ, the 1020’s
camera sensor surface area delivered low light
performance and natural bokeh the likes of
which we’d never seen before on our shores.
The execution was tactical and simple.
A big camera sensor is likely an expensive
individual component, so taking the well worn
tech and manufacturing of phones like the
920, and bolting on this delicious oreo, was
a safe way to reign in costs.
Looking back, this hardware gets so much right.
Point and shoot camera ergonomics, with a
dedicated shutter button, it avoids the unpocketable
trap of zoom lens phones like the Galaxy Zoom.
It’s also refreshing revisiting this polycarb
frame.
Sure cheap plastic will feel cheap, but this
phone doesn’t feel cheap.
It’s still sexy hardware.
It’s just a shame that Microsoft lacked
the consistency and the fortitude to make
Windows Phone a real threat to iOS and Android.
It’s still my favorite user interface, live
tiles are great, and it runs phenomenally
well on lower power hardware.
This is five year old hardware, dual core
cpu, 2GB of RAM, and it’s still able to
provide a reasonably smooth experience on
a newer build of Windows 10.
That’s a great argument in favor of efficiency.
I just don’t have the same confidence in
a Galaxy S4 running Nougat as well, even with
substantially more powerful internals than
what Nokia graced the 1020 with.
Of course the main story here is this camera.
We’re just dancing around it, that’s why
you’re really watching this video.
Large sensor, partnership with Zeiss, Image
stabilization and a real shutter.
This thing is a beast.
It’s super slow, but the output from this
shooter still handily competes with modern
phone cameras.
Current phones have more consumer friendly
modes, pretty color super saturation HDR processing,
artificial software background blur, ai and
ar options, and significantly snappier shot
recycle times, but photo to photo, its tough
to beat the super high resolution shots from
this pureview, especially when comparing raw
files.
In general, well ahead of the curve for manual
options, and this interface is still one of
the most organic for quickly adjusting photo
settings and staying focused on your subject.
This phone was never intended to run windows
10, and it introduces a clumsy combo of Lumia
and Microsoft camera apps, but it does fix
one issue from this phone’s windows 8 days.
Where I prefer the Lumia camera app for stills,
the Microsoft camera app has better support
for video and autofocus performance.
As a phone photog, it’s just so much fun
revisiting this gadget even if the experience
is ultimately bittersweet.
We never saw this line, this idea evolve.
We never got that Lumia 1030 or 1050.
Big baller camera hardware bolted onto a faster
chipset with more RAM, a quad microphone array,
a higher resolution display.
It could have been epic.
It’s where we’re apprehensive and hopeful
for a resurgent Nokia under HMD.
The pieces look like they’re in place.
HMD is made up of a sizable number of classic
nokia alumni, the Nokia Zeiss partnership
is back in place, yet early efforts from the
two companies have been more than a bit underwhelming
on the photography front.
Now we’re seeing rumors of a Nokia 10, an
exciting number for us old Lumia fans, could
this finally be our follow up to the 1020?
Instead of another single mega sensor, those
rumors pointing to a penta-lens array of cameras
on the rear.
Maybe different focal lengths, maybe a crazy
zoom, some even suggesting a multifocusing
and multi focal length experiement akin to
a lytro camera.
It’s not exactly what we purists were hoping
for, but honestly, any experiment, any risk
in this market will be a welcome one.
That is, if it can live up to the Nokia name
of old.
And of course we want to hear from you.
The market is marching towards more computational
photo editing, is a five sensor camera what
HMD needs to rekindle some interest?
