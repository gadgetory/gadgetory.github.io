paco calm and for those of you that want
to know what's going on around New York

political National World crime we can go
to sports and we can check on the
Rangers the Knicks the Jets the Giants
the Mets and the Yankees so I believe
the Yankees are in spring training right
now so if we go to gossip we can look
what's going on so it looks as though
Michael Jackson's dr. Conrad Murray
accused of causing delays at singer's
death bed so that's not good and go a
little further to local news and this is
where we can get our local New York news
so the columnist tab is pretty cool
because it gives editorial views on
various topics so if we go to the
opinion tab we can actually get people's
views on the current events that are
occurring right now so if we want to go
into an article all i have to do is
click on it and if i want to save this
article it's pretty simple all i do is
click Save article and this will
actually save to the cash on this
particular program so they go into
settings I can go into my account I can
change the display screen font images I
can load images or not load images if I
like so I can go into cash and I can
save up to five thousand articles or I
can also change that number if I like so
just click done and I can integrate this
with Twitter and I can integrate this
with Twitter just by clicking on here I
can enter my twitter name and password
