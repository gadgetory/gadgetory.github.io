weekly hello and welcome to episode 0 18
of the pocket now weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocketnow.com where we
discuss what's hot and what's cool in
the world of mobile technology Windows
Android iPhone sometimes even blackberry
sometimes even symbian we discuss
everything that's mobile I'm your host
Michael Fisher senior editor at pocket
now I'm joined by our managing editor
anton d Naja good afternoon to you sir
greetings everybody and by our
editor-in-chief Brandon minimun good
morning to you hello hello hello we've
been going over listeners and and fellow
and co-host we've been going over on our
target time by like half half an hour by
like 40 minutes the last couple episodes
of the weekly have been like like almost
two hours long and yeah but I want to
get one free bin ridiculous exactly so
we're going to try and keep it a little
bit tighter today I know we always say
that but we we have a plan there's a
somewhat shorter topic list and we're
going to get in-depth but Before we jump
into the real topics of the day just for
our for our abbreviated podcast pre-show
/ thought thread I want to take a
nostalgia trip this is episode 0 18 this
is episode 18 of the pocket now weekly
which coincidentally happens to be the
age that I was when I bought my first
mobile phone and listeners if you don't
reside in America I know it's different
in every country in America 18 is when
you can do a lot of things you can you
know you can vote who can serve in the
military except drink you can't drink
which is absurd but that's kind of a
topic for a whole nother podcast but you
you can you know could you start kind of
taking control of your life in a legal
sense and I was due to take a trip to
Washington DC with my then girlfriend
and I was going to borrow my mother's
cell phone which is that which was this
this thing and I was like well I don't
want to really do that so I went to
Radio Shack which is
I got my first my first mobile phone and
so I didn't have any credit and in in
America if you want to be with one of
the bigger wireless carriers of course
you need you need a lot of credit
history or you're gonna pay a
five-hundred-dollar deposit or a two
hundred dollar deposit or something but
not with sprint in 2001 where you yeah
that explains it does doesn't it where
he there was no deposit no no special
fees no nothing and I got a samsung SCH
3500 and readers might remember this
from from our brief are short-lived
series on where we're coming from from a
couple months back but it was a one of
those one of those analog and digital
you know duel mode phones that was a
flip phone but it wasn't a clamshell
like the screen was always present but
the you guys know what I'm talking about
where the flip like goes over the screen
and the screen is visible whether it's
open or closed hmm it was the coolest
thing to have in in two thousand and two
thousand one and I my favorite feature
of this phone of which I carried for
even then even when was my first phone I
didn't manage to carry more than a year
i was i was bored of it in six months
and i had to get something else but I
adored it so much my favorite feature
was the voice tiling which sprint was
aggressively pushing back then and it
had ten slots and you had to record you
know you had to record the phrase it
didn't recognize words he just
recognized the sound so you were like
you know call dad at home and it's like
rerecord okay call dad at home and then
you know and then it would recognize
that and it worked well and for all of
the 49 contacts that it stored I could I
could die all 10 of them in a voice
tiling fashion so that's that's my
little nostalgia trip in the morning I
want to hear I want I want to hear
Brandon's first phone ever because I
Tony's answer is gonna be more exotic to
me as a Romanian answer so did Brandon
tell us about your first is this is
this for a smartphone ur right any phone
your first mobile phone this is we're
going a little a field of our normal
area of expertise aha I had this kyocera
joint um what I would do this is
the days of smartphones well I guess it
would be in the mid to early 2000s and I
would go to the verizon store cuz my my
mom was on verizon my dad too and I
would go to the store and I would look
for this display or the device with the
most amount of pixels on the screen I
kid you know no I even by then I have my
love for pixels started i think when i
got my speak n spell um when i noticed
that the you know the little little
digits would be crisp and clear it was
great 20 found this it was like a
kyocera phone it wasn't a smartphone it
had probably a 64 x 300 AD gray matrix
display and it really didn't do very
much but i would i would spend hours
flipping through the menu systems just
because I cared about you know the
deepest settings of the phone kind of
like I would do with my GI 83 in high
school and you know that's it that's
another story but it had a retractable
antenna and I remember I would chew on
it kind of as a weird habit and my my
mother didn't like that very much but I
mean it was it was kind of boring but at
the time you know I was like wow look at
all these look at all these pixels I can
almost see it group I couldn't see a
graphic if I squint right are you like
you can almost see a diagonal line
that's not that's not terribly jagged I
remember yeah I mean it was still like a
staircase right diagonal lines okay what
does that thing that your sketches like
I just right right wow that's awesome
that I can't but I can't believe your
obsession with pixel density goes back
it goes back that far um but that's
that's crazy what about what about you
telling coincidentally i was also 18
when I got my first mobile phone but
that happened in 1998 so I got a I got
to use the dinosaurs in the technology
and my first very first phone was the
Ericsson GA 628 it was this huge phone
which basically I'm looking at the spec
sheet right now the size of the display
wasn't in pixels but it wasn't
characters so it had one
12 charge so I'm looking at it right now
as well that is a look at those yeah
right you know that phone had
interchangeable color plates so if you
look at the stock images that blue thing
you could change that out with yellow or
red or green or whatever your color
flavor was but I had the upgraded I
think it was six months later than that
to a Bosch 607 which had a display of 4
x 16 characters which had a orange
backlight and it was it was awesome it
had an extendable antenna and of course
in nineteen ninety that was the year
when the first cellular companies
started off in in Romania the first two
which were later acquired by Vodafone
and orange respectively but one one
thing just as the misc when my battery
died in my initial Eric's on GA 628 my
dad correct opened the battery case and
replaced the batteries with normal eight
a size batteries four of them and that
gave me one we had that give me one week
of battery life I wish I could do that
now but awesome i remember reading a
story about a guy trying to modify his
palm SCH i 502 put a bluetooth module in
or something back in the day and he I
may have spoken about this before but he
nicked to the battery bag while he was
inside the casing and apparently this
blue column of flame just shot up from
the phone and like eight his kitchen
ceiling I mean it's it's amazing what
how much power is contained in these
lithium-ion cells and how volatile they
are if you screw with them thank you for
for indulging me in this this kind of
off-topic thought thread and gents
because I it's it's so funny to like
listeners and you guys like if you if
you just have a nostalgia trip and you
want to Google pictures of old phones
that you were your friends might have
done because I was googling your your
answers guys and the internet was so low
res back and you know the 2002 or 2001
like the pictures that I got
particularly of your Bosch 607 Tony are
like like they're blown up a little bit
so it's like for 60 x 360 for 345 is the
biggest image I can find and even that
is like it's just tiny
like that was the name of that internet
service on feature phones it was like
five dollars a minute and it was like
not even close to the reel web what was
that called something like coffee cup or
Java or owed will Joab oh what ya like
that would have been like when it was
written in web standard and stuff like
that yeah yeah yeah we had and we still
have web access around here really yeah
i mean that's that's for free for for
normal prepaid phones aside from data
connection yeah so web usually comes for
free here you remember when water the
wireless internet used to be charged on
a permanent basis like like minutes
there's like circus circuits which data
ah nightmarish Minnie oh please right
well let's let's jump back into into
modern-day here with them we're gonna
lead off the week with a bunch of
android stuff and ran and i would like
you to kick this off because you have
the most experience with with this
google opened up pre-orders for the
nexus 4 and the nexus 10 and i think our
headline probably says it best google's
pre-order experience for the nexus 4 and
10 was horrible yeah let me let me start
off from the very beginning so usually
when a company has a new product up for
sale that that is hot and desired that's
a funny way to start it they give you a
pre-order time like you know everyone
knows that Apple pre-orders start at at
midnight pacific or 383 a.m. eastern so
Google up until the day of the nexus 4
and 10 pre-order had on their page it
said pre-orders start on I think it was
the 13th of November and so no one
really knew when it was going to start
so I i got up at 3am and i kept
refreshing the page until 4am yes i am a
little crazy in in that respect and so
and so I thought to myself okay probably
it's going to be later in the morning
and by the time for aim for am came
around I was checking some of the texts
lights and they said you know it looks
like it's going to be at noon um Pacific
or actually noon noon eastern and and
9am Pacific's I said okay so I'll wait
to the next day so I I I go to my
computer after lunch and I sit down it's
it's 1145 15 minutes before the
pre-order I go to the nexus for
pre-order page third
add to cart button I'm like sweet I'm 15
minutes early I'm gonna get my my nexus
4 I click Add to Cart and then I go into
my cart and it says your cart is empty I
proceeded to do that exact thing about
15 to 20 times and that takes me about
15 or 20 minutes so then it's twelve
o'clock and by that time the add to cart
button had changed to a notify me button
as if they were sold out within 15
minutes even though the pre-order didn't
really start yet they turned it on 15
minutes early and so I SAT there
frustrated I did get an order in for the
nexus 10 but it was really the nexus 4 I
was after so I kept hitting refresh and
it just so happens that everyone out of
20 page loads the notify button would
change to add to cart so I'm thinking
sweet maybe you know they've got some
more inventory it's only 12 10 10
minutes after the pre-order and so I
click Add to Cart and I go to my cart
and it's in the cart and I'm like yes
I'm gonna do this so then I hit the
proceed button and then this thing
rotates and it times out and then I'm
like that's okay I still have it in my
cart I go back to my card it says your
cart is empty so I start cursing
profusely I go back to that page i
refresh I keep doing that so that after
a very long time it takes about two
hours I successfully placed an order for
an eight gigabyte model but I didn't
want the 8 gigabyte model I kind of got
it by accident so I thought to myself
okay you know I'll get the 8 gigabyte
model I'll send it to one of the other
pocket now guys and so it's also scraps
to the guys yeah go ahead yeah so I'm
thinking okay it's two hours later I'm
going to try for a 16 gig so I keep
refreshing the page and then I get the
add to cart button and after a very long
time I finally successfully order a 16
gigabyte I nexus 4 at this point the Sun
is up right yeah well I mean it were it
were at like you know 3 p.m. at this
point um so I'm feeling pretty confident
and then I go into the google play store
where they show you order status and um
I am very curious about when I'm going
to get the fee nexus 4 i'm thinking
maybe i'll get it the next day on
wednesday maybe i'll get the day after
that on Thursday and so I see both of my
orders listed before the eight gigabyte
and the 16 gigabyte the eight gigabyte
under status says complete which is
weird with no shipping info the 16
gigabyte version says shipping estimate
November 15th so I'm a little frustrated
thinking you know okay if it ships on
the 15 that probably won't get it till
the 16th of the 19th and so then the
15th comes around and then Google sends
out these emails to most people that pre
ordered the nexus 4 and said and that
says you know due to overwhelming demand
we're not gonna be shipping these for
three weeks oh but we're gonna give you
free shipping for all of your troubles
cuz that's the same as being awesome
yeah and I've just gotta wonder number
one how could the tech company with the
most amount of servers in the world have
such a screw-up with the pre order
process how could their communication
have failed so tremendously and why did
it what was wrong with their system that
had it had had so many people thinking
that they successfully placed an order
for a nexus 4 when really the stock was
probably sold out within 3 or from its I
mean how many units did they have 100
units yeah it was just it was the worst
pre-order experience ever and if I was
the if I was an average person I would
probably say you know screw the nexus
where I'm gonna get a galaxy s3 or a
droid DNA or something because this is
just ridiculous yeah and I'm looking for
you know a mentions just googled you
know like Google pre-order Fiasco Nexus
4 i'm kind of looking for for other
reports on this and everyone's kind of
reporting on the back order and stuff
but it doesn't seem like Google has
offered Google hasn't offered any
comment on this right there just sorry
here's some free shipping that's that's
basically the extent of their
involvement yeah and to be honest I
don't even know if Google really owes
anyone an apology I mean you know we're
so used to companies like Apple
anticipating the high demand and and so
you can still place your pre-order write
it right after they sell out it's just
the shipping date changes there's a lot
of transparency they tell you you know
you're gonna have to wait a little
what Google just was was completely non
communicative about this whole entire
process and it probably pissed off a lot
of people it sounds like yeah it sounds
like yet another kind of kind of fail on
Google's end in the customer service
department if you I feel like Google is
um I feel like Google's like a giant
version of us when we get really busy
and in a whole bunch of comments come in
and we can't answer them all like right
away you know because we generally do
make an effort to answer comments that
ask questions and comments that pose
interesting points of discussion but
sometimes you know you're just so busy
that you can't handle it I feel like
Google is that way with orders yeah
maybe but but you know if Google's
trying to make a world-class device here
that is better than anything else they
need to provide world-class customer
service a world-class that order
experience agree I mean those are the
bare minimums right ya know I I concur
and I mean while we're talking about it
to that the I went out to get some
coffee today and there was a box on my
porch that had a circular logo on it and
I felt sure it was the samsung logo and
I was really excited but it turned out
to be an old navy package for my
neighbor so screw you old navy and your
branding but so I'm waiting on a nexus
10 today which listeners if you listen
to this before it goes up have a have a
keep refreshing pocket now because we're
gonna have a ax and unboxing on that
shortly it Brandon thank you for for you
know soldiering on through all that
those difficulties there it's it's
unfortunate that that took place but um
it's more concerning to me in in kind of
a sense of what could come from google
in the future because its customer
service in particularly in the wireless
industry particularly in the wireless
carrier industry has typically gone by
the wayside and Google there's a report
from the wall street journal today that
google is reportedly in talks to become
a wireless carrier Tony you wrote the
story didn't you yes I did what can you
just give us a very quick rundown of
this rumor and how it's how is this
different from from rumors like this in
the past well I can't tell you exactly
but I can tell you this much this is
that
kind of news which he can boast under I
don't know a huge question mark because
the original source The Wall Street
Journal cited some of course anonymous
sources within the who are familiar with
the matter to be specific that said that
some said that Google might have but
then again some other said the Google
might have not discussed with a certain
TV provider satellite TV provider dish
network the name doesn't say anything to
me here in Europe maybe you guys in the
u.s. know it better they're pretty big
here AMC hates them but yeah yes so that
that's the entire thing that google
might have or might not have discussed
with DISH Network to use their part of
the spectrum to start a network provider
basically who would compete with the
AT&amp;amp;T verizon sprint and the others I
think that the best case scenario here
if it comes to fruition is a
dramatically changed wireless industry
for the better because we know that when
Google enters a new industry like this
let's say with their fiber they offer it
one at a very low cost and to an
extremely fast advanced beads so if
Google gets this right it's very
possible they could offer plans that are
half as is half as expensive they could
launch lte-advanced right out of the bat
with some compatible phones that go with
it shot asked if they would go
lte-advanced right out the gate that
sounds like something they would do
right it sounds like something they
would do giving us 100 megabits per
second down and so forth but of course
you know there this is a highly
regulated industry and you might see
something like Google Fiber where they
start off in like one city and then two
cities and at this rate google fiber for
example I think will be ubiquitous in a
very long period of time in fact so far
a way that this advantage that they have
of one gigabit per second internet might
be less of an advantage because Verizon
and Comcast and all those from internet
providers see it coming and the same
thing could happen with the with the
wireless thing but you know I they've
been working on this or talking about it
i'm assuming they've been working on for
a very long time so I reason to believe
that if they were to launch a wire a
wireless carrier
that it would be closer to the former
scenario words in a lot of cities and
it's it's advanced its LTE you know guys
a couple of commenters were happy
because allegedly there is some sort of
monopoly in the form of not one carrier
but more carriers in the states agreeing
on rates and stuff like that and they
basically applauded the idea of Google
entering the market but here's one thing
for you guys I'm google and you are the
two biggest carriers AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
and I tell you guys okay starting
January 1 2013 I'm gonna start my own
network and my rates will be basically
half of your rates what will you guys
say and I don't know exactly but here's
what i would say i would say you know
what google get all your android phones
off of my shelves and sell it yourself
oh yeah right but then you gotta I mean
if I'm verizon or AT&amp;amp;T I've got to like
see what that's gonna do to my to my
bottom line right because i can't just
subsist on iphones and windows phones
yeah but you know you'll kill google if
you do that so it's basically bluffing
right well the the wireless carriers who
couldn't just pull their android phones
i mean that's that's probably the
majority of their business at this point
yeah yeah so I don't think that's a I
don't think that that's a reasonable
threat if if Google came out with plans
that were half as expensive I think they
would probably be investigated by the
antitrust people in suits because that
would that would be sort of using
Google's school and not you know scale
or power to influence the market and it
you know let's face it these carriers
can't cut their plans in half they
already um you know especially sprint
and t-mobile they they need more revenue
so that they can survive yeah right so
this would be this would be terribly
destructive that would be terribly
destructive and Google probably knows
that and they probably don't want to be
investigated and so they probably would
have lower lower rate plans but they
wouldn't like come in at a dramatically
lower price yeah and even if they did
like I said I don't think carriers are
gonna drop Android because they need
android it's a very interesting thing to
to think about a new carrier and I'll
just this will be my last thought on it
I I think that it's been a long time
since those of us in the geek sector
have really thought about carriers and
that used to be you know those used to
be the fanboy wars back when when dumb
phones were were kind of they were never
really quite the same but they were
certainly there were much fewer
differences between dumb phones as there
are between smartphones and people would
fight on the internet not over there
manufacturer usually so though that
happened to they would fight over the
carrier like you know I would sit there
and and and you know to watch people
defend bell atlantic against you know
mci or or whatever and it's just like
okay you know it so I even thought about
carriers in a long time except in the
context of this is the pipe that allows
my cool device to work but I think
Google if they ever did this they would
bring something a lot more interesting
to the equation I don't think they will
I mean I don't you don't know enter like
enter yeah i think this this does smell
like one of those rumors that just is
kind of like a pipe dream right it'll
never come to pass who's not who knows
we'll see another thing they could do
just letting my creativity run a little
wild is that they can be the first
carrier to do exclusively LTE / voice
since they be i know all their felt a
sort of live with LTE advanced and yeah
they could just don't eat i don't think
you need lte-advanced to do that but you
need you need you need int volt owns to
do it yeah well you just need to
implement voice over LTE on the network
side and then the phones need to be
compatible with that are any are any
phones out there right now volt vol 2 e
compatible volte was wasn't the HTC
Thunderbolt volte capable but they never
flipped that on something which I feel
like I wrote a piece on this and then
immediately forgot everything I learned
I don't know that will be interesting
because as we've talked about a little
bit like once or twice you know are we
have these amazingly capable data
devices in our hands but the minute we
use to make a phone call it's going over
this you know this network that only
supports what is it's like 13 kilobits
per second marable codex yeah which is
you know which was implemented because
they needed a lot of compression because
voice calls take up a lot of bandwidth
or they used to
and so it makes sense but you sound
terrible I hate talking on the phone one
of the reasons I hate talking on the
phones because you it's like what did
you say you sound like you don't you
guys have HD voice well the phones are
launching with it but the networks
aren't capable of handling it right now
well the orange here in Romania has HD
voice have you ever heard it Tony yeah
really whatever it's it's like
cd-quality voice whenever you are on a
3g coverage then it will switch
automatically to HD voice and it's
basically CD quality versus the old LP
or cassette that's awesome it's this
isn't putting me in mind of having old
phone conversations back in the day when
I would when I was selling a I den when
I was selling nextel like they the voice
quality was so good because I den was is
different and weird and whatever but I
used to you ever you ever talk to those
people on the phone who don't have a
good phone voice and i don't mean it's
annoying i mean that their voice has a
particular frequency range that they
just they sound muddy all the time you
can barely hear what they're said he
used to date a over it was like I don't
I love hanging out with you but I do not
want to talk to you on the phone because
I can't hear a word you're saying I have
no idea what you're saying right now
stop talking exactly yeah anyway I sort
of know what you mean via the evo 4g LTE
on sprint is HD Voice capable although I
don't know if they've rolled that out d
on the iPhone 5 is actually I think it
has a competing high-definition thingy
cuff like what are they it's like a what
does it call it's like full spectrum or
I remember hearing about that yeah and
we were all very excited in the live
chat we're like oh HD voice and then
everyone's like yeah but nobody's gonna
support it yeah yeah I don't think
carriers care about it you know I don't
think there are many people I mean
everyone's so used to the 13 kilobit per
second audio quality of a phone call
then they care a little bit more about
data speeds I'd that's called it's
called wideband audio by the way ah yeah
and they made a big deal about how it
boosts the mid-range Phil Schiller is
talking about it in an animated fashion
on my screen I'm guys I'm just looking
at my carrier and and I was looking at
the carrier because I remembered having
HD voice calls with lower
phones too so I had an HD voice using my
samsung Taylor developer windows phone 7
device from back in the day and so
here's here's the page from Orange
Romania it says phones with HD Voice
apple iphone 5 LG optimus l7 HD HTC
Desire see HTC one s HTC One X nokia
asha 302 Lumia 610 Lumia 800 Lumia 900
galaxy s2 galaxy ace galaxy s3 that
sends out of sums with HD voice yeah a
lot of phones yeah geez I'm surprised to
see this is when you get into that kind
of differing network you know capacity
thing where you're like whoa wait woman
so where's this compatible and what's
going and then I wonder if I did like
some street test this would be fun to do
in about a year when some carriers in
America have it rolled out and just do
some on the street sidewalk interviews
like please let's just do this test
phone call for 10 seconds and tell me
which one sounds better and see if
anybody can actually tell the difference
on the street hmm you know I would want
I wonder what skypes bitrate is because
skype has such good audio quality i do
too yeah i just searched google for
skype iterate and i found it's probably
variable based on based on speed the
network speed and you know then we just
like when you stream video and it said
when it when you have a fast connection
if you flip the HD and then if you your
connection drops to lower speed then it
will switch to SD yeah you used to be
able to force to force your phone back
in the day to to use a different codec
excuse me if you wanted a higher voice
quality but then the network would
always override it it was this is like a
whole nostalgia day for me of like ye
olde howardforums talks anyway let's
let's move on guys cuz there is there's
actually big news that they will want to
talk about this is kind of my my biggest
news of the week because I was the one
who was there i covered the HTC and
Verizon announcement in New York City on
Tuesday for their latest collaboration
which ended up being the droid DNA this
is HTC's if you've must have heard about
it but if you have an it's HTC's newest
device for Verizon Wireless yeah this
device that they called about fifth
hundred times at the presentation the
ultimate droid that ultimate was their
huge buzz word of the day that mean is
the last one yeah final the only HTC
omega ya know it's and it's the phone
that the public is is kind of if you
haven't handled it it's very tempting to
call it a phablet and it's I think
something we've talked about the podcast
over and over again as as the butterfly
J for Japan as the the the DI X the DLX
but it's not it's not any of those
things a butterfly J is out in Japan but
this is our version in America it's the
droid DNA and I think there's an
unlocked version plant as well it is not
at all a phablet in the hand it feels it
almost identical to the one x it feels
like a lengthened HTC One X with with
cute design cues from Windows Phone 8
and of course a giant 10-8 a 5-inch
1080p panel but despite the fact that
this panel is is so comparatively huge
because of the way the phone is designed
it just doesn't it doesn't feel any
bigger in the hand really it feels a lot
like the iphone 5 to be honest with you
not in terms of like it's metal but you
know it's it's it's materials but in its
form factor it's just it's it's thin and
it is lengthy in the hand and it's
that's great I really really really like
it and I know Brandon over there has
been just amped to to hear about this
because it's ask you about things away i
was gonna say right i I do i do have
some questions for you Mike yeah please
please please because I've got it in my
hand right now it is the black version
the only one that is around at the
moment and ask away man this thing is
I'm smelling a Joe Levi tweet with you
saying you have its new your hands I
knew how I I just really i should say
I've I was tempted to say that's what
she said about seven times this is a
very happy day for that's what she saids
like it's like almost that's what she
saids right yeah yes and good figure
it's unprofessional um yeah so I I I
guess for to put forth one observation
in your comparison video with the
optimus G I was amazed to see that
despite all those pixels and with a
similar processor
the droid DNA keeps up and in some cases
beats the optimus G right right so yeah
it does the background on that as Joe
leave I wrote an editorial on you know
the basically saying the DNA is likely
to be slower than the optimus G and why
you shouldn't care and it's it's a good
editorial and basically that's his
argument right these phones run very
similar hardware under the hood they've
got the Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro two
gigs of ram yada yada and the same GPU
of course and but the DNA is driving
like twice as many pixels and actually
the math gets a little fuzzy on that we
don't know if it's two million pictures
or whatever but but it's like yeah
there's a lot there's a lot more display
to drive so wouldn't you think this
would be a slower phone and it's not I
tested him in a side-by-side video the
optimus G was just alpha fresh factory
reset and the DNA obviously was brand
new and no I mean that it runs just
smooth as silk even with HTC sense 4
plus on it which is something else so so
you're using this phone and obviously
the display is stunning and that's great
if you want to show your friends at a
party or if you want to watch a 1080p
movie and get a magnifying glass out but
when you're actually using the phone
when you're emailing browsing the web on
Twitter and Facebook do you think to
yourself and stop and say this is this
is better this is better than galaxy s3
this is better than the optimus G or is
it just kind of fade away and it's it's
you kind of forget about all those
pixels I think that's gonna be the last
question I have to answer to myself
before I write the review because
there's all these competing things
happening in my brain right we're like I
look at the thing and I'm like this is
absolutely a beautiful display and you
look at rounded corners on the sense
clock and it's like there is not a hint
obviously it's 440 PPI there's not a
hint of any pixilation there but at the
same time I'm like what I'm being
conditioned right I I know this is a
1080p phone I understand that the
display is a huge part of it am I seeing
something am I making it up and you know
as my brain seeing more of a difference
than it's actually there between this
and a 720p display I will tell you
before I answer that question for myself
which will be you know for the review
this is absolutely one of the most
beautiful displays I've I've ever
encountered and it
the viewing angles HTC was big to point
out that the 80 that you can view it
from like 80 degree offset you can
actually probably do it amazing oh it's
nuts I mean I'm looking at it almost
edge-on right now and it's it's as it's
as though I'm holding one of those
cardboard screened demo models for like
third-party retailers because like the
print on paper it's like yeah it's like
it's it's like it's paper right on the
face of the thing it is just incredible
I was about to ask yeah Michael you know
when we're it shows and we're checking
out new display panels or new phones the
manufacturer usually embeds phones in
the table and covers up the phones
themselves and only leaves the screen so
you can compare the screens between
their flagship and the competition now
imagine this if you would only see the
screen of the HTC One X which was a
great screen compared to the screen on
the droid DNA would you would you find
any difference would you say that okay
this is hands down the best or this
hands down better or this is obviously
Detroit DNA and the other one is the 1x
that that is a really good question I
you know they're there is a shape
difference here that the DNA screen is
taller so of course that is whether
whether that's good or bad it's up to
you as far as resolution wise I just
don't know I need to have a look at them
both I unfortunately don't have a 1x on
the Boston office anymore to compare it
with but I tell you I think and this may
be a software thing I I certainly think
it is much more impressive than the
display on the galaxy s3 but i need to
do you know i need to do some
comparisons here and see i would really
like to do and speaking of on the street
stuff something similar to the thing I
just suggested with the display you know
I'd like to just go up to the random
person be like here's two phones and
they're covered up wounds like which
which display do you find more appealing
you know we got to get you on the
streets man sorry like a pansy yeah I
want to do some investigative reporting
get high my up here with a rig and I'll
have a handheld microphone ya know and
it yeah what's interesting about this
though guys is that like there's a lot
that HTC stole from itself you
in the windows phone from the Windows
Phone 8x like its did this kind of form
factor which is very narrow on the edges
and if you look at it edge on top or
bottom it almost looks like at the Nokia
smile even where it has like the you
know the bulging back and the thin edges
it is lightweight and the front facing
camera is also that same ultra
wide-angle thing yeah which HTC was very
keen on showing us and by the way their
whole presentation was really cool it
was very brief they showed us a video
they had the president of HTC America
come up and the verizon CMO and it was
you know it was it was quick it was
brief it was fun and they got us a
review unit promptly which we really
appreciate yes I gotta tell you though
the responsiveness this is HTC Sense
this is sense for plus running on top of
jelly bean for not for that one dot one
I think and it is it's just it's the way
sense was supposed to be I mean it
doesn't feel like it you know it feels
like that's interesting it isn't that
that I was gone I was going to frame my
next question around sense because you
know in the example of the One X you
know you've got this gorgeous screen
this great hardware and then this sense
which just lags in places yeah so so
what if you took the great things about
sense the email client is amazing
although I know you use gmail the
widgets are beautiful and you made it
really fast lag free and then you put it
on a really awesome display is is that
enough Michael for you to say in the
future prefer a sense for plus phone
with the same configuration you know
what i mean i dunno tremaine and and I
this is not a cop out it is just a
function of the fact that I've had other
phones to deal with in the DNA is still
very new to me I don't know yet there
are things that I miss from TouchWiz I
certainly don't miss the TouchWiz nature
UX like cartoony carnival you know
stupid leaves floating on water tap
ripple effect drop water thing you know
but I do miss it's useful notification
shade toggles i miss press and hold the
power button for even more cool options
i miss you know since is not as
intuitive that way i don't think and
also sense has these
it's easy to forget that census really
has its own unique design language that
is not always good particularly an audio
feedback I don't need my phone to sound
like a typewriter and every time I tab
on something at HTC Sense it's like
clack clack clack like mine why are you
doing this is not a is not a Smith
Corona you know so i don't i'm not sure
yet but i have a final question yeah
Tony hit me so you guys remember when we
blend the coverage for droid DNA and I
was like guys I really hope the screen
is not the only selling point of this
phone now let me hit you with this
question if the droid DNA would not have
a 1080p screen but a HD screen like the
others on the market would this be an
interesting phone or would it be just a
droid just another android does it have
an escort proud to me yeah yeah yeah for
me it would still be interesting because
of its of its form factor Tony does the
screen to have the same dimensions in
your hypothetical I mean I know it
doesn't have a same resolution but it's
still a 5-inch screen yeah let's say
yeah let's say everything is the same
except word resolution you know I still
think it would be yeah because i think
the HTC has has brought their beautiful
2012 like kind of design revolution to
this in a big way it's got these really
nice perforated red strips on the left
and right it's got that front facing
camera that's ultra wide angle which is
actually I could see being useful in a
couple situations it's got a great feel
in the hand it feels like a premium
product and it's it senses run so well
on top of this I would still be excited
about this yes and now a question for
both of you guys do you think this is
too little too late with HTC continuing
to grumble fifty sixty percent
quarter-on-quarter I mean do you think
it's enough for for HTC to save
themselves with this unit let's see it
will go global the HTC deluxe will hit
global markets is this enough I don't
think it's enough by itself personally
but I think that it's definitely going
to help them particularly since verizon
seems very very dedicated to this launch
in a
way that other carriers are not
necessarily as dedicated to their launch
and we'll get to that in a second but
yeah I think with verizon behind them
this is going to sell pretty well in
America because I think this is going to
be the droid of the holiday season I
think that this phone is of course the
first 1080p phone and that's that's
getting headlines you kind of look back
historically at firsts and to see what
effect its its head so we have HTC with
the evo 4g with the first 4g phone in
the US did does that matter today yeah
not really we've got the the first 720p
screen on the Galaxy Nexus by Samsung
does that matter today uh sort of you
know it it sort of paved the way for
samsung to be a leader in these high res
displays and and the 1080p thing could
very well do that for HTC they could
they could create variations of this
form factor with that highly acclaimed
screen I think it's it's tough to answer
that question until Michael you you
answered that that operative question
and yeah it agree will be and and that's
a good interesting way to look at it as
from a perspective of first I tell you I
did watch a nap Assad of Star Trek
Enterprise last night in 1080p on this
thing and I think they shot that in 1080
I hope they shot it in 1080 because
anyway it was the is the only thing I
could think of I was trying to get to
sleep and God it was beautiful I mean it
just is normally when I'm watching
netflix on my phone i'm watching like SD
episodes from 1997 of some old TV show
right so i can't tell the difference but
on this one I definitely wanted to fire
up a full HD and it it's it is gorgeous
and I'll tell you right up front the
battery life doesn't seem to be a
problem even with that relatively small
2011 our cell that is good yeah great
have you tested out the camera uh yeah
it doesn't sound like better than 1x is
probably the same as the one x-ray well
I asked I made sure to ask HTC about
that and they said that the optics
physically the camera module is
identical but the tuning on the software
side has been has been optimized so
we'll have to see in different
conditions i will tell you i took a that
shot i took this morning of the the old
navy box
sitting on my in my front lobby was with
the the DNA camera and the lighting was
crappy but you zoom in on that thing and
it's like it's it's it's a little like
zooming in on a Nintendo game I mean
there's some crazy pixelation it's wrong
it's really bad lighting we'll have to
see how it performs yeah those 31 x
performed well in excellent lighting
conditions but once the lighting is say
normal or less than normal you just got
pixels well this picture is terrible did
you look at yeah yeah so don't zoom down
it's terrible yeah I know it's well in
like I said that is pretty much the
worst lighting I could pick if I wanted
to like put a phone through camera boot
camp that's the lighting i would pick so
we'll we'll see but i want to keep
talking cameras i do want to switch
platforms while we talk cameras we're
gonna have a lot more chat on the DNA
i'm sure next week because the review
will be up at the next time we speak but
let's let's talk let's talk lumia let's
jump on over to the to the Windows Phone
world and we've got a lot of news from
this and it's so it it's so nice to have
talked about this for months I mean ever
since the podcast started even we've
been talking pretty much every week
about can't wait until the Lumias get
here I can't wait to actually finally
you know be be a member of the club and
I just finished my Lumia 810 review
where I gave it a seven out of ten and
to make this segue for real just to talk
about the camera real quick Adam Lane
and I got to meet in person first of all
one by one I'm meeting everyone from
pocket now in person Adam Lane is a tall
guy I didn't know this is he taller than
me I he's a he's got to be as tall as
you ooh sounds like he's fired he's good
no it was it was great well we met we
met I came in New York City for the HTC
event and Adam and I had arranged to
meet to do a shoot out of the same scene
using like six or seven cameras and the
results of that can be seen on my lumia
810 review and Adams Lumia 920 review
Adam whipped that up because he's our
resident awesome photographer and
Windows Phone guy so anyway we shot the
same scene with a bunch of cameras and
we were surprised to find that the Lumia
810
which means the Lumia 820 because the
Lumia 810 is just a t-mobile version of
the 820 with some different externals
and internals so it's just a different
phone what a crappy sentence that was we
were surprised to find that the Lumia
810 has essentially the same camera
performance in at least some
circumstances as the Lumia 920 there's
no optical image stabilization obviously
and it doesn't have the PureView brand
but the resolution is almost the same
and the cameras performance is almost
the same and that means whether it
depends SM full or half empty person is
going to depend on whether that means
the 920 has a crappy camera or the a-10
has an awesome camera I happen to have
both units in my possession at the
moment and i will say for a mid-range
phone that 8-10 shoots a good picture is
that so that's why it's as thick as it
is because it's got the the optics that
maybe they just didn't caught PureView
to keep the sales down and well then the
920 sales up well remember no it doesn't
have the same object cuz the 920 has
that that optical image stabilization
rig that mechanical image stabilization
so the 920 I think the module on there
has to be thicker I think I will have to
see a teardown of each to confirm that
but the Lumia 810 is definitely a thick
phone until yes I'm looking at that
pattern with the boot which you guys
shot from several angles yes with
several devices and I still think the
nokia n8 is the best there in that point
that Adam made as well yeah the nokia n8
was the oldest phone we had in that
shootout and that Adam and brought that
along it's still right there yeah it's
striking to me how how much the colors
vary between all these phones like some
of them like the razr m is just
atrocious they come in and not in
general but compared to all the rest of
these and it imparts this purple kind of
haze on everything and not the purple
haze that we've been hearing so much
about and then the it windows phone 8x
like kind of over sharpens everything um
and puts kind of a maybe a greenish
pallor on it and then the Lumias err on
the side of pink as well it looks like
with the 920 doing a little more in that
regard but it's it's striking how
similar the 810 in the 920 you know how
similar their results are so I'm
I happen to like the Galaxy Note 2 most
out of all these to tell you the truth
but you know you listeners you'll want
to go on they and check out both reviews
to see what what the thing is what your
feelings are about which camera is the
best and certainly I'm no photographer
but if you look at the gallery from the
8-10 from the shots that i took
including one that my friend my friend
took of me looking rather rather
mournful about something they you know
it's it's excited camera for a mid-range
phone and the 810 as a whole delivers a
solid mid-range experience it's built
like a just a big block of wood or
something though I mean it's really
intense I liked your job test in the
video Michael mmm thank you yeah that's
very bold of you I didn't want to I
didn't want to beat up the review you in
a too badly but I'm like yeah this is
the kind of phone and I my favorite
analogy in that review was that it's
like the Nexus 7 of smartphones because
when I'm carrying around the nexus 7
right it's not like I'm carry around an
iPad it's not like I'm carrying around
something that's like Oh gotta be
delicate with it because it's you know
it's it's fancy now you toss it around
and it's fine that's what the a-10 feels
like it feels like it'll take a beating
you know it's not something you have to
baby and I think that's going to be
attractive to a lot of people I do not
think that it's worth 149 99 on a
two-year contract not with the Lumia 920
at one hundred dollars right now I mean
they are in different carriers and I
started thinking about that as i was
writing the conclusion I kind of put it
in there where I was like yeah if you're
on t-mobile if you're married to
t-mobile USA and you really like what
they give you then you should this is
the closest you can get to to a high-end
Lumia device right unless you buy an
unlocked 920 which isn't gonna support
t-mobile's bands right I was also on the
Prophet surprised I was intrigued to
hear that your results on tmobile were
very similar to mine with the the subpar
indoor performance on the inconsistent
data speeds and oh yeah I
and then I I wonder to myself you know
you know team will want some good phones
and in optimum conditions they have a
fast Network and so forth but oh if
that's true for you know at taking an
average sampling of the population you
and me in in pretty pretty big highly
populated areas in some areas that are
not and we have this experience then
what about the rest of the people do t
mobile users just contend with poor poor
indoor performance in exchange for the
unlimited data and so forth I just I
start to you know I was wondering you
won't whoa and one of these people about
that's a good question this goes back to
the carrier discussion you know where
some people you know the carriers it
generate loyalty and you know based on a
lot of apocryphal is giving a lot of
anecdotal stuff it's like whoa where I
live and work this works well for me and
I I used to be that guy with sprint like
sprint always worked well for me almost
wherever I lived and worked it was
always a solid solid provider and then
I'd here literally thousands of people
on the internet and in person people
just telling me off sprint jousters
terrible i can't get service with them
anywhere and so you know i understand
what it's like to have those
inconsistent results and I know that
t-mobile provides good service somewhere
I think it's Miriam mirror and you are
over at Engadget is like the biggest
t-mobile fan ever and you know so I mean
it works some places it works and you
know wherever it doesn't work Ryan it's
a it's kind of like I guess AT&amp;amp;T where
you don't tease my carrier of choice
because around here it works extremely
well yeah but if I lived in New York
City or if I lived in san fran or Las
Vegas I couldn't possibly use AT&amp;amp;T at
least last I checked maybe it's changing
now with LTE but there are times when
you cannot make a call just because
there are too many people on the phone
at the same time so I I think you're
right that it just matters where you
live and what works in your area it does
yeah and I really hope that that that
everyone like you know I know it not
everyone reads these monster reviews
that we whip up like mine I think this
one's 4,000 words I mean it's huge but
if you're gonna read any part of it it's
like you know read the part that says
your mileage may vary you know you need
to go
to use your 14-day or 30 day exchange
period to your advantage go by the phone
use it where you live and work make sure
that the coverage will work for you
because it doesn't matter what we say
you know and it certainly doesn't matter
what verizon says for example just
because I'm still bitter about my time
in the Northeast Corridor where I'm like
I'm zooming past on the train i'm
zooming past banners for AT&amp;amp;T s 4g LTE
network and I've got 4g LTE service on
my on my lumia 920 and meanwhile my
verizon phone which i'm tethering off of
is like 1 x 1 x RT t like 20 kilobits
down like for real guys it's like
America's largest network it's like no
stop it Monty kilobits yeah anyway so
that's the t-mobile story and just just
to wrap up the d810 story my biggest
disappointment wasn't on the network
side it was in maps I'm Brandon you
talked about this a little bit and Tony
wind when you had a windows phone what
was your last windows from this the 610
to review and I I used 7.5 so I have
never touched windows phone 8 and back
and then the day it was Bing Maps it was
bring it right and now it's kind of now
in Windows Phone 8 its nokia maps which
I was so looking forward to I was like
all right good we're getting rid of the
bing maps which I was disappointed with
on the under my focus my personal daily
driver last year baby nokia drama nokia
maps will be awesome no it's it's just
horrible it's it's it's embarrassing
it's what it is it's it's I'd like the
thing is there's like a there's a sorry
was like outside Brandon's rolling
thunder from his keyboard coming in from
from that I'm not I'm not moving I'm
doing jumping jacks pic oh okay um no
the thing is like you can go into Nokia
Maps and you can do what I did yesterday
which is well i'm hungry i want to go to
Boston burger company my favorite place
ever for dinner and then I'll just let
me just search for it here on on my 8 10
or my 920 it doesn't matter and it does
dutifully report where Boston burger
company is located the location that's
three miles away meanwhile literally six
blocks
down the road is another Boston burger
company as a matter of fact it's the
original one that doesn't even show up
in the results list this similar thing
happened when I was on a train ride I
was on an amtrak train i was looking at
the terminal for the cross sound ferry
in new london connecticut i did a search
for cross on ferry with local results it
returned results for the crosstown ferry
terminal on Long Island in New York said
know it now I have a question and is
sorry for interrupting you know is this
happening with the online maps or is
this also happening with the maps you
download as of Nokia Maps and you can
use them offline too it's not the
downloadable ones the experience I've
had with the downloadable ones has been
on nokia drive not i have not downloaded
maps on the on nokia maps on the bing
maps like you know plus so I this is all
online this is I would just do a
comparison between I did I also didn't
download them when I was on my android
phone when I'm doing that straight
comparison you know I'm like okay what
do you have to say about this Android Oh
what do you know Google Maps is the best
mapping solution ever and it gets the
job done and it does it ten times better
than then it happens on Windows Phone so
but he was just such a disappointment to
me I wouldn't be so irritated about it
if I haven't if I hadn't expected it to
be so much better as a result of the
transition to Nokia Maps but I don't see
how I could use this and these are the
two examples I site in the review but
there are many more and if I'm going to
be using this you know 920 is my daily
driver I need to use a third-party
mapping solution that interfaces with
Google Maps or I need to just go to like
maps google com in the browser I don't
want to do that you know it's not a good
mapping solution and it's um it's it's
it's embarrassing it shouldn't be at
this level right now you know this this
platforms been out for two years it
should be better so it's funny that you
say that because nokia is so proud of
their mapping service and now with the
microsoft collaboration they not only
destroy in their marketing and all their
ad campaigns the iphone maps but they
also put themselves at the same level
with google maps I mean they regard
themselves as the alternative
and you know that may be the case in
Europe it may be the case in other parts
of America I will tell you that between
boston and new york city at least in the
past week that has not been my
experience and and it's very
disappointing so i think i want to go a
little more in depth with this and maybe
maybe write a piece on it and so this is
not the last you'll hear about about
this listeners but um you know we'll see
how it goes i really hope it improves
very quickly Brandon you didn't mention
this too much in your thoughts on
Windows Phone two years later but
brandon has a great video which I just
watched this morning about his
experience you know with Windows Phone 8
after two years with Windows Phone do
you want to elaborate on some more of
what you thought about coming on to the
new platform yeah sure briefly so you
know about two years ago I was using the
Samsung Focus as my daily driver for a
while because I really liked it you know
it had yeah this new operating system
and and at the time it was kind of
Android which was laggy and had some
problems and it just iOS which had its
own problems with being too tied down
and too limited and so the samsung focus
was an interesting departure from both
of those because it was kind of the
middle ground between not having enough
control like an iOS and having tons and
tons of control like you have an Android
with Windows Phone you can kind of
customize the look of your main screen
you have live information and yet also
static icons that link to programs and
it was just totally different it was
fluid it was fast but the problem two
years ago was that the app story was
poor most major apps were accounted for
but the vast majority of second and
third-tier apps were just not there
because developers were kind of kind of
like the windows RT problem they're
thinking should I spend time and
resources to develop on this new
platform or should I spend more time on
Android iOS and the other platforms that
are already making me money so so I I
got an 8x and I was very curious to see
if the experience had changed two years
later so I used it for a full week and
you know it was very familiar and yet a
little bit different and I mean that in
a good I mean that in a good and a bad
way I mean in the good way because that
fluidity was there that that
interestingness of something new and
fast something that just worked and was
well thought out i mean Windows Phone 8
is a really good operating system from
end to end um in terms of the UI and the
responsiveness and that was great and it
was cool to see windows phone 8 with a
high res display it was quota see
windows phone 8 with you know is powered
by a dual-core processor although it
didn't feel that much faster than the
focus I've got to be honest well yeah
and I think you say in the video because
windows phone 7 was so fluid there was
exactly no room for improvement yeah
yeah yeah but that it's kind of
disappointing to me because I remember
talking to some of the Microsoft guys
back in two thousand ten and eleven i
think it was 11 when I when I when I
asked why isn't windows phone 7.5
optimized for for dual core support and
while all those these androids were
coming out with dual core and they said
but we want to do it right we we don't
want to rush it out and I and I thought
to myself that must mean that they're
going to do something with dual core
support that Noah that the other
platforms just aren't doing and well
that turned out not to be the case right
um so so in terms of the good like I
said everything was fast and fluid high
resolution display it was it was that
feeling that I had two years ago but
then I also had that bad feeling when I
went into the App Store and I searched
for a wide variety of apps that weren't
there partly because I and correct me on
this if I'm wrong apps have to be
rewritten for windows phone 8 thank you
for bringing this up i don't i don't
know right because I I was so excited
when i got my lumia i was like how great
i know that it has spotify so i don't
really need anything else no it doesn't
cuz spotify has to be rewritten for
windows phone 8 or something i guess
some it wasn't some apps don't I I don't
also don't know I feel very under
educated about this it's very possible
that the really high end apps i guess
you could say like Spotify the developer
has decidedly has chosen to rewrite the
app to take advantage of some of the new
things in Windows Phone 8 and so they
but it's unfortunate because they pulled
you can't get spotify for windows phone
8 right now there are two aspects guys
first of all is the shared core the
kernel with
desktop operating system and then again
is the variety of resolutions for which
have to be coded within the application
itself with Windows Phone 7 + 7.5 it was
wvga and that was all ah so it's just so
spot if I probably pull their app
thinking that you know if someone
downloads this they're gonna get a low
res experience and that's gonna make
people pretty upset and you know I guess
it's I mean if they release it in the
next few weeks that's fine because you
know windows phone 8 devices are just
now hitting store shelves so it's not
like there's millions and millions of
people that are crying cuz spotify is
not out there right and yeah well and
then you could speaking of spotify we
have to touch on pandora as well which
you know Lumia buyers or Windows Phone 8
buyers I forgot what it is are gonna get
a full year of pandora one for free
which is great let's meet the pandora
app won't even be available until 2013
so it's this is not a i guess i guess
this is not a negligible amount of work
that needs to be done like there has to
be there's some core level and Tony as
you just said there's there's there's a
lot of leg work that needs to be done to
make most probably apps right yeah so
but that's so frustrating you know you
see Microsoft baked in the announcement
doing all this this kind of bluster and
being like yeah we got 120,000 apps and
we're gonna have we're going to have 46
of the top 50 it's like great when I
think this comes back to a point that
Tony made in a previous podcast about
Windows Phone being the story of like
not being done in time and yeah waiting
and and and and I think in this case you
know windows phone 8 was rushed out you
know there's there's talk of a
notification center that didn't make it
in you know it the first version of
Windows Phone 7 was rushed out so
quickly that they didn't have copy and
paste which is strange coming from the
company that invented copy and he's got
a mobile device right so so to wrap to
wrap this up drop this up my conclusion
and using Windows Phone 8 for a week was
that at the end I decided to go back to
android / iOS depending on the device of
the day and that is because my
experience is the same as it was two
years ago which is good and it's also
bad so both to wrap it up and to put
words in your mouth Windows Phone 9
great operating system yeah so what I'm
waiting for yeah I will say that you
know it just to give my final thoughts
on Windows Phone 8 as well as a whole I
kind of disparaged the talk about how
Microsoft was so big on demoing
resizable live tiles because frankly I
was tired of seeing it right I was bored
it was like stop showing me that then I
put resizable live tiles as like a
10-second little segment in my Lumia 810
review because it's really cool you can
make a really cool-looking home screen
and I've kind of struggled over the past
couple days to to make my home screen
look like you know look like something I
want to look good and also feel good
using and I think I've gotten to a good
point with that anyway it's it's a lot
of fun and I am surprised by how much
that little tweak just introducing that
other live tile size by how much that
has changed the the daily experience and
really liked it particularly under Lumia
go ahead Oh dead continue say don't
particularly on the Lumia 920 is what I
was going to say which last week when we
podcast to did was before the Lumia 920
official launch day and I just if you
haven't seen the video listeners I up a
video of my my own Lumia 920 unboxing
and that's my own unit that's not a
review that's paid for that one and I
also shot of just a little bit of
footage of my in-store experience and we
talked a little bit before about
carriers and they're supportive device
launches and you know I I don't want to
crap over all over eighteen t here
because they were just busting their
butts to to correct these reports as
they came out of kind of lackluster
launches and stores across the country
and really I mean you know we work
closely with the PR people at 18 teen it
was very clear to see on twitter and on
email and all that stuff how how hard
they were working to try and address
issues that cropped up but in the store
like i was surprised the people were the
ATT store reps were wearing Windows
Phone 8 t shirts and that's about where
it stopped like there were no demo
devices on the store this is it my this
is my experience at the cambridge
massachusetts store there were no demo
devices out running Windows Phone 8 all
the windows phone demo devices on the
floor were
windows phone 7 devices and yes this is
an official AT&amp;amp;T retail store not a
retailer not a third-party dealer the
retail stores were only stocked with
three colors of the Lumia 920 because
the cyan version was apparently an
online exclusive in the gray version is
apparently internet international
exclusives stop with the exclusives like
it wouldn't it be great if you could
walk into a store and and get any one of
the five available Michael I am so with
you since most of the exclusives are us
only gonna say yeah you actually get
screws and right and I don't yeah of
course I sound like the first world
problem American right I'm like come on
you know but no I understand Tony like
now I get it I understand what it's like
to be shut out of something when they
tell me I can't get the cyan cuz I'm not
online and I can't get the gray because
it's an international and like what okay
that's how we feel about the droid DNA
and all the other good stuff you guys
get is you know what I know that's a
that's a recent occurrence I mean near
be Europe got everything that's crew
2008 exact outward now i think i think
the LTE thing really helped the u.s. to
get in the forefront of these mobile
device for these releases he agreed and
i just wish but i think i feel the pain
of windows phone you know fans because
they see these kind of lackluster
carrier launched and I I wouldn't even
bring this up but other outlets have
reported on this like people have you
know run with headlines saying like a
tease launch of the Lumia 920 was really
weird you know and it's true and I
remember their launch of the the veer
back in the webos days and you know this
isn't an 18 teen thing all carriers do
this and they you know they fawn over
who they like and they they kind of
ignore who they don't and you know
sometimes mistakes are made or whatever
but it just felt so half-baked yeah but
don't forget and this is this through
the I'm remembering this exactly quote
that Steve Ballmer said back in the day
that AT&amp;amp;T is the premier windows phone
carrier and this just doesn't sound like
that exactly yeah no it doesn't but of
course you know what here when you have
no competition in that space then I
guess you can do what you want right
because verizon
I'd one windows phone that they cared
anything about and then they now they're
making a big noise about carrying all
the new ones sure but for windows phone
7 they didn't do anything really you
have to imagine old carriers had Lumia
920 now imagine that 80s you know
exactly yeah now that's that's very true
so you know and then there's t-mobile
whose small that they they have the 8x
and they have the 810 so it's a very
interesting landscape today I think
maybe some carriers may have been burned
by the by maybe buying into the buzz on
windows phone 7 and then just having a
whole lot of inventory i don't know i
will see if i'm not very half-baked go
ahead i'm fascinated michael to hear
about you know for listeners that don't
understa sui bounced around from phones
all the time but we always come back to
sort of our home carrier that we're
married to that we have a two-year
contracts on or we have a pre plate
prepaid plan on and devices that we we
own and we don't have to send back and
Michael made a very bold move of
changing his home carrier I think from
verizon to 218 tea and buying his own
dough Lumia 920 um and he has yet to
have time to I think really settled down
with that because his plates of late has
been full with other devices but I drew
I'm fascinated to hear in a similar way
that I went through the process how you
like Windows Phone 8 on the on the Lumia
920 after week or two of usage i I'm I'm
very excited I will be very excited to
share those thoughts and you're
absolutely right I i bought the 920 last
Friday and then this entire week has
been taught at home last Friday I did
the unboxing video he used this for five
minutes a user for five minutes and i
also bought as listeners my know the JBL
powerup speaker dock which i also
unboxed on video and showed you and I
was like well this is great I put the
JBL box on my desk I plugged it in I put
the 920 on top of it it charged and then
it like I haven't used it saying I
haven't been able to because I've been
using
the cool stuff man exactly DNA what a
wonderful problem I have I mean it is
true and I will say this just to wrap up
my thoughts on that even though eighty
didn't have the best launch they did
they didn't have the wireless the free
wireless charging plate in stock you
know because Lumia 920 buyers are
supposed to get the the wireless
charging plate for free as a limited
time promotion for launch day and so
forth they didn't have it in the store
and I was like come on guys really
another thing you don't have but you
know what 18 TMI info they shipped it
the same day I think and it came to me
on on the following monday so it's
sitting next time no it is great also it
charges the droid DNA as we were
discussing off the air before the
podcast started speaking of making good
on promises my nexus 4 just shipped the
the eight gigabyte the first one hi ho
shirt hey congratulations did you get
did you order a wireless charging orb as
well I don't think they're for sale yet
are they oh maybe they're not I really
want one I want a nexus 4 just to use
the charging orb and then I'll send it
anyway um do you guys I got a question
yeah where do you charge your your your
phone's when you when you go to sleep at
night oh now I've got the JBL powerup
doc next to my bed and so I put the
phone on top of that but normally they
live on my bed stand ah Within Reach
what about you Tony on my desk my office
setup has also a bed so my room is my
bed as my computer has my basically it's
all in one for me I live and work here
so oh my devices are being charged on
the best in arms reach from from my bed
okay so you so you both have it close to
your to your bed um I've got this weird
phobia and I hope you can talk me down
from it I I'm afraid I really want to
put my phone on the nightstand so it's
in within easy reach but I'd put it like
across the room because I'm like
paranoid that the radio waves the Wi-Fi
the LTE are gonna like harm my my brain
give me some sort of like illness it
sounds like you're not surrounded with
temperatures beside yeah
Plus like even if the phone's not nearby
you you know you're getting bathed in
Wi-Fi all day anyway and LTE I mean you
know FM radio waves and all that kind of
don't know who knows what you don't know
about yeah yeah I think I don't think
you need to worry about that Brandon
because I what what is the there's an
FCC mandated distance from the body that
your phone should be like you they have
to include this warning in the manual
and if you ever read any of the safety
and product information any of the phone
that they're like nobody no nobody does
but but a lot of them like he's motor
oil especially is big on saying like
don't we don't recommend you carry your
phone in your chest pocket like put it
in a holster and make sure each sneaker
yeah you guys remember back in the day
we I was like boasting almost every week
or every second week something about SAR
ratings as a re s yeah those things just
died out we don't see any more post like
that right it's if the listeners don't
know what's our is a specific absorption
rate and it's a measurement of how much
radiation is absorbed by your tissues
and I think there's some something to do
with everybody cared about those either
but it was nice to see for instance the
brand new HTC being lower lower SAR ated
than I don't know the iphone and just
making up something now that's it you
don't see that nowadays I mean they they
all have radiations we just don't know
to which extent you know what I think
and I think this is a symptom of voice
calling dying out to a degree because
the big deal about this whole flap was
that you know the more radiation of
phone put out the more dosage you were
getting right out against your skull and
they showed like you know the cat scan
images of like you know the brain
localized brain heating or something
like that and it was like wow that's
crazy but nobody talks on the phone
anymore so I mean we're all texting or
they're all down by our you know they're
all in our hands down except in Nebraska
and sick accepted breske nicely done
anyway let's let's move on just just
briefly so we can get iOS in the
conversation even though it's been a
slow week for iOS Google's reportedly
testing its Google Maps app for App
Store submission which I'm sure is
making apple fans Apple users everywhere
just salivate as someone who very
briefly had to deal with a crappy Maps
in my case Bing or Nokia Maps I feel
your pain in a different sense so um you
know I really hope that Google Maps gets
launched on iOS soon because we all know
that would be a good thing for everybody
but Apple I guess I have a different
opinion I don't think so so far so far
listen I'm not hating on google or or
stuff like that but so far Google's been
all talk no action they were all like
we're working or we would work if apple
approved and all that mad love specific
plans you know what Google get the
application out let Apple reject you and
then just kill them for that just don't
come with with ideas like we would work
if we knew that apple would approve but
we don't know that just get the
application out send it for approval and
if they disapprove which I think they
will because they they got out of bed
with google for a specific reason which
is iOS maps then just do your best to
bash apple if i can till then just make
make the I if Apple turns them down if
Apple rejects Google's mapping
application that would be the ballsiest
move that way of the time eater I don't
think it would be ballsy are done
removing google maps from iOS well no no
I think it would because look they
removed google maps from iOS and they
thought you know maybe a lot of people
in the company thought they had a
competing product that would work well
but ebuddy but launching a product that
is inferior having a giant public uproar
over how crappy it is and then when your
white knight comes back to say hey you
want it you want to use it you want your
customers to be happy being like no no
it's uh that would be intense I still
think that they will not approve this
application or they will make some
probably make up some conditions that
Google will not approve I think the
entire reason for for this move beyond
the thermonuclear war between Apple and
Google was for Apple to finally start
off their mapping project good or bad as
it is it will improve but if they made
the first if we have a saying here if
you say a also say be mmm-hmm before we
leave iOS may I make a comment well you
do I've got one short one as well in iOS
before
go but please do you okay I'd like to
suggest that now is a terrible time to
buy either iPad and here is why we are
obviously between generations the ipad 5
will the big version will clearly have
the in cell touch technology it's gonna
be thinner and lighter because Apple
knows that we really we really are all
tired of the size on the weight and the
ipad 4 is like an iPad 3 it's entirely
too heavy and thick um and so the next
generation iPad 9.7 inch is the one
again then the ipad mini on the other
hand is also a product with compromise
and we could argue about this all day
but the low pixel resolution does matter
and you can do things like hold it at
arm's length away from your face or you
could say to yourself well the cop you
know the compromise years that I get a
low resolution screen but I get this
incredible hardware with very very thin
and light form factor that's that's even
thinner and lighter than the nexus 7 but
the iPad Mini is a first gen product the
ipad mini 2 is most likely gonna retina
display and i think that if people are
thinking about buying an ipad they
should wait on they should wait on both
till the next generation so you're
suggesting they should wait until
october two thousand thirteen do you
think that's when the ipad fire yeah no
I think they now settle for a yearly
cycle with bringing the ipad 2 october
the ipad mini 2 october the iphone to
september's so i think there will be no
more march q1 or q2 releases yeah that
sounds right they did that with the
iphone right yeah yeah i think i think
you don't get a weight yeah I you know
uh yeah i would say i would say your
tree or your wisdom is sound your logic
is sound i don't think people are going
to because the thing I was gonna say was
that I was waiting on the 18 th or to
open and I went in to get my lumia 920 I
went into the apple store awaited and um
yeah I didn't realize guys you guys
didn't tell me this you guys did not
tell me that the ipad mini was um was
like it so light that you feel like
you're on a planet with less gravity
I don't you told me but I don't think it
really hit my brain right because I you
you have to listeners if you have to
feel it it yet I don't care what you
what you feel about iOS cuz heaven knows
I find iOS to be very very dull and it's
certainly not the OS for me but man you
go into an apple store right now drop
what you're doing it's Friday go into an
apple store and find yourself an ipad
mini and just hold it it feels like it
once again a cardboard like it feels
like a dummy device it feels like
something that a third party retailer
would put on the shelf so it doesn't get
stolen like it doesn't it's incredible I
I don't even know if I like it it's so
light I like a little heft but man oh
man anyway so do you think it's too thin
um no I don't I don't think it's too
thin no I I do think that they bezel a
thumb rejection on the sides is a little
inconsistent but I don't think it's too
thin though did you think Tony do you
think a piece of paper is too thin it
depends on what you're comparing it with
yes yeah this uh no one's talking about
i think people are starting to talk
about this this in cell touch that Apple
has on the iphone 5 and the iPad Mini
significantly reduces touch
responsiveness and I'm hearing some of
my friends being like my my iphone 5 the
keyboard it it doesn't peop feel as good
as the 4s and I and you know it's
because it's a different touch
technology and it's it's worse for touch
responsiveness really did you experience
that and I didn't on the iPad yeah I did
to it to a degree um it's it's just it
feels a little bit more numb uh some
people might note it but people coming
from like the I the ipad 3 or the the
iphone 4s will notice it but people
peeking over the first time won't but
it's subtle but i think it's a problem
well that's interesting it'll be
interesting to see how that how that
looks going forward maybe once everyone
gets tired of talking about purple haze
that'll be the next thing i want to jump
into reader mail before we close out the
the day guys we have the reader mail
today is all from or the rear mail we're
reading is all from people who've
written us before so this is the the
reader mail
returning writers hour and by our i mean
five minutes wishful thinking yes I know
right but these are all really good
questions they're really cool so guys
everyone thank you for writing in again
and everyone who wrote in whose letters
we won't get you thank you please please
writing in Kenneth Meadows the second
says hey guys I was wondering with all
these Nexus rumors going around do you
think that we will ever see
manufacturers offer customers the option
to pick their own phone hardware and I'm
like wait what what do you mean and the
sentence continues like alienware does
or did with PCs also thanks for the
advice in my phone color you're welcome
Kenneth meadows um that's an intriguing
question do you think manufacturers will
ever let let us as customers custom
order our own phone hardware and like
just plugins like yeah you know what I
want to go for the two gigs around now
put four gigs of RAM in there and go
ahead and put the the flaming skull LEDs
on the back and you know we're gonna
give me the neon green paint job on the
sides like what do you think i see i can
see this happening oh yeah i actually
looked into this because i was so I was
sort of messing with the idea of
creating I don't know who take years and
years creating a website that would
allow you to do that but after looking
into it it occurred to me that yes you
could do that if you're willing to
charge two thousand dollars for a phone
mmm mmm because the complexities
involved in having to change the
firmware on each different configure or
like three or four or five or six preset
configurations but if you get dell or
alienware style where you could probably
have hundreds or thousands of different
combinations you can create that many
different kinds of firmware and you have
to support all those different kinds of
firmware and and and and not only that
but don't don't think don't forget about
the engineering if you want to have 16
gigs of ram in your phone you're gonna
have to move around to other things
you're gonna have to create different
cases it's probably gonna be thick and
the people that are getting the really
high spec phones to fit in a certain
case it's going to be the same case that
the people with the the bottom line
phones are because you're not gonna have
five thousand different cases it's so
complex yeah tonight I don't think it
will ever happen because of
the reason the second reason Brandon
told you it's just I think the reason
because H let's take HTC for instance
HTC has the flagship one x+ has the
desire c so you have several different
models and you can basically choose the
hardware configuration by choosing a
different model but what I would pretty
much like to see and this is something
we were discussing almost weekly with
the guys on the pocket now team would be
an experience when I will take my phone
out of the box I would boot it for the
first time and it would ask me do you
want the HTC experience if yes then I
would have all the HTC Sense four points
whatever experience or do you want the
Android vanilla experience and then I
would have a nexus like phone that's
what I want you know and I think that
well then that's doable that is totally
doing on this doable today I think that
will be an element look at you know I
think that proves that goes away stored
proving my point which is I think I
disagree with you guys I think we will
see this happen because we're starting
to see these really crazy software
customizations we're not seeing that
Tony yet and I hope we do at some point
that we see the option to go to go raw
or to go skin but you know we did phones
are smartphones are more and more I mean
people are becoming more and more aware
that smartphones are are the computers
of today and tomorrow like smartphones
and tablets are it and I think as it
continues to mature as the world
continues to mature you're going to find
manufacturers who are willing to say hey
this worked in computers let's see if we
can bring it to smartphones and some of
them will fail miserably and but but
some of them may find this market and
there were people I know virtue isn't
doing very well in Nokia's selling them
off or whatever but there were people
who would pay thousands of dollars for a
phone that ran like you know did crappy
dumb wear stuff and like it there were
diamond-encrusted and that was their big
thing but I think there are people who
would pay a premium price for a phone
that is custom-made and Ida you know I
don't think that the software is the
main problem opposed to laptops and
desktop computers when you can basically
throw in any hardware component you want
a smartphone has limited space and it
would take a huge
standardization across manufacturers of
internal components like CPUs GPUs
memories they would have to have the
same socket sizes they would have to
have the same dimensions because
basically in a bland I have never been
in a plant producing smartphones but
I've been another plans it just robots
who take the internals and put it in
their specific place so you have to have
compatibility issues and this is
something which I don't think anybody
wants at the moment so you'd have to
like a company would have to offer like
five different configurations like you
didn't really really custom build your
very own but you could be like here
accompanied be like here's five or six
versions of the same thing it'll be like
like an HP approach to two smartphones
yeah and and you kind of look
historically at of course Dell was first
to do build built to order computers and
at the time at the time you know there
was gateway 2000 there was IBM their own
all of those other huge industry players
and then Adele came in and made a brand
for itself based on the fact that it was
going to do something different and it
and yet they I don't remember what
happened in the 90s but I think that if
you went to the dell website you go to
archive.org to see this your
configurations were relatively limited I
mean it wasn't nearly as extensive as it
is today with you know 78 cpu options I
think he had like three CPU options
right two different kinds of rams would
say were the first to do it so they they
had that room because nobody else was
doing anything like it so five choices
is better than one yeah and I think that
will I I think we'll see it i I just I
agree I think you guys bring up really
great points but I i think this industry
moves is so obsessed with the future and
it is still resistant to becoming
stagnant as much as we complain about
things like form factors and stuff it's
just moving so quickly forward that I
think we're gonna see a many a bold
manufacturer do this at some point hey
and let's not forget the people are
slowly thinking about the idea of their
phone replacing their laptop and their
desktop through the external keyboards
and monitors and such so having someone
pay 1500 or 2000 bucks for a really
high-end phone that replaces all your
machines is not totally ridiculous right
so let's uh we're gonna we're gonna jump
to the
piece of listener mail here this is from
our friends sibin Zetlin I know who
tells me I got his name right last times
I think so from from Serbia right uh I
don't remember he actually didn't say in
this piece of listener mail and I don't
want to I don't want to get it wrong by
guessing this time but um he asks an
interesting question which I have been
thinking about 2 he says android has
routing which enables it to be fully
customized and tampered with iOS and
iPhone have jailbreaking which is pretty
similar to Android's routing with all
that in mind I would like to ask a
question what does Windows Phone have
what kind of hack is there for windows
phone I've been wondering this question
for a long time well yeah but there's I
specifically looked up windows phone 8
right and if you like Google like
Windows Phone 8 custom mods or Windows
Phone 8 modding or whatever it's amazing
because it looks like this kind of this
frontier town that's that's empty and
not yet really built yet and waiting for
people to move into it because no one
like there's a bunch of fan sites and a
bunch of URL squatters who have you know
reserved you know crap like you know
whatever windows phone 8 racks axe oars
net or whatever but like there's not
really a lot of talk about this because
it's been out for like two weeks exactly
but and it's built on an entirely
different kernel than seven was so it
has to be an entirely different approach
and I remember what did windows phone 7
have what was the name of their like
jailbreak thing was a chevron yeah
everyone w yes yes yes but even that
what that didn't allow you to do much
right could you even put an image behind
your home styles no no you can basically
just side load applications and if you
have a head the proper boot loaders and
the proper files you could flash Iran
which already was jailbroken right yeah
so that like that's and that's it I mean
inside loading apps is a big deal I
don't mean to diminish it but this is a
good point you know with iOS you can
jailbreak it and make it look like kind
of however you want even though it runs
poorly with android of course you can do
whatever you want to so like do you guys
think we're gonna see with the windows
phone 8 kind of cracking community take
take shape or what I mean I think we've
got to see it at some point right I
think we will see more of the
and then we have seen with Windows Phone
7 and Windows Phone 7.5 because exactly
of the fact that it has a shared kernel
with windows 8 yes agreed this is also
this is a question that's kind of also
addressed by our third piece of listener
mail which I won't read butter Phillip
from Cardiff in the UK thank you again
for writing in but he's saying you know
and the pictures up you can choose the
background image and that image is
displayed is the app icon and in xbox
music the background changes to the
current music you're playing so Phillips
making the argument that windows phone
is actually in some ways more
customizable than than Android you know
I if we're talking aspect customization
yeah but if we're talking like to
performance tweaks and stuff like that
now then right yeah and it's just like
performance tuning versus visual tuning
yeah I think it calls to mind you know
it the difference is between all these
platforms again and how awesome the
differences are how cool even though we
have three only of three major players
in the landscape there really is
something for everybody but I would love
to see the windows phone 8 hacking
community kind of take off and deliver
functionality that we don't have because
for for as much as I love the modern UI
and the Windows Phone experience as a
whole there's so much about it that just
still feels so bare bones you know what
i want what i would like if Joe Belfiore
is listening to this podcast I know he
is because he commented recently on one
of our boats and pocket now Joe if
you're listening to this I would like to
see this the ability to have a wallpaper
on Windows Phone 8 and the live tiles to
be 25 30 35 percent transparent so I can
see the wallpaper behind it will still
see that sells just like a glass style
and that will be the ultimate
customization for me oh man that sounds
like something I would just hate but you
know what options are good right i mean
do you know I don't know I guess we'll
have to see going forward I think what
I'm excited guys just to kind of wrap up
my thoughts on the day I'm excited that
that Windows Phone 8 is finally here for
all the things that I that I would
change about it there's also a lot I
really love about it i'm glad that we're
going to kind of watch it grow and
that'll be the way we close how 2012
with this kind of
resurgent platform that is finally
getting its day in the Sun it looks like
and we'll see how that works out so
quick windows phone 8 question for both
of you guys yeah windows phone 8
according to gartner is okay windows
phone according to gartner is at
two-point-four percent market share
clubwear DC windows phone and six months
from now it's 2.4% globally yeah in six
months from now I think it'll be at I
think it'll be no less than eight
percent and to whose agenda whose loss
uh well there's still some blackberry
share to eat up right and symbian and of
course symbian yeah I think I think it's
gonna be mainly blackberry and Symbian I
don't think iOS I don't think android
users are going anywhere i think uh iOS
there might be some ports from iOS but
yeah I would say reventon I I don't know
about the market share number but
there's there's one thing that's for
sure which is that we talked about the
the surface RT on a previous podcast and
and there there it always be there have
been rumors of a surface phone by
Microsoft and that could be an extremely
awesome amazing piece of technology that
that Microsoft could spend all of their
cash advertising to increase market
share of Windows Phone but the problem
is guess what they say scarred when the
surface brand a little bit with this RT
right so that'll that you know so that
card if they play it and dare they play
it because they're gonna you know really
piss off a new Kia and some other OEMs
what will be far less impactful now
because of that the problems associated
with the surface RT the diminished
surface brand right but you know yeah I
I don't know I just think that working
in concert with windows 8 which of
course has its own problems as far as
like you know popularity and adoption
desire and all that I think that it's
such a big thing it's such a big unified
push from Microsoft and they're so
dedicated to making it work I if in six
months the windows phone market share is
less than eight percent I would be
really really surprised I don't forget
that iOS is at thirteen percent so
that'll mean it will catch up to iOS
quickly
hmm yeah well you know I'm being a being
uncharacteristically optimistic this
morning so anyway um guys any final
thoughts before we wrap it up cuz i
think we are about ready to go get the
work day started there goes our one hour
podcast even when we try to be sure you
know it's just but you know it's a good
problem to have because we had listener
