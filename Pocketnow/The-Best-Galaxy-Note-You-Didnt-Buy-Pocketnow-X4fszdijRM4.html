PocketNow about a year ago Samsung
released a phone for the fans the Galaxy
Note Fe also known as the fan Edition
and undoubtedly this is one of the most
beautiful phones that you did not buy
because it wasn't available
in most markets but you could get it on
eBay for about eight hundred and twenty
bucks there and you would have it
imported from South Korea in fact this
is the SK Telecom model but it works
just fine
on AT&amp;amp;T here in the US but it was
expensive but it's also stunningly
beautiful and of course it's based off
the samsung galaxy note 7 which was
discontinued and as the note 8 has come
out and the note 9 is right around the
corner you can pick up this phone for
not that much money still on eBay and
it's just the same beautiful phone that
the note 7 was and this particular model
is really stunning because it's the blue
coral blue version and it has gold
accents on the side so blue and gold
very complementary colors just looks
absolutely fantastic I love how this
phone looks and it works really great
stuff it's got a super-fast processor
plenty of RAM nice big battery that's a
little bit smaller than the note 7 but
still plenty capable of getting you
through the day so in this video I
wanted to take a look back at the Galaxy
Note Fe fan edition so this phone
actually has really good specifications
even for today's standard the hardware
is based off of the note 7 as you can
see but the specifications are that of
the galaxy s7 era phones so you've got
the Exynos 88-90 octa-core processor 4
gigs of ram 64 gigs of storage 3200
milliamp power battery which is down
from the note 7 but still plenty to get
to get you through the day and it's just
a gorgeous phone especially on the front
where you have the appearance of a
nearly bezel this display on the sides
you just have screen and a top and a
bottom chin that just gives this
immersive experience unlike any other
phone we have the 5.7 inch display it's
AMOLED of course 2560 by 1440 for a
really good PPI of 515 and if you
remember with the note 7 Samsung reduced
the radius of the corners on the edge
so that the screen would be a little bit
more flat for the note that way you
could more easily write on the edges and
not have to worry about kind of the
s-pen falling off the edge like it would
um like the s7 edge for example with
that tighter screen radius just a
stunning stunning phone got the glass
back as the wireless charging of course
and there it says Galaxy Note fan
Edition this is the coral blue model
it's got a super nice Sheen to it with
these beautiful gold accents if you take
out the s-pen the s-pen is blue too so
super nice and of course with the note
devices you get screen off memo so you
can say things save it for later right
now I've got this running action
launcher cuz I'm not a huge fan of the
Samsung stock launcher and it just works
great it still works really great I can
get on LTE in the US on 80 even though
this is a South Korean foam everything
works wonderfully and if you go into
software information you can see that
this phone is running Android 8.0
unfortunately not 8.1 and you know
Samsung isn't really doing a good job
updating the note FV I just got a
software update today actually and it's
her the April 1st security patch and
it's already July so you know this isn't
a phone that I think Samsung cares that
much about it was a phone for the fans
hence the name fan Edition but you still
get all the really cool aspects stuff
like this little hovering thing where
you can create notes you can do smart
select you can write on the screen
or you can add shortcuts for a variety
of things so you get the utility of all
the S Pen functionality plus you could
use this as another form of input kind
of like a mouse just to navigate through
the UI I mean it works really really
well and it's just a beautiful beautiful
phone I mean look how immersive it is if
you look at it straight on it doesn't
look like there is a it doesn't look
like there are any side bezels and
something that I really love about
phones from this era from Samsung is
that it has a hardware button on the
bottom which of course doubles as a
fingerprint scanner you can double tap
it
to get into the camera and plus you've
got the recents button on the left and
the back button on the right so you're
not taking up any screen space at all
for on-screen keys the downside to that
of course is that you cannot switch if
you like your back button on the left
while you're stuck with it on the right
you can't change it with software but
the but the upside is that because there
are no on-screen buttons you really get
to maximize all 5.7 inches of this
screen and you really want to do that
because this phone is just so gorgeous
we look at this thing
turned off it's even beautiful we've got
the always-on display I've got the
beautiful gold accents on the color
wheel blue and gold or blue and orange
are complementary colors so this is just
a perfect match on the bottom we have a
kind of quiet speaker headphone jack and
USB type-c which is nice one of the one
of the early devices from Samsung to
have USB C was the note 7 and then the
note a fee just a really beautiful
device you can still get it on eBay
they're still pretty expensive because
they didn't make that many of them but
you still have to import them from Asia
if you really want this phone although
you might be able to get one used for
not that much money so that's the note F
II a phone that you definitely didn't
buy because it wasn't available in your
market or it's too expensive or you just
didn't even think about it
or you're just not a big enough fan of
Samsung phones to rock the FE fan
Edition but nevertheless definitely one
of the most beautiful phones I think
ever made it's just a stunner and it's
really a shame that the note 7 couldn't
survive so hope you guys liked this
video what did you think about the note
Fe did you ever consider buying one do
you think you might look into it now
that you've seen this video are you
looking forward to the note 9 let us
know in the comments and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
