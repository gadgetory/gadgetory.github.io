all getting curved OLED displays the
Nokia n9 has to finally be the flagship
that we've been waiting for and Samsung
has just crushed absolutely every
pre-order in its history
I'm Jaime Rivera and for those of you
asking about the cool t-shirts follow
the first link to rep apparel and then
the coupon code will give you a 10%
discount
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with new product
announcements we've got the new ZTE
quartz Android wear SmartWatch that now
works on t-mobile and the reason why
this watch is cool is not because it's
round it is not because it's probably
got the largest Android wear battery out
there at 500 milliamp hours but really
the fact that this thing just costs $200
we cannot wait for a review unit to
arrive until you've all about it how
about if we talk about the Nokia at 9
and the reason why this is so important
is because Nokia not necessarily made
anybody happy lately with the fact that
it has stayed away from flagships all
this time now we're hearing that its
latest and greatest no Kid 9 might land
very soon we're talking about a
snapdragon 835 processor 6 gigabytes of
RAM options for 64 128 gigs of storage
and I don't need to hear any more nokia
when do I get my device how about if we
talk about a device that I have been
waiting for and kind of not waiting for
anymore the future surface pro the
reason why is because we were expecting
the surface pro 5 a whole new design
with absolutely everything and it turns
out that apparently it will not change
much when it comes to its looks it will
change it internals and trusted sources
are really claiming this to be more of a
surface pro 4.5 instead of a 5 not
exactly sure what the name will be but
we do notice is that Microsoft has
already kind of teased the fact that
it's working on a speaker that's going
to be powered by Cortana because
everybody's doing that now we're just
waiting for a serious speaker now just
to just I don't know that's what the
spotlight over to Samsung for those of
you wondering exactly what the company
was claiming a few days ago that was
going to break records it has broken
records when it comes to its pre-orders
in Korea the company has announced that
it pretty much pre-ordered or pre-sold
should we say
thousand units that is a crazy amount
it's pretty much the most the company
has ever done these are great numbers it
could only make us imagine how much the
company has sold outside of Korea we
can't wait to get those numbers even
though Samsung doesn't really always
make them officially and finally the
very hot news that they have to do with
the Google pixel 2 or pixel whatever
that thing is going to be called or
those things should I say because
apparently we're getting up to three
devices one of these may be a tablet or
it could be a really affordable
smartphone but the point being is that
Google is apparently trying to secure as
many Ola displays as at can from LG up
to the point where the company is free
paying for them pretty much like what
Apple does to be able to secure as many
parts of whatever it wants now the
number is just insane apparently Google
is willing to invest 880 million dollars
and I think that number is like
seriously 880 million dollars just to
secure this OLED supply from Algeria
we're talking about curved displays so
we could be looking into some amazing
changes in design for the future pixels
we cannot wait to see what we get but it
leads me to the question of the day do
you think that moving to a curved
display would be a good move for the
pixel in my case I don't know I've used
curved displays I've used non curved
displays I still drift more to non
curved just for the ergonomics sure the
curved displays look beautiful but then
again I want to be able to use my phone
but leave us a comment down below this
is one opinion I cannot wait to read for
you brands you know the way it goes even
wanted was earlier before the video was
filmed bubbles I'm out comment
