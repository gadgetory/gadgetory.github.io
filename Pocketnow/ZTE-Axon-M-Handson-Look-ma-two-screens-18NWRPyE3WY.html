idea of having a smartphone with two
full displays at a time when software
has apparently matured enough to make
good use of them reporting from New York
City I'm Jaime that are with pocket now
and let's have a look at the ZTE axon M
so before you remind me of the failed
Kyocera echo and how the X on em brings
nothing new to the market well in
reality it does if you do the math the
Kyocera echo was launched a whole six
and a half years ago a lot has changed
in the Android space since then think of
the ZTE X on em as a new addition to the
lineup it doesn't replace the successor
to the axon 7 but instead provides a
bold new approach to a smart phone and
complements the lineup and why the M
after the axon ZTE s chosen into the
picked multitasking multi purpose etc
and right they should because this is
definitely a bold design there is
nothing like it right now at a time when
thin and curved flat slabs are the thing
the X on em is chunky and boxy we have a
black aluminum trim on the Border's
glass on the front and back but instead
of this being just Gorilla Glass 5 we
have 2 5.2 inch 1080p displays on each
side both of IPS technology this enables
a few unique things to the axon em you
can use the phone in dual mode meaning
two or more applications working
separately on each display you can use
it an extended mode to turn this into
the sort of a-squared tablet for more
real estates and have applications scale
to it and then there is mirror mode for
you to share content on both displays
with somebody else the user interfaces
Android 7.1.2 as close to stock as
possible and it has for you to choose
any of these modes through a special em
button on the navigation keys according
to ZTE there are at least 80
applications already supporting all of
these modes at the time of this video
but the applications that don't will
work just fine on extended mode
and following on the legacy of the exon
7 there are also dual stereo speakers
included allowing for more immersive
content consumption so what's the catch
well a project like this has taken years
to make and as such not all the
specifications are the latest and
greatest we're talking about last year's
snapdragon 8 to 1 4 gigs of ram 64 gigs
of storage with microSD expansion
included there's a 30 180 milliamp hour
battery with quick charge 3.0 supports
and even with the two displays ZTE
claims the testing has proven quite
positive when it comes to insurance and
if you hadn't noticed this will be an
AT&amp;amp;T exclusive and then the other
caveats come with the obvious bezels
separating the display though I didn't
find that to be annoying given how near
these are on the sides and also since
there is no selfie camera the uija has a
few interesting ways to have you flip
the phone around depending on your need
for a primary shot or a selfie shot it
does take some getting used to but the F
1.8 aperture on the 20 megapixel camera
should lead to some awesome photography
and I guess that is the biggest take
away with the ZTE axon M do I like it
yes I like it a lot but I do acknowledge
that it will take some getting used to
and we will definitely report on that so
