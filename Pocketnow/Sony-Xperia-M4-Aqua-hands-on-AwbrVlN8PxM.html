Xperia m4 aqua and we'll just leave it
at that I'm Anthony nod and you're
watching pocket now Sony Xperia m4 aqua
hands-on at the 2015 M WCM barcel√≥
whether releasing the z4 at this show
would have been a good or bad thing it's
up to you to decide
Sony however considered that it was not
time for the flagship so we've got a
phone that closely resembles the z3 a
mid-range device which according to Sony
brings all the cool features of the Z
family to the lower-class camera
capabilities to day battery life which
of course is still a quote and
waterproofing on the outside it looks a
lot like the z3 Z 2 Z 1 and so on so you
can instantly recognize the Sony
signature design language some love it
some love its large bezels on the top
and bottom for us it's a mixed bag
between feeling right at home and the
need for redecoration this being a
mid-range er Sony had to cut some
corners both on the outside as well as
on the inside despite company officials
trying to sell it as a quote no
compromise phone there are a couple of
notable advancements as well so let's
take them one at a time on the inside
some more corners have to be cut still
the company says the phone sets a new
standard for mid Rangers and that too is
ok this is Sony's first octa-core 64-bit
smartphone running on the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 615 processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz the SOC is being helped by two
gigs of RAM which is plenty for a
mid-range er internal storage is capped
at 8 or 16 gigs depending on which
region and model you get both of which
are expandable via microSD card with
additional 32 gigs the screen is a
5-inch panel with HD resolution of 720
by 1280 and the camera on the back is a
13 megapixel shooter powered by Sony's
own Exmor RS chip with an aperture of
f28 oh and ISO ratings of 3200
the front phaser allows you to snap 5
megapixel selfies and Android 5.0
lollipop ensures you're up to date
something which xiii owners are still
waiting for the 2400 milliamp hour
battery should be enough for two days
according to Sony but will of course
have to wait and see for ourselves once
we get this baby in our labs the other
feature inherited from the flagship is
the waterproof build the Xperia m4 aqua
is rated ip65 and ip68 for water and
dust resistance so you can be as active
as you want while using it we of course
had to test this out and we also had to
play around with lollipop coming out of
the box on the m4 aqua together with
Sony's own custom user interface it was
as snappy as ever with the signature
apps like Walkman and album as beautiful
and fluid as ever
sadly the unit had no internet
connection and we couldn't check out the
PlayStation app but that and more
in-depth testing will have to wait until
our full review which we're hoping to
get to use shortly on PocketNow until
then please give us a thumbs up if you
liked the video and follow us on social
media and our main hub at pocketnow.com
to never miss a beat abandoned and
denied thank you very much for watching
and I'll see you in the next video
