Parker now calm and today i'ma show you
screw soul for windows mobile devices
and this game is kind of like a
two-dimensional Rubik's Cube for your
device so the first thing we're to do is
select which level we want so there's
three levels and are increasing
difficulty of course so we can either
continue last game or play a new game
i'm just going to play a new game at
level 1 and the object of the game is to
line up all the colors corresponding it
to each row so as you see i have a
couple of green right here so if i move
that right there and move this up here i
have a completed row of green so to get
back to the main menu all have to do is
double tap and it's going to ask me if I
want to leave I'll say yes and it's
going to save it so if we want to switch
to the next level which is even more
difficult to play this new game and as
you see we have quite a few more squares
so i can just align these squares up and
move them over and align them up some
more and let's see we're just going to
try to get this blue row so there we
have it we have that one single blue row
but then again we have all of these
other rows to complete so I'll just
double tap and I'll ask me if I'm say
okay and go to level 3 and start a new
game and this one is even more difficult
so as you see we have all of these other
colored squares so if I want to move
them over you can move them up and down
and over let's see here if I want to try
to arrange this one blue line I can do
that
okay so anyways we have sort of
completed the line and that will stop
now we'll go back at any time if you
need help information all you have to do
is click here and it'll give you a
little run-through about what the object
of the game is and as you see you're
trying to create these rows of squares
for a corresponding color so is it this
X so this is another marketplace pick
and the program is called screw soul and
is one dollar ninety-nine cents on
windows mobile marketplace thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
