getting one will be harder than expected
analysts predicted the Apple watch
Series 3 going LT was the smartest thing
that Apple could have done and speaking
of LT it seems that were close to a
surface pro including it I'm Jaime
Rivera and it's an irony that we're
still covering iPhone 10 rumors after
the device was announced this is behind
out daily the official loose today begin
with deals if you're in the market for
the Google pixel I highly suggest you
wait because the newer ones are going to
be announced in a few weeks but if you
just can't wait there are some refurb
options at woot we're talking about 349
bucks for the Google pixel 399 for the
pixel XL the deals are actually not that
bad now the rumor is that we've been not
covering lately until they become
official or the whole Sprint and
t-mobile thing mainly because we've been
waiting for this for a while t-mobile
wanting to merge with AT&amp;amp;T then it
didn't then john ledger came and changed
everything and now the uncarrier
apparently wants to merge with Sprint we
wonder which is the smallest carrier
here right now I believe it to be Sprint
but then again there is a map that shows
how coverage would be if both carriers
would merge there is some significant
improvement here hopefully it does
happen so long as they retain the
uncarrier policies and for those of you
that have been waiting for that surface
pro with LT that was promised ever since
the event and hasn't yet happened we've
got some sources that are claiming that
we should expect it on December 1st
still don't have pricing information or
what exactly this surface pro will bring
in addition to the LTE connectivity
given how long it's taken for you to
wait but yeah stay tuned if you're
wanting one
and speaking of LTE we've got analysts
already talking about the Apple watch
Series three in a positive light
apparently they're predicting the device
will fill up to thirty three million
units and the reason why this device is
going to be more popular than the
previous ones is because Apple actually
launched it with LTE not necessarily
because of the LTE functionality but
because the watch doesn't depend on a
phone according to analysts the smartest
thing that Apple could do is make the
Apple watch its own product not
dependent on the iPhone or at least just
make it optional just like the iPhone
became the
dependent from PCs and Macs a long time
ago whether that's true or not I'd like
to know what you think in the comments
and finally the very interesting rumors
today have to do with the iPhone 10 and
Romeo and Juliet you know I looked at
these code names and I laughed but yes
apparently the reason why there might be
delays with the iPhone 10 are because
Apple has the two components as Romeo
meaning thought projector and Juliet
meaning the iris scanner that both
merged to provide the whole face ID
facial recognition apparently there are
problems with the DA projector component
and that's the reason why we're
expecting delays and we expect the phone
to launch on November 3rd as expected
but obviously not at the production that
Apple was expecting it seems that the
company is going to take up to 2018 as
we were mentioning yesterday which is
terrible which also leads me to the
question today I mean think about it
would you be willing to wait up until
next year for your next iPhone we just
rather get the iPhone 8 and then wait
for the iPhone 11 or 10s to actually
solve all the things that Apple should
have done a while ago it was a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion I I don't know I'm a mixed
