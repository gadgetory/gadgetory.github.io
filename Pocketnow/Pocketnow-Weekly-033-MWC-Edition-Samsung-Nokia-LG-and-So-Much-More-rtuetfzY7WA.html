the mobile world has one live from our
last day at Mobile World Congress it's
another very special episode of the
pocket not weekly the once-a-week
podcast from pocket now calm where we
discuss smartphones and tablets just
like all those that just landed at
theatre Europa just down the road I'm
you're very tired host Michael Fisher
and i'm joined by similarly tired
managing editor and pounding Naja both
of us very full of tapas good afternoon
to you good afternoon everybody and we
are joined long distance once again by
editor in chief Brandon minimun where
the Sun is up good afternoon to you good
morning to you good and whatever what up
yes what up we don't have there are
things that are different about this
show today first just everything's
difference intimately thing is so oh my
god even though the show didn't pack
nearly the amount of surprises and
excitement we hoped it was still very
exhausting and we got a lot of stuff
covered actually we're uploading videos
as we speak there the last of our videos
are going up in the internet right now
so by the time this lands all of our
videos from mwc will be up except one
except for one except our wrap-up right
yes and then and then we'll probably
have the occasional bloopers because
everybody knows me and camera don't mix
well together haha that's not true i
thank you i think you did the best hosts
have a posting job of your career at
this year oh thank you sir yes and we
will also say get you guys yeah yo good
all right son of again I was gonna say
you guys you guys really got around and
I wanted to ask you I wanted to start
off by saying after going to Mobile
World Congress there must be at least
one device that you guys are excited to
buy and I was just one I'm just
wondering what that device might be for
for for each of you well i will let i
will let Tony go first but I will ask
you before it does
fine to just one because I have to
choose good all right Johnny so I would
most definitely as usual every year
would like to buy the bat phone but on
the interesting note i will most
definitely not end up buying bison sad
because of the huge thirteen hundred
dollar price tag on that or the 1000
euro price tag so yeah that's a want but
probably won't you don't want to sell
your car to get a pass on three mMmmm I
haven't thought about that maybe me now
that you mentioned maybe and if I was to
choose a number two I would be going for
the LG optimus g pro right I'm having a
strange bout of deja vu it seems like we
sat on these very these very big beds
talking about this not not 24 hours ago
and not for one time only right he we
just had the pocket our live hangout
last night everyone and we talked about
a lot of the stuff and we were glad to
be bringing in to the weekly so I'll
answer the question on the tablet side
this should be no surprise to anyone who
watched my hands on with the Sony Xperia
tablet Z Brandon though has not been
here he wasn't at the Hangout so he
doesn't know that this is the first time
in my life I've ever wanted a sony
mobile product so my god yeah it's
beautiful it's then it's light is
waterproof it's basically everything I
want in a tablet with the exception of
not having an app ecosystem it's it's
one it's one step closer to this future
where tablets will be like these just
surfaces you just pick up the surface
and it has virtually no wait and they're
virtually no depth and and the Xperia
tablet Z is so close to that but there's
one big problem which is that I think I
think a lot of the world is kind of over
this 10 inch tablet form factor and they
can't and it's good to have choice but
if they did this tablet in a 7-inch I
would have children with the tablet you
know I agree that I agree that I would
love to see it a 7-inch form factor as
well but having held it and I don't know
if you can tell this from the video but
when I pick it up and I pick it up with
like the last inch of the side of the
device in my fingertips and even then it
is so light it is unbelievable
leave how light it is also brought to
light for me I mean it's a matter of
things I I would find that to be too
light it's just what I thought of the s2
when I first saw it I it felt on
consistency well you know me yeah you
know I hate the galaxy I hate of the
galaxy s3 when I first picked it up
because I felt was to light it fell yeah
substantial but the Sony devices built
so well there it's light without feeling
like blood crap and that's why it's so
great to say it's really tough to get
that balance light and high quality it's
one of the few times I think we've seen
that in the mobile world from from from
me at least yeah yeah but but you're
right don't when you said it was too
late for you I just pictured you like
reaching for it and like picking up and
it like rocketing into the stratosphere
I think there was a feather but the
unform a less impressive or or less
established brand perspective the thing
I was excited most by is something else
that Tony couldn't care less about is
the the yotaphone out of Moscow see that
video Brennan the one with the e-reader
on the back yeah an ereader it's it's a
second display that happens to be
powered by e ink but it can be an
e-reader if you want it to be can be
whatever you want it'll display anything
that's the beauty of it and so I was
like it when I first rolled up in their
booth which by the way would look like a
jail cell so is that that the picture is
a futuristic jelsa yes yeah that's the
one that I tweeted yeah it's the bazaar
booth but we rolled up in booth and it's
packed right and it was packed that
booth was always back yeah everyone
wanted to see the yotaphone because
everyone's so starved for something
that's new right after we saw the note 8
we were like okay even though then this
is something we have discussed I mean
it's not that I don't like the yotaphone
it's it's a good concept I wouldn't find
it useful in my day-to-day usage I don't
really that ebooks on a phone I don't
use airplane tickets or boarding passes
on my phone so it dont map I don't need
navigation at all times on my phone so
it probably depends on on that person it
does and this is why you and I are a
pretty good
pair that our show like this because you
and I you do all the things I don't
exactly we're the exhibit finest example
of opposite use cases ever cuz i do
everything you just mentioned so yeah
probably the most compelling thing about
that was to me is if you throw a map up
on the on the e-ink display and of
course if the phone dies on your way to
your destination I just a got your
medicine that that's good cool and
that's awesome but the device something
that's full of compromises I mean the
size and the weight and I think it's you
know we still dream about this this dual
mode screen and we always think the new
iPhones going to have it or something
where you can like flip it into eating
commode and it's not on the other side
it's on the same side but it's a
two-mode screen that would be really
cool I think I media that would be a
very versatile very useful thing for
someone who either reads a lot or likes
apple adding another side switch the
mute switch joined by the new East oh
yeah yeah but ya know it was very
refreshing to have that comes what would
you purchase right now good question
you've got an angry commuter in the
background there or your ride is here
that was actually an ambulance oh yeah
you might have seen this last week but
if you didn't this is special effects
coming to you live from Barcelona yeah
so you have to put up with that and when
it's not the ambulance it's our neighbor
banging on the friggin wall so Brendan
Brendan if if you could buy something
from what it was announced here only
hear what would you buy well i was i was
first gonna say the optimus g pro just
because I've been impressed with what LG
has done recently and the 1080p screen
on that larger larger display it seems
like a note too but the way it should be
with a higher res display but then but
then Michael said the tablet Z and I was
reminded of it and I would get one but
then we have the same problem with
Android tablets you're gonna get the
Xperia tablet Z it's gonna have a crazy
good screen it's gonna be so light that
if you pick it up too quickly it'll go
into the stratosphere it's got the
really good build quality but then you
start downloading apps and you're like
cheese this Twitter act is massive you
know this um Facebook use the Facebook
app is just a
and and that's still such a big problem
and we talked about this all the time
and it's there's no end in sight to the
the crappy apps on Android tablets
problem and when you have a 7-inch
tablet it's not as bad it's like a big
phone at so I was printing for a comment
to a conversation at a major
manufacturer recently this manufacturer
makes Android devices and that was
brought up right this this app problem
on 10-inch tablets on Android and this
manufacturers attitude seemed to be if
we continue building 10-inch tablets if
we flood the market with these things
developers will have no choice that
seemed to be the attitude that did so
and they are right up to a certain point
yeah I cannot go into details as spur
how much effort the developers need to
support several resolutions on several
form factors on several display modes
but obviously too much because at the
moment aside from a couple of handful of
applications it doesn't seem to look
good yeah but there was other stuff we
saw a whole bunch of other stuff at the
show and what I was going to bring up
about 15 minutes ago with our
unconventional podcast discussion was
that we're going sounds outline today
listeners because we are we're just so
done because we're cool and we're
improving we're hip and worked out with
but we are also we are also the end of
the show and there's so much to choose
from it's just a wonderful glut of
product Brendan on a scale of 1 to 0
from from 0 to 10 how disappointed were
you about the Nokia heaven yeah um you
know I was watching that interview with
Stephen Elop on on the verge and they
clearly have a strategy they want to I
you know we don't really as consumers
are like high-end stuff and enthusiasts
we like like really high-end awesome
hardware but the truth is a lot of
people cannot afford that and so if you
can get some of that nokia nokia lumia
920 goodness in a product that's half
the price it's compelling to millions
and millions of people so they're
they're kind of doing what's right and
they're gonna have a kick-ass Lumia 920
successor in the near future will be
happy but we're a little bit
disappointed right now because
they're doing something to make sure
that their business grows I think
tactically it was probably wise that we
were talking to somebody from another
publication about this I don't remember
who about how we were somewhat
disappointed but at the same time I
think the Lumia 920 still has some legs
on it it still has a ways to go whereas
a twerp if Lumia had an if if Nokia had
announced this super PureView device I
think they would have shot themselves in
the foot not necessarily the Lumia 920
is a six month old device going seven so
it's it's about the time they updated of
course I understand that probably there
will be a major windows phone 8 update
sometime this summer towards ottoman and
if if they do something that's gonna be
the moment well it's not a six-month-old
way so I got three months older boy no
yeah was launched in November November
December January February that's no it
was lunch in October oh hey Brandon can
you figure this out for us no no okay
regardless I think I think the night
went I think that would have
cannibalized 920 sales if they announced
it now I think the 920 is still moving
but we'll see i don't know all i know is
we were very disappointed all right in
the moment i was very disappointed i
think everybody was yeah when we stuck
around a little tired that's i'm a
little tired of the not alphabet soup
but the number soup i mean you know i
officially cannot keep track of the 900
the 920 the 720 the 610 25 he can you
can you do it in one breath there's like
five of them nelson of all the US
carrier has to the 820 day 22 the 810
and then we've got then the laser for
verizon as another number which is
totally not related any of those yeah
it's crazy yeah but anyway you know it
was still a fun nokia event i found it
to be a good time it was announced in
September it was released in November of
2012 yeah thank you Tony felissa we were
both right can we talk about can we talk
about the asus fonepad i think you know
then the question would be which is of
course the 7-inch tablet that can make
calls which tony has gone on record by
saying that he would use yes
and now that you've seen it Tony of the
this device that we always you know
hypothesize about would you still you
hat or the better question is how would
you use it like would you put it in your
pocket yes so so the main reason why at
the moment I'm carrying both a tablet on
the phone is that I'm more productive on
the tablet but of course I need the
phone to make phone calls so it's double
the bulk double the devices if I had the
device which offers me more productivity
which is in this case the tablet and
also had the opportunity to have phone
calls not by a speaker or bluetooth
headset but as a bit an earpiece then I
would cut it down to one device only now
i'm not sure if it will be the asus
fonepad or the note 8.0 the form factor
in the concept this is the way I use it
Wow yeah it like I think what we came
down to last night and that in the
pocket on live discussion was basically
like why not have the feature I mean in
the US I think Samsung told us that more
likely than not that earpiece is gonna
be removed from the note 8.0 and in
their version of years probably yeah
yeah but so why the same reason why you
couldn't make a phone call on the Galaxy
Tab 7.7 which also have an air base but
but why do they take that away because
you probably you probably need a you
will consume both data and voice on that
and the carrier probably only wants you
to consume data right the carrier
probably doesn't want to because they
don't acknowledge that as a phone right
yeah it's a bit secara man there the
thing that probably has to do with their
preferences one way to the other book so
it doesn't hurt to have it that just
besides the earpiece my problem with the
phone pet is I don't understand how it I
don't understand why I anyone's excited
about it it's a nexus 7 with removable
memory and a backhand am an aluminum
back and they slower processor because
it's the until 24 whatever which is the
Lexington relationship yeah yeah and so
it's cheap so right but it's still not
as cheap as the nexus and it doesn't run
it's not an exit device you don't get
definitely ask Google experience and the
Nexus 7 has already made by a suit so is
this is this as soon as trying to stay
competitive as
ok this is this is what the nexus 7
should have been really with the slower
process nothing with the processor but
with the earpiece and the design and the
looks of it oh i did i see i should say
i don't agree i like i like the nexus 7
much better than this device
aesthetically I don't ya see what we did
this in our comparison video you can
throw around the next 27 a little bit
and not worry about that thing I think
you said you're talking about the
PadFone put the with the Lumina back you
were like and this can probably get
strapped scratched easily I don't know
Brandon what would you would you
consider the asus fonepad Frank you put
that I can't put that in my pocket I sit
down and like my pocket bust open yeah
so you wouldn't use it as your daily
driver is your phone no I don't I don't
see how it could ever work where I mean
you have your one phone number and it's
on your phone and that's what you carry
a lot and it's unless you could like
duplicate your SIM card and have calls
coming on your tablet if you happen to
be using it you go they daddy cool
you're thinking of it's wrong you need
to remove your sim from your daily
driver phone and make your phone pad
your daily driver that is supposed to be
and just think of it it's basically a
supergiant phone and imagine the battery
life on that phone I mean you have a
phone with a bet with a tablet battery
alright for me the minute I put that
thing up to my head and had a
conversation on it i think i would i
would immediately put it on ebay because
i couldn't i would not be able to deal
with holding that lunch tray up to my
face that's my only thing i think it's
the least ergonomic situation possible
and it doesn't really feel good against
your face now did you do it do we take a
picture of you with the with the thing
up again i'm no i'm showing it all for
that on every hangout possible anyways
yeah you know what I'm excited about and
I was hoping that this would be the case
and Emma World Congress is definitely
happening is that this year thanks to a
certain Apple device will be the year of
the metal phone the metal device
aluminum
so you're thinking one your thinking bat
phone you're thinking uh what else did
we had aluminum only Oh God and when
yeah I should see one do you think that
okay let me follow up with a question
right now do you think the s4 will be
anything but plastic or would it be
aluminum let's be fight it that's funny
um if they if they do aluminum I think
they will be chastised for that because
um that's not their style I think that's
gonna be plastic what do you guys think
yeah I think they got well we've been
talking about this all week and like
with the release of the note 8 looking a
whole lot like the existing you know
design language but we don't see them
changing that for the god of all of that
but don't forget the no date is a phone
which is a gap filler for a family which
is more characterized by last year so
that family starts with the S free
continues with the note 10.1 the s3 mini
102 and then the note a point when I'm
guessing that starting March 14 there
will be a new cycle and I'm hoping for a
new design cycle which will end up with
the s4 note 3 s4 mini added if so on if
we're talking hopes I'm right without
right there with you if we're talking
expectations I think Samsung has grown I
think Samsung is going to be timid this
year i think the galaxy s4 is going to
be underwhelming physically speaking
that's a very good point and public
service announcement Michael and I will
be in New York on March 14th to bring
you galaxy s4 coverage that's you know
that's that's such a good point about
having to be safe this year because
Samsung is in a very very comfortable
spot in fact Google thinks it's so
comfortable that they need to do
something about it oh you know this and
and so like Samsung doesn't have to come
out with all guns firing with some
innovative crazy new stuff they just
need to iterate because the galaxy s3 is
still really good phone it's got awesome
brand recognition everyone still wants
it and they just need to make it a
little bit better they're in every
they're kind of in an apple position
right like with the 4s and probably with
the 5s you know
yeah I think that's what I'm worried
about River here is that yeah I'm
worried too yeah I think that the I
liked the direction that Samsung went
with the s3 even though it was kind of
it was a little schizophrenic and they
they didn't really pull off the polished
riverstone thing but it was something
different i found it to be refreshing
because it was different I don't even
doing that though Michael and I have
been discussing or debating exactly this
well while on the show floor yesterday
by the way I got the chance to take a
look at the HTC One and yeah with the
thing i like the phone that it's no
doubt about it it's a great phone and i
took a test picture in the usual badly
illuminated HTC booth of Michael and I
know he's good but Zoe's a gimmicky you
either love it or hate her you probably
use it for like a weekend disabled if
that's that's something different but
the picture I took I wasn't sold on it I
mean I've seen lots lots lots of pixels
and it was jagged so so it wasn't it
wasn't clear it was excellent it was not
it was not that dim I mean at that at
that light level I was expecting more of
course I cannot draw a conclusion based
on that so this was the leading Michael
and I were just talking if the rumors
are true and the galaxy s4 will not have
an accident sir but the same Snapdragon
600 running on the HTC One then the
resolution will be a 1080p resolution
just like on the one and the specs will
be approximately the same it will all
come down to two things one the camera
which will probably be a 13 megapixel
camera on the s4 vs the four megapixel
ultrapixel camera on the HTC One and the
dizziness is gonna be a that's just
going to be a dagger in the face of HTC
who is trying to do this megapixels
don't matter crap I think that I
completely agree with you Tony it's
going to come down to largely in large
parts of the camera but also importantly
how the how each company positions the
device in the market and how they
advertise if HTC is not if HTC brings
the same lackluster push they did with
the 1-series compared to Samsung's
all-out assault it won't be very good
and by the way
better shooting cut leaf right listen I
will tell you this i will take a million
group parachuting commercials over
anything that samsung has put on my TV
recently these stupid commercials with
like the guys with the unicorn game and
then like they even managed to make Seth
Rogen and what and what's his face on
funny Paul Rudd I mean I like those guys
and I hate them in these commercials
like the Samsung commercials are
horrible but they're always around there
are so many of them that you can't help
but they spend so much on advertising
exactly and HTC can't match that I mean
right I haven't looked at their both I
can't say that with any I think I think
that they're going to I mean that that
was the difference between previous year
successes and and and last year where
they were so quietly and they had you
know some ads for the for the One X and
they just weren't good don't forget also
guys that the s4 is probably going to
have this octa-core processor it depends
on who who you listen to or who you read
there are several rumors some some of
them say there's going to be the octopus
octopus esser son sa is going to be
faster iteration of a quad-core
processor from from Samsung and XE nose
and some say they're going to go with a
Snapdragon 600 so no I don't think
they're gonna do that they're gonna stay
with their own silicon and once again
this is going to take this is going to
come down to messaging as well if
Samsung can make an octa-core processor
meaningful to the common to the public
that's going to be a real women but then
again let's and let's just speculate on
that what does octa-core mean for the
masses right now I think it means
exactly what quad core meant back in the
day when it was not supported by Android
octa-core is not supported by Android as
my speed just one sentence and I'm going
to end it up on this adding to the two
differentiating things the design on the
camera Michael mentioned yesterday and
he was right that we have sense 5.000%
she a shin between the two devices and
what do you think they're gonna do is
touch wiz I think that they have no
choice but to pretty it up I mean it's
really cartoonish right and we didn't
mind that when nature UX first came out
because it was so response one year ago
and it was eat but it was a year ago and
now it's just it hasn't aged
well in my opinion do you agree Brandon
or do gluten I never really elected to
begin with they had this whole nature
theme you know as you alluded to with
the you know it feels like a pebble in
your head the device itself and then
they introduced TouchWiz which had or
nature UX which tried to make you feel I
don't really remember they they tried to
say that it would make you feel relaxed
during Huey's yeah of course humans q /
mem that remember that they had that
advertising campaign in the beginning
then they pulled it because I don't
think anyone knew what the hell they
were talking about I agree i think that
is entirely but i think i think they
will change the theme that they have a
one year cycle in which they shut the
shop every device its design and touch
with and i think we're looking ahead
forward to the March fourteenth event as
a news cycle with a new design and the
new TouchWiz and the theme will be not
designed for humans but for monkeys out
into something else if it's a sensor if
it doesn't happen with the galaxy s4
unveiled and we're going to have to wait
for another year because it is the
smartphone group within samsung that
pushes TouchWiz for and it's basically
the s4 which starts it off yeah it's the
SD ice yeah yeah yeah so it's not going
to be like the galaxy camera two is not
going to be what's gonna find ya but
yeah well love to see it was amazing
though to walk past Samsung's like a cur
sized booth and realized i was i was
actually walking up to a samsung
representative and just to be on the
safe side i was asking them is there any
other device any new device which you
are showing off here which is not the
note 8.9 ace free ago5 something and she
was like no and that super huge samsung
booth was still full and they only had
the nailed a point out as a new device
on display they had lots of devices but
only the note 8 point wasn't yet
fascinating yeah they have a huge blood
buzz buzz around them and that's good it
is good for them and you know and I
don't mean to say we weren't interested
in somebody because their product I mr.
and they just we just didn't wanna stop
by because if they didn't have anything
we have
already covered yeah and before we could
jump off a samsung and I do want to talk
about this very briefly we we we can
talk about this right look like the
microsoft thing look yeah yeah yeah you
guys talk they didn't offer any official
comment on this but we're at a microsoft
event last night it was not during
announcements or anything like that
we're just makes it a trick sir yes it
was lovely they hosted us for some
cocktails and we got to talk to some
Microsoft folks and it was very nice but
they had about 40 windows phone devices
on the floor yeah that you could just
play with it see only by HTC not yes and
oh yeah and then they even had a huawei
there while we w one on the floor and
I'm looking around I want to show Tony
the deity bez an innate there and not
only is the ateam Odyssey not there
which is an American device man i don't
understand if that's not there but the
ativa said samsung is not represented at
all on the floor to the point where heck
yeah yeah and when we asked about it he
said let there's no particular reason
why it is not here so if you want to see
if maybe i can find a colleague who can
show you his personal one but it's it's
not it's not here but we it's not it's
nothing we can tell you about that it's
bad and you know what I just realized
even on the windows 8 side there were no
Samsung products there was no it's yeah
yeah yeah you see ya so why what are you
guys trying to say I'm just like I don't
know if it actually says anything or not
I'm sure it doesn't say anything
significant but it is i think it's
interesting that there were no Samsung
products on the floor of this Windows
Phone and Windows focused I'm going to
say something but not directly I'm going
to read the rate what I said previously
that some samsung samsung doesn't
doesn't really care about windows film
because the majority of their products
and their income comes from android so
this might be a passing back of the bowl
that Microsoft is slowly trying to not
push them out but let's say build the
buzz around nakia which is their child
and HTC they're using every lever that
they have to to to control the market um
can we talk oh just a little bit more
about this the the note 8.2 who this
device is for you
guys have felt it you put it up to your
face you put it in your pants or
whatever you've done with it and and
like you know I'm sitting there thinking
the you know you got the nexus 7 which
is like a such an all-around great
tablet and then you've got devices like
the you know the the suitable set foot
per phone head yeah you've got the phone
pattern then you've got you know the
heavyweight the Asus Transformer
infinity and then yeah you know what is
what is this 8 8 inch thing like what is
it who would buy that let me let me tell
you before Michael Johnson the note 8
point is for me and for people like me
who want to have a unified device all at
all times now you can throw in or take
away the S Pen thing you might use it
all the time like Michael does or you
might never get it out of the phone like
I do it's not about the S Pen it's about
the fact that it's made by samsung it's
running smoothly it has some additional
features and it has an earpiece now the
S Pen for me doesn't really matter but
for Michael it's it's a must yeah you
know I think the note aid is for people
who wanted the note 10.1 to be something
that felt a little more finished and
it's just who don't want to carry on a
10-inch now they want a smaller more
portable tablet that still retains the S
Pen and all that additional
functionality and as a matter of fact
and doesn't just kind of throw it on
there the S Pen on the note 8 also
function it offers additional
functionality in that it actually works
the buttons on finally right which is
finally a first place yeah and that
seems like a minor thing but Samsung is
really paying attention the S Pen there
there according developers to build apps
to take advantage of the S Pen there any
is there are there any third party apps
that are noteworthy universe ml
headboard footboard hacia if you can so
what is foot oh I thought you you hover
and it sure use your information use the
interview aside from built-in
applications and the developers will be
able to use api's to implement air view
in their applications whenever you hover
over with your S Pen then it will either
expand or show you something so you'll
be able to action without touch and we
chat but every time you hover
in the calendar it's a pain doing I will
be honest some of these features really
suck when you hover ever view is not
good for everything but I use interview
so much to scroll in a page you just
hover the S Pen over the bottom of your
page and your browser just scrolls for
you and I mean it's it's so nice and I i
think that there's a reason why this is
the galaxy note 8.0 and not the seven
point 0 or the seven point whatever I
think that since the iPad Mini is a 7.9
inch device there must be some marketing
thought back thought here so we got a
slightly larger but still higher PPI
screen than you do and of course they
got the S Pen I said that resolution I
mean I don't know what it is i guess i
guess consumers don't really it doesn't
really matter to them because like when
I see this 1280 x 800 thing happen over
and over and over again it's like let's
push things forward a little bit like
let's not see pixels yeah but aside from
you and I on the geeks who are listening
to this show nobody seems to care I mean
I people buying ipad yes absolutely so e
tu definitely it burns your eyes and I
can understand where you're coming from
I can also see them but I can neglect
them and I can learn to live with them
but your average Joe and Jane don't
really care about that I mean it's but
it's it's kind of like a broadband
internet like when you have 56 kg like
oh this was fast enough or maybe you
didn't and then you got broadband and
then you like I can't live without this
kind of like you know when you and
you're using a retina iPad you're like I
would never want to use a non retina
iPad again I think people just need to
have a taste of amazing clarity and then
they would want and and because of what
we do we constantly see new stuff and we
switch our devices off now if we
wouldn't work in this domain and we
would be stopped probably with a tablet
for like one and a half years you don't
get the chance to play with another
competitor and see that there is a
better option and then again all the
rest is just numbers yeah yeah um well I
have another mark on samsung they don't
talk about something else um did the
cool thing in my mind what the 8 inch
form factor is that it's getting closer
but it's still far away from this like
idea
of a digital notebook for people that
like to write stuff down because cuz cuz
the note the note the note 2 in the note
1 it's just slow too small because
you're the size of your palm is like the
size of the screen and then the 10.1 is
not portable but the eight like is
almost there did you guys find that to
be the case like was it very comfortable
writing or all right here here's the
thing I can't speak to writing because
we didn't have a time to do a lot of
writing on the know date when we were
filming our demos but holding the thing
they made a big deal about saying that
holding it they wanted it to feel like
you were holding your notepad your
journalist know about your diary or
whatever and it felt great to me Brendan
you have an iPad Mini if you hold the
ipad mini in your left hand and the note
8.0 right hand you can't tell the
difference is that light yeah Wow good
yeah yeah absolutely and and it's the
the field the look did do not inspire me
this size and weight yeah that that's
for the bank your psychological because
you probably are fed up with this design
I mean you've seen the s3 you've seen
the no.2 and probably you as you reach
the point where you say this is enough
but let's say that's your first Samsung
device your first contact with this with
you this your first sensor devices
something so library yeah I mean yeah
it'll it'll sell more than absolute
times a little bit but it doesn't it i
would not i would say it'll sell i would
say it will satisfy will it inspire
people no only not in the way that
samsung wants them to be inspired with
their whole like creative talk i like
that thought process cell satisfy
inspire it's like a checkbox you know
yeah right because i think i think that
the Third Point inspiration depend
heavily factors into repeat purchases
right I'm much more likely to buy again
from a company that has inspired me than
I am from a company that I've said yeah
their product is good and before I wrap
up the Samsung talk I have just an
adjacent question to you guys or an
announcement to make with the galaxy
note 8.0 the line between phones
phablets and tablets has officially
disappeared did you notice that we got
four or five inches 6 inches seven
inches
eight inches nine inches 10 inches 11
inches there's no line anymore it's I
mean you can still categorize them but
yeah there's no like well I out to the
line is still there the gap is not yeah
yeah well you have phones then you have
phablets and then you have tablets with
phone functionality and then there's
there's a huge blur what do we call
these that phone blitz oh oh God waiting
is this is this that no well I've wrote
about the phone book I remember what it
was that was that media yeah but it's
it's a phone book yeah we have a phablet
in a phone booth no but a fumble that or
no there's got to be a better name for
it well I'm excited to umm to import one
of these from from Europe and maybe one
of us can do an experiment to see I will
be the experiment because I will
definitely keep it as my data driver
because I'm the earpiece fanboy on a 7 /
8 inch form factor if anybody to if
anybody if Tony doesn't get a hands-on
with this thing is going to be a crime
because this is exactly as product we
are gonna but listeners we are
definitely going to get a review device
so much watch for that yeah let's let's
move on from Samsung did you have a
preference because we got a whole list
of things we've seen right not much
fight go on I do it Oh what was it no I
my London grants I do have a preference
I want to know what the heck is going on
with HP and after we get done making fun
of their tablet their first tablet I
want to know if there if you guys got ND
any indication that like this is just
them dipping their toe in the pond and
they're gonna come out with some badass
awesome tablets soon I must I must be
completely honest when we were at the
event where the HP was showing this off
we did not get an opportunity to talk in
depth because we were still we were
rushing to film a number of videos in a
very short amount of time because we
didn't have much time at this event so
we weren't able to get any any insights
except for the fact that in my view the
people representing HP at this event
were very nice and very knowledgeable
there was very little excitement on the
team there to show this thing off also
we have to mention that this was not a
dedicated HP event that it was a
get-together yeah
companies so that probably could have
added to this stuff I would like to say
that I am probably the only one on the
team who is not disappointed or not have
a sour taste in his mouth about this HP
android tablet I mean you got I know
what you guys think it's it's like last
year specifications and it just doesn't
sound right I mean I'm giving them first
of all the benefit of the doubt because
it's their first try and their first
attempt at something and they are trying
to keep the costs down while and this
was emphasized bringing better quality
materials than the competitors now we've
got to get aggressive good what's the
bezel made of and the frame is stainless
steel yeah and the back is is that the
such thing is they emphasize on this
that this feels better and of course for
me it feels better than the nexus 7 but
if you come to think of it the
specifications are not that good but
it's not just that they're not that good
let me let me speak to this row k I mean
I you know if you're going to put a 5
megapixel camera on the back of the
tablet fine it's a 3 megapixel camera it
is something from two years ago or three
right and tablet cameras useless but the
thing is I'm not willing to give HP the
benefit of the doubt because I've done
that right and it's not their first
attempt at a tablet they tried with
something that had far more potential
and which was released in a completely
unfinished condition and then that the
tablet that the android tablet it is
Rachel yeah so behind so if it is going
to be the first tried an Android tablet
why wouldn't they let me tell you why
because they are nothing amazed because
they are not Google who can sign a
contract with a sous to deliver super
super low priced devices and about the
only way you can cut prices down and be
competitive against the asuste Nexus 7
is to cut down on the specifications
replace your 5 megapixel with the free
megapixel replace a Tegra with a
Lexington and make that that move and
whether the market likes it or not it's
going to be that's another question but
they try to via Slee they have the price
point in mind
right and they cut every single corner
they possibly could to get to that point
and I in my opinion they released a
tablet that is more forgettable than
almost anything else I saw at the show
when this was a company first of all
that like helped found the computer
revolution and second of all which which
had something in its hands that will
truly could have been amazing you could
ask for it's just funny because it's
coming out in April yeah that's not even
the thing is a joke on so many levels
that I am Bob it boggles my mind that
this is the same company that creates a
beautiful product as the envy x2 you
wanna hear something funny I went to
their website because I wanted to see
the message you know these companies
have gotten really good at setting up
these like micro sites with nice
graphics and big pictures and they
always have a message at the top of like
why should I care and their message for
the slate 7 is two words experience
amazing but the thing that the cool
thing is that right under that they put
the price starting at 169 which is
really cheap and then there's a little
paragraph about why it's interesting but
like they're there I kind of agree with
Tony a little bit I kind of agree with
you too Michael but I agree with Tony
that you know they're entering they're
doing something that they there's an
opportunity here at this price point
because right now people that want a
cheap Android tablet they go with Kobe
they go with our coast they go with
those cheap like $99 tablets that you
see your grandma using and struggling
with and they all are they're not even
terrible their unusable they're so slow
there so bad and maybe like this slate 7
is gonna be crappy an April when it
comes out but are 169 bucks if you only
have a hundred and seventy bucks to
spend like maybe this is a good option
but but but the Nexus 7 is so close
thirty dollars more right for thirty
dollars more you get the nexus 7 with
like community laid Vantage's that
Google can communicate to you right
which is like fast software updates a
better display to my eye but to be
fairly don't know how HP will do that
will deal with the software updates I
mean we don't have any history at full
we know it won't be as fast as a nexus 7
the Nexus 7 is sometimes slow my Nexus 7
is still not updated to 4.1 point2 and
it's an ex
7 and it's a white one at that so that's
my nexus 7 buddy there that's yours and
I wanted to give it back to you I didn't
miss said it back with Mike Nahan skin I
kind of want to back years I've had four
point two four months oh my nexus 4
point 2 point 2 220 the four point to
point to a method will use the latest on
one I'm sorry all the latest so we don't
have any history of android history with
HP maybe they'll be I mean maybe they'll
be the first ones to update who knows
maybe they will suck I will say I will
say that the company has absolutely no
history of following through in mobile I
don't see that changing and when I saw
said that somebody else on the team had
written an editorial about HP sucking i
think was Hymie right with this photo
yeah of course was Hymie I was
disappointed because I wanted to be the
one to write the editorial you guys are
just slashing myself I'm rushing down
the drowning men back in the pool today
the end they've done for themselves I
just don't I you know I've done it
themselves and I have no no sympathy for
them let's talk about a company that
actually means something and I want to
talk about the LG optimus g pro just for
a second can I yes yes and we should
mention we should mention that the
optimus g pro is not the successor to
the optimus G no it's not the optimus g
pro is the answer to the galaxy note 2
and in many respects is LG is upping the
ante silly g pro at the moment is a
better option for a phablet than the
note 2 is but but there's the S Pen so
I've been recently using my mother the
note 2 as my daily driver and the g pro
is better in almost every aspect if you
count the higher megapixel camera the
better screen I even think it feels
better and it appeals more to me if I
stop here then it's a no brainer it's
the LG optimus g pro you talk about the
spec sheet yeah but if i take into the
equation the s pen which I don't care
about really but Michael doesn't
probably many others then then there's
that because on the g pro you can just
use your finger as a stylist and that
you know what that means and if you're
used to using the s pen and the entire
package with which it comes the old s
applications then the tunnel to is still
still still there there
let me speak to that for one second but
after Brian I feel like trying to go
ahead well I was I was gonna ask I was
going to ask the house the the back has
that that glass thing I know the back is
blasting exact so if you rub your finger
against the back of the S free or the
note to you got the exact same feeling
when you rub your finger against the
back of the Jeep bro it's the same
plastic it's probably even the same
technology but they have the same
texture which you'll see on the Nexus 4
it just plays nicely in lights and it
reflects and it's squares in itself and
michael says it's like good like I've
like a cheap tile bathroom floor in a
motel you never want to go to oh my gosh
that's my worst no longer on the white
one oh yeah but we haven't seen the
bloody haven't seen the black one the
black one might be beautiful I just
think the white one looks like we're and
this this we have also we have to say
this that these devices which were on
the show floor at LG were the South
Korean devices which also had the
antenna for TV and radio reception they
probably might bring the global version
and other colors or other colors too and
I will say on the software so it's not
just that the S it's not just the s-pen
that the note to bring to the game that
makes it a better phablet in my opinion
it's it's Samsung's optimization of
TouchWiz to suit the larger form factor
you know the multi screen is a better
way of multitasking in my opinion than
the resizable window approach that LG
does there are more customizations look
there's a limitation and the Galaxy Note
2 if you have the multi window update
which I'm currently not running you can
only stack up two applications at one
time as with the cube slide on the LG
you can have like five or six
applications like back in the day of
Windows 3.1 when they were attacked what
about the other with different
transparencies and you can just move
them around like it was a windows pc so
you can do more on on a screen with not
enough real estate to make that
experience worthwhile so yeah you can
run six things at once and show your
friends but it's not a good
you'd be like workflow well it depends
you can have a small calculator and left
you can have a small note but on the
right and then your Twitter largely on
the bid it all depends on how you
planning on using it yeah and on
something like a tablet that makes sense
to me but like not on 5.5 inches and
huge I think here's the thing and we've
you know what after this is great
because after we talked about this here
in the podcast we can take like a whole
weekend of not arguing about the optimus
g pro i think it is the finest example
of copycatting without understanding why
you're copycatting and i think it is a
product that has no reason to exist well
there's one thing here that we're
forgetting which is that if Samsung is
sticking to its yearly release cycle
we're not going to see the note 3 until
the summer so now LG hasn't as I'm
through uncle autumn even Mountain diva
beginning of September hmm yeah so LG
has this huge window of time and and
Samsung's not going to accelerate their
their note 3 development just because of
the g pro so LG has this huge window of
time to convince people that this thing
is better and what are they gonna do
they're probably gonna say that the
screen is much better they're gonna say
I memorized better the processor is
faster yeah well harp on those and by
the way we didn't take any shots with
the optimus g protein on it might be a
total POS it's just for my resolution
because the note 2 as you said earlier
the note 2 cameras quite good is among
the best camera I've ever used but it
says it's as good as the gaps as a same
cameras calcium happy iphone 4s n dat
bass and the 4s yeah so what I what I
want to say is that the optimus g pro is
by no means an iteration of the optimus
G but i think that the optimus g pro is
what what resulted after the LG optimus
view and view to evolved oh please don't
say a curse word now i will say remember
we're on the floor at LG and the guys
like we were asking about the fidelity
like oh we've got the optimist did you
see that yet last year and the view to
get also lets you we got the view
no we don't want to see that so I think
that this the the g pro is the view
evolved and probably what the view
should have been and if you get so much
better this this finger I don't know
noting or writing more so that that was
introduced with the view and the
software side of it hasn't changed maybe
it has been upgraded to a better
experience but I don't see it as
copycatting the samsung now they just
brought up and just one sentence and I'm
gonna end this they just brought up a
large screen size phone which happens to
be able to get some melt input from your
finger like every other phone in their
lineup at MVC yeah which is it yeah
which is a horrible feature when you use
it with your finger yeah especially on a
three-inch something device how I wish
we did I'm sorry Brendan yeah I was just
gonna say the the g pro screen besides
being super high resolution from the
pictures and videos I've seen looks very
good quality good viewing angles good
color and saturation like is it I can
justify that yes it's one of the best
greens yes which holds true with our
experience in the LG optimus G which has
a wonderful screen yeah yeah yeah
playing with my right now yeah um so if
we if we can I would like to talk about
what we saw today yes please which is
brand of the video is probably live on
another the last time you looked at our
at our site but we don't screen the
Sailfish the Sailfish yeah so we got our
opportunity to to play with yoga's
sailfish OS which is still running on a
developer device it's a nokia m 950 yep
and actually CTO newly-promoted CTO
Stefano Moscone you gave us a nice
interview told us a little bit about the
direction they're going talk a little
bit about the sdk they just released but
we got to see this always running in
person for the first time and i think we
can say it's a very beautiful OS yeah i
am excited too so if like I just said
this to Michael if i am to choose right
now between any platform which is a
recent startup I'd use yola over kubuntu
maybe ela over-seasoned so yeah I think
they're heading into a right direction
they are doing things come
legally differently from everybody else
and it's either the novelty of things or
it's probably the beauty of the things
which is appealing but it is appealing
I've got a few questions about about
selfish I've been watching you bunt to
bunt to very closely and that is easily
easily ported to legacy hardware and not
that you would want to do that right now
because it's so early and so have
thinked but does this is like what is
this is this the linux-based yes yes its
limits and it will it will run native
Android applications it will run native
android apps yes what yeah it's kind of
a situation like that like the
blackberry or the emulator hope foot
well it's but it's not quite an emulator
it's more like a when I did it right and
when I said in the interview like oh
okay so people will be able to port
android apps he was like no there's no
porting record you just run the android
apps right on through is how do you do
that you got to get google play on there
you'd probably find a way around to get
the apks yeah so what is their plan to
to get this since the world so when we
eliminated like launching it they're
going to launch it with they are going
to have a device they are designing a
piece of hardware that will carry forth
the visual language of the OS into into
the hard one roll so they are going to
release hardware of their own they are
also planning on licensing it to other
manufacturers I don't know who they're
talking to if anybody and they are they
have not ruled out the possibility I
think of offering this for download for
existing hardware so so they would would
they talk about like providing
instructions and and knowledge base
resources on doing that they didn't go
to that you know I think there's the
company we have to keep in mind yola is
is 60 people strong this is a very small
very very small company and I think they
have to stay razor focused on one thing
at a time and right now that seems to be
from the impressions that I got that
seems to be the piece of hardware they
haven't announced yet the smartphone so
I think we'll have to wait to see that
before we can cure concrete responses
hung on the few and of course would like
with every other company they have the
separate divisions one of which is
working on the user experience one
just working on the aspect and looks of
the platform itself one of them is
working probably at a hardware support
and whenever these separate divisions
reach their final target their final
point of development then we'll join
everything together and probably will
see the end result interesting now
having seen it in person and used it and
and erasing the fact that there's some
novelty involved here is this an
operating system that you guys could use
as it on a daily driver today no I mean
its current in Wells pre-production do
yet today no you know once its once it
polished and it's working I could give
it a try like I gave symbian a try
Symbian Belle or or nokia n9 running on
me go so I don't see why not especially
if you'll be able to run a native
Android applications even if it's going
to be emulated do you have access to the
world's largest or second largest App
Store so that's not going to be a
problem so it's just like a new
interface you have to learn it and it
depends on the learning curve the more I
think about it now and having seen it in
person the more I think that sailfish
looks like an OS that if you put it on a
virtue if you put it on a really
high-end piece of hardware it would look
beautiful because so much of selfish is
focused on the aesthetic the visual
appeal to the point Brandon where it you
know the ambiance thing where you can
select a a wallpaper and like if it's
like a wallpaper with all the leaves on
it it'll change the entire OS palette to
greens so it's really pretty it's
gorgeous and if you take it actually we
took a picture of me in the video and
then we made a Michael Fisher ambience
so the whole thing was this kind of
ridiculous for the sweating flesh tone
so just adjusting how this works if
those of you who are running itunes 11
know this with the iTunes does it with
the album covers the software itself is
checking for a color which is mostly
present or omnipresent within the
picture which you are setting as an
ambience and then it changes your text
accordingly just to make a contrast or
readable but still keeping it in sync
with the visual guide line yes not just
text with like highlight color
yes yes the theme so that's cool so yes
I think it's very pretty and just answer
your question Brenna day if the app
situation is that by the way they're
offering a native SDK to and which they
announce today so yes you can code
sailfish apps and I think 20 minutes
after they released the sdk that for the
40 line code yeah oh yeah it's like a
gallery app is like 40 40 lines of code
that's it does that mean it's okay
apparently is very elegant yeah yeah it
doesn't take very long to code apps for
this place and and the camera app is
also nice 20 minutes after they released
the sdk they have their first app which
was a podcast app like it wasn't like
pong or something you know so that's
pretty cool I mean you start asking
questions about this though and you
start thinking it's like is there room
now for what for a fourth platform for a
fifth left arm well there certainly is
room and we are always supporting
newcomers the question is that as we
said it yesterday on a podcast
unfortunately windows film is still
struggling for that third spot and it's
not at all secure so at one point when
you don't even reach five percent you
cannot consider yourself a solid third
competitor so i think that the game is
on for the third option we said
yesterday on the hanger on the hanger
i'm sorry so anyway yeah that's way it
was i think overall it was really good
fund it was fun absolutely and watching
this new platform run on a piece of
hardware that was three years old he
runs smoothly that that that that piece
of hardware is standing at the base of
Nokia's current smartphone design
language that's the predecessor of the
nokia n9 and the n9 was basically the
final final version of the nokia lumia
800 and then SOR why don't we talk a
little bit about Kwame and the ascend p2
sure good I like that phone you did I
mean aside from the fact that it doesn't
have a 1080p screen I'm trying to
remember it's I don't need a 1080p
screen on a four-point something inch
screen the 30 megapixel camera we took
the samples I shot you with the huawei p
2 and you shot me with
right we established that it's it's a
mediocre camera right at first glance
the the images looked good but when we
blow up the entire size of the image on
the computer you could see some noise
even in well-lit situations and then
there's the emotion UI which I find to
be good but it's a strange combination
of other competitors options pretty much
defines cartoony yeah but all in all the
piece the piece of hardware feels good
in the hand and the the software
experience is fluid it is it is fluid
where I'm sorry I don't I remember the
day I remember covering in I don't
remember what it feels like I don't
remember what it looks like I have to
look at us that's that's that's because
it was one of those videos when Michael
Fisher was behind the camera and not
tell me behind a camera so I'm excited
about the hoo-ha the S&amp;amp;P too and I think
they might manage to uh to do something
with that but we had a little bit of
dilemma we wanted to shoot a comparison
video and we didn't really know what to
shoot it against ya because of the specs
I mean shooted against the s3 I mean
that's a almost a one-year felt old
phone shooting against other competitors
i'm not sure what do you think Brandon
about the Ascend p2 I I can't think of
anything that would make me want to use
one or buy one yeah boom sorry boom
sorry Charlie yeah yeah I was thoroughly
underwhelmed it was hoping to see their
w-2 smartphone but they did this
mid-range android phone is like sweet as
a mid-range android phone i bet you're
excited about the LG optimus l3 too oh
yeah a little palm size box of Congress
yeah you know there was actually another
another brand I wanted to talk to you
before we left and Brandon of course
we'll ask for your thing but we also did
just get back from the CTE thing the
know that NEC thing the the kyocera echo
resurrection the the medias W and I
think that video is up now to or should
be it should be idea anyway so that
thing um filme probably looks like total
garbage for babies yeah
but if when you hold it you it's not
until you hold of that you realize that
it's not it's not the case here echo at
all it's a much thinner much lighter
much more modern device that folds
differently it doesn't have a hinge that
requires 39 patents because it's so
convoluted the thing actually can't
close like a book with the displays on
the outs each display in the outside
front back which it has a whole bunch of
disadvantages to it but one of the
advantages it does is if you fold it at
90 degrees and put it on a table you can
throw the same video on both screens so
if you're sitting across the table for
each other you can be watching the same
thing which is uh yeah i mean that's
cool but ultimately it's still got a big
old bezel running down the center of the
screen yeah yeah so until they manage to
do something with that bezel and join
them okay I can live with one or two
millimeters but not two or three
millimeters on each side which adds up
to six and I see a picture and there's a
huge bar in the middle and that's a
deal-breaker for me yeah yeah but you
know that was I think our last video
shutter or second last video we shot
here at mwc and it was nice to sort of
end on a product that wasn't just
another iterative slab rectangle you
know somebody doing something different
we always love to see that what about
the ZTE phablet I don't remember it
either yeah everyone with the 3d esque
the dual-mode home screen with the 3d or
the flats yeah right the one where you
could be high will be repulsed by the UI
or fully repulse but you have you have
gave it to it that it had a great
display the split was wonderful as an
end and that's bad that's just about it
yeah no I don't want to give this thing
too much bunk this is the ZTE memo grand
memo right ma'am yeah you know Brendon
remembers handling the Grand not the
ground king ass but the grandes at CES
probably right yep yep and I think I
mean Brandon you were you were kind of
halfsies on it I think you were excited
about it in the moment then afterwards
you were like who's gonna buy this right
it's rough friend yeah just yeah that's
kind of what I felt about the grand memo
you know if it was another for me if
you're going to bring a phablet to
market I need to know why you're why
you're doing it and I need to know what
you did edit utility it brings me
besides a huge screen I didn't see it
with this one well the phablet concept
by itself is not about the s-pen I think
you're associating the phablet with the
S Pen I'm not I'm associating the
phablet with I'm saying if you're going
to build something the size of a phablet
you have to have items like the S Pen
but not the S Pen by itself though you
need to build more in the way I see it
the phablet is just a device between a
tablet and and the phone it's just a
larger screen device that's what i call
the phablet no then it's just as fun
that's the droid DNA I mean to me that a
5-inch you know screen yeah we're
talking close to six now 5.5 or seventh
and that so I think that that's the
phablet I think if you put a six inch
screen on something or 5.5 inch screen
on something if you want to get just if
you want to get me to buy it makes a
phablet the phablet it functionality
that I cannot find on a smartphone I
disagree well then what's the need for
another category I mean what was it why
are you have minivans and then large
cars like why don't you just that
analogy doesn't live here i think that
the phablet is that exact segment of the
market which is filling in which was at
that point filling in the blanks between
the four inches of the time and the 10
inches or the seven inches at the time
and that category was named phablets 4.8
plus but seven minus what do you think
Brendan I don't know yeah it's it's it's
it's an archetypal topical argument that
is at its core boring I'm so times
unless let's sing seeing huge phones for
no reason let's say I remember there's
no reason to exist go ahead Brenda Leigh
we should end on an interesting note
let's look can we please dear let's
let's talk about something that's not I
mean aside from the fact that i'm flying
out like in a couple of minutes yeah we
gotta run what do you have something in
mind rent no ok let me i'm looking at my
thing here
what I look at my notes here and Brenda
would you buy a phone purely because the
screen is not protected by a gorilla
glass but a sapphire glass which is more
expensive than the gorilla glass but
it's basically indestructible um I think
that would be a nice nice feature
because you know yeah i'm looking at my
iphone screen which has a girl a glass
and some Space Age stuff going on and
it's scratched up and any phone that I
use on a daily basis or even worse than
cases I you ever see someone with it
with a phone and they have a screen
protector and like the edges are peeling
up using Dustin yeah you're like you you
like this is the worst experience you
could possibly have just take it off
take off the screen protector and be a
little more careful um but why is their
phone coming out with a sapphire crystal
yesterday there's another video it
should be up by the end of this podcast
where we have visited a company which is
located in Boston which is currently
producing some neat zaphire screens or
glass well Zephyr is not glass so's
Empire slabs of protection for certain
electronics and they are very much
liking the idea or would like the idea
of entering the smart phone / tablet
world in approximately two or three
years right and just to be clear this is
not a protective screen protected they
said this would replace Gorilla Glass
yes in the house line yeah and we saw we
saw a cool demo on the video but yeah
involved scratching up a lot of glass
with some concrete and then trying to do
the same thing on sapphire and it's a
little harder to tell in the video
because our lighting wasn't wasn't the
best but I'm standing like three inches
away from the thing I'm like wow you're
really like putting his weight on this
concrete go ahead to the sapphire and
Sapphire just wouldn't refuse to scratch
and Gorilla Glass 2 it was not the third
iteration than you Muslim but the second
one got scratched really easily yeah
yeah and it's informative so everybody
should check it out you should check out
the video yet it is really cool and we
talked to this gentleman about maybe
visiting is a company considering I live
literally 30 minutes away in Boston at
me awesome they would but anyway so that
was interesting and there was so much
interesting stuff here at mwc even
though the device Avalanche that we
didn't really expect ultimately never
materialized so there
a lot to see I think we got to put a lot
of it on film for our listeners for our
readers for our Watchers and you know it
was a really really fun time and it was
there's a lot of stuff that was shown
off Tony and I by the way and and I
should have said this what we were
talking about Samsung have been a
walking samsung commercial yes at a time
for show because when we're not like
beaming photos to each other on our
galaxy notes we are we were like oh
what's your apartment look like so we're
like talking about our home life we're
like drum using S Memo to draw doodles
of our like hometowns and hahahahaha
layouts and stuff yeah but usually in
the subway when we were traveling were
just sharing images by a quote of myself
bumping our phones together usually SS
game every time I envision every time we
sent a picture a plus I could change
yeah yeah it was like we have more and
more sense than money going in our
pockets of course esm some fans
celebrate one yeah so it was a good time
we hope that it was it appeared to be a
good 10 an exciting time from your
perspective Brandon yeah it was very
interesting to see lots and lots of
videos and um I think it's it's it's
becoming more clear and more clear and
more clear than the big guys are holding
off on announcements until they can
control the situation more and do a new
york city event or London event mwc will
not die but I've been covering mwc for
quite some time now but I'm seeing it
going slowly slowly south I mean the HTC
was missing this year Samsung was
missing this year who knows maybe even
LG will be missing next year and then
that will leave us with pave ZTE and the
startups right and dozen HTM Samsung
present but there was nothing crazy
coming yeah I expected HTC to bring
something woke me didn't ya uh we'll see
happy but as you said you have to get on
a plane Brandon your business to attend
to and I need to go buy souvenirs for my
loved ones oh yeah SAS execute I think
yeah I think we should we should wrap it
up listener mail sorry guys we haven't
even looked at the list
message yeah yeah but this is a special
edition podcast so I hope you'll forgive
us and I think Brandon if you do not
have any closing thoughts then I will
take us right out do not have closing
thoughts grateful it was lovely to hear
your voice but that is that is going to
do it for this episode special episode
