device of crazy specifications case
leaks already point to an iphone 7 with
more ports and features but similar
design and tmobile seems to have pushed
some buttons over at AT&amp;amp;T I'm hi Mary
vera and I guess the smartest way to
enjoy the west coast it's actually get
up earlier and I don't know don't be so
confused by the time zone this is
parking out daily
the official news today start with deals
we have been waiting for quite a while
for some application that might be
announced by t-mobile on june six
that'll give you deals on pizza and
stuff like that but if you think the
t-mobile is the only company AT&amp;amp;T just
announced it's a thank-you service which
pretty much works in the same way you
get deals on movie tickets etc you can
learn more in the links in the
description and speaking of deals Apple
is back with their usual back to school
program if you are still eligible for a
student discount lucky you you now have
the benefit of getting beats solo2
whenever you buy a mac or powerbeats 2
whenever you buy any iOS device but
there is a tier for the price tag I just
don't understand how headphones have
anything to do with you know education I
would have rather gotten something
different like an iPod Touch like they
used to do but hey that's just me now
some very interesting rumors come from
the one plus three mainly because of two
things number one apparently the price
tag will be $350 number two apparently
the company is gearing up for 1 million
units on launch which is nothing but hey
they know their numbers this device
definitely will be a flagship killer
along with the axon 7 and whatever moto
Z we get it's gonna be a very
interesting mid-year let's see what we
get and speaking of rumors some very
interesting ones come from case makers
obviously if you want to know how the
next iPhone will look you have to trust
these guys and now we've got some of the
iphone 7 that show was three important
things number one the smart connector
number two the dual camera number three
well there is no quad speaker apparently
there's this gigantic speaker at the
bottom but there are some perforations
at the top of the case so it could just
be that apple's figuring something new
out whatever the case may be we can not
wait to let you know more though it
doesn't seem like there will be much of
a design change and finally the very
interesting news today or should I say
let's continue with the rumors are about
the galaxy note 7 edge because he
apparently won't be called galaxy note 6
galaxy note 7 is apparently going to be
a beast and specifications we've got a
Snapdragon 823 processor along with six
gigs of ram with options up to 256 gigs
of storage and iris scanner for
authentification along with obviously
the fingerprints
a 4,000 milliamp hour battery as well in
addition to the s pen and pretty much
everything we can expect from the Galaxy
Note lineup this is clearly going to be
a beast of a phone so much so that we
want to know in the question of today
what is your wish list for the galaxy
note 7 what would you like to see in my
case apparently the rumors also include
waterproofing so that would be one thing
and then the second thing would be how
about a replaceable battery but thats
just me leave us a comment down below
