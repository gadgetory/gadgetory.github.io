iphone 6 plus two surprises all along
with this apple finally takes a stab at
mobile payments with Apple pay and
believe it or not apple also announces
its Apple watch I'm high Meadow Bavetta
and we will try to make this episode not
fully about Apple today this is pocket
out daily today is full of official news
both good and bad as AT&amp;amp;T has just
announced that they will be carrying the
Moto 360 which is great the only problem
is that even though they'll priced of 0
to 360 at the same prices as other
carriers and even the same motor roll up
they haven't provided a date the only
thing we know is that verizon is
probably carrying it on november 11th
but even more interesting we've got some
interesting data from the Moto 360 that
reveals that even though they tout a 320
million power battery it seems to be
only a 300 million power battery after
tear down which means that that is the
main reason why the battery life is so
terrible and if you're wondering exactly
what the name of Android L would be
there is this chrome bug that pretty
much revealed that it's going to be
dubbed Android LMP and LMP can stand for
lemon meringue pie orange pie or
whatever you're going to call that thing
I cannot believe that google actually
plans to continue its pastry thing and
choose the lamest name in history where
you could probably just call it android
l or at least call it lollipop but
anyways reports are there obviously
these are just rumors and it could be
that google changes its mind at the edge
now let's hook the page over to Apple
but let's talk about the least important
things until Apple can prove otherwise
they have just announced Apple pay which
is their new mobile payment system and
it does work with the new iPhone 6 that
we'll talk about in with the new Apple
watch that we'll talk about through NFC
in the same fashion that it works with
Android the only difference is that
Apple has approached it from the other
side they've partnered with Visa
MasterCard and American Express and with
a ton of banks in addition to
supermarkets retailers restaurants and
just about everybody in a way to have
the system working by October meaning if
you buy any of the Apple products that
support it you will be able to use your
mobile payment system through touch ID
and there is this new secure feature in
the Apple products that you will choose
to buy that will not allow Apple to keep
your information which is really
interesting
now let's see if it works as obviously
nobody else has figured it out up next
let's talk about the Apple watch not i
watch Apple watch and it's actually in
three different features we've got the
Apple watch which is made of stainless
steel we've got the Apple watch sport
edition which is made of aluminum and
then we've got the apple watch edition
edition yeah I know weird name but
that's made out of 18 karat gold and
we've got different straps we've got the
most smart way to replace the straps
with just a simple button you can
replace them get the sport ones get the
metallic ones get the stainless steel
ones you can choose whatever you want
but even more interesting as a software
there is a new user interface that works
a lot with the button dial in addition
to having a touchscreen that's made out
of sapphire and other interesting
specification that we've got here we've
got a lot of sensors that are working
with this Apple watch and the only
problem with it is that it will be
launched until early 2015 so yeah it
brings a lot of the health kit features
from the iphone 6 and iOS 8 and the
iphone 5s and other devices that support
it but the problem is that you won't be
able to use it until early 2015 when
there is a date for launch it starts a
three hundred fifty dollars which is not
bad but obviously there is an Apple
watch that will cost thousands of
dollars that would be the apple watch
edition so stay tuned as we get more
information whenever Apple plans to
reveal this and finally for the hot news
of the day Apple unwraps the iphone 6
and iphone 6 plus both devices available
for pre-order on September 12th and
ready to launch out to temper 19th Nova
strange mentioned you get the same color
options space grey gold and silver and
these are pretty much the same phone
only one is bigger than the other the
only differences are in the display
where you get close to 720p resolution
on the iphone 6 and 1080p resolution on
the iphone 6 plus but then again
everything else is the same you get the
same camera same a chip the same m8 a
coprocessor you get the same ram storage
options which are 16 gigs 64 gigs and
128 gigs where you pay twenty dollars
for the 16 gig $300 for the 64 gig and
four hundred dollars for the two-year
contract for the 128 gig and then just
add a hundred dollars if you want the
bigger iphone but again the
specifications are
pretty much the same and these phones
actually look hot they're thinner than
the iphone 5s though obviously bigger
and there are some new iOS tweaks here
and there in order to make use of the
new screen real estate which is great
but there is so much detail on these
phones that I would rather send you to
the links in the description where
Steven covers everything so that leads
you to the question of the day what are
you getting are you getting the iphone 6
or the iphone 6 plus because in my case
honestly i love the fact that the iphone
6 plus has better battery life all the
way but i think i'll stick to the iphone
6 the basics 4.7 inch model because
carrying two phablets will be enough but
leave us a comment down below and let us
know what your preferences friends you
know the drill if you want to get it was
