pocketnow.com here at Aoife in Berlin
this time at the Samsung booth where
we're checking out the brand new Galaxy
Note 2 this is a 5.5 inch display on the
new device as opposed to the 5.3 inch on
the previous one but they findout the
bezel so the device still sits rather
nicely in the hand that's an HD Super
AMOLED display there underneath powered
by a 1.6 gigahertz quad core Exynos
processor with 2 gigs of ram backing
that up Android 4.1 jelly bean is
providing the experience with Samsung's
new nature nature UX version of TouchWiz
there's an 8 megapixel autofocus camera
on the back 1.9 megapixel camera on the
front the same camera switches on the
galaxy s3 Full HD recording and playback
obviously the s-pen dock is down here on
the bottom as on the last time but the
s-pen itself has been slightly
reimagined with a different tip to give
it a different texture on the glass
other various s-pen optimized apps on
this device of course we're familiar
with s note the ships even on non stylus
enabled devices you notice when we hover
over stuff here we can
it's like hovering over a an icon or a
button with the mouse wheel o pop-up
calling out its functionality and of
course right in the free hand and you
can see the different levels of pressure
sensitivity very clearly here obviously
a big improvement over earlier
iterations there's obviously there's
formula mode there's text mode to
transmit to transpose your stuff into
regular text
or Roxanne text if you are in a rush
obviously this is powered by a 3100
milliamp hour battery huge battery
compared to any other device on the
market in this in the phablet class the
usual sweet Wi-Fi b/g/n Wi-Fi direct
bluetooth for today and and NFC
responsiveness throughout the device in
my experience here at Aoife has been
really stunning especially considering
the TouchWiz layer sitting on top of
that and the fact that this is a demo
unit that's been really manhandled
rather severely when I hop into the
browser and show you just hop on over to
pocketnow.com very briefly a nice
website you should probably visit once
in a while
really nice roomy keyboard obviously as
you might expect on a device this size
will go to the desktop site treat this
like the pseudo tablet it is page is
loading nicely over Wi-Fi here and there
is our full pocketnow.com
site
page load time certainly very acceptable
not just network speed but rendering
speed were dealing with here doesn't
take much for this device to keep up
with our even fast scrolling do a little
pinch to zoom to show you what that's
all about the resolution on this device
is technically lower than on the
previous unit because the Samsung has
changed the aspect ratio but you're not
going to notice that unless you're a
real resolution hound and as you can see
responsiveness very very nice as far as
the cameras go we told you that it's the
same camera sweet as the sgs3 but we
have some software optimizations here
and there's always somebody in a group
shot who won't smile you pick best group
pose you decide try and get everyone in
the group in the shot take the photo
instead of like burst shot where it
takes 20 shots and something like a
second this takes five shots over the
course of a couple seconds then it will
think about it and it will use the
facial recognition technology when you
tap on a face you can choose the best
face of that particular individual
select that and the shot will adapt
itself not a major improvement to the
camera camera experience but obviously
Samsung not taking their eye off the
ball with imaging on the galaxy note 2
so that's just a quick look at the new
samsung galaxy note 2 here from Aoife in
Berlin stay tuned for a lot more
coverage on more Samsung products more
of everybody's products as we make more
videos to save your viewing desires
thank you very much for watching it's
been Michael with pocketnow.com as Tony
behind the camera stay tuned for more
and we'll see in a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
