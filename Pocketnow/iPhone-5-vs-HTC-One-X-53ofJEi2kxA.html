pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to compare the HTC One X with the
iPhone 5 let's get to it okay so both of
these devices are very different but
they have one thing in common they both
have extremely highly regarded displays
in fact for the last six months or so
most people would agree that the HTC One
X is the phone to have the best display
it's got amazing color amazing contrast
a great PPI and overall it just has
really good qualities of a good display
then the iPhone 5 came out which
improved upon the iPhone 4s is display
by increasing color saturation it's
higher resolution and it you can fit
more on the screen at one time so in
this video we're let you decide if you
think the One X is better than the
iPhone 5 or if the iPhone 5 is the new
reigning champ in terms of quality of
display so let's talk about
specifications these are obviously very
different there are two versions of the
One X this particular version is the
Tegra 3 quad-core international version
which has a gigabyte of RAM but in the
u.s. on AT&amp;amp;T you can only get it on one
carrier you get it with a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
CPU with one gigabyte of RAM and 16
gigabytes of storage now the Apple
iPhone 5 is available on three carriers
in the US and in some places it actually
will work on t-mobile we've got the a6
dual-core 1 gigahertz CPU care with 1
gig of ram and 16 gigabytes of storage
to start and these are about the same
price actually the 1x might have come
down a little bit they both started at
$1.99 for the 16 gigabyte version and
the 1x might actually be at about 99
bucks now with a two-year contract both
of these devices have LTE they both have
8 megapixel cameras we'll talk more
about camera quality later they both
have about 1.2 megapixel front-facing
cameras and a lot of other features that
you would expect so in a lot of ways
they're very similar obviously they're
running different software we've got
Android 4.0.3 here and iOS 6 now let's
talk about the hardware on both of these
the HTC One
is about 8.9 millimeters thick and you
know in the hand that feels extremely
thin because what HTC has done is that
they carved out this nice edge so when
you wrap your hands around the device
you're actually feeling this part edge
and not sort of this sort of bulbous
backing that contains the battery kind
of a trick that a lot of manufacturers
are doing now but it works it makes the
device feel thin HTC also has this
infinity display so it kind of looks
like the display keeps going as it sort
of wraps around the edges definitely has
a really unique design then on the back
we've got the polycarbonate here and a
very attention-getting lens or ring
around the 8 megapixel camera HTC has
their dedicated image sense chip which
should make taking photos much better
with with their software and the quality
should be a lot better of course we have
a flash here Micro SIM 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and the standard micro
USB the iPhone 5 on the other hand is no
slouch in the design department Apple
went with a truly unique design here
we've got this beautiful aluminum on the
back flanked by pieces of glass
depending on what color you went with
then we've got these beautiful chiseled
edges to kind of give it a shiny jewelry
like that's what some people are saying
I don't think it looks like jewelry it
just kind of looks elegant and we goes
all around the edges on these these
beveled edges are really nice it looks
good on a table we've got a 4 inch
screen here over here it's a 4.7 inch
screen 312 PPI 326 PPI slightly higher
here on the iPhone 5 and we've got a
nice standard 1280 by 720 resolution on
the One X but on the iPhone 5 not a
standard resolution we get 11 36 by 640
so not true HD although playing back HD
content on the on the iPhone 5 actually
looks pretty good beyond that we've got
the 8 megapixel cameras mentioned with a
flash we've got non-standard lightning
which won't work with anything right now
it's the first iOS device to have it you
probably don't have a cable for it and
you're going to have to buy the
converter for 29 bucks and of course
we've got the nice speaker grille along
the bottom
kind of similar in a way to what HTC has
done with these drilled holes kind of a
new trend from smartphone manufacturers
ok so let's talk about display quality
I've got both of these devices set to
50% screen brightness and it's not on
auto brightness so it'll stay at that
50% level obviously here we've got
totally different interfaces iOS 6 with
lots of icons and cents 4.1 with a lot
of widgets so what I want to do now is
go into the web browser and bring up the
same image and see if we can get a
comparison but first I kinda want to
give you a close-up of the screens on
these devices so I'm going to get close
to some text let the camera focus so you
can kind of look at the clarity and the
PPI and the color saturation without
getting a reflection and then we'll go
over here now over here to the HTC One X
they both have just fantastic screens
it's going to be really difficult to
pick a winner something that's very
clear right off the bat is if you want a
bigger screen obviously you're going to
go with the One X 4.7 inches is 0.7
inches bigger than the iPhone 5s 4-inch
screen and it's it's it's significant at
the end of the day ok so let's go to the
internet browser on both and we're going
to just open up a blank page here then
we're going to do a google search go to
Google Images actually and we are going
to search for palm tree there we go
here we are we have the same results and
let's look for something that looks kind
of nice I like this right here we'll
bring both of those up we'll hit
full-size image here full-size image
they're not sure if this is a high-res
image or not good enough to see the
difference in color so the iPhone 5 at
medium brightness is dimmer than the HTC
one exit minimal brightness which means
that the One X has a brighter screen if
you turn it up to 100% it's going to be
brighter because at 50% it's brighter so
that's something to consider you can see
that the whites are the kind of the
whites in the cloud are more apparent in
terms of color profiles they both have
very similar color profiles what I mean
by that is that the blue here is very
similar to the blue here just looks a
little brighter here slightly whiter but
I think that's because of the brightness
the green is nearly the same shade green
this is not like a comparison when we
compare the iPhone 5 with an AMOLED
screen because these are both LCD
displays RGB sub pixel configurations
very similar display types just one is
bigger and apparently one is brighter as
so let's go back to the previous page
and see if we can get another picture of
a palm tree all right let's go to this
guy here full-size image
and once again we're seeing the exact
same thing so on the one X we're seeing
that everything's kind of a little bit
lighter a little bit brighter we're
actually seeing a little bit of gray
here in the water whereas here it's very
much aqua which which again it might be
because of the brightness but it looks
like the the one X is actually
displaying a nicer picture here so
they're very similar displays it looks
like the One X might be slightly better
it's a matter of personal preference and
this is not a scientific test but based
on this it does look like I'd prefer
anyway looking at the One X for 12 hours
a day then looking at the iPhone 5 which
is not to say that the iPhone 5 has a
bad screen the one X just has an
incredible screen by the way if you want
to see our comparison of iOS and
jellybean which will be on the One X in
the near future we'll put a link up at
the video right here so you can check
out that comparison so we hope you enjoy
this comparison video it does look like
that the One X's display is slightly
better than the iPhone 5 we're going to
have more on camera quality in an
upcoming video so keep an eye on that
both of these devices have great
hardware the iPhone is just a little bit
faster thing of the day but when
jellybean hits the 1x that might be a
different story if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now
