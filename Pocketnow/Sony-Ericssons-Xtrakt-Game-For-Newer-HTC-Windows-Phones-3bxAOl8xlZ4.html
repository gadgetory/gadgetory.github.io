Pacquiao calm and if you've ever looked
in your games folder you'll notice how
barren it is most windows mobile devices
only come with solitaire and bubble
breaker but I'm going to show you a new
game by sony ericsson called extract and
this game actually utilizes the ati GPU
image on which is a which is a
compatible on the diamond xperia touch
pro and touch HD and newer windows
mobile devices from HTC so we'll go into
that right now okay so now we'll just
turn on the settings for the game and as
you can see it's very fluid the
transitions between screens are pretty
rapid okay so as you can see after the
game is loaded it it's a 3d game and
we'll just start a new game right here
and you can go into how to play when you
download this on your own so to start
you can select different tracks of
course that one's locked so go to the
first track and this game utilizes
either the keyboard on your windows
mobile device if you have one or the
touch screen and I'm going to use the
touchscreen version right here so it's a
3d game and you have to drive and you
turn by going side to side and you can
shoot the enemies by tapping the screen
so as you can see the processor is very
is very fluid it's smooth it's quick to
react oh darn I hit that thing yeah of
course you'll probably do a lot better
than I am
okay so apparently I'm not very good at
this game so you'll probably do a lot
better than I will and i'll post a link
on pacquiao calm as to how to get this
game thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
