Xperia z1 is a flagship it screams
premium from the instant you lay your
eyes and hands on it it is as snappy as
an Android phone can get today it is
water and dust proof and according to
Sony effects quote the world's leading
camera in a smartphone when you manage
to pack all of that in a glass and
aluminum build at least on paper you got
a perfect recipe for an irresistible
phone how much difference is there
between word on paper and reality we're
checking all of that out right now this
is our full review of the Sony Xperia z1
before we proceed we want to thank our
friends that closed the code at UK for
supplying us with this retail review
unit which landed at our doorstep on
September 20th giving us enough time to
spend more than a week with the phone
exclusively as our daily driver we got
the chance to know all of its pros cons
quirks and hidden aces up its sleeve
we've not only got the pleasure of using
the Xperia z1 but we also compared it to
other Android and Windows Phone devices
flagships and popular phones or not like
the galaxy s4 HTC One and Lumia 925
we've also learned a lot like for
instance that the Xperia z1 is a device
which gets as close as a phone can get
to the premium and exceptional in hand
feel of the HTC One simply put the z1 is
a jewel Sony used a single piece
aluminum frame to build the Xperia z1
and the entire front and back are taken
up by a single sheet each of tempered
glass the phone feels sturdy well-built
and gives you confidence that it would
definitely put up a decent fight against
scratches granted you don't abuse it
with a knife
screwdriver or scalpel the free flaps
for sim micro SD and micro USB port is
the price you have to pay for the water
and dust proof construction but Sony
managed to micro coat the headphone jack
one flap less on the Xperia z1 and since
we mentioned waterproofing its IP
ratings allow submersions of one and a
half meters of fresh water up to 30
minutes the dedicated camera key which
we believe should be standard on any
and every phone enables you to snap
underwater pictures even if the screen
is not usable there are no buttons on
the front which is in its entirety made
out of glass from right to left on the
top of the device you'll find a 2
megapixel front face notification light
Sony branding as well as the usual
proximity and ambient light sensors the
mitho love that there's a 5 inch full HD
screen with Sony's own triluminos
technology as well as x-reality engine
for those who don't want to do the math
this resolution and size results in a
PPI rating of 441 Android buttons are
missing as there are no physical nor
capacitive things to push and touch on
the device's front instead Sony opted
for unscreened buttons for multitasking
home and back but the other single sheet
of glass can be found on the back that's
where you were 20 point 7 megapixel
camera with the G lens lives underneath
which you'll find a single LED flash and
I've seen logo showing the exact contact
point as well as the Sony Xperia
branding should you forget what phone it
is that you're holding or in case you
want or Sony wants to show it off the
bottom holds the speaker grille a
microphone as well as a lanyard hole
while the left side is where you'll find
the microUSB port and the micro SD card
slot both covered with the flats meant
to keep water and dust out of the z1
there's also a magnetic dock connector
should you prefer an accessory with a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack at the top
is thankfully missing a flat which is
not the case for the SIM card slot on
the right further down there's your
power button volume rockers as well as
the dedicated two-stage camera button to
focus and release the shutter it also
just so happens that it finally wakes
the phone up from sleep unlike other
devices equipped with a similar hardware
solution from other manufacturers under
the glass as we mentioned there is a 5
inch full HD display a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor clocking at two
point two gigahertz two gigs of RAM 16
gigs of internal storage expandable via
microSD in 20.7 megapixel main camera on
the back with a two megapixel webcam on
the front three thousand milliamp hour
battery Android 4.2.2 jelly bean on top
of everything other specs include Wi-Fi
Bluetooth NFC as well as a 3G and LTE
capable radio
Android 4.2.2 with Sony's own UI is what
operates on the Xperia z1 thanks to
Google's tweaks to the OS over time as
well as the powerhouse specs under the
hood of the z1 the phone is as snappy as
a flagship Android phone can get in the
second half of 2013 those familiar with
the Xperia Z or other phones from Sony's
lineup will feel at home using the z1
those new to the phone will have no
problem getting used to the custom user
interface Sony decided to keep its
on-screen button usage instead of going
with a physical or beneath the screen
capacitive solution of course Google now
is in but the notification shade has
been changed completely
despite the users ability to modify the
shortcuts and toggles present it is
nowhere near stock home screens and
widgets are fluid as you can always use
one of the built-in device themes to
further customize your device they'll
change wallpaper as well as the accent
color throughout the entire system a
selection of small applications windows
apps running on top of everything can be
used to multitask if that's your cup of
tea then there are the bungled so many
applications like Track ID for audio and
TV PlayStation mobile music and video
unlimited offerings which enrich your
experience and instantly welcome you to
the Sony ecosystem however some of these
might not be available in your region
the album application has a neat way of
displaying more or less image thumbnails
and the camera app allows the user to
make a couple of tweaks interestingly in
the auto mode superior Auto manual
timeshift burst picture effect sweet
panoramas AR effect social live and Mpho
eye are the available options superior
auto will produce eight megapixel images
and the software does a great job at
identifying the scene you are currently
shooting in adjusting the settings
accordingly the manual mode is pork of
course you can select the scenes
yourselves but that's only available in
8 megapixel output mode once you try to
capture stills in the maximum 20
megapixel mode you are limited to only
being able to set exposure and white
balance which kind of kills the manual
mode for us timeshift burst is Sony's
main camera feature or at least that's
what friendly refs emphasize most on at
the introduction in Berlin at Aoife it
allows capturing 61 frames in two
seconds starting before pressing the
shutter button you represented with the
frames and
can select the best after scrolling
through them of course you can also keep
all of them and then there are the other
modes like social live with which you
can broadcast video to your friends on
Facebook a Google Goggles like info I
mode special panorama shooting mode
though you have to be quick at moving
the film rather steadily and then
augmented reality mode to overlay funny
objects on your stills there's also a
picture effect mode that applies special
effects in real time though the
selection is not exhaustive weather is
the sensor or the software which
produces a great amount of noises beyond
us we sure hope Sony can further improve
the camera with future updates because
shooting in conditions other than
perfect immediately generates a lot of
noise that noise is not only present in
20 megapixel shots but also in the 8
megapixel output range as well low-light
sensitivity is good though results will
vary there usually a hit or miss and
when you manage to snap a frame the
output will be lacking detail however it
will not black noise we are more
satisfied with the video capturing
capabilities of the phone than with its
picture taking ones we'll play the
sample for you so that you see exactly
what we're talking about
we everyone this is tony from pocket now
and we are in the same place but it's a
different side of the park we are
checking out the sony xperia z1 and
putting it against the Nokia Lumia 925
we are recording HD video which is full
HD the Xperia z1 just like the bit for a
second there with hope is just on the
screen and not in the final video we're
gonna go against the Sun here keep on
walking by let's see how these to cope
with changing lighting conditions and
let's try to move in for a close-up on
the leaves here on the ground stand
there a bit just to see if they both
manage to cope
there and back again and there's some
movement action and get back to where we
started from thank you very much for
watching see you in the next video we've
used the xperia z1 over the course of 10
days we did not run into major problems
with the phone or its software and using
it exclusively as our daily driver we
didn't manage to bog it down however we
did see some occasional stutters and
lags something which Sony could easily
fix with further software tuning and
optimization after all we are looking at
a very powerful phone specs wise with
our regular usage we got more than a
day's worth of battery life out of the
3000 milliamp hour back which is
powering the phone we're talking about
phone calls text messages social media
Facebook Twitter Google+ taking pictures
browsing the web instant messaging
Google Maps YouTube videos Spotify music
and even workout tracking he will
definitely get at least one day's worth
of action of the z1 given you don't
abuse the camera which you'll probably
well do in the first couple of days of
usage anyways sony proudly claims the z1
has the world's leading camera in a
smart phone our findings are different
we are not saying that it's a bad
shooter we are just saying that you need
to test it out for yourselves and don't
take anyone's word for it this is of
course valid for every manufacturer it
is now time to draw our conclusion we
definitely recommend this phone it is a
very powerful device and Sony's best
phone yet needless to say that the z1 is
part of the elite group of top Android
phones alongside the Samsung Galaxy s4
HTC One LG g2 and the others note baldie
is exceptional waterproofing em-dash
proofing are welcome additions for those
looking for such features and the
overall feeling you get Mali hold or use
the devices that you're operating a
premium product the weakest point in our
opinion is the camera and we hope Sony
can improve it in the future
the display is much improved over the
previous Sony models and offers good
results when viewed straight on however
the viewing angles are still not good
site visibility is poor and color is
washout because of all the
aforementioned we are reading the Xperia
z1 a nine point one out of 10 folks as
always subscribe to pocket now on social
media to be among the first ones to find
out when a video or text piece is
published of course you can also follow
me on the Facebook as well as on Twitter
I'm an ant nd not if you'd like this vid

comment down below with your own
thoughts on the Xperia z1 thank you very
much for watching till next time stay
