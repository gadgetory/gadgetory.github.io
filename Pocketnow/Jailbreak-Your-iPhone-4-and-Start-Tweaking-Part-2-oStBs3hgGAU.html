pocket now calm a couple of months ago
we posted a video about why you would
want to jailbreak your iphone at the
time that the jailbreakme.com website
was released which allows you to
jailbreak in one touch within about a
minute we talked about how jailbreaking
really allows you to customize the
iphone in ways that Apple never intended
which is a good thing because Apple
really want you to live inside their
little box of how a phone experience
should be we talked about how you can do
3g over FaceTime how you could use your
phone to tether to a laptop how you
could change the entire look and feel
and experience of your iPhone and in
this video we're going to do a follow up
talking about some other things that you
can do with your iPhone once you decide
to take the leap and actually jailbreak
it let's get started
now if you want to use jailbreakme com
you'll have to revert back to iOS 4.1 or
4.2 newest 4.1 there are certain ways to
unlock or jailbreak iOS 4.1 but they're
a little bit more complicated if you
want the super simple way jailbreakme
com you're gonna have to wait a little
bit until they catch up and upgrade so
in this round of updates I wanted to
change several different things about my
iphone that we're really bugging me
number one starting off with the lock
screen I never liked the slide to unlock
I want to take that away and make it so
that I can just tap the screen to unluck
really you don't need more than that so
there's actually a winterboard theme
that allows you to take away the slide
so now I just tap anywhere here on the
bottom and I jump right into the
operating system so yeah it saves
probably quarter of a second but it's
nice to have especially if you're
bothered by that idea of always having
to slide to unlock number two I really
never liked how in order to respond to a
text message you have to interrupt what
you're doing go into the SMS application
it's really annoying so there's actually
a utility called T lurt thats about
tlert it's actually about four dollars
in cydia which is the jailbreaking
marketplace but what it does is it
allows you to respond to text messages
as an overlay and you're going to see
that in a second let's say I'm working
in my calendar and I get a text message
what I can actually do is I can read the
text message I can close it or more more
ideally I can respond to the message
right from the screen without having to
leave what I'm doing and then it just
goes away it's a brilliant little
application it's well worth the four
bucks that you pay for it and it keeps
you from being interrupted when you're
doing something and you get a text
message now something else that I
changed here is my whole layout of icons
a few problems with icons on iOS four
number-one folders are great for
organizing icons but they take forever
to load have you ever noticed that even
on the on the iphone 4 there's a second
delay from when you press the folder to
when it expands and that's really
annoying if you're trying to access an
Internet short
real quick or something like that so I
installed a winterboard theme that
allows me to have five icons by four
icons now they wouldn't fit unless I
shrunk them so i used an application
called shrink to make them 95% the
actual size I'll show you that in a
second so now what I have is all of my
internet shortcuts which used to be
inside of a folder lay it out on the
bottom row here and all of my icons are
smaller they don't have labels which is
yet another winterboard theme so that
everything is extremely clean on the
screen and I'm using five icon dock to
give me five icons along the bottom so
that they don't look too jumbled I've
actually used that application that i
mentioned earlier called shrink to make
the badges see where it says eight a
little bit smaller let me show you all
of this in action here so by going to
settings and I go into shrink so what I
have here is a setting for page icon so
I can make them right now they're ninety
percent I can make them really small
sixty-six percent and very small you
really wouldn't want to use this unless
you like seeing tiny things on the
screen or if you are fitting maybe a six
by six grid of icons on your screen so
I'm going to go back to my 95% now you
can also change the dock icons I have
them scale that one hundred percent
because they fit but I had to remove
reduce the size of the badges so before
they are at a hundred percent and you'll
see that they get really cramped when
you do that so fortunately you can
actually turn down the size of the badge
icons to make them smaller and make them
fit a little bit better on the screen
now in terms of this theme that allows
me to take away the icons and also take
away the lock button that's in
winterboard so here we are in
winterboard and I've got two themes
turned on right now no labels iOS four
which is a simple little theme that lets
you take away the labels and also iphone
4 tap which quite simply makes it so
that you can tap to unlock without
having to slide to unlock pretty simple
stuff now of course there are side
effects to jailbreaking and that's
something that anyone will tell you is
jailbroken their phone once you start
adding lots of things you're going to
compromise battery life you're going to
compromise speed I have
noticed really a significant decline in
speed or battery life but there is a bug
with all of these different things I've
got going on if I if I slide to the
right the icons kind of don't show up
sometimes sometimes they blink and I
can't move around icons so if I try to
slide this around it freezes and you
have to restart springboard doesn't
bother me too much because the icons are
arranged in such a way that you know
everything makes sense but this is why
jailbreaking is still not something that
everyone does there are problems you
have to be patient but if you are
patient and you're willing to mess
around a little bit you can really
change the experience of your iphone for
the better so that's it for a look at
the latest changes I've made to my
iphone after jailbreaking it please
leave a comment below if you've got an
awesome must try jailbreaking tweak or
utility please thumbs up this video if
you liked it and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
