the block but it's the first Nokia
device on Verizon Wireless in a very
long time and it is also the first
Windows Phone device or one of the first
Windows Phone devices on Verizon
Wireless in quite a while those things
make it significant so let's do an
unboxing a hardware tour and a first
boot for the Nokia Lumia 822 on Verizon
Wireless I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow comm let's get to it
okay so taking a look at the packaging
here we can see that Verizon and okiya
have collaborated pretty closely on this
bright-red Verizon branding of the
Verizon 4G LTE sticker there some phone
features in the back let's just take a
look at atonia that it's a Nokia Lumia
822 with the lipo battery what's
included in the box and not much else
just a bunch of legalese down there and
then there's a label on the bottom let's
go ahead and take the sleeve right off
discard that that pattern is repeated on
the inside nothing on the back so let's
go ahead and pop this open this is a
true unboxing this time around have not
been inside the box yet we don't even
know what color we're getting yet it's
white DeRay well that sounds like fun
pop the device out of the box real
quickly still cold from from sitting on
the stoop there we'll go ahead and put
that aside for a second see what else is
inside here ah heavy container means
there's things in here we don't want to
miss in this case product safety and
warranty information well maybe we'll
miss that for now here this is a Nokia
AC charger that we've become familiar
with on the Lumia 810 and 920 which we
reviewed the USB cable and big ol
battery literature on the battery
telling us this is an 1800 milliamp hour
unit just popping our sim into place
here we can see that this is the same
SIM tray under micro SD card slot
arrangement as we saw on the Lumia 810
also while we're in here we'll let you
know that the battery door is very very
thick and is surprisingly heavy very
high quality no doubt in our minds that
this is going to survive quite a few
instances of removing it and replacing
it
battery door snaps in securely and we
have sim insertion instructions and
call-outs for the various buttons and
controls on the screen protector which
will go ahead and take off now very nice
and there propped up on its packaging to
keep the glare off the display is our
device the Nokia Lumia 822 custom build
for Verizon Wireless just kind of take a
tour on the hardware here as you can see
this is not the thinnest phone in the
world far from it
this is an 11 point 2 millimeter thick
device you can really feel that
thickness in the hand down in the bottom
is the typical Windows Phone 8 home back
and search Keys the verizon branding on
this rather pronounced chin below the
display call out power button volume up
and down and the dedicated camera button
that is required for Windows Phones up
top three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack what we assumed to be a
noise cancelling microphone up top
nothing on the left hand side we come
around to the back and we see the same
shape lens housing as we see on the 8 10
and the 9 20 calling out the Carl Zeiss
optics and the 8 megapixel autofocus
camera the device is a hundred and
forty-two grams which feels substantial
in the hand but nowhere near as
substantial as the Nokia Lumia 920 which
we'll get into more in a comparison
video this glossy finish is similar to
that on the Lumia 920 but because the
battery cover is removable there's a bit
of a hollow sound when you tap on it
that's a little bit different now that
we have the Simmons heard we'll go ahead
and press the power button for our first
boot with sim card carrier branding on
the very first flash screen we see well
note here that this device is powered by
a Qualcomm s4 dual-core processor
running at 1.5 gigahertz that's backed
up by a gig of ram and storage is 16
gigs onboard but that is expandable as
we just saw inside with a micro SD card
nokia splash screen has come up as you
can see now we've got illumination on
those back home and search keys that
were a little bit difficult to see
before and while we continue to wait for
this food we'll just have a look at the
USB port and left and right speakers
there left right speaker ports at least
and now we get to finish setting up a
few things well thank you for your help
Windows Phone we'll go ahead and do that
and we'll accept those remaining terms
and this should be it boom there's our
home screen the bright red Verizon
Wireless branding dominating everything
we already have our Windows Live account
logged in there's our welcome text
message software seems to be running in
accord with the way it should be so
looks like it's time for us to download
the apps we need and move in to our
Nokia Lumia 822 for the first time
I hope you enjoyed our unboxing hardware
tour and first boot of the Nokia Lumia
822 stay tuned in the days ahead we're
