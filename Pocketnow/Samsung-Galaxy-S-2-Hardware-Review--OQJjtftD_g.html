pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
review for the Samsung Galaxy s2
Samsung's flagship smartphone for 2011
let's get to it
so again this is the European version
that comes to us from cloaca UK they're
shipping the device right now but it
will also work on AT&amp;amp;T in the US it is a
quad-band GSM quad-band UMTS phone so
for those keeping track that is the 850
1909 hundred and twenty one hundred
bands meaning it will work in Europe
it'll work in the u.s. on AT&amp;amp;T as
mentioned it'll also work on t-mobile in
the US but not on 3G it's very likely
that we're gonna see this phone released
on all major carriers so if you don't
want to pay 700 plus dollars for this
right now just wait it's going to
probably be available at a subsidized
price in the near future on a carrier
because the carriers are gonna want this
phone it is pretty badass let's talk
about specs it's got a dual-core 1.2
gigahertz Samsung Exynos processors
they're brand new chip previously in the
Galaxy S line of devices we saw the
hummingbird chip clocking in at 1
gigahertz of course that was a
single-core so they made a huge jump in
terms of cores and clock speed here for
the Samsung Galaxy S 2 of course Samsung
is not alone Qualcomm is doing their 1.2
gigahertz Snapdragon which is going to
show up in the HTC next wave of devices
the sensation the sensation for Jeep the
Sprint Evo 3d and then we've got Nvidia
working with Motorola on the Tegra 2 on
the device on devices like the Atrix 4G
and the upcoming Droid Bionic on Verizon
the Tegra 2 Kotzen at 1 gigahertz
dual-core we can't really compare clock
speeds because as you know in the
desktop world you can get a chip that's
a faster clock speed and it's slower
than a different chip with a lower clock
speed so we really have to look at
day-to-day usage and we're going to do a
lot of benchmarks here on the Galaxy s2
in terms of RAM we get a full gigabyte
of RAM for multitasking that is a
tremendous amount of RAM HTC sort of
maxed out at 768 their next generations
of
the phones are going to have one
gigabyte but we get it right now in the
galaxy s2 just like the Atrix 4G has a
gigabyte of RAM internal storage you get
16 gigabytes - though you can of course
expand that if you get a micro SD card
so we have got bluetooth 3.0 we've got
Wi-Fi II it's hard to miss a B and G of
course this is DivX compatible it's got
two cameras the one on the front shoots
at 2 megapixels which is actually pretty
high for a front-facing camera it's also
a larger lens so it lets in a lot of
light we're gonna see in the four of you
own pocket now that the front-facing
camera takes really good photos on the
back which we're going to see in a
minute we have an 8 megapixel camera
with a flash that can record 1080p video
these next-generation dual-core
processors can take advantage of the
full 1080p resolution and this phone can
even playback 1080p if you connect it to
a panel you need a special accessory to
make that happen but we'll talk more
about that soon this is running on
android 2.3 the latest Gingerbread which
is nice we've got DLNA support so you
can beam your content to TVs and whatnot
wirelessly if you want so let's take a
look at the hardware of the device it's
a very shiny front so you're gonna see a
lot of reflections happen it's kind of
hard to avoid but the front is just this
nice piece of glass and we know it's
glasses we take a little piece of metal
here coin and you can hear that it is
absolutely glass so a really high
quality screen here and we've got a very
interesting design it looks just like
the Galaxy S the original where we had
the button in the center kind of like an
iPhone actually and then we've got two
Android buttons here back and home and
what's kind of cool like the Nexus S
when the when the Galaxy S 2 is off you
don't see any buttons you just see this
Darth vader-like dark display this
massive piece of glass that covers the
front and it looks really really good so
up here we've got the 2 megapixel camera
proximity sensor light sensor earpiece
then we've got the screen which is 4.3
inches diagonal the resolution is 800
down and 480 across now this is the only
downside to these higher end
specifications we don't get the qHD
display that word
the next wave of devices which is of
course 960 down by 540 across so not
that big of a deal we've got the Super
AMOLED plus panel here which we're going
to compare to the previous generation
AMOLED in a second now down here of
course we've got the home button and
it's nice to have a dedicated Hardware
button it actually clicks in when you
press it which is nice to try to bring
it up here so it has a nice clicky sound
to it and it automatically turns on when
you press it and then as I mentioned
these these other Android buttons only
turn on when you actually turn on the
phone so let's go to the side here this
device is incredibly remarkably
amazingly thin and everyone that I've
had hold this device that says the same
thing they look at it from the front and
they're like oh it's just another slab
phone and I said well actually hold it
your hand they hold it in their hand and
they are floored by how thin this is if
you take four quarters if you want to
try this at home to see how thick it is
this is actually thinner than four
quarters it is about eight point five
eight point four millimeters thin it is
the thinnest smartphone on the planet
right now it's thinner than the iPhone
four thinner than the desire hd you name
it this phone is incredibly thin and it
is also very lightweight and yet the
remarkable thing is that it doesn't feel
cheap in hand in hand it has a good
solid feel you might think it might
twist a little bit but if we try to
twist it don't try this at home
it's a very solid phone it doesn't have
aluminum unibody construction like the
HTC phones but it is strong and rigid
nonetheless okay let's go around the
side here we've got a volume up and down
rocker on the left side of the device
we've got the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack dual microphone here for noise
cancellation we'll have to test that to
see how good it is over here we've got
the power standby button kind of a nice
location on the right so that you can
actually you know press it with your
thumb if you're right-handed or
left-handed that's a different story
going back over here we've got the port
for micro USB the first microphone we've
got the speaker back here we don't have
dual speakers but the audio on this
phone in terms of speakerphone and
playing music is actually really good
and even at maximum volume the speaker
doesn't
which is quite a feat so up here we've
got the 8 megapixel camera which will do
1080p video quite impressive we'll have
full video samples coming up soon got a
nice LED flash they're not dual LED I
think they're gonna start scaling back
from dual LED because that's just too
much light for for a smartphone there's
the nice big camera sensor I can try to
take off the back battery cover they
don't make it easy ok here it goes it's
it's plastic totally plastic extremely
thin to keep with the thinness of the
design also very flexible here we have
the SIM card now we've got the sixteen
hundred and fifty milli amp hour battery
that's a big battery for a device that
this is thin that is this thin if you
think about it we've also got the non
hot swappable micro SD port there so you
can add up to a 32 gigabyte card and
have a ton of memory on this thing
getting the battery cover back on isn't
so easy if to press it in what seems to
be ten places but there it's finally on
okay so let's talk Super AMOLED what is
Super AMOLED or we should say Super
AMOLED plus and why does it matter well
if you remember the Galaxy S smartphones
introduced Samsung's proprietary Super
AMOLED screen Samsung is really the only
name in town right now when it comes to
AMOLED they sort of have the monopoly on
these screens and em OLED is incredible
in its level of contrast and power
savings so in an AMOLED screen when
something is black it is truly black the
pixels are turned off unlike a an LCD
screen where where you see black you
might sort of see a greyish grayish
color because it's being illuminated by
a backlight so up here we've got a the
the notification strip up here is black
and if we flick it down you can see a
little bit more black if you flick it
back up
you know it'll go back up there it is
truly black and the contrast is just
amazing now let's take a look at a
galaxy s device that has the Super
AMOLED screen not the Super AMOLED plus
the captivate right so they all have the
same panel let's zoom in and see if we
see any difference between Super AMOLED
plus and Super AMOLED so this is the
same page loaded here and
the contrast looks a little bit better
on the left here on the Galaxy s2 but
really not that big of a difference
seems to have crash the browser there
they are both set to automatic screen
brightness let's just pull down their
notification shades they're using darker
colors in the galaxy s2 because it's
Gingerbread so there's a lot more blacks
than there are sort of the gray color
but you can get a sense that there's not
that much of a difference now that is
not the case if we take out say HTC's
super LCD screen so here is the
thunderbolt need to connect the charger
here now there's a really big difference
again these are both on automatic screen
brightness and it almost looks like the
thunderbolt here has a white coating on
the screen that's because the backlight
is just blasting light onto the entire
panel whereas on the Super AMOLED plus
screen only individual pixels that are
active are getting getting lit or
backlit if you want a technical
explanation of how AMOLED works versus
LCD look it up on Wikipedia but that's
sort of the explanation there and it's
very apparent when you compare these
devices side-by-side Super AMOLED plus
is beautiful it's gorgeous
it doesn't seem to bring that much of a
difference over the previous generation
Super AMOLED they look about the same
and Samsung is getting kind of funny
with the names of these screens is the
next screen going to be Super AMOLED
plus plus 2 or something it's kind of a
long name that they just keep sort of
adding to so beautiful screen beautiful
hardware on the samsung galaxy s2 this
thing is fantastic build quality it's
ridiculously thin and so far it feels
very powerful with the 1.2 gigahertz
dual core Exynos processor the gig of
ram and a lot of other goodies of course
a phone is only as good as the software
that is running on it and in the next
video we're going to talk all about
Samsung's new TouchWiz interface which
does some really cool features has a lot
of interesting gestures built in you're
gonna want to stick around for that so
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and if there's something
specific you want to see about the
galaxy s2 please leave a comment below
and we'll try to cover that thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
