what we're here to find out I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
Lumia icon versus a Lumia 1020 the Lumia
1020 is still one of the most
progressive smartphones in recent memory
the 41 megapixel image sensor defined
the phone and put Nokia's biggest
competitors on their heads to date it's
still capable of taking the most
impressive pictures of any smartphone by
far with the exception of its distant
Symbian cousin the 808 PureView the 1020
was groundbreaking nonetheless and Nokia
is continuing that momentum by bringing
other impressive handsets to more
carriers into the Lumia icon which will
launch on Verizon Wireless later this
week how does it compare with the 1020
does the Lumia icon share the 1020 s
impressive photo taking capabilities or
can we toss the icon into the
ever-growing pile of disappointing CDMA
windows phones let's take a few minutes
to find out shall we
on the outside the Lumia icon is pretty
drastically different from pretty much
all the other Lumia smartphones made in
the last few years on the other hand the
Lumia 1020 is practically identical to
all the others - what my colleague
Michael Fisher calls an Oreo on the
backside most recent Lumia smartphones
have all featured the same rounded edges
unibody polycarbonate build the flat top
and bottom edges they've usually been
bright and colorful and very distinctly
Nokia design the Lumia 900 920 10 2015
20 and most in between - the Lumia 925
have all very closely resembled the
Lumia icon however is very squared and
industrial or the matte finished metal
band wrapping around the edges and a
matte polycarbonate backside and there
are two slightly lighter tone stripes on
either side of the microUSB port on the
bottom and 3.5 millimeter port on the
top edge and unlike more recent models
like the 1020 in 1520 the camera on the
backside of the icon is entirely flush
we imagine all these discrepancies are
thanks to Verizon but for once we're not
complaining though we could do without
the unsightly logo on the top left
corner of the face and the tramp stamp
on the back
sizing the icon up with a 1020 despite
the larger display on the icon the two
are very similar in size at 137
millimeters tall the icon is six point
six millimeters taller than that in 20
but at zero point four millimeters
narrower and zero point six millimeters
thinner and the icon in tints when you
hit the scales at 167 and 158 grams
respectively the biggest set of
differences between these two flagships
from Nokia however are the beefy specs
lists being that the 1020 launched in
late July 2013 its specifications have
slowly started to age just slightly
inside it has 2 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of storage a 2000 milliamp
hour battery and a Snapdragon s4 SOC
composed of a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
Krait CPU and Adreno 225 GPU the camera
of course is rated at 41 megapixels in
the display measures 4.5 diagonal inches
and bears a resolution of 1280 by 768
pixels the Lumia icon also has 2
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of fixed
storage but it's battery is 24 20
milliamp hours and it comes with a much
more powerful Snapdragon 800 chipset
composed of a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
Krait 400 CPU and Adreno 330 GPU the
image sensor is rated at 20 megapixels
and the display is 5 inches diagonally
with 1080p resolution both have NFC
Wi-Fi AC and Bluetooth 4.0 the icon also
has qi wireless charging built-in
whereas the 1020 does not
there are two major differences with the
displays both have great blacks of
course and the colors are super
saturated but the higher density of the
icons 1080p panel is visible to the
naked eye edges of the homescreen tiles
are noticeably smoother than those on
the 1020 and viewing angles the icon
seems to have slightly better side
visibility a more minor note at in
twenties display appears to be slightly
warmer than the icons other than that
the display differences are negligible
in terms of design and hardware alone
the 1020 is definitely more distinct or
the icon is more understated not
everyone will like the stark industrial
design of the icon but we're smitten
with it we still haven't gotten over the
awkward way the 1020 lays on a table
both the Lumia 1020 and Ikon are running
in the same version of Windows Phone
software update 3 with a Nokia Lumia
black update almost everything is
exactly the same feature for feature
except for two first the glance feature
the Lumia icon does not support glance
due to some hardware restrictions and
that's seriously unfortunate as it's one
of our favorite Nokia Windows Home
features to date the other is density or
tiles will fit on the Lumia icons home
screen than the 1020 aside from that the
usual stuff comes prepackaged the Nokia
camera app cinemagraph mix radio screen
gamers storyteller and much more the
important question is how noticeable are
the spec improvements on the icon over
the 1020 as far as opening closing and
switching apps everyday performance it's
going to be virtually identical the
faster clock speed of the icon CPU does
cut the initial launch time of
applications each application opens a
split second faster on the icon but
switching between previously opened
applications happens at exactly the same
speed scrolling web browsing and all
basic interactions will be virtually the
exact same the biggest difference
performance wise would be in gaming
thanks to the beefier GPU and extra CPU
cores it's simply a more powerful
chipset that's visible in various
benchmarks and will be visible in
graphically intense games for instance
the icon was able to complete the
SunSpider test and just over half the
time of the 1024 most the difference
won't matter for some this is just what
the doctor ordered as far as battery
life goes we haven't quite had the icon
long enough to provide detailed analysis
but we can compare them quantitatively
the icon has a 24 20 milliamp hour
battery to the 1020's 2000 milliamp hour
battery but the icon also has roughly
doubled of pixels and more screen real
estate we've seen that the Snapdragon
800 is relatively power efficient but
there's no reason to believe just yet
that the icon stamina will be
significantly better than the 1020 s
testing camera quality was a bit
interesting between these mainly because
we knew the 1020 had a significant
advantage from the start the 41
megapixel sensor has been the subject of
much praise since last summer it's still
the smart phone camera to be despite all
the tough competition the icons camera
does a decent job of taking some of the
best parts of the 1020 s camera and
packing them down into a reasonable size
it's still very respectable and more
and practically all other smartphone
cameras out there the 1020 is capable of
taking much higher res Raw shots up to
38 megapixels the thing is those
differences are never going to matter if
you're only ever going to use the five
megapixel images which are shared from
the phone by default but the advantages
are barely noticeable if at all
whitebalance continues to be an issue
with both models however the 1020 airs
heavily on the warm side and the icon
more so on the cool side making the tint
Winnie's pictures seem more lively
while the icons are more true to life
but still a little bull just know that
both of these phones have powerful image
sensors to sum the 10 20s larger sensor
will pay off but we imagine few will
complain about the icons image sensing
prowess
so which Lumia is the better smartphone
overall from a design standpoint we
fancy the slimmer more bold chassis of
the icon but the 1020's design is adored
despite the Oreo bolted on the back the
internals across the board are better on
the icon but the payoff is miniscule if
you're not a gamer the only major
improvement over the 1020 found on the
icon is the display and it's substantial
the display is more balanced and sharper
it's also larger without drastically
increasing the phone's footprint it's
unfortunate the 1020 doesn't have sheet
charging and it's almost as if setting
that the icon doesn't have glance the
1020 manages to edge out the iconic
image sensing but we feel the icon is an
all around better foam and this makes us
very excited for the 1020 successor
Nokia just keeps getting better and
better at what it does thanks for
