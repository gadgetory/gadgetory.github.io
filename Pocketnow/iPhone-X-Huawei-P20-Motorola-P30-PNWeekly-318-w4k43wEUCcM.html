alright so to anybody that might be
joining in right about now bear with us
for a second we are - our production
booth today as Jules is he's across the
pond as it were so let every gonna have
everybody chill for just a second while
we make sure to blast it out and get a
lot of you audience members in with us
so let's go ahead and do that
Lee brendan is on the case I'm on the
case as they say in paw Patrol wait a
second so you're not gonna do a drum
roll you mean a drum intro yeah drum
intro
do you want to do you guys want me to do
it I actually don't honestly but you do
not want something embarrassing and
entertaining exactly alright so I did so
we're on twitter we're on Facebook and
all right there's that link all right so
we're gonna give it a little we're gonna
give it a little bit longer okay cool
yeah so I can get it alright cool so
it's already on Twitter I am doing the
retweets yep coming up right now
retweeting or so we're so socially savvy
we're basically Millennials right well
we are Neal's I'm not you're not right
but all right and Josh and I are
technically Millennials you guys are
Millennials and I am not complaining I
think that okay so I think in my case
it's just straight up I there's no other
way for me to say that I'm there's no
there's no way I can see I'm not a
millennial when I have a mic like this
on my face and then sync you're fine can
you do some Justin Timberlake or
something
I'll try think of it I'm trying to give
a song okay so while we were getting
ready for the show I was trying to think
of a song that would like be good for
the intro given what topics we have for
today but give me a second I'm gonna go
ahead and retweet this out real quick
come and hang out with us there you go
and
that has been tweeted and I was trying
to think like okay so what if we do it
this way clearly we all want really fast
internet so when it comes to 5g whoa
need that way going to go into a cop
attacked by laughs by the way meet the
microphone and move to one side Oh
perfectly fine with me I am NOT able to
do that I have to be much more careful
because I have this mic right next to my
mouth so so ya might have to mute my
microphone from time to time
in any case 5g is on the topic for this
week as we talk about more phones that
might be coming with the next generation
of mobile internets however there are a
few different competitors in line but
one of them in particular that you might
be expecting may not be on the docket at
least for now we dive into that in our
main topic today but there's plenty to
talk about in our news segment where we
talk about the Motorola P 30 which looks
really familiar but as far as how phones
are made to look we also have a couple
of leaks a little bit later about phones
you might be incredibly excited about
and then finally we also have some talk
about Apple as we explore a couple of
the features that may have that they may
have some problems keeping in iOS 12 or
potentially hopefully coming back in the
next phone but we're not too sure yet it
is the weekly on this day August 17th of
2018 episode 318 I hope I got that one
right in any case we are here with
Brandon minimun and Jaime Rivera I am
Joshua Vergara what's going on everybody
and I want to start off this show real
quick by just it is going to be one of
those this is gonna be one of those
moments where III embellish a little bit
and I get into something that I'm just
incredibly passionate about that has
nothing to do with the show can I just
say I watched crazy rich Asians last
night I fired so it's so good like okay
far be it for me to talk about
representation because it is a hot topic
with any demographic these days and
everybody's stance and cause is
important it's just great to feel like
it's arm it's as an asian-american it's
to feel like a real part of a certain
movement that's happening because
there's a there's a huge implication
behind this movie that just came out and
but one thing I want to point out just
to keep it as relevance at the pocket
not weekly as possible there's
representation across the board women
are represented in a very very lovely
manner Asians of course asian-americans
and yes those are two different
demographics that the movie focuses on
but the tech community is also
represented as well there's a character
in the movie who is working on a
start-up that's more that's that's kind
of a lighter representation however
there's also and I'm not going to give
any spoilers but there is a youtuber who
is in the movie and the reason why I was
so excited about is because okay there's
that moment in Avengers infinity war
every every nerd and every geek
understands this wonderful part of
watching a movie that they really love
and are really anticipating is why
there's a moment in infinity war when
Captain America reveals himself and you
hadn't seen him since civil war you know
all that and you're really anticipating
him coming on to the camera and they
make him come into the camera in a very
awesome white and everyone in the
theater when I watched infinity war
clapped and were just so happy to see
him like it's that kind of fandom as an
Asian American when I saw people like
Ken Jong awkwafina Michelle Yeoh come up
on camera my elation cannot be better
expressed than just oh my god this is so
amazing and it's just great to be able
to see something like that like then and
I'm not even gonna get into the politics
of it or anything like that everyone
else talks about that already it's just
great to be able to watch something like
that and it is important to to to be
able to see yourself and your stories
being shown in cinema because it
normalizes what used to be stereotypes
into things that are really in real life
these are IRL stories that were that
we're getting represented on screen and
you know what like I've never been on
the other side of any of these
representation causes or stances I
understand where this pride comes from
and I'm just really happy to see that
this movie is getting the recognition it
deserves and it's at 96% on brought
Tomatoes well deserved it's a fun movie
yeah I will definitely look into it I
mean I'm part of a mine
already as well so definitely sure if
you're not into rom-coms I don't blame
you for not whining so watch it but what
I will say is it is genuinely funny so
alright so I do want to start my chicken
with a high me real quick because I know
Brendon had a couple of things he wanted
to say so I want to make sure I end with
Brendon okay check in what oh I thought
that the term chicken was pretty implied
but I just want to see how you have been
since we were I guess what David Cogan
which is really fun podcast is probably
with all honesty like dude you've got me
signed up for every single podcast going
forward I I don't think I have ever had
so much fun not just being part of a
show but eventually watching it again I
you know it's it was the conversation
was great the fact that you know
somebody who watches our content was
then part of it and got to provide his
own unique perspective you know from a
user like that the problem is we all
live in a bubble if you think about it
we all have all the phones we want on
the table we can test one phone today
and then move to the other but for the
consumer that's not the way it works you
buy one phone and you're stuck with it
after those 14 days up until you're able
to swap it and from the experiences of
my brother and my sister just hearing
how much it takes them to cancel a
contract to move to a carrier to try a
different phone dude it's like really
nightmarish and so I love the
perspective of a consumer so for me dude
like that was probably the best podcast
ever not just the pocket our best cast
ever and I am I'm having I've been sick
I've been horribly sick since since
Saturday so if you hear me mute the
microphone or go mute for a bit it's
just because I'm coughing that's the
reason I have to keep my voice down but
hey it's it's great to be back alright
awesome and yeah I I gave I made to to
our to our listeners and to our viewers
if you are ever in a little bit of a
little bit of a funk I am the tag I yes
yes I just drink as much green tea as
you possibly can right now it's
if I would have been if I would have not
had this last night I would be miserable
today man you have no idea how much I
thank you for the tips dude no worries
one more thing I don't recommend it for
everybody especially if you have a very
sensitive palate but oil of oregano just
drops of oil of oregano is really good
for you but it is really spicy after all
or EGNOS of spice so do please take with
caution if you are sick it does help all
right
so Brandon had a couple of things that
he wanted to say and I think it's gonna
be a great way of getting into our
device talk for today's podcast so
Brandon take it away okay great so every
most review organizations get review
units like one or two phones usually one
and so on so in the case of the note 9
Jaime has the has the note 9 and Josh
has went to but I don't and I you know
played with one when we were at unpacked
and I went to a t-mobile store two days
ago and played with one but guys I just
can't decide if I want to spend 999
dollars
personally on this phone I need your
help
you guys both have one you've been using
it for like a week should I buy this
phone oh my god so there was a video
that was gonna go live but then when we
swap the plans of the weekly going live
right now it's not gonna go live until
tonight everyone so a shameless plug and
it's literally been my initial
experience I don't know about you Josh I
I have large hands I have I don't enjoy
the size of the note but just because of
everything this phone is able to do I
don't care like I seriously don't care
I'm kind of in the same boat the the
phone is too tall it's just too tolls
I felt that way about the note 8 as well
so this is not a new note 7 was the best
I loved the Brandon that that note 7 fan
Edition video because it's so true for
me that was like the best note ever
sorry oh no no it's fine um but yeah I
do think it is that the phone is too
tall and the handling yes I can look
past it because of what the
phone is capable of 100% I totally agree
with that
I actually think that using the s-pen as
the marketing strategy is what Samsung
should do moving forward but for anybody
who actually cares about the performance
of their phones the S pen's not the
story the story is the cooling and it's
more tact it's hard to talk about that
because it's not really easy to get the
layman or the common user to really
understand why that's so important I've
had literally no slowdowns on this phone
III do a lot with this I've been gaming
I've been multitasking I use Samsung
notes I've been riding with the s-pen
and I've had no problems whatsoever with
the performance and I think that is
probably going to stay that way unless I
like overload the phone with data and
the storage and whatnot because that
happens sometimes but I really think the
cooling is doing its job like the phone
gets warm yeah it doesn't slow down it
ok interesting so I've had that same
experience actually the phone is only
heated up once but I have another story
this is actually another video that's
coming next week shameless plug went to
run some tests with David Cogan we went
to test data speeds on this thing
compared to devices like the 1 plus 6
compared to devices like the iPhone 10
oh my god so I'm just gonna give you an
idea the iPhone 10 intern areas of
Midtown with no traffic like there was
nobody there I was getting around 40 to
50 down on the iPhone 10 on what area on
t-mobile ok I was getting 60 down on the
oneplus 6 because it's got the Qualcomm
Snapdragon a tat 45 so it's obviously
got better antennas it's got 4 by 4 my
mo and everything
guess how much the one the the Galaxy
Note 9 was doing well I saw your
Instagram so I saw my Instagram story 1
109 D down how's that possible
I was possible let's kick a bit LTE so
that's the thing the snapdragon 845 ever
since the eight thirty five gigabit LTE
has been available on devices that have
the you know you know the latest
flagship chips
but the 8:45 is like I would say like a
category higher and then it's got four
by four my mo and then carrier
aggregation and so many things and I was
expecting the one plus six to perform
the same and it didn't the Galaxy Note
nine literally smoked but I mean smoked
every phone that was there and I've had
cases like for example if I want to if I
want to grab the train for example have
to cross the street I have I crossed the
street and the only phone that's still
connected to my Wi-Fi is the note nine
okay so when you when you're on these
cellular data tests was the speed did it
kind of spike to one ninety and go down
it started it it started at you know
slowly gradually going up and then BOOM
190 and staying there wow that's awesome
and and so we is so coded you so you
know David Koch ins the unlocker he's
like dude I have to test this and so we
ran in some some of the codes where you
check what antennas the phone is on we
that we then downloaded files and made
the comparison by downloading files it
wasn't just the speedtest.net thing but
ever since that whole okhla thing came
out where that you know you know that
i've always made this topic about how I
hate until modems a lot on iPhones
mainly because battery life is terrible
but I didn't know that there was such a
difference when it came to data speeds
and to be fully honest with you because
I always juggle between an iPhone and
and you know an Android phone I always
use both like I have noticed so many
cases where the iPhone does terribly in
network performance particularly here in
New York and where I have no issues so
ever since I've been using the one plus
six I have had zero issues with
connectivity but now with the note 9
it's even it's like twice better man hmm
well I think that your problem with the
iPhone 10 is that you're holding it
wrong and so for me it's like you know
that they came up with the whole okhla
study and so I obviously checked what
modem I have on my iPhone I noticed that
I do have the you know the bad the Intel
modem one and you know so I got myself
another T well you send me the t-mobile
simba Brandon you send me the other
t-mobile send that I need
it doesn't work so I have to t-mobile
Sims right or both they both have the
same data capabilities according to
their plans
we ran the tests David had other
t-mobile Sims as well we also ran the
tests with AT&amp;amp;T actually we got better
data speeds on t-mobile in certain areas
then this is not me recommending
t-mobile by the way because I'm here in
Queens and t-mobile is not the best year
so but in the certain sectors of Midtown
that we were at like t-mobile was
killing it man it sounds like to me
obviously the modem has a lot to do with
it but I feel like t-mobile as as an
underdog has invested a lot in major
cities yes
to give you like incredible data speeds
I wonder what the note 9 would do on
AT&amp;amp;T in the same location any idea yes
yes so we week so we try it out with the
note 9 on AT&amp;amp;T but so the data speeds
were like 60 down which wasn't bad it
was still better than the iPhone but not
like t-mobile yeah
I'm still better than the iPhone and so
you know it's one of those things where
it's like ok so you're paying so going
back to your topic of why choose this
phone so the question is what are you
paying a thousand dollars for here
you're paying for a notch design that
pretty much every phone has now you're
paying for a good camera that's not the
best in what we have today what else is
here for $1000 I think that the only
selling point for me when it comes to
the iPhone 10 is the size is the fact
that I have a flagship with a with a
large size display I guess we could say
in a small form-factor so it's very
comfortable to use I like the iPhone 10
for that let's not forget those add
emojis though let me just say oh come on
we're sorry the cookies I apologize
sorry well you also forgot the fruit
icon on the back that adds that adds
like 500 bucks so yes yeah the deeply
designed in California right what are
you paying for here so it starts at
double the storage to start you have
expandable storage capabilities yes fix
me I'm not talking to you you know
that's a real problem by the way I've
been hitting that button too much oh
yeah so you have the s-pen which
I wouldn't care about the s-pen before
but now it's become like the coolest
thing because of the Bluetooth
functionality um you've got the best
display on a smartphone hands-down no
room for comparison I even have the Oppo
find X here by the way you tilt it to
the side and then it becomes like a
little purpley uh like honestly the best
display in the market right now is the
Galaxy Note 9 and so you've got the best
of this the best of that the best data
speeds the battery life has been great
so it's not that I I say it warrants
$1000 I feel no phone is worth that
amount of money I mean full amount of
the more powerful product but if I had
to shell 1000 bucks between the iPhone
10 in the galaxy note 9 I would go for
the galaxy note 9 it's so funny as you
play with it in the camera there it
looks like you are honing a cafeteria
tray it's just so I have to agree but
you know to help you make up your mind
we haven't published our review by the
way listeners and viewers because I know
there are some reviews out there but the
thing is this is not final software we
were warranted that by Samsung the
moment they gave us the unit so we don't
make reviews out of prototype software
we wait for the final thing and then we
tell you and I have been having issues
with the camera hanging but it's
happened mostly on third-party apps like
Instagram stories so I can't say it's a
phone problem but I also feel that it
deserves final software we before we
make the review so let's just sum cut to
the chase here should I buy this phone
next week will you use the s-pen
sometimes yeah okay then do it because
if not there's the galaxy s 9 Plus which
is almost the same phone yeah it's
largely the same phone it's missing that
cooling which is what my point was but I
don't think that you're going to
actually load the phone so much that you
would require it you know there's
probably there's probably the level of
people who are going to require the
cooling might not be too common so it's
okay to give that a pass and I guess the
the question that any that I'll ask
anybody who asks me if they should get
the note 9 is what are you using right
now and that's going to
that's a good question yes yeah what are
you using right now because that will
determine if the note 9 is actually
going to be the worthy upgrade that
warrants that money if you're using any
of the last two generations of either
samsung line I'm gonna go with probably
not you probably don't need the note 9
it will be great if you can afford it go
for it that's already spent so much
money on the last two and I would
probably say the same thing with the
iPhone 10 because you spend all that
money on the iPhone 10 do you want to
spend that again for a new phone I don't
know maybe the iPhone cents already good
enough for you it's not going to be
enough to convert somebody conversion
rates from one to the other are going to
be tough in the these next couple of
years because the prices are so high
yeah let me play let me play along with
your thought exercise you just asked me
where what are you upgrading from and
the answer is a one plus six so what is
your answer to that I would stay with
the one plus six really yes you clearly
it from someone for someone who has
bought a phone and you chose the one
plus six you clearly value value you're
not just wanting everything you clearly
value value this is not going to be the
value you were looking for so the thing
is is this phone $500 more worth in
features mm-hmm that's when it gets
tough you already made it the thing is
by by choosing the one plus six as
someone who put the money down you've
already answered that question for
yourself that's the thing so if you are
already at the one plus six you've
already made it clear to yourself that
the S Pen is not really too important to
you the cooling is not too important to
you the four thousand milliamp hour
battery is not too important to you
because the one plus six is already
providing the experience you require and
here's the thing here's the thing like
the one plus six is great for gaming the
one plus six has more RAM it's got dual
sim capabilities and the one plus six
dude the battery life is epic AF so it
depends on what you value like in my
case battery life for me is probably one
of the most important things in a phone
I hate having to carry battery packs so
for me uh you know it's just I don't
think there are $500 more phone here
that's the thing well well let me just
clarify something I didn't get the
oneplus six because of the value I think
that's a great added benefit I would
love to pay less for something at pasta
I got the one plus six because I love
oxygen OS I think it's a true
improvement over Android I like how it
looks I think it's beautiful and I got
the self white like Josh I mean I hate
that self wait I know you don't you can
love the red I'll is just the real cool
it can't fault that yeah it is so cool
but here's the thing so yes you you've
Alice so if you value oxygen OS do you
know what it's like to move into the
Samsung user interface that's not
necessarily the best experience that is
the problem so if so here's the thing
gaming is already great on the 1 plus 6
again it's just if for $500 more you can
buy yourself a regular sized iPad and
Apple pencil and the 1 plus 6 and you
still have $100 to spare Wow true oh
yeah alright guys so um we did talk
about the no 9 for a little while now so
for our for our first segment on this
show I'm gonna go ahead and jump right
into it it'll be a little bit of a
lightning round because all of these all
of these topics I'm really excited to
talk about because I think they all are
pretty awesome in terms of just like
what we can talk about with them now I
don't know how much we want to talk
about this
there's no segue to it I will say hi me
talked about the iPhone 10 and speaking
of the iPhone 10 or at least its design
motorola had one of the phones leaked
recently and okay so it is the Motorola
P 30 and it looks really no year and I
guess my number first let me get into a
couple of the details the p30 packs a
6.2 inch display with full HD resolution
and a 19 by 9 aspect ratio it also comes
with the Snapdragon 636 so you're not
looking at the highest and
specifications clearly the phone has
been officially introduced in China so
it's kind of we're not too sure where
this is going to land in terms of
markets outside of Asia outside of where
we saw I get leaked as six gigabytes of
RAM 64 and 128 gigabyte storage versions
with micro SD card expansion and then
there are two cameras on the back one is
16 and one is 5 while the front-facing
camera is a 12 megapixel unit it does
come with a headphone jack that's one
thing I did I didn't want to highlight
because the Moto Z 3 which I am
currently
in the middle of reviewing does not have
that so a mid Ranger gets the headphone
jack
but aside from that the last thing to
talk about is the 3000 milliamp hour
batteries so talk about those cameras on
the back they are in a particular
position that is all too familiar for us
and now but then you turn the phone
around and the notch at the top also
looks completely familiar how do we feel
about this phone it doesn't matter to
you that phones like this come out
that's so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
outright say that it's a blatant copy of
anything but you know when you feel so
when you feel that the device feels so
familiar and the way that it looks what
kind of feelings does that bring up in
you Brandon go first I don't know I
don't I don't mind
I think the iPhone 10 has a pretty nice
design and as is the case with every
iPhone to ever exist the six to twelve
months after the iPhone comes out the
industry makes a shift to have certain
looks that that resemble the iPhone
because for a lot of people and in a lot
of countries the iPhone is still a gold
standard
maybe less so over time but in a lot of
countries that is the case so when I see
an Android phone that looks like an
iPhone I don't really mind I think it
looks kind of cool it's kind of like I
mean there's only so many ways to orient
cameras you can go to cameras you can go
horizontal or vertical that's it you
can't put them diagonally you can't put
them one over here and one over here or
whatever here one over here it's just
there or there so there's only so many
permutations of stacking the camera and
the knotch
you know you guys know that I don't
really mind the knotch I think it's a
cool way to maximize screen to body
ratio so I think it looks like a cool
phone and Motorola software usually is
pretty lightweight and the Snapdragon
636 it's gonna be fine it's gonna get
the job done oh man I I just you know
for me from a former Motorola user of
many years it's just I think it's I
can't say that it's Lenovo I don't know
who is doing this I just it pisses me
off that the company that came up with
his irons like the razor they came up
with designs like the Moto X they came
up with so many innovative concepts
that I feel it was either bad marketing
or what I don't care what went wrong I
just know that the Motorola that pretty
much got me into the cellphone industry
many years ago who didn't want a Vader
or a Vulcan or a star tack or stuff like
that
so this is what you're making of the
most iconic this cell phone designs that
I've ever seen because for me they are
this is what you're making of it you're
making a ripoff of another company like
seriously that's why there's so many
implications behind it and just in case
anybody who's watching the live right
now or watching the video didn't notice
I brought out the Moto X I want to say
this is the 2014 edition the hump on the
Oppo find X is literally the same as
that yeah yeah exactly
oh yeah that's true huh right up here
yeah this was when this was this was at
a time when Motorola really liked okay I
get that the Moto mods are supposed to
be a way of customizing the devices and
whatnot but when it's when it's an
intrinsic part of the phone and not just
something you kind of plaster on it
gives the phone more of an identity and
yeah it's that level of design that
people really crave for because it gives
it gives not only the line but also the
user a certain identity I even have my
life's motto down here the next moment
engraved on the bottom of this phone and
you know bamboo I was all about bamboo
phones back then including the one
placement yeah this is a great phone
yeah and I just get really Malik air too
much that the phone resembles something
so much because there are a couple
there's one there's one remark in the
top chat right now over at the YouTube
channel Renato Laporte's says maybe this
is just what Asia wants they want a
mid-range iPhone 10 running Android so
if the design of the iPhone 10 is
desirable but of course there's no
Android on it then okay I kind of get
where some people might be coming from
that there's a demand for a phone that
has the look of the iPhone 10 and then
it's running Android so that's really
just that that's what I think is
happening here and the implications of
the markets being in Asia and what they
want
those are all things that we can
speculate upon but ultimately Motorola
just in general I just I don't know I
don't know where they have I don't know
what has happened I don't know where
they've gone the Moto X was a great line
that ended up getting relegated into the
Moto Z the Moto Z's not that bad it's
never been bad it just isn't as exciting
as the Moto X used to be so to see the
p30 come out it's like I don't know
maybe this is the culmination of these
feelings I've had for the last couple of
years
Jaime just dropped off but I remember
him telling me something very
interesting this was like five years ago
it had to do with the perception of
somebody that could afford an iPhone
kind of like I don't know if you like
cars Josh but like when I'm walking down
the street and I see a Lamborghini I
think wow that guy's rich or that guy's
hot whatever like that's a cool art and
I think the iPhone in many countries had
that amount of cachet yeah 100% and so
like and that still exists even though
you know there are so many other great
phone choices and Android phones that
are as premium if not better than the
iPhone in certain respects but
especially like in China and countries
that are more third-world having an
iPhone or even something that looks like
an iPhone it isn't an iPhone is
something that people respect
yeah and it's clearly something that
they respond to so that's the reason why
we see it a lot more so I also find it
funny that they also have the color
gradient from the p20 so it's like
clearly they're trying to think of all
of these things that people really
enjoyed of past phones and now Moto's
like we'll do our own version of it so
I'm not I'm not necessarily mad that the
phone looks like the iPhone 10 or even
has the p20 color gradient but it's just
like you know it's it's it's I can see
both sides
speaking of premium phones and what what
a premium phone can be to a user
we had another leak come out and it's
fur phone that I think everyone's really
excited for we have now the Google pixel
3xl getting spotted in the wild so we
not we're not too sure exactly what date
it's going to happen there's some
speculation that's going to be like
October 4 or something like that but
when
is very clear and it's that because of
changes in androids architecture the
notch is going to be something that
Android addresses in the future and
we're expecting it on the new Google
pixel now the the image that we have in
the particular article shows that it was
it was a phone that was spotted in a
street cart in Toronto which i think is
pretty funny it's a large phone that is
not recognizable compared to phones we
have right now which is why this leak is
is interesting but what people are
saying is again there's a huge notch at
the top now I don't know where the
conversation can go with that we haven't
gone already like people are always
saying either they don't like the notch
or they don't mind it like you Brandon
do you think that the pixel having the
knotch
is going to be it's gonna be polarizing
for sure but obviously the pixel is
going to be the flagship moving all
Android phones forward is the notch
going to be I don't know do you want it
to be smaller should it be bigger should
be you know it is this too much for you
there's there's got to be a reason for
it like at like the inclusion of
additional sensors because you know if
you're just putting a camera up there
you don't need to have such a large
notch if you add an earpiece you need to
make it bigger if you add an LED
notification you need to make a bigger
if you're doing IR scanner or a flood
illuminator it needs to be bigger yet so
I think maybe the pixel 3xl and the
pixel 3 will have some surprise sensors
up there
my guess is something to replicate what
face ID does on the iPhone 10 that's the
only explanation because you don't need
to have a like a one inch by like a one
inch by like half inch knotch unless
there's some additional sensors with
that damn inch down that's a huge not
the Holy Mary Mother of notches as Tony
posted on on the news like literally had
to make that joke on the daily I just
couldn't avoid it we're talking about
the sorry guys
it seems data speeds don't like me but
yeah oh my god those pixel rumors are
still talking about the Moto more time I
don't mean that that one photo
came out on a streetcar in Toronto of
all things yeah I am hoping that this is
a joke honestly like there are a lot of
separate rumors that are claiming that
that this phone is just the dud than
Motorola threw out there it wouldn't be
in sorry that Motorola that Google threw
out there it wouldn't be the first time
I remember there were so many rumors of
the iPhone 5 if you remember so many
rumors of the iPhone 5 being this like
teardrop iPhone 6 style design and when
we least expect the iPhone 5 was a
completely different phone than what we
saw in the rumors so you know I wouldn't
blame Google by using duds or fake
devices to test internals and have the
chassis actually be different I do hope
that it what Brandon is saying is the
case I would love if this was a dud
because now like I understand that the
pixel 3x I was gonna be coming out I
want to hold the dud phone out but I I
think what Brandon is saying is is where
I'm going to land on this there better
piece there better be a reason there
better be a reason and I one thing I
really disliked in the short amount of
time that I used the iPhone 10 was that
you had to swipe down on either side of
the notch to get a couple of different
functions
don't don't like this at all if I'm
using it in one hand and I gotta go to
the other side like that's just you know
it's is the buttons like so if you okay
so you probably won't remember this Josh
for Brandon does like you remember
whenever you needed to to reset like to
put the iPhone in DFU mode in previous
times or you would have to make a play
with the home button and the power
button and the volume exactly okay so it
turns out that the button combinations
now the other time the phone just
completely hung I went to an Apple store
and it turns out that the fun
combinations are now completely
different they're a matter of how much
time you hold one button and then how
much time you hold the other and so it's
one of those things where the Siri
button is now the power button and then
if you want to turn off the phone you
have to hold two buttons down and for me
that's just so ridiculous for the sake
of not adding an extra button that thus
things like it's but it it literally
takes me five minutes to turn off the
iPhone 10 because I have to remember the
button combination to skip this slide to
shut off
it is the stupidest thing like for me
for me there are certain design
decisions that are definitely stupid
that slide from one side or the next it
won't be new I mean I think Android uh
what was it after Ice Cream Sandwich
Android jelly bean I think yes had this
where one side was like the the quick
toggles and then the other was
notifications for me that was stupid as
well so I don't know man
I I feel that we've still got better
serve a purpose like we heard rumors of
three cameras that so I asked in the
comments like what do you so I saw some
like crazy funny comments over the
question of the day and one of them was
like oh my god that thing will be like a
soul unlock or like this doesn't just
don't lock your face it unlocks your
soul I'm like damn it alright whatever
it's gonna look like it's gonna look
like Brainiac from Superman's triangle
there it appears all the way into your
soul and unlocks based on your
personality that's that is that is that
well in let's see I mean and probably
like the the most interesting part is
that the rumor still claims just one
camera at the back so you were able to
prove it with the pixel too and you know
III think that if they were to stick
with the one and and and keep their
computational / algorithmic processing I
think that'd be great as long as they
improve upon it I just imagine I want to
imagine what it would be like to have
the power of Google's algorithmic
processing with an extra lens like that
kind of that excites me to be honest it
doesn't need to be three it didn't even
need to be two but it's two plus
Google's power I'm an I'm I I just I
just made myself excited over the phone
alright so a couple of hot takes real
quick for our next topic
okay so uncarrier 15 with t-mobile it's
funny how we go back and forth when it
comes to like our advancements in
technology and also how things just work
in the real world
apparently uncarrier 15 I don't know if
they're running out of ideas it's not a
bad thing but you can have teams of
people helping you out in the t-mobile
store rather than the automated system
that you usually have through the phone
you're actually going to have something
somewhat of like a Genius Bar that T
Mobile is going to give you so you have
human interaction and you actually get a
little bit of that human touch when it
comes
to the problems that you have with your
service we don't have to stay on this
one too long
do you prefer automated systems have you
have you do you think this is I did are
you happy to hear that human touch is
back into our automated and back into
our customer service with t-mobile I've
even had to call t-mobile at all reason
we uh we lost brand oh boy let's just
hope you don't lose me but here's the
thing I don't know it's I hate talking I
hate dealing with machines just because
they ask so many questions like a human
most of the time understands what I need
with just one phrase or one question so
I am just completely against automation
honestly like I hate going to counters I
hate you on campus for example when I'm
travelling and have a machine be me
having to deal with a machine like I
don't want to deal with that
I don't want to be offered more miles I
don't want to be uh I don't care and
that's the problem with machines that
it's like if these companies use these
machines to also sell you things and I
don't care about these things I just I
walked them for something specific I
want to leave with what I need and
that's it okay fair enough
so Brandon do you prefer talking to a
human I feel like it's an easy question
to answer right like um I prefer talking
to whatever is the most efficient and
whatever saves me time and last I
checked human beings have certain
weaknesses and so I you know I'm cool
with the machines Brandon is just he
basically said he would prefer to stay
in the matrix he just said that right
now alright so we're gonna call an agent
going forward yeah pretty much okay so
it's a little bit like a Genius Bar
especially over the phone obviously when
you go to a t-mobile place there's no
automation there it's not like going to
McDonald's and you have to order on the
machine which by the way is becoming a
thing apparently so who knows maybe this
will be implemented in more places like
t-mobile in the future but for now this
is just talking to humans on the phone
rather than an automated system so that
whole Genius Bar reference well
there are a couple of things that Apple
is doing right now where a lot of users
might be asking of their Genius Bar what
is going on iOS 12 it introduced a
feature in FaceTime where you can have
groups of people in FaceTime I still
personally think this is incredulous how
you can have up to 32 people in any one
FaceTime call but it's limited to four
at the moment however what they did was
they took the feature out of iOS 12 only
to have it come out a little bit later
on it's not a canceled feature it's
still going to come it's just gonna take
a little bit longer for them to work out
the kinks
do you use FaceTime guys all rhyme with
the kids and that's about it
okay yeah I use for family things but
you know what's weird if you look around
you and it kind of reminds me of the
next salad days people use FaceTime as
if it were just a phone call they're
walking down the street facetiming
they're like in there in like they're in
Walmart facetiming like so everyone can
see it's just like it's like this
cultural thing where everyone's using
FaceTime instead of phone calls and it's
very very public yeah the other did
Nicki Minaj was in Bryant Park and
everybody was face trying to show that
they were there with just watching her
that's why I don't think that was a that
wasn't a reason to go crazy but I guess
some people like her music she's pretty
popular I understand we tend to
gravitate to hangouts on air and also
you did just YouTube in general when it
comes to our video versions of the
podcast do you think we could ever do
like a FaceTime version of the body and
be cute to low resolution and probably
not reliable enough maybe maybe maybe so
Kay okay so you guys were talking a
little bit earlier about how the iPhone
10 is missing like buttons in particular
well this is this is one of the gripes
that I had with the iPhone 10 as well
when I was using it I miss my touch ID
and it has not been the case with the
iPhone 10 like you want to have that's
the other thing about we talked about
the no 9 earlier it has every measure of
biometric that you can ask for at least
for now so you can use any one of them
you can
come if you wanted to and you can use
any one of them at any given point I
tend to use the fingerprint reader as
much as possible but if the phone is on
the wireless charger pointing up at me I
hit the power button it recognizes my
face I'm good to go I love that however
with the iPhone 10 it's only the face ID
and this is a real thing I people can
make fun of me all they want but I used
to get really annoyed with the iPhone 10
when I would be brushing my teeth and I
want to look at my phone and because I'm
brushing my teeth and it occludes my
face I can't get into my phone and I
really hated that there's so many
scenarios where face ID doesn't work
exactly so touch ID would have been
great and apparently touch ID might be
coming back thanks to yet another little
leak that we're looking at here and
whatever version touch ID might come
back as is still kind of up in the air
but number one the question is wouldn't
you be happy to have touch ID returned
we ask you this what specific scenarios
is it that you wanted touch ID to work
because if you think of it it's mostly
whenever you need to pay attention to
something else like brushing your teeth
or driving or driving those are the
cases furtive hid becomes annoying and
this is not me trying to defend face ID
I prefer touch ID a million times over
window unlock my phone face but then
again if you're in New York City in a
cold AF and you're wearing gloves you
appreciate a way to unlock your phone
without having to take your gloves off
that's true the scenarios are definitely
different based upon like where you are
like how you use your phone and what
scenarios you find yourself in I don't
know like you know me I'm the BlackBerry
guy I want tactile feedback you know I
don't want to just stare at my phone and
hope it does something I don't want to
do that one of the one of the worst the
worst scenarios is for me it's very
common its phone on table cannot unlock
iphone 10 unless you're like you
position your head over it like it's
just like the funniest acrobatics ever
you look down at it and then like you
know you're a cure your second chin kind
of pops out so then it's like anyway
that's not you apparently on this one
the fingerprint sensor might be embedded
in the screen so maybe that particular
situation is going to be mitigated by
what
the apples going to innovate on if touch
ID does return so I'm not gonna lie I
guess what I like the most about face ID
is actually not beside D per se but how
Apple uses it where your notifications
are not visible or readable unless you
unlock unless the phones tease you until
the phone to text that is you and then
your notifications be readable and then
you decide if you want to unlock the
phone or not that for me is the most
genius thing that I wish every phone did
sometimes you just want to look at your
lock screen you don't wanna you don't
want to dive into the phone and then
look for the notification you just want
to read it from the notification but if
you've got like a psycho girlfriend or
psycho you know whatever it is you don't
want your notifications on your lock
screen and therefore it just adds an
extra hurl we're on on face ID don't
have to deal with any of that you just
it's not until it's easy that it shows
you what you want to see I need you know
what I did kind of like that that was
the touch I I will admit that that was
kind of cool where I looked at it and
then it gave and then once I recognized
it was me it gave me the info I wanted I
did I did kind of like that I'm not I
kind of with you there and it's cool I
wish that Android had that that's part
of a video that I'm I'm part of one of
the videos that I'm working on by the
way it's just that like I wish that
Android had that is for me it's like one
of the coolest things in iOS mmm fair
okay so for our final one in this new
segment then we'll take a quick break to
pay some bills the we're gonna go ahead
and talk about apparently Xiaomi by the
way Xiaomi SH ok so not Jimmy not see
how me Shou me I got a I got a I got a
lecture from one of my good friends chai
Lazaro over at gadget man she's a great
friend
she gave me she's like the forum she's
like an expert on how to pronounce it so
Xiaomi so shout out to you tribe
apparently they're pulling like an honor
right now with a new brand called poco
so what we have here is a leak of a
phone called the poco phone f1 and over
in India where it is apparently going to
be launched on August 22nd someone has
already unboxed it and you know what I
have to say there's a I'm excited to see
what Xiaomi can do
a brand that potentially will have the
because there's one thing that we know
about Xiaomi it's that they've been able
to make premium phones for prices that
are actually pretty accessible it's kind
of a mark of their Chinese of their
Chinese brands this one's going into
India they already have a strong
foothold in parts of in other parts of
Asia including India and I think they
have a little bit of a foothold in in
Europe right now after after all they
did move into that market within the
last year quick thoughts on what could
possibly be called the poco f1 they call
it the master of speed because
apparently it comes with the snapdragon
845 and let's see here what else did
they say
dual rear cameras the design at least in
my estimation looks a little bit it's
more utilitarian than anything else it's
not the it's not the prettiest looking
phone and the price according fraud to
GSM marina I think is what they said was
it was gonna be about the equivalent of
$500 so yet another phone that might
undercut these super expensive flagships
we have right now so how do we feel
about this I don't know I I like the
strategy of I love the strategy of show
me like how they make money through
services and not through phones like I
find that to be fascinating
I love devices like the B mix 2s it's
not my favorite phone but it's just so
cheap and so well made yeah you know
it's just shocking um I love that I love
the examples like that I guess the only
thing that I didn't like about the
rumors is where they come up with the
name like poco phone cuz poco in Spanish
means al-islam like it means you're
getting your MIDI you're getting very
little ah and so I think that they
should have thought out the name better
if that's a true thing but we'll see I
mean I don't care that thing is called
literal literal lease if it costs 300
bucks 400 bucks I don't know we'll see
yeah
the the suggested price of 500 was a
conversion from leh which I believe is I
don't know which currency that is but
that's that that is what's projected
Romanian currency oh there you go so
1999 leh so that's about $500 apparently
- according to your guys's article but
yeah I mean it's it's fine I would love
to say one
there are offshoot brands typically
there's a little bit more value for
value for what you'd get there but
obviously there's gonna be a little bit
of a concession and the first thing I
want to know about this phone is how
that camera works because it's usually
the Achilles heel to any of these off
brands that try to bring value but
anyway Brandon you were you had a couple
things so something interesting about
show me that I don't think many people
realize is that they make so many
products they make a rice cooker that
connects to your phone they make an air
purifier that connects your phone they
make a hoverboard a TV like there's just
like a universal electronics company
that is that makes products for people
in China that needs to make clothing
that doesn't connect to your phone but
I'm sure it will sued yeah I didn't know
that they made clothing that's
unbelievable dude like their Xiaomi
stores and Shanghai are are it's it's
funny because their Xiaomi stores are
like going to an Apple store here in in
the United States it's like it's a thing
it's packed all the time doesn't matter
where you are and they sell a ton of
stuff seriously like their clothing they
sell shoes dude wow that's amazing a lot
of stuff yeah yeah it's crazy
and it's and it's a it's a fairly good
brand but you know before we get too far
into it there's one thing I wanted to
point out you're right Boco means small
shou means small so yeah so I just
remembered that right now that Xiao it
means small I forget what me is but I
think it's small something there's a
certain there's a certain phrase that
together those two words make and I
forget what that is but Xiao take it on
its own it means small and from the
record I'm Filipino it's not that I it's
not that I know Chinese or anything but
I happen to remember that fact all right
so uh we're gonna go ahead take a really
quick break and we'll be right back to
talk about some 5g miss that's even a
word
all right one quick second doo doo doo
look at that I'm missing oh there it is
all right here we go this episode of the
weekly is brought to you by jamp now
helping you track your Apple devices
it's hard enough remembering to keep
your iPhone or iPad in sight sometimes

account so check out Jam comm slash
pocket now do you remember when can I
create a little side chat about
something yeah give me give it give it
like two seconds and go okay do you
remember when the iPhone came out and
people were you know taking photos and
flipping through galleries and browsing
websites and listening to music and tea
the commercial side of it people said
you can't use an iPhone in the
enterprise there's no security you got
to use a blackberry or a windows mobile
phone and you know over time they added
like Microsoft Exchange support they
added the ability to remote wipe and all
this stuff and now it's like not even a
conversation there's plenty of people
that use an iPhone for personal and
business yeah I do remember that
and that's one of the reasons why I
really you know I remember when I was
using the BlackBerry back in the day
especially the bald in particular it
never really occurred to me that that
stuff would be important and it's funny
how much that's become a thing like
obviously ever since that earlier era of
smartphone technology we've come to a
place where security is so much more
important than ever and back then it was
just one of those things I took for
granted it's just part of the device and
I think there's there's value in that
there's value in having a phone that is
already encrypted and is already very
secure and yeah it's just funny how like
back then I was just using it because I
was using it and I I almost kind of
looked back on it and I retro actively
appreciate the fact that I had rim back
then it was rim but blackberries
security at least keeping me from
getting my identity stolen in particular
but yeah oh I got a bit of a train going
by right now I don't know if you guys
can hear that yeah
I'm Jaime dropped a mic it might come up
in a second Jaime did drop off for a bit
but I'm gonna give it a couple more
seconds then we'll get into our main
segment for today alright and we're back
Jaime is out for a second he did drop
off one more time also we are going to
spend the next 10 to 15 minutes or so
talking about our main topic it's
something that we've talked about before
which is why I'm okay with it being a
little bit shorter personally but also
just so you know Jules Jules is not in
the production booth today his head is
probably exploding based upon the timing
that we've had on this podcast along we
apologized Jules we had to sort of like
wing everything today because Jules who
is so great in the production booth was
not available today hopefully you're
having a great trip wherever you are
right now brother okay
so let's talk 5g 5g is obviously going
to be the next generation of our mobile
internet we did talk about it a little
bit a couple of weeks ago because the
Moto Z three of which we are still doing
our review on right now it's going to
get a mod that is going to provide 5g
connectivity it is a mod it's an add-on
but our speculation from a couple of
weeks back was that the phones that are
coming in 2019 are potentially going to
have 5g connectivity built-in so that
would make the mod a little bit obsolete
from the
that however a lot of manufacturers a
lot of phone companies are throwing
their names into the Hat are officially
signing up for the race right now we
have Samsung huawei LG and it's only
going to be a matter of time before
other manufacturers like Oppo vivo
Xiaomi HTC Sony they're they're going to
join obviously but for now it's a race
of the top three Samsung Huawei and LG
now who's gonna do it first and I think
that's where we can start off this
conversation who do you think is going
to achieve 5g true 5g first within their
phones what do you think Brendan well I
think Verizon will be the carrier to do
it first in a very limited number of
markets and the only support that first
only supported device is going to be the
motive C and as you guys taught me last
time we talked about 5g the antenna
array required for 5g is a little bit
complicated and that's why the Moto mod
is you know a little bit thick and has
some complexity to it because you need
to have a specialized antenna array that
would probably make the phone much
thicker so I imagine that maybe maybe
galaxy s 10 maybe certainly the the note
10 and and maybe the the flagship from
Huawei will start to have these these
five 5g capabilities and probably be a
little bit thicker
maybe it'll combine it with a bigger
battery 2 and no headphone jack
maybe so but there's this is the thing
though I I agree with you that Samsung
would be one of the first one of the
first choices when it comes to all of
this but apparently Samsung has
confirmed that their first 5g phone is
indeed not going to be the galaxy s 10
and even though we were speculating that
to be the CAD we were speculating that
the S 10 was going to be the first 5g
capable phone with it built into the
device without having anything any
add-ons or anything like that I'm almost
a little bit surprised but also not
because I would like I was saying two
weeks ago I would think that these
manufacturers want to put so much
testing behind it obviously
has been doing that they have their own
tests and in the studios whenever we go
to their 5g days or to their media tours
and whatnot it's incredible
so they're definitely putting all of
their R&amp;amp;D behind it but the
manufacturers have to do the exact same
thing it might take a while so that's
the reason why I was skeptical that the
s10 was going to be the first 5g phone
and it looks like that's going to be the
case and you're right about the whole
Verizon deal I think in the u.s. Verizon
will probably be the first ones because
they have their very fast internet that
already exists and then they're just
kind of piggyback that and bolster it to
become full 5g but here's the thing
though there is there are there are
places around the world whose internet
beats the pants off of even Verizon here
in the US so I actually kind of think
that 5g will probably be achieved
somewhere outside of the US before here
personally it might be like in Korea
where Internet is incredible oh my god
in Korea the what Anton was there we
were experiencing some great speeds on
our project five cards and it was
amazing like the internet was so good in
Korea and I wonder if they have probably
the better outfitted infrastructure to
achieve it well it's interesting because
before LTE you know 3G you know Europe
and Asia had that the 3G speeds much a
long time before the United States got
it and then the u.s. was very quick to
adopt LTE the carrier's really went
quickly with that and so don't you think
that the US carriers would be first with
5g because they have such ubiquitous
strong LTE networks built out because 5g
is a piggyback on LTE right it is yeah
5g is not as one of our commenters on
top and the top chat is saying right now
it is important to just sort of clarify
5g is not any one signal technology it's
not like we're creating a whole new band
or a whole new radio just to make 5g
work it's a combination of a lot of
things
so there's millimeter-wave there's LTE
Pro LTE you and all that so ltu is
is what I'm sort of referencing when it
comes to what kind of speeds and what
kind of internet they have in places
like in Korea and one of the reasons why
we have different we have different
radios and bands and different speeds
here in the US that range from the
different carriers you're right that
there's that ubiquity with carriers like
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile Verizon and they are
spearheading the development of 5g but
the reason why I feel like it's it gets
a little bit tough is because you do
have to marry all of these different
speeds and different bands together and
we haven't even perfected our LTE that
exists now which is kind of my point and
meanwhile I mean it's internet so much
better than so many other places in the
world that what if the development of
the 5g that we're doing here in the US
was sort of what if a test market was
created out in a different place outside
of the US where the infrastructure
actually has that perfect I don't want I
hesitate to use the word perfected but
much better LTE than what we have here
is what I'm saying
which which I guess isn't that difficult
because you still have Royal rural
that's a hard word to say for the areas
in the United States that don't have
don't have LTE don't even have 3G don't
even have broadband connectivity because
there's so much you know open space in
such a large part of the country whereas
like in Korea it's just more compacted
in terms of population that's easier to
you know put up a smaller number of in a
smaller amount of infrastructure to
reach the population I agree with that
and that's the reason why Verizon is
probably going to be where it really
comes in because Verizon actually has
the right speeds and they actually cover
those rural you're right that's a hard
word rural areas and you're totally
right about that and I think I think
that is the reason why Verizon will be
the first carrier for sure but as far as
the first phone there is an announcement
that did come out this is our final
story in terms of 5g and we can kind of
mold it all together
apparently Sprint is going to be holding
or rather carrying the LG G 8 and it's
an LG LG M Sprint together or making the
claim
that the LGG a potentially whatever the
next LG smartphone is going to be on
Sprint is going to be the first 5g
smartphone so potentially LG might
actually be able to make it happen it's
coming in the first half of 2019 which
is what this graphic shows and perhaps
Sprint is gonna be the one but I don't
know I I'm not I'm not here to throw
shade at anybody or anything like that
it's just I don't really feel like
Sprint's going to if they get the first
5g phone I don't think it's gonna be
great
like I would sooner think that Verizon
will do a better job of implementing 5g
then Sprint would because the coverage
is different I've never had a good time
with Sprint personally myself so yes you
can say that technically you got the
first 5g phone but is it gonna be a
great 5g phone I'm not too sure about
that
and you Sprint or t-mobile is the
question true t-mobile has a much wider
net that's true I'm a just got back by
the way there's a much wider net for for
t-mobile but I think by the way to bring
you up to speed - hiya Jaime um we did
agree Brandon at least and you can tell
us what you think that as far as
carriers are concerned because right now
LG is claiming they will be their first
5g smartphone however as far as good
first 5g carrier is concerned we think
that Verizon will probably be the the
place where it happens good so Verizon
has got the tools I think that they've
got like the strongest partnership with
Qualcomm as well and call coms like
everything that they've already prepared
for 5g is like horribly the most
top-notch it's just I think that Sprint
is gonna use pretty much the same
technology and it's I'm shocked as the
rumors are that the Galaxy S 10 is not
bringing 5g exactly we did we did yeah
even if there is a chip already designed
for it EXO knows they're not bringing it
those are just rumors I the cool thing
is that they said that they're doing it
if they said that they're doing it
that's great you know the problem is
when they say when they say things like
in the first half of 2019 so there are
six months I mean it could happen on on
literally May 29th
yes it's far you know we'll see
don't forget that one of the reasons
that Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T were first with
LTE and t-mobile and Sprint were
was because of financial resources
because those are the top two carriers
in the country they had access to the
most capital the the many billions of
dollars required to change towers and
upgrade infrastructure so it just it
just makes a lot of sense that Verizon
would be would be first followed me by
AT&amp;amp;T and the t-mobile Sprint we'll get
to five key when they can do it wait a
second what do you mean I mean what are
you talking about remember sprint was
first with WiMAX oh wait was that this
was the point that I was making a little
bit earlier is that like the reason why
I'm skeptical about 5g actually being as
viable as we hope it will be at least
for now is because we haven't even I
said this two weeks ago we haven't
perfect we have not gotten anywhere
close to perfecting LTE as it stands
right now in the US which is why I get
that in the u.s. our development and R&amp;amp;D
is being put towards 5g as it should be
you know because these are the companies
that are trying to spearhead it like
Qualcomm however there are so many
markets in the world and even one of our
users in the chat right now Renato
Laporte is already saying that even
t-mobile in the Netherlands is already
preparing its network with LTE Pro 13
and there are markets outside of the US
that already have LTE that is just
killing it right now like on Lunas shoot
that's better LT than the United States
I'll tell you that much okay god Ronia
is insane I know Estonia is amazing III
talked about how Anton and I when we
were in Korea together we were getting
great speeds on all of the all of the LT
that we're using on mobile networks and
you know a part of me wonders like if
you really want to develop 5g in a
certain manner to really get a good test
market for it why not go outside of the
US to really perfect that because the
u.s. is obviously like the Wild West
when it comes to LTE and networks you
know so the biggest problem is I one of
the things that I've learned about the
United States is like they're like yes
we have the best metro system in the
world I'm like no you don't this problem
is when you when you when you I mean I
know that there are a lot of people here
in New York that have never left New
York and that's a problem because you go
to Barcelona and the Met
from Barcelona Berlin our million times
better than this what time the trains
gonna pass and what stops its gonna make
like and so that's the biggest problem
with mobile carriers they feel that
they're the best this is the most
expensive data in the world I believe
without a doubt like it's hilarious when
they're like yes and it's just the
hundreds like even even Wi-Fi in this
country is insanely stupidly expensive
and it's not the best there is and so I
do understand that the United States has
a lot of difficulties when it comes to
infrastructure let's just start by the
fact that it's easier to place to bring
great LTE to Romania because the country
is about the size of Texas and so if if
we are fair to the United States we have
a huge problem when it comes to
infrastructure and it's called size this
country is larger than Europe mmm-hmm so
you know it's it's just that's just the
way it is if all you have is one major
airport it's easier to serve you know
international flights if all you have is
a country the size of Spain or the size
of France it's easier in the United
States it is so much difficult because
and then you've got like very densely
populated cities and cities that are
that have nothing yeah and so that's the
biggest problem of the United States
like I get it but I do agree the United
States needs to leave but at the same
time I feel that the implementation of
5g is gonna be easier than the
implementation of LTE because LT
required like a completely different
infrastructure whereas 5g is like an
antenna that lives on top of LTE like 5g
without LTE can't live like I'm GNR has
no it does not exist without LTE and so
the I guess the pitch with 5g is we are
creating a spectrum that lives on LTE
but the idea is to pull people off of
LTE in order for the people that remain
on LTE that won't upgrade their phones
immediately to have better better data
speed so I guess the the pitch that
companies like Qualcomm are making is
tell you what guys don't invest on
anymore' LT 5g is gonna be your solution
because we're gonna pull people out of
out of LTE through 5g so I get that
we'll see if it works yeah for sure and
we'll see where that goes I I was
telling Brandon just just just so that
you're up to speed I made that I'm not
surprised that the s10 is not gonna be
it like I was the one that speculated
two weeks ago that these manufacturers
are going to have to like make sure that
it works the way they want it to and I
just don't think that the next
generation is gonna be it which is why
it's great to be first but if it's not
good it's not gonna be the case yeah
like in the essential phone brought the
notch first but when the iPhone 10 did
it everyone talked about the iPhone 10
yeah and these these these hardware
companies are desperately going to want
to promote something new to finally get
all those people to upgrade that have it
and like they're probably making the
commercials now the 5g Galaxy S 11 and
and they're not gonna do with the S 10
because people are gonna be like I'm
still not going to upgrade because
there's no 5g in my area and so I think
they want to wait a little while longer
until 5g is more pervasive so they can
put their marketing dollars into
promoting this new awesome high-tech
feature that is a good point if you
think about it like there's a reason why
I still haven't invested in a 4k TV like
if I get a unit then that's cool but I
won't buy it just because what is it
that gets streamed we don't get stream
4k so unless I buy 4k content you're not
really consuming it yet well you know
what's the point of seeing a pixelated
image right now just because I want the
latest TV for not the latest content
there's a lot of totally underly there's
a lot of really good 4k netflix content
YouTube content it's really good and 4k
TVs the newer ones do a really good job
at upscaling 1080p to not 4k but it
doesn't look pixelated so it's gotten
better that's what I'm saying so what
I'm saying is it'll just take time like
people reading collect me where they
don't adopt the latest technology
because they're waiting for it to get
better and so I have to agree with that
I guess I'm just worried that the s10
won't bring 5g because I totally
desperately want them to like bring it
out and just learn from everything
that's gonna go wrong with it
in that way and that way the note 10
will just be better because that's just
what I tell people don't buy the first
generation wait for the second
and so I wish that companies were
willing to experiment early just to fix
things in their next generation true
they're probably gonna be watching LG
very closely then it's gonna is gonna be
what they're gonna do and then yeah and
then the no 10 I wouldn't be surprised
you know what I'm I'm thinking the NotI
might be might be the one it's not gonna
be the first half of 2019 because that's
when all of the kings have to be worked
out it's gonna be the last half of it so
for our final story today it's something
a little bit lighter I know the 5g Todd
gets a little bit high / low level
whatever you want to call it you know we
I'm not that I will I will admit right
now that when I go to Qualcomm Media
Days I I don't really understand
everything but I do my best with it so
hopefully you guys enjoyed that talk
about 5g once again we will of course be
revisiting it if we see even more
information about 5g come out but for
now we're gonna take the opposite
direction from our t-mobile discussion
earlier it's not about humans being who
you talk to
it's about having an echo in your dorm
this is uh this is gonna be interesting
st. Louis in university is placing echo
dots in all of its dorm rooms and while
this thing has happened in other
universities the difference with st.
Louis is that it's mandatory there's an
easier what there's an easy way of
opting out of the program you just have
to press the mute button but it is still
a yeah you can probably unplug it I
don't know how they're going to
implement or even I don't want to use
the word enforce but I don't know how
they're planning on implementing having
an echo dot in every single dorm room
but obviously there are some concerns
about privacy and stuff like that but
the reason why the echo dot is
apparently important to their mandatory
dorm room out fittings is because it has
a skill created by n powered that will
answer questions about student life such
as when the gym is open how much
printing paper and the library will
cause questions like that that college
students have on a daily basis and while
that is kind of cool it also kind of
eliminates Liz the reason why I'm
bringing it back to the t-mobile story
it eliminates the RA like you you kind
of the reason why you even have an RA in
your dorm room in your dorm hall I
should say is because you have to go to
them to ask them for questions that you
would normally have but now it's all
about having the echo dot in your room
and then answers all your questions for
so what's the RAS whole deal re is
supposed to just like find you drunk on
your dorm room and send you to detox is
that their only function now what is an
RA by the way a Resident Assistant okay
[Laughter]
so an echo dot in your like I I
obviously don't have any kids so I I
couldn't even be close to relating to
this whole story but if you had a kid
and you wanted to send them to a college
and they had this in the dorm room how
would you feel about that I don't know
so my kid is about to go to college in
Florida huh which is thank God for that
and so yeah I know I'm that old I
apologize
oh god I'm actually able to laugh this T
is awesome dude this T is like best oh I
guess I don't mind like I like the
technology I think the technology just
there's certain technology that is
useful i I've never used an Amazon echo
I have used Google home for a while I
love being able to just be you know call
this or call that I love these these
benefits I feel that if universities can
tailor into the SDK of what these
product can do and take them further
that's awesome but this is just me from
my perspective like do you guys see that
there's any sort of risk in that being
intrusive or something well the the
devices do have to be returned and if
the echo dot does record and locally
store audio like I'm not saying that
anybody is going to open it up and try
to get to the audio I'm just saying that
you know there's that implication
there's no reason to I you know but so
the question is can that can they
control what that echo dot listens to is
the question true you can hit that mute
button if you want but you who knows I
mean we've had reports of of echoes or
Amazon's
assistant literally laughing out of
nowhere
what yeah there's a few people saying
that their echoes have been have been
just sort of straight-up laughing in the
middle of just
the moments during the day Google home
hasn't been doing that for me I've never
had any of those weird poltergeist
moments with it thankfully but yeah it
could get a little bit creepy like
imagine if you're in your dorm room
you're trying to sleep or maybe you're
doing stuff you should be doing and then
all of a sudden the echo dot just like
does something you know might have
forgive my skepticism it's just you know
if my son gets caught doing something
he's not supposed to be doing I don't
know it's his problem like it's one of
those things where you know whether I
would if any it's it's just one of the
things that I've learned about parenting
is if they don't do it in front of you
they'll do it behind your back it's one
of those things where I don't know if I
want something to monitor him or not
because I wouldn't want to know but then
again I would rather him not be doing it
in shady areas or stuff like that so
that's that's I guess the trade-off
where I don't know what's worse is the
question it's still good I love that
okay well I feel like I interrupted
Brendan earlier Brendan a couple of your
thoughts and then we're gonna go ahead
and call it on this one eater Brendan
fries Oh
ready froze oh okay well there you go he
was a bit in there and then we lost them
there it's just I don't know man you
know again you don't have kids but from
your experience in college like how was
it it was fine and I actually okay maybe
the reason why maybe the reason why I'm
bringing up the whole RA thing is
because I was a goody two-shoes and I
was and I was I was friends with my RA
so I'm sad for you my college days were
crazy oh no I mean I there are obviously
things that they're obviously stories
that I have from my college days I went
to I went to a Catholic school though so
you know you can you can take that with
a grain of salt but the thing is that I
actually was friends with I was the guy
as a freshman who would leave the door
open so that anyone can come in hang
with me and hang with us I'll leave the
door open and on any given weekend I
would probably be cooking and they
gnorm would smell like Filipino food so
everyone was free to come by and hang
out with me so yeah so I was just chill
like I got along with anybody I was
actually called not like there was any
award or anything but like a lot of
people that I lived with in college
called me the easiest roommate ever so
I'm really chill mr. president I guess
we had a college bar like right beside
the building and so that didn't happen
until until after I left they actually
opened up a bar in my college and yeah
things happened after that but yeah that
was crazy like for me so you know it's
it's one of those things where and we've
had this conversation with my son where
it's like you know you only get to go to
college once or you know it's up to you
on that one but you know these are there
is a particular time in life for
everything and so this is the time for
you to enjoy a ton of things and just
you know be smart about it don't be
stupid about it but I can't just sit
here and tell you not to do a lot of
things that I did like it doesn't work
that way
yes for sure I'm just asking you to be
smart about it
like don't be stupid obviously there are
consequences to everything you do and so
it's really hard like I feel and I feel
like we're like drifting away from we're
probably overthinking what this echo dot
is going to do yeah I agree I agree with
that but probably you know they're gonna
be those parents though who are like so
you're monitoring my kid like there are
gonna be those parents who are going to
feel skeevy shibata's website and i
wonder if this service will allow
parents to monitor their kids oh no I
don't think they would ever allow that
to happen personally like that's just
gonna be a huge amount of red tape I
don't know and I feel it's a difficult
topic regardless yeah exactly but it's
interesting that they're doing it I love
that the echo dots are so branded with
the st. Louis University yeah they did
they're purple and they have the
insignia on the side so by the way do
you have an Amazon echo I don't I stick
with Google home and same things it's
just I don't need another product to
give me reasons to buy more stuff from
Amazon more than I already do yeah so
that is my that is my biggest problem
like I am a compulsive shopper when it
comes to Amazon just because of the
convenience of not having to go to a
store to look for something but I know
exactly what color I want of whatever
shirt I want to buy or whatever shoes I
want to buy and I know my shoe size and
I just order it
doesn't work I just send it back and
well that would be an interesting thing
what if each dorm room had the echo dot
connected to an Amazon Prime account
like any one of those students could do
that and it just becomes an easy way of
ordering things for your dorm room like
that is cool that is true I mean I feel
that everything had I feel technology
has a ton of benefits obviously there is
like you say there are risks but this is
where everything's going then like them
you know there's there's only one way to
find out if they're if it's risky or not
that's me yep I agree with that all
right now
Brandon did he did drop off hopefully he
comes back I'm gonna take my time on
this outro because he does have the
master off button for this cast so if he
doesn't come back we're all going to
hang up and people are just gonna be
looking at silence he's the one who
started the chat Jesus all right let me
try to contact him all right cool while
Jaime does that and on that note that is
going to be our show for this week
