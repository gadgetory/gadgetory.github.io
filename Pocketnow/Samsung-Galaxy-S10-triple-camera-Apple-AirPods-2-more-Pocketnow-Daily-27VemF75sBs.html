might bring triple cameras and we're all
for it
Apple's whole audio line might bring
some interesting changes in 2019 and if
the HTC u12 plus hasn't arrived to you
well you're actually not alone
I'm hi Mary that are reporting from
Milan Italy and this is the face of
jetlag this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for a very
inexpensive mid-range er the Nokia 3.1
is about to launch at B&amp;amp;H and yes
specifications are not necessarily the
best but it's a hundred fifty nine bucks
it if you want to try Android P right
now that's probably the best way to go
as that phone is in the lineup you'll
learn more about it in the description
now let's talk about Apple and it's
infamous MacBook butterfly mechanism for
the keyboard if you join a ton of people
that are complaining about what is going
on with MacBook keyboards and everything
some people actually have to pay a lot
of money just to get them replaced the
company is going to be covering up to
three years after manufacturing date for
whatever issues you can have you'll get
a full replacement whatever not of the
computer but of the keyboard obviously
or the keys so you can learn more about
the program in the description I'm
already having issues with the spacebar
now for those of you that are having
issues with the HTC u12 plus meaning you
ordered it on Amazon apparently it was
opposed to arrive to your doorstep on
June 21st and now you're getting back
order up until August 3rd you're not
alone there are other people that are
dealing with this apparently HTC is
looking into it as it's only a sporadic
case still it's not worth to wait until
August 3rd guys trust me
and for those of you that want to buy
yourself a pair of air pods are waiting
for the newer ones panel you're gonna
have to wait until next year according
to Bloomberg as the company is working
on bringing new improvements to the air
pods like water resistance etc but the
problem is that they might get more
expensive we also hear about new home
pods etc I'm not necessarily happy with
the way Apple is trending with audio I
wish they said yeah we're bringing back
the headphone jack but it's not gonna
happen
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 10 and
boy is this cool
name's beyond 0 beyond 1 and beyond 2 3
phones it seems that one of these
devices is gonna bring a flat screen 5.8
inch display in one camera the other one
is gonna bring that a similar size
display but with dual cameras and then
there's a third one a third device that
is bringing a 6.2 inch display that's
curved and three cameras what is the
company going to bring to the market
here we still don't know these are again
just rumors let us know in the comments
what do you think that Samsung might
bring with this Galaxy S 10 because my
god if they came up with like a wide
angle and a telephoto and the primary
camera I am sold but leave us a comment
