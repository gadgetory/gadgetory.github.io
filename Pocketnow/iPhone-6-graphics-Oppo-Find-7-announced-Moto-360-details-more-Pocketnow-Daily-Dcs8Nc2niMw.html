includes almost everything we were
expecting the iphone 6 could include
more powerful graphic capabilities
thanks to a new chip and we finally get
the camera specifications for the all
new HTC One I'm hi Mary betta and since
it's Father's Day in my country I'm
supposedly getting a free beer today
right right this is PocketNow daily
especially off with some official news
as google has finally and I mean finally
for a reason launched at Google Nexus 5
Nexus 7 and even the chromecast and as
many as 11 countries all across Europe
and everywhere and this is taking so
long I don't understand why Google has
been reluctant to market these
smartphones and tablets and other
countries and it's finally happening and
the price points are kind of similar
just make sure the description for full
details and hopefully they don't run out
of stock on this case now let's talk
about the Moto 360 the company's
designer in charge of this SmartWatch
was recently on a Google hangout trying
to explain everything over 22 minutes
and this is very interesting as the guy
didn't really explain much you didn't
really give us a lot of details of what
we are expecting one of the cool things
is for example they don't work with any
Android device running Android 4.3 which
is awesome but probably the most
interesting features is the fact that we
don't know anything about the battery
meeting there is no charging port on
this thing and he didn't say how it was
going to charge or how it's gonna be
powered this is really interesting what
we're getting in this moto 360 and it's
kind of something expected from a
company like Motorola let's see in the
summer now let's talk about Apple one of
the coolest features of the iPhone 5s is
a 64-bit processor which really is
actually not that relevant without more
RAM but it is because of the GPU that's
included and imagination technologies
has just launched a new GPU that is
being rumored to be launched on the next
generation iphone and what the cool
features of this new GPU is the fact
that it includes ray tracing
technologies that will allow any game
that you're playing to give you accurate
lighting many you will see shadows where
they're supposed to be you will be
seeing lights where they're supposed to
be and again games are getting cooler
and cooler let's just hope they also
give us a gamepad now talk about HTC
as we are expecting the all new HTC One
very very soon and one of the biggest
questions is will HTC fix the camera
issue got links in the description for
details on the specification Zand we
finally get the specs for the camera and
listen to this it says 16 megapixels and
4 megapixels so we do know that the
phone carries dual cameras we just don't
know exactly what they're for but we do
know what the resolution is now so
hopefully the images are going to be so
cool that we are just going to want this
phone will see and finally for the hot
news of the day the Oppo find 7 or 7 s
got announced and the reason why I say
that is because this is actually two
different devices that look exactly the
same and the reason why is because one
of them is the fully powered quad HD
display a full-blown Snapdragon 801
processor phone and then the other one
has a Snapdragon 800 with 1080p display
and this is really interesting a lot of
us were hoping for a 50 megapixel camera
on this phone and you do get it but you
don't this is actually a 13 megapixel
sensor that has a software gimmick that
takes 10 photos at the same time
whenever you're taking a shot and then
it builds you a 15 megapixel shot just
like you do with panorama so yeah that's
really interesting hopefully it is as
cool as they're trying to sell it but
that is a question of the day all the
videos that you see in the links and
tell us what you think about the Oppo
find 7 would this be a smartphone that
you want it even includes out to eat for
all markets in my particular case I'll
be honest with you I do like the thing
it looks gorgeous but leave us a comment
