and another thing that I like about
Android is the ability to load up custom
keyboards or input methods today i want
to show you swiftkey x beta and what it
can do and some little caveats about it
let's go take a look
okay so first and foremost an input
method is a fancy name for a keyboard
you windows mobile guys know that as a
sip or a soft input panel and basically
whenever you go into a text editing box
it's that keyboard that shows up right
across the bottom and it lets you well
type in stuff there's all kinds of stuff
that we've shown you in the past this is
another one and it's kind of unique so
let's go through some of these settings
first then we'll get to the really
unique part that sets it apart from all
the other input methods that we've
looked at before first of all you've got
your language profile and this is in the
settings which you can get to come back
in here in the language and keyboard
settings area okay so let's go ahead and
go into swiftkey beta language profile
you can set your language in this case
I've chosen English us so this is kind
of a nice choice for you if you've got a
a device for example that is a European
device and you don't have English us you
might have European us or UK us excuse
me UK English how about that but you've
got all kinds of different English
variations well in this case you can in
fact download the US version of English
but there's also some of the other stuff
in here as well that you can download
too so quite a bit of language that you
can download the download itself takes a
bit of time so I would recommend you to
do that over Wi-Fi let's go ahead and
take a look personalisation you can
tailor predictions this is really where
the app gets interesting now once you're
all familiar with dictionaries right you
type in something on your keyboard and
if it doesn't recognize a word like
pocket now you can add that to your
dictionary so when you type in pocket
now it will autocomplete that or rather
it won't auto complete it to something
else that makes sense so it won't try
and a spell check something for you
that's really not a problem in the first
place well this is rather interesting
you can see here it's got learn from
Facebook Gmail Twitter SMS and then we
can clear all data now you actually have
to provide not necessarily credentials
but you have to log in and give this
app the ability to look at the stuff
that you're posting in each one of these
if you want to get these personalization
options now you don't have to do it it's
entirely optional if you don't do it
this is essentially a normal keyboard
however if you do and that's where this
I really gets interesting like I've
mentioned before the app will
essentially use your post to Facebook
Gmail Twitter and your text as a
predictive measure that will try and
figure out what you're trying to say an
autocomplete faster based on what you've
typed in there so if you come in here
you can go in and of course you need to
login using facebook okay so you do that
and login now this is not providing
credentials to swiftkey rather what it's
doing is it's logging into facebook and
you're getting back a token that gives
swiftkey x the ability to connect to
facebook so if you ever want to go back
and undo that it's relatively easily and
you see here that i did not complete
that so it gave me a message saying that
it failed and that i should try again
i'm not going to do that because this is
just kind of a demo for you we don't
want to take up that time but what it'll
do it'll try an autocomplete based on
your writing style on each one of these
and I find I have entirely different
writing styles in each one so I might
want to use my gmail writing style and
not my facebook or twitter or text
because those are all kind of shorthand
and abbreviated whereas my gmail is more
longhand it's more email so bear that in
mind because it is token-based you can
revoke those tokens from any one of
these apps and you don't have to worry
about it but even still I'm a little bit
worried keyboards in and of themselves
have the ability to record and report
every keystroke that you write I mean
they're a keyboard that's what they do
they have the ability to report that
back to a third party I haven't seen any
that have actually done that but the
potential is there now having an app
that goes out and connects to all of
your social media and your gmail well
that's a little bit concerning to me and
it's one of those things where you go I
no if I want to do this but it's really
an interesting and novel approach let's
go ahead and look at some of the other
settings we can change the theme from a
dark theme to a light theme I like the
dark one it's kind of windows phone 7
ish layout we can change it to qwerty
azerty different languages and one thing
that I don't see even though we've got
all this is Dvorak it shouldn't be that
hard guys but anyway moving right along
we can also turn on arrow keys if you
don't have a little touch pad or a
rollerball it's nice when your keyboard
has arrows to help do some fine
positioning of your pointer so i've got
a touch pad so we'll leave that turned
off come down here in stats my
efficiency is only fifty five percent
that's not all that great for a keyboard
that's supposed to be super efficient
but it's still a beta so we'll forgive
it a little bit i also have 801 total
keystrokes which means that i've saved
1010 now when you look at it in that
perspective fifty-five percent that's
not bad it saved me that many keystrokes
so this isn't accuracy this is
efficiency let's go ahead and look at
some other stuff advanced we can do all
kinds of stuff typing style I've had
this in rapid so it's really fast for
those of you who type and depend on auto
correction i'm going to go ahead and try
precise for a little bit and see if i
like it any better the spacebar will
what insert a space complete the parent
word always insert a prediction you can
set that the default is to complete the
current word yada yada yada lots of
stuff hey we got all that one thing that
I just recently did is I disabled the
autocomplete for the physical keyboard
so when I slide out my keyboard and
start typing just like that I actually
get swiftkey X autocomplete suggestions
on that keyboard as well so the
experience is the same across both
different keyboards even though the
keyboards are somewhat different but
enough about that let's go ahead and
come back to home
then let's take a look at how this works
so let's go ahead and make a new google
doc and wait for that to load we want to
choose a document will call it untitled
open this guy up and because this is
going out to the cloud and back it is a
little bit slower it's needing me to
login apparently it did it automatically
good so I've got my untitled document
down here let's go ahead and start
typing something in so i went ahead and
hit the edit button and now i've got my
first line of text and you can see the
keyboard down here it's really kind of
nice it doesn't follow the theming and
notice up here that i've got this
cyanogen blue theme and I've got East
nice green buttons down here so it
doesn't really match that yet again
still a beta but we can go in here and
type in hello and you can see it didn't
autocomplete that very well for me again
on camera it's kind of hard because
you're looking at this from a different
angle hello my name is joe ok just like
that and it replaced with how so kind of
interesting how all that works same
predictive type that you normally have
you've got the same keyboard that
switches over to a numeric versus a
versus an alpha keyboard you can long
press and get numbers and just like that
all kinds of fun when you flip the
keyboard open now let's do this first
when you're in landscape the buttons are
a little bit easier to push because
they're a little bit busy they're a
little bit bigger rather and when we
open this up and start typing so I can
get my cursor back in there I work for
Pocket now.com and I had that in my
autocorrect but I didn't choose it and
you see it put a space in after my dot
and capitalize the c so i have to go
back in and do that
and so this is kind of using the
prediction even though we told it not to
on the physical keyboard so a little bit
interesting there anyway the the app is
called swiftkey X it is currently a beta
it is very fun I've enjoyed using it let
me get back here to my language and
keyboard and you can see swiftkey X beta
if you would like to give this a try
yourself head on over to pocketnow.com
