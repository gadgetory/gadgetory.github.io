pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
last final look at the galaxy tab 10.1
in comparison with some other tablets we
have on hand and with some as others
that we've used so sit back relax and
enjoy the show so here we're looking at
the galaxy tab 10.1 from verizon versus
the HP TouchPad and it's a little hard
to tell from the screen here but the HP
TouchPad is they're both on full
brightness the HP TouchPad has a
noticeably kind of yellow tint to it
over here and this is more of a blue
white either one of them are probably
very color corrected but that doesn't
really matter so I've got the default
web browsers brought up on both of these
and so we're going to kind of launch the
web browser for the pocket out site
together see them loading here both
connected to Wi-Fi
and both still loading the site
specifically the ads the text is
certainly more readable on the Galaxy
Tab even though it's smaller it looks a
little blurry here on the HP model and
this is already finished loading the
page we're still waiting for the HP
TouchPad to finish lending and I realize
that this is kind of an outdated model
technically since HP's decided that it's
not going to make this device anymore
but you can kind of see the difference
between the web browser and it's still
not finished loading up the page
scrolling through you can see this is a
little chunky scrolling through here a
lot more fluid let's go ahead and open
up a article on both of these if we look
here no content here on the HP TouchPad
that we can select it's completely
missing whereas on the Galaxy Tab we
actually can launch the video in the
review size wise as you can see here the
galaxy tab is a little bit longer but
noticeably thinner and a whole lot
lighter than the HP touchpad is the this
really feels like a slab of plastic and
it's very heavy this is lightweight
feels very nice in the hands easy to use
so unsurprising that in this case the
galaxy tab 10.1 would win out over the
HP TouchPad even at the ninety nine
dollars at the HP touchpad is so we're
looking at the galaxy tab 10.1 and the
original iPad we both got them Google
here with a default browser Safari and
the default internal browser on the tab
and let's just go ahead and launch this
what I found the difference between
these two particular dices and obviously
this one's not going to load any flash
here and we even got an advertisement on
this particular
showing the page is still loading in the
background thankfully but the tab is
definitely lighter and thinner a little
bit longer as you can see here a little
bit narrow as far as the video screen is
concerned quality of the pixels of as
far as like being able to read here I
actually can see the the galaxy tab
screen a little bit better than the ipad
one and I'm a little bit of an angle
here screen brightness it feels like
they're just about the same screen
brightness wise between the two of them
on these devices now that said it still
feels like in the realms of the apps and
how the android system works in
comparison with the ipad and the iOS
ecosystem that's in the background there
really I still feel like the android
tablet system is a lot like the iPad one
when it first came out meaning that a
lot of the apps that are out there just
aren't really ready for prime time or
aren't quite don't look as good as they
really could just like when the iPad one
first came out there were a whole lot of
tablet applications available there were
a lot of iphone apps that you could use
the screen doubling with and that just
didn't look as good as everything else
now that said moving on to the ipad 2
let's go ahead and bring that up here
the ipad 2 is a little bit thinner not
very very much as a hair here and as far
as everything else goes size-wise it's
just a smidge shorter has a little wider
screen format then the galaxy tab as far
as speed goes i found that they're
pretty negligible now you can't really
compare android processing power and ram
and all of that and what the Vectra
specs are the specs on the ipad it's
it's it's not a fair game in playing
numbers with these sort of devices
unless you're playing android to android
or the ipad 2 ipad it just doesn't make
any sense other than looking at what the
device can do and what i found is that
on the ipad and i'm not an apple fanboy
by any means if you point the camera up
we'd see a lot more pcs in this room
then you would Apple products but the
iOS system just works right now and
Apple has done a really good job of
controlling the hardware and the
software combined to make a really solid
ecosystem and provide a lot of tools to
developers to produce some really the
apps and have courted those developers
to do those apps in a really nice
fashion there's a lot more music
creation apps on the iPad there's even
apps allow you to connect multiple iPads
together do music creation whereas
Android is just getting started with
that if you look at the music type of
applications that are on there there's
not an IMS 20 app on there now there's
not a app like garageband on there yet
there are some tuna wraps and there's
some some funky little sense but they're
not nearly as good as what this now has
and again back in the day when the iPad
first came out there weren't a whole lot
of music apps for this either so my
anticipation is that unless Apple really
steps up their game with iOS 5 and
moving ahead that the Android tablets
are really going to start coming into
their own and start picking up some of
those you know high-end apps that people
expect and have been using here now in
comparison as far as usability between
these two apps as far as simplicity
Android is still more of a tinker's type
system in my opinion and I like to
tinker whereas iOS I can hand to my
two-and-a-half-year-old and
be able to navigate it through it very
quickly and very easily without fiddling
around with a whole lot of stuff get
herself in netflix or launch other
applications and she understands this
single button interface to get back and
forth whereas this multi button
interface while she would obviously
learn it and pick it up pretty easily as
a child it's not quite the same to her
she doesn't care where the content comes
from though if I'm playing netflix on
this or netflix on that obviously it
doesn't matter and i have found that
even watching netflix on this galaxy tab
versus the ipad 2 doesn't really make
that much of a difference to my myself
either now my ipad 2 does not have a
data plan with it so i found that the
Galaxy Tabs data plan has been
outstanding to have available to myself
when I'm out on the road I don't have to
do a whole lot of tethering and really
it makes me think that the next time I
upgrade if i choose to do an ipad again
i'm really going to think heavily about
doing a data package because i tell you
what that 4g speeds on this tablet have
been very very nice and all i found
really android is necessarily a loser in
this case it just as i said before feels
like it's the first gen products just
getting started compared to items like
then the color which I've had it its
outstanding compared to the galaxy tab 7
it's out out started yeah the galaxy tab
the original its outstanding in
comparison to the asus or the motorola
xoom or really any product out there
other than aside the ipad iOS and
leaving it aside comparing this device
to any other tablet that's on the market
really blows away just about everything
that's out there and it's really a
fantastic device for the price when you
soon as you bring back the environment
and the ecosystem of iOS with the ipad 2
then this doesn't look quite as strong
this you still have to use itunes with
which i really dislike
I don't have to use itunes I can use
whatever syncing app I choose I've got
google music on here a lot more services
that Google Apps look better on this
than they do on the iPad and frankly in
another two years we may find that these
are actually the better devices on the
whole and Apple gets stuck where it is
as far as interface goes between the
galaxy tab and the iPad or the HP
TouchPad really i do prefer androids
ability to lay out the icons as I see
fit I realize you can do that by
jailbreaking the iPad I you know
jailbreak the ipad for other reasons not
for moving the icons around I also like
the ability to add widgets to the home
screen although that's not really that
important when it comes down to it when
you're trying to work in a tablet
environment my workflow has been created
around this particular device and used
lock me in a lot i used the docs to go I
use the Kindle reader with this
particular vice and I worked around it
enough now that I know how to make
things work correctly on this I found
that when I first got started with a
galaxy tab it took a little bit time to
adjust my workflow but it did adapt very
quickly although again the apps that
were written for Android for example the
office apps we're a little sluggish on
the Galaxy Tab versus on the iPad and it
comes right down to the developers and
how they're developing not necessarily
the hardware or anything particularly
wrong with this particular device or
anything about it battery life between
the two compared to the HP touchpad or
the Nook the galaxy tab does a fantastic
job it does an outstanding amount of
time on battery life and can go for
hours and hours and hours as far as
constant use if you leave it turned off
it goes into standby mode and you have
any sort of notifications that are
popping up it choose that battery life
very very quickly whereas with the iPad
the battery life just goes and goes and
goes and goes and goes and goes when
you're using it and then if you turn it
off it goes and goes and goes and goes
some more much longer than if
but the galaxy tab and in fact if I turn
them both off with the same and both at
a hundred percent the galaxy tab would
run out of power faster than the ipad 2
was and that's probably do the way that
that Apple's dealing with the apps and
again that's just a strict comparison of
how the perception of the products are
not necessarily that the galaxy tab is a
bad device should you buy the galaxy tab
that depends on what you're really
wanting to accomplish if you're already
an Android user and you're comfortable
with Android and you don't mind
tinkering and your anticipation is that
the product is going to get better and
it will then you could go with an
android device you'll love it it'll do
everything you want it to do if you've
already started out on an iPad and
you've got a lot of apps in that
ecosystem and there especially if you're
involved with music like I like to do
you're going to want to stick with the
ipad 2 for now don't give up on this
quite yet until this gets a little bit
better down the track that wraps up our
video series on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 with
LTE from Samsung for verizon if you have
any comments or questions please leave
them below will try to answer them in an
orderly fashion and we'd like to hear
your feedback on the video series as far
as the tablets go to see if we would
like to see more of this sort of tablet
coverage in the future thanks for
watching
