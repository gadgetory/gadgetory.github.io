on very good um soon hmm let me see your
all right so we've got some stuff to
talk about all right so which episode
are we on 1111 hey everyone welcome to
the eleventh episode of a pocket now
pocket cast podcast I will be your host
Brandon minimun editor-in-chief of
pocketnow.com also in the line managing
editor of pocket now mr. Evan blast
holler back how are there we go and also
on the line senior editor and Tandy
naggy holler back Anton however hey guys
hey everybody hey hey hey all right so a
lot to talk about although it's funny
because every time we podcast I say
there's a lot to talk about so next time
i will say there's very little to talk
about and we'll do half the amount very
nice can we have only a half-hour show
then yeah i'm curious as to what is the
ideal length of a podcast i'm assuming
that people that listen you know put the
time into it they listen on the way to
work they listen on the ride home on the
subway so there's not much of a
difference between 30 minutes and 60
minutes but i might be wrong so those of
you that are listening you rather our
podcast be 30 minutes or you like it 60
minutes or you want it 90 minutes which
I can't promise we can do let us know I
think the average out there is is 60
minutes for for the other podcasts that
occur on the Internet of which there are
many very good so let's get started so
cyanogenmod 7 version 7 final was
released I've got to admit that I don't
follow cyanogenmod that much Joe Levi
our resident Android expert does and
it's a really really big deal in the
Android world it's a it's a series of
roms that include a lot of really cool
features that you don't get on stock
devices and if you go to cyanogen com I
think it's cyanogenmod sightsee sayat
sign antigen here to cyanogenmod com and
you click on devices you can see that
there are Rob
for pretty much every device so you root
the device you you add this rom and Joe
did a pretty comprehensive walkthrough
of what's new in cyanogenmod 7 and the
list is is pretty comprehensive I was
pretty curious to see what they would be
for example you can move the top the
notification bar down to the bottom of
the screen which is kind of cool you can
change the way you know notifications
happen you can change themes you can
change performance tweaks certain things
about the display and it's a it's it's a
pretty cool thing have you ever used
cyanogenmod either of you I know I
haven't but talking about those small
tweaks especially the one with the
taskbar I have to come in here and say
that windows mobile 6.1 and 6.5 had the
option it so it was a third-party
application to the taskbar down but no I
haven't used antigen mud yeah I haven't
either um basically because my my main
on Android is a droid x and you can't
use it on that model or any of the the
motorola motorola models to boot loaders
a lot so okay yeah i'm looking here
there are no motorola devices mostly HTC
and yeah they're pretty much all HTC I
don't see any Samsung devices supported
here I'm just looking at some of the
other features a lot of them are sort of
novelty features which you could achieve
if you were to just get third party apps
but i guess the draw of cyanogenmod is
it puts everything and it's it's been
many years in the making it puts all
these tweaks under one roof under one
rom so that you don't have to download
you know 20 different third-party apps
to get the same functionality for
example there is a feature that might
double your battery life because
apparently there are red blue I might
get this wrong and two green pixels on
your display and if you the reason our
two greens is because it requires the
most amount of power to actually be seen
but if you disable the green and only
have the red and the blue your screen
might look weird but your battery
apparently goes through the roof and
cyanogenmod it gives you that that
functionality another thing it does is
it includes phone goggles which is
basically a an add-on that disallows you
from calling people a late at night
presumably when you've had too much to
drink or even taking too many drugs or
something so so a lot of stuff a lot of
features really and also a fair amount
of performance tweaks sort of just
wanted to talk about that for a minute
so say if you guys remember back in the
day approximately two or three years ago
maybe it was more windows mobile was the
standard for power users windows mobile
was everything a user wanted in order to
tweak to improve performance to tamper
with the registries and so on and when
Google Android came out it was all about
the usability actually if i recall well
Google Android was at the very beginning
what iOS with Apple is today it was a
simple operating system for somebody who
wouldn't need to tweak or to enhance
performance but things changed over time
and the Android became the number one
source and ROM and the platform for
customization windows mobile of course
is in the best Windows Phone 7 does not
allow you to do any of these and well
with the iphone it's another different
story and with cyanogenmod users who are
really interested in improving
performance tweaking adding that that
edge that very little which doesn't come
stock on Android devices is very useful
but there's the other part of the users
who just prefer a stock rom as vanilla
as it gets and I think it really comes
down to personal preference I always was
a vanilla rom type of guy I wanted
everything stripped down and I installed
those five or ten applications that were
especially good for my day-to-day use
and I applied those tweaks which were
good to me with cyanogenmod you get
everything of course you can customize
it by different categories and you can
turn on or off or
tamper with the settings for specific
parts of the of the operating system but
if you don't want that then you can
always go with with a vanilla rom but
after so many release candidates I think
cyanogenmod 7 version 7 I think it's the
final version has matured and I don't
think when we will see the next version
I think we will see some next release
candidates once Ice Cream Sandwich your
sunday comes out and then it's a whole
another level yeah and you raise an
interesting point um Android is sort of
revered right now as the platform for
tweaking and customizing and previously
it was windows mobile of course and
Windows Phone 7 is probably the least
customizable but I phone you know it
doesn't have the reputation as being met
customizable and yet if you jailbreak
you can completely change the experience
why do you guys think that despite that
that the iphone is a very hackable
platform it's not known as the hackable
platform because there's so many updates
i think and every time it gets updated
you have to read jailbreak it so for for
a lot of people it's you know it's not
something that they want to even get
into you know it's like the sony PSP and
how those the the home brewers were
constantly battling with with sony every
time a new firmware upgrade came out
that that's a good point I I was using
the iphone 4s my daily driver for a
while and i jailbroke it and i did all
these cool tweaks it started to get slow
I fell behind on upgrading the firmware
because the there's always a flag and
when the new firmware gets gets unlocked
or whatever term they use for it and it
was just it wasn't as pleasant an
experience as it is an Android to to
upgrade to new versions and to tweak so
it's not as user friendly in terms of
tweaking as Android probably makes sense
yeah that's right but we have to make a
differentiation between performance
tweaks and those visual mods you can
jailbreak the heck out of apple's iphone
and the iOS and you will still get that
same icon ish home screen that
you cannot change but with Android there
are so many visual mods you can apply
and you can you can have another device
with another user interface looking
fresh every day if you want well
actually and this was surprising to me
when I was standing in line for 11 hours
to get the iphone 4 I talked to this guy
that was trying to convince me to
jailbreak the iPhone 4 and I I was
throwing everything at him i was like
what if i want to have a screen just of
widgets what if i want to have my missed
call on the lock screen and to
everything i wanted to do he said yes
and when i got home and i jailbroke what
he said was true you can literally
change everything about the iphone the
big problem is that these changes
dramatically after a while of installing
lots of different things impact
stability and performance not only that
but you have to update the tweaks which
sometimes aren't done very often and so
you'll get like a homescreen tweak that
isn't updated in six months because the
developer made it put it out there and
then didn't support it so i think that
there's an issue with the vibrancy of
the development community for for Apple
devices although to be fair I mean
there's you know there's enough of a
jail breaking community that it supports
an entire on App Store and for a while
it supported to app stores and so they
all merged are you talking about cydia
uh-huh and then I forget the name of the
other one mmm bonus points if anyone can
think of it without looking it up um I'm
gonna look it up mm-hmm let's see I've
got my jailbroken iPhone here is it
called rock I think Drock yeah it's good
call yeah very good all right well that
is interesting to sort of figure out and
understand the perceptions behind this
is like class all right let's move on
all right so now we're talking about the
HTC Sensation previously known as the
pyramid it feels like this thing has
been out forever but it was just it was
just in the past week that it was
announced at an HTC press event in the
UK a lot of other announcements with it
t-mobile will be get
the sensation 4g which we're going to
talk about its kind of big news the
sensation is what we thought it was
going to be dual core snapdragon 1.2
gigahertz CPU running on android 2.3
it's got 768 megabytes of ram it's got
the the qhd screen making it HTC second
device to go beyond wbj the first was
the evo 4g or not the evo 4g the evo 3d
and we're also getting a new version of
sense finally a dramatically different
version of sense for a while for the
last year all the way back from probably
the desire HD era where there was also
the legend and the evo and the
Thunderbolt all have the same version of
sets version 2 point 0 0 or 2.1 finally
we're jumping to three-point oh there's
a lot of cool stuff with sense
three-point oh it allows you to launch
apps from your lockscreen it gives you
weather on your lock screen if you want
it or the time or stock quotes it
features a new email application it has
new widgets really nice-looking and of
course it has HTC watch which is HTC's
attempt to do their own sort of video
store that live yet i don't i don't
think it's live i think it comes out
with the flyer and the flyer has is
going to be released when when they say
mid-may so didn't we also see that
there's um it looks like they might have
a couple of other stores in the works
what was it we saw HTC read an HTC aria
yeah listen and read so they H TC filed
a patent app or not patent trademark
application for HTC read in HTC listen
which presumably means that they're
going to come out with their own ebook
store and music store and this is a very
good strategic move for them because if
they can make a profitable music video
and ebook store bundle it with all of
their devices that can be very very
profitable for them so you think they're
kind of butting heads with carriers
there though I mean you know like
especially verizon has
invested quite a bit and it's V CAST and
I don't know how it would feel about HTC
coming in and you know preloading a
competitive marketplace well if verizon
continues pushing v cask which would
make sense because it's been around for
like a decade they could have HTC scale
back some of the features they did this
with the Thunderbolt the Thunderbolt
doesn't have HTC's remote management HTC
Sense comm service it uses verizon's you
know remote management service so mmm so
annoyingly almost HTC will have to you
know customize their devices and and and
you know be subject to the demands of
Verizon Sprint t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T when
they roll out their devices but yeah so
in the u.s. we are going to see the
sensation as the sensation 4g on
t-mobile it'll basically be a and an EVO
3d but without the 3d screen it'll be a
little bit thinner is this a huge win
for t-mobile yeah i think absolutely it
is i mean this is a hot phone you know
any way you look at it and and of course
it can take advantage of the 4g hspa+
speeds yeah and it's interesting because
usually you know the u.s. lags behind
and getting these high-end devices from
HTC now here's two in a row that that
the u.s. is either getting first you
know as as with the evo 3d or you know
probably simultaneous to to a European
and Asian launch in the in the sensation
why do you think we've seen that shift I
mean just a few years ago it used to be
Europe got the devices first and
literally one year after even even as
recent as the inspire 4G the desire HD
was released year before that why is it
all of a sudden we're seeing releases in
the u.s. first I think that the the
market here has matured to the point
where I'm you know we've now it I you
know enough people were that are they're
interested in smartphones are you know
on their first second and you know in
some cases their 10 smartphone now
that's a bit of an exaggeration I'm on
my channel your beat you're well beyond
your tents dude um so yeah I think and
who was it who just said was that the
think it was the CEO of sony ericsson
who said you know the west coast of the
u.s. is now is now the the center of the
the smartphone industry you know now
that's where it's at Tony are you are
you upset about this you guys always got
the cool stuff well no I try to look at
it as as objective as I can and the of
course the US market is one of the
biggest markets when it comes to
smartphones and one of the biggest
markets has one of the biggest markets
with competition and don't forget that
Motorola is very strong in the US and
it's not that strong in Europe and I
always expect big players to fight on a
huge market rather than on a let's say
European market which is divided into
several smaller markets because the
reality in Germany might differ from
that in France Spain Italy especially UK
Canada USA and Australia are some
outside and the devices are trying
manufacturers are trying to launch them
at the same time on these markets
because these markets are of course
targeted by everybody and the sooner you
get to that market you had the edge yeah
well what's what's interesting is to
look back and remember that one of the
reasons Europe got devices first was
because there was standardization almost
from the beginning I might be wrong
about this but don't all countries in
Europe operate off of similar cell phone
frequencies yeah you're right but not
all countries and not let's take two
separate and different countries let's
stake Germany and let's take Romania we
have the same operator I mean we have
several others but we have the same
operator let's see Vodafone in Germany
in the UK and in Romania the same
operator in Romania or in Germany or in
another country might bring the same
device later than in other countries
which wouldn't mean a Europe europe-wide
lunch for the same carrier for the same
device but
in the u.s. once you get to a carrier
it's a nationwide launch I say I say
that I think that although the the US
wireless market is a lot more fragmented
than Europe there's been a lot of
investment in network I mean the US was
was first with 4G as far as I know with
the wimax network on sprint first with
the LTE network so there's been an
acceleration towards faster data and and
the the OEMs really like that I mean
they want to put their phones on the
fastest networks possible and is there a
4G network in Europe Tony there is but
it's in the western part of Europe which
is more let's say trying to keep up with
countries like us and japan and those
countries which are trying to adopt
technology faster it is it LTE and no
i'm not sure it's LTE its 4G I know
there is 3.5 g and which is HSP plus i
believe but and then i'm not sure about
ltd rushes have wimax for some time I
know remember the I'm the maximal t he
had yeah Matt they were actually first
that was HTC's first 4g phone banking
2005 we were so jealous but why were you
saying Brandon that that the the US
market is more fragmented than Europe
well I mean because if a company wants
to release a phone they've got to choose
between you know for different companies
all which utilize for different types of
spectrum and in Europe they could build
really the same phone right and put it
on vodafone or you know orange and
really not have to reconfigure the
device that much besides branding and
built-in applications from the carrier
yes that's right but there are only a
couple of carriers in Europe which are
present in most countries besides those
there are several other local national
carriers which which also can be part of
the game so I think Europe wise we have
lots more carriers than in the US ah so
perhaps it's it's even more fragmented
in Europe
look at it that way but I'll make a
point brand and it there might be more
carriers but there you know basically
using the same bandwidth the same bands
while in the US you know we have to gsm
carriers that use different 3g spectrum
and then to cdma carriers who's who's um
handsets and devices are not
interoperable yeah well uh there should
be a world carrier world cell right you
know we could all just have the same
devices at the same time imagine the
turnover yeah but it would be a utopia
one more note about the the HTC
Sensation I I'm very much concerned with
weight and thickness but fortunately the
sensation is actually thinner and
lighter than the desire HD by a little
bit and that's kind of a big deal
because the desire HD the inspire 4G is
a thin device if you stack it next to
even an EVO 4G or a thunderbolt it's
it's pretty razor thin so the sensations
going to be a stunner um in terms of you
know feature set feel in hand capability
we just need some Android to take
advantage of multiple cores a little bit
better and then we've got and we've got
a conversation to have do any of you
guys have that same feeling I had that
HTC devices are boring nowadays I mean
of course there's a company signature
when it comes to everything even cars or
all bmws will will have that signature
but take HTC for instance the new
devices all looked the same I have the
impression they have a wooden box and
they try to draw them and make them fit
in that box it's dull I find them to be
the same design same button layout same
speaker grill and they are playing just
a little bit with the thickness and the
radios and so on obviously you haven't
seen the cha-cha D'Antoni yeah
cha-cha-cha-cha with it natasha is it
yeah you're totally right they do have
the same design but then i'm sure they
they do it you know a little bit to save
costs to keep
development there they're psycho kind of
short because if they went back to the
drawing board i made an all-new carbon
fiber phone that was you know two
millimeters thin that would take six
months and they can't afford to take
their time in rolling out devices so
they iterate and they iterate and they
iterate and eventually they're going to
have to sort of break away from the same
form factor that they've had since I
mean you can even see similarities
between devices of HD see you today and
like the touch HD of two thousand four
or five yeah mm-hmm I mean maybe they
honestly think that what you know what
they've got going is is the best you
know in each of the aspects of the phone
you know the speaker grill they finally
gotten it perfect the body style they
think you know it's the most arrogant
you know the screen is the perfect size
so you name you know from from their
perspective they they may be making the
the absolute best phone and secondarily
they might be thinking that they're
making the best phone and compared to
what else is out there they have no
reason to change the hardware I mean no
one else is innovating no one's being
the catalyst in changing you know the
iphone really really pushed the bar a
little bit with with glass and metal
construction a lot thinner but HTC is
doing metal construction now they have
glass screens their devices are thin so
we're really waiting for the next era I
guess of hardware design whatever
company decides to be the catalyst for
that but for now you know there's
there's almost no reason for HTC to to
do anything anything big they they have
a formula that works and kidding
competitively they've got a good product
yeah which wasn't you know which wasn't
so true even a couple months ago we were
saying that you know they were kind of
falling behind what you know what you
know LG was doing certainly what Samsung
was doing right right cool all right
well let's move on we're going to talk
about the skype for the HTC Thunderbolt
which we showed on video if you remember
the early Thunderbolt commercials you
might have seen this guy sitting on a
park bench chatting with with his with
the video camera in the front and
looks kind of like a native video chat
solution there weren't many you know
status bars on the screen or buttons to
press it looked really clean well that
was actually skype and skype video chat
did not launch with the Thunderbolt but
it's been leaked in sort of a beta form
it only really works on the Thunderbolt
it's been tested on other devices and it
works pretty well but the problem is
that it's not an actual native solution
still standalone app you can't get to it
from the dialer like you can with Apple
FaceTime you guys think that will ever
see Android with a native FaceTime like
a chat solution or do you think that
there are too many models too many
software versions too many OEMs too many
carriers to even begin to do this yes
and no and this depends depends on the
market them as we've been spoken we've
been speaking before about this it all
comes down whether carriers or a
specific market is n2 video calling
whether you call it skype facetime or
standard video calling it's not the same
in Europe like it is in the u.s. so
every market has its own specific we've
had video calling here standard / / gsm
in europe since years now and people
don't seem to use that maybe because of
the rates may be because they they don't
find it useful and for me as an end user
it's the same thing whether i use skype
for video facetime or regular video
calling it all comes down to whether i
want to use that feature whether i want
the other person to see my face or I
want them to see or I want myself to see
their face so I think the question is
whether verizon really wanted the skype
to be part of the phone or they did not
it's I think it comes down to to the
market that I said yeah I think it also
comes down to as you implied well on
these on the topic of whether video chat
matters it could it could be the best
video chat solution in the world of the
best frame rates it could have the most
stellar integration with the native f
dialing application at the end of the
day most
people aren't going to use video chat
because they don't want you to see their
face or to see what they're doing or
where they are at random moments in time
it's a very top we've talked about this
a lot but it's a very specific use case
scenario of when video chat matters like
when your kids taking his or her first
step and you want to show your husband
or wife that's that's one example or you
want to pick out a new shirt and you
want to ask your husband or wife or
girlfriend boyfriend whatever how does
this shirt look you know we still love
me if I get well that you can always
take a picture or or shoot a short video
send an mms put it to twitter to your
Facebook I mean um calling somebody and
the actual calling screen which asks you
to answer with video or without video
puts that certain amount of stress for
the party which is receiving the call
why does he or she want to see me in
video oh my god how is my hair look what
am I wearing and and that's I think it's
unnatural and you only have like what 10
seconds to decide or to put pants on
absolutely and if you answer only but
with voice then you are in an awkward
situation why did you decline my video
call do you have something to hide and I
think it's it all comes down to people
it's that so funny you mention that I've
done this before when I first got the
iphone 4 I would call my friend my
friend Mason he got an iphone 4 as well
and I was so excited about this facetime
thing and I would you know I would put
my pants on because I always operate
with my pants off and I would you know
good brush my hair put on a nice shirt I
don't know why I did all this and then I
would FaceTime chat him and he wouldn't
answer with video well probably because
he was in his pjs or he just didn't want
me to see Anna I felt for a second I
know it sounds kind of trite but I felt
almost insulted that he didn't answer
with video yeah so so from that there on
out I decided you know maybe maybe text
messages and and phone calls are just
the best way to communicate for now
absolutely very good well that is skype
and the Thunderbolt it's kind of
annoying I heard a video or not a video
a radio ad two days ago about the
Thunderbolt and they mention this video
chat but come on guys video chat doesn't
exist for the Thunderbolt right now stop
airing this
Heisman it's making people maybe they
know something maybe it is yeah maybe
they know something and it's coming very
soon huh well if it were up to you they
would they would have to stop calling
the atrix and the inspire 4g 4g devices
I'm so glad I'm so glad you brought that
up hey Mel here comes I sent out a tweet
I just what I just want to check in at
once every six weeks with the world to
see if this problem still exists I sent
out a tweet nice I asked anyone on our
twitter is getting their promised 4G
speeds on their Atrix 4G or their
inspire 4G and I'll clean up their
responses right now due to do where we
carry mentions okay scrolling down let's
see this was from yesterday actually and
the responses were the same that they
were six weeks ago six weeks before that
that they are getting basically worse
than 3G speeds so they'll get burst 2 3
megabits per second down maybe two but
they're upload speeds of course without
hsupa are still like 200 k and so mmm to
not go off on a rant that the problem
still exists there is still no 18t 4G
network after how long has the inspired
by now that was the first one let's see
februari for three months three months
three months it's appalling really is
and and you know they could they could
solve the problem temporarily by
releasing this hsupa fix so at least we
can have our upload speeds back but
anyway let's move okay so talky there's
a lot to talk about for windows phone
seven this week which is which is great
because there seems to be a lot more
Android news than there is a windows
phone 7 yeah this is the first you know
real windows phone 7 news we've heard
since since the launch I would say or
you know since the the devices start
going on Sally mean Microsoft was kind
of absent at both CES I shouldn't say
both at CES mwc and ctia we hardly saw
anything
windows phone 7 related yeah yeah I mean
six months later they they're talking
more about it a lot to talk about
actually we've got four or five things
to talk about but first thing I'm going
to talk about is applications so back
when I was reviewing the the Samsung
Focus I had a good time with it was a
good phone of course it was missing some
very key features like fast app
switching you know a better way to jump
to an application in the Start screen
which they're fixing in mango we're
going to talk about that in a minute but
also very important is applications does
the platform have the basic apps that
you or me or whomever uses on a daily
basis at the time the answer was no
there was no angry birds which you know
everyone of course plays obsessively
there was no skype there was no amazon
there was no kindle there's no new york
times but that is starting to change
naturally i mean over time this is going
to get better and better and it was
announced that angry birds and skype are
coming to Windows Phone 7 so those are
very strong applications that that you
know a lot of people have been holding
out for but it's almost symbolic that
this is happening that these companies
are devoting their resources you know
Skype is doing in rovio for for Angry
Birds they're devoting the resources for
windows phone 7 which is basically their
endorsement of the platform um gee isn't
though I mean I mean we know that that
Microsoft certainly isn't shy about
throwing money around when when it sees
a problem and you know it it essentially
had to to bribe nokia into to coming
over into its 10 and you know who knows
if that's not the case with some of
these big software men or developers as
well that might have been true although
if i'm not saying it is i'm just saying
it's possible it's possible although if
you were Microsoft and you wanted to
have skype on your platform from day one
wouldn't you pay to have it on day one a
major app like skype I think Microsoft
almost bit off more than I could chew
with the windows phone 7 launch and and
you know literally it didn't have the
time or the resources to get everything
done though that it wanted to so you
know it just may not have had people to
to go out and coordinate with the you
know team skype or two
Rovio and I mean it you know they did
have a lot of of apps that people were
looking for on liked window thanks
netflix i think was a big you know
launch app for them and yeah I don't
think because they weren't there at at
launch that precludes the fact that that
Microsoft um you know what you know
who's pulling some strings but it's also
totally possible that that that these
companies do do see some success in the
platform and and see it having you know
it lacks enough of a future yeah i will
say that that rovio is one company
that's very concerned with the security
of marketplace which is why you know
they're they they gave on the amazon
appstore and exclusive on angry birds
rio at launch um because they know you
know amazon is going to have a
definitely a secure environment for for
transactions and and microsoft with the
windows marketplace is going to be the
same way right yeah very very compelling
stuff so that's you know rovio is very
selective and they want to make sure
their apps aren't pirated so hopefully
this is an indication that the windows
phone seven marketplaces is secure and
it's got the features and the delivery
and the you know the offering that
company like Rovio is made millions and
millions of dollars off of their
products there if they're finally
satisfied with that moving on about
Windows Phone 7 so we've got mango
coming out which is the big update to
Windows Phone 7 probably windows phone
7.5 if you want to call it and we knew
that it brought you know two or three
major things fast app switching by
holding the back button on the hardware
to ie9 to bring better browser
performance and what was the third thing
before we heard about the new stuff you
guys remember Twitter integration I
think in the People Hub yes Twitter
integration of the people up but
then Joe Belfiore a came on stage and
whipped out a can of like ten more
things that mango will do and we were
very happy about this I'm going to go
over some of them now quickly and then
we're going to kind of discuss whether
this is enough and I'm going to point
tonal heaven towards an article in the
skype chat while I do that so fast at
management or faster at management so
one of the problems with Windows Phone 7
is that if you go to the program list
you get an endlessly long list of
programs and if you've got 40 apps this
is a big pain in the pain in the butt so
now you can press a letter like you do
on the zune HD or you can hit the search
button and be taken immediately to the
app another thing that they've refined
in mango is new marketplace search
results so right now if you search for
something in the marketplace you're
searching for a song or a nap it jumbles
it all together which is kind of
ridiculous but in mango it's kind of
segmented in the pivot list speaking of
the marketplace the app screens are
updated to be more user friendly now
when you have a free app the button
doesn't say purchase which makes no
sense it should just say install Bing
results the built-in Bing application
has been improved the browser has been
improved even more it supports
background html5 audio streaming so if
you've got for example Pandora and the
browser streaming html5 audio you can
leave the browser stop the music clay
also there is the address bar on the
bottom in in landscape a couple more
things live tile improvements so now
there's more versatility and how
developers can take advantage of live
tiles and live tiles actually can work
sort of within application so the
scenario they gave is a qantas airlines
application and you've got little tiles
inside the app different flights you can
tap and hold on a tile that represents a
flight and put it on your Start screen
of course we've got custom ringtones
which is always nice to have and
system-wide performance enhancements
mango uses thirty percent less rampur
app faster app launch times better
physics for scrolling
and more so a lot of improvements for
mango are you guys satisfied with with
this or do you think that there are
still a lot of things left out well
there are a lot of improvements in mango
but from the typical end user point of
view how many of these are major I mean
okay fast app switching major
system-wide performance enhancements
major ie9 major but but the rest
marketplace search results updated app
screen and marketplace and all the other
bing search results are not something
huge are not how should I say not
breaking and shattering your world are
just some features which are added and
most of the people out there would say
that these features would probably
should have been at launch at the Manor
come on copy and paste we've waited six
months for that we will wait another
additional six months for fast app
switching and we got fast at switching
one year after the windows phone 7
platform was launched I'm happy to see
Microsoft is committed to constantly
improve the ecosystem the platform but
there are some things which I think are
overly marketed of course major features
one two or three it's okay to have a
refresh every six months but over
marketing um I don't know a search
button in the application list over
marketing a improvement in the bing
search results is I think it's overrated
what the users want to see is huge
features added constantly and the if
possible they wanted they wanted them to
be added at launch if possible I don't
think it does it make sense what I'm
saying it does and I just want to chime
in for a second i think users also by
the way I should preface this by saying
if you look at these new features guess
what they are they are catch up none of
these features are our innovative
absolutely compared to the other other
offerings out there I think people want
to see some badass features that we
we as mere consumers cannot think about
we want to see apple style things
meaning you know Apple seems to be able
to anticipate what we need before we
need it which is always a fascinating
prospect but all of these things de
mango they're very much necessary
they're great but they're they're just
bringing the platform to where it should
have been or should be today what do you
do you guys think that it would have
made a huge difference if Microsoft
would have waited with the launch and
the may be launched with mango I think
that would killed them yeah they they
already launched you know eight months
too late yeah so then what what they do
now it's normal yeah I mean I think what
they did and was very clear as they just
got it out and I'm sure there were
conversations in Microsoft HQ when they
said we need copy and paste and then
some guy was like all right that'll take
two more months and the guy in the front
of the room said all right forget it
let's just get it out we'll get the
updates out later let's get the traction
and we'll figure out the other stuff in
the future and that's what they're doing
I mean how's different the market now in
April than what it was in in October or
November we still have google android
and the apple iOS and the top one or two
step two spots and windows phone 7 is
still playing catch-up to achieve those
two digits market share I think it would
have been clever to wait a little bit
more maybe launch in February with all
the features in it so that it wouldn't a
lien ate all those users which put their
soul to it I mean coming from windows
mobile I came from windows mobile and I
was highly anticipating windows phone 7
for me copy and paste was not feature I
never used it it's okay to have it but
fast that switching is something huge I
don't have to always get back to the
start screen to select another
application go back and forth and back
and forth I think my personal opinion is
that they should have waited a little
bit more to launch with a little bit
more yeah yeah I think a lot of people
agree with that and you could also argue
that
would have been the the nail on the
coffin so that's always an interesting
conversation to have real quick want to
just chime in and say what we aren't
seeing in mail or at least what we don't
think we are going to see in mango
certainly they could come out with these
features but there's a list of nine we
have here first of all Wi-Fi and USB
tethering come on come on I mean that's
that's almost a right for absolute
here's there might be just just a second
excuse me can I be the attorney rukna
right now we've waited how long for
Wi-Fi tethering on Apple devices we just
got a 4.3 so I'm gonna be the attorney
now was the prosecutor five minutes
before and I'm gonna defend Microsoft on
this now all right that's fair that's
fair but the problem is that if if mango
were to launch in February this last
februari and it didn't have Wi-Fi and
USB tethering you'll be fine because
people would say well I phone doesn't
have it so but the fact that mango is
coming out in late 2011 or 2012 it makes
it that it makes the platform look worse
ok number to a screen capture come on
come on come on the gray skirt to do
screen captures on windows phone 7 is is
very difficult you've got to download
the developer tools and blah blah flash
support in the browser which you know
button some people don't care about
that's not Microsoft though as much as
it is Adobe right yep well couldn't
Microsoft work with Adobe get a get a
piece of software to get it to go I'm
not sure they want them to because
silver light is coming ie9 is coming and
Silverlight is a strong competitor for
adobe flash I'm not sure that Microsoft
wants to have flash support on windows
phone 7 so this again is my personal
opinion yeah that's that's a good point
um that's I think that's a that's a bad
attitude for them to have then because I
mean you know what you know most sites
are still using flash not Silverlight
and they're not going to be moving over
to silverlight they'll be moving over to
html5 of anything right oh yeah i mean
silver lights almost as bad as as flash
in that respect that it's a last
web technology and the world's going to
html5 so yes but Microsoft can tell you
that we no longer or we don't intend to
support adobe flash we are moving on to
the next gen we will support html5 with
ie9 and we already are one step ahead
we're just waiting for the others to
catch up then I'll go out and buy an
android that does support flash I mean
flash is important to people and it's a
big selling point you know ladies like
very playbook it's it's one of their
bullet points it's one of the bullet
points of the zoom and for good reason
because it's annoying when you can't
when you don't have flash I mean you're
not getting the full web on on these
devices yeah hmm yeah so other things
that aren't in mango no support for
front-facing cameras and video chat no
turn-by-turn text-to-speech navigation
with offline support like Android
devices now have no support for
third-party keyboards no landscape
support for the Start screen no sharing
options for video and smart dial you
know you go into the dialer and you want
to call Evan well on an android phone
but I just turned off my monitor that
wasn't cool on an Android you type you
know 3826 is that you told everyone my
phone number down cause I was similar
spelling it out your name so unless they
have evident in the phone book it won't
work smart duh I mean some of these very
base they're still very basic like USB
tethering screen capture and smart dial
come on is that really going to take
that long to include so mango looks good
although perhaps not as good as it
should look and hopefully we have more
surprises and hopefully more most
importantly we'll see this in 2011 and
not 2012 boom yep very good alright so
next thing we want to talk about more
windows phone 7 the chassis to specs
were announced and of course the chassis
wang specs are really define all of the
specification are the specifications for
the current crop of windows phones and
devices so you've got the you know 800 x
480 display you've got the one gigahertz
processor 5 megapixel camera so on and
so forth
microsoft sewing kind of going in the
opposite direction with chassis to they
want to support lower end devices at
lower price points so so let's see
what's the difference here you can do an
800 megahertz processor screen
resolution is the same what else has
changed in the chassis tooth I think
everything's the same we have a low nut
not specifically lower and processor
because the processor on the desire z is
another category of processors it
doesn't drain battery that much and it
still got the speed edge so it's it's a
fast processor and windows phone 7 is a
fast platform so I'm not sure we're
losing anything here and we've got the
gyroscope and besides these it's nothing
I don't think anything else has been
changed from from chassis 122 yeah they
couldn't lower the ram requirements
anymore 256 yeah I was somehow expecting
they could lower the the resolution of
the screen because we've been hearing
about half VGA and it's been there in
the documentation even before Windows
Phone 7 came out and that would have
made a statement for lower end devices I
mean like you take with the android HTC
Wildfire imagine a small device price
oriented may be made my nokia and boom
you got a top top seller blockbuster but
no they just uh maybe shook hands with
the Qualcomm and they said okay still
your company still your CPU but we'll
use the newer one hmm yeah I mean this
is a this this whole situation is pretty
pretty basic economics you know you
lower price you increase demand but I
think this is a little bit detrimental
to the image of Windows Phone 7 because
they're clearly trying to hit lower
price point so they sell more devices
but at the same time it looks like
they're taking a step backwards I mean
the average user who doesn't understand
why they're doing this might say wow
shouldn't they be going in the opposite
direction and requiring faster hardware
higher resolution screens so it's almost
inconvenient that Microsoft have had to
publicize this you know well as I said
it's not necessarily a step back you
have to understand that the processor is
still fast you have to understand that
the GPU which is accompanying the new
Snapdragon is the 205 GPU and it's
faster than 200 the GPU which is on the
current cpu so um I'm not sure it's a
step back I think it's half a step
forward hmm well intuitively it might be
other in the eyes of the you know
average consumer doesn't get caught up
with with aspects of phones it might
look like a step back yeah very good
well let's move on yet more windows
phone 7 news this week whoa yeah we're
just going to keep going here um the HTC
maza maza mm is that my Seng right uh
was it was leaked on XDA and it looks to
be a device heading towards sprint it
kind of looks like a trophy it's a slab
style device it looks a lot like a
trophy did you see I mean that the the
camera and speaker designed on the back
it's almost identical so so there you go
the trophy for for sprint and then a
little exclusive for us we came across
what could be a 16 megapixel windows
phone 7 device we found an advertisement
it shows in the advertisement they show
a device that kind of looks like the
desire s but running Windows Phone 7 it
could be a placeholder but it kind of
makes sense a little bit that HTC would
do a 16 megapixel windows phone 7
Windows Phone 7 at some of the best
camera features out there you can launch
the camera by tapping and holding the
camera button when it's off the shutter
speed is usually very fast on these
devices it's very easy to review
pictures so it would make sense that HTC
would do a digital photography focused
camera sure I think it definitely makes
sense for all parties involved um and I
think one of the things that that's sort
of been ignored by a lot of people are
you know
are chiming in to say well megapixels
don't matter you know the camera is
going to suck because you know the
optics are going to be poor but we don't
know that we don't know anything about
the optics what kind of lens they're
going to put on it or you know how big
the sensor is there anything so I would
think that it that if HTC is coming out
with the world's first 16 megapixel
phone and you know they're they're
making a big to-do about it that they're
they're gonna make sure it takes a good
picture yeah they're they're probably
going to invest in it in the camera
technology and sort of break that trend
where people think okay if I've got an 8
megapixel camera yeah it takes bigger
pictures but the pictures are grainy and
they're soft when you blow it up the
number 16 is is significant because
right now the highest that is out there
really is 8 megapixels so they're gonna
double that it'll highest from them I
mean yeah you've got that you've got 12
megapixels from the n8 and then you've
got 14 from the Altech leo yeah yeah so
so what's up it's a good brown number
for them and that would be cool that
would be a way to differentiate not only
HTC from the pack and do something
different but Windows Phone 7 i'm sure
microsoft would be excited for that i
personally would settle for a 5
megapixel camera that would take better
pictures than the iphone and i will be
happy ecstatic the iphone does take a
pretty darn good pictures you guys agree
yeah yep I actually use the I promotion
what's that none of these no no camera
phones or have really been good at
capturing you know any motion it's you
know all still shots anything with
motions going to come out blurry because
you know they just um they can't the
shutters on a fast amount um you mean
when you take HD video on the iphone not
video when you're trying to take a
picture of someone moving oh yeah yeah
the shutter speeds it's not fast enough
you're right so maybe maybe this HTC
device will be the you know the first
one to have a like a super fast mode
actually the sensation claims to be able
to do what you're describing Evan
what you see on the screen is exactly
the picture you're going to take there's
no like shutter lag well the nice thing
about having such high megapixels is
that you can you can set these phones on
burst mode and I want you know it'll
it'll bring the resolution down
significantly but point if you have a 16
megapixel camera it's really not going
to matter if it you know even if it's
have door quartered you know a 4
megapixels and burst modes gonna going
to be um you know give you a fine result
most the time indeed indeed alright well
let us move on to the final bit for
today um it's it's almost getting kind
of annoying to talk about the white
iphone 4 but the white iphone 4
according to Apple I think it was a
tweet from phil schiller a vice
president of worldwide product marketing
for Apple I said yes there will be an
iphone 4 and white is spring a full year
after it was originally promised but
this is kind of strange because the
iphone 5 should be due out in the summer
if we ignore the rumors of of delay and
so does this mean that the this
confirmed was that the iphone five will
be delayed no i think maybe it says
though that the iphone 5 won't come in
white so now it's like if you want a
white phone you're gonna have to go with
the floor and you know they're going to
sell some of that some of that stock
that they've built up yeah well they
probably have a massive stock and
they're probably all running very old
firmware but it doesn't really matter
because i think when you connect your
iphone to itunes for the first time they
don't check those audio that we didn't
wait for this thing you know like so you
know for a lot of people it was like
should i get the the black one now or
should I wait a month you know for the
white one and it turned out it wasn't a
month it with many months indeed doesn't
matter the wise iphone coming up now I
mean would anyone buy it well I'm not
gonna run to trade in mind or sell it or
anything I mean it it's it's almost
disingenuous to my
of the iphone at such a late period in
time to say okay I'm gonna go get the
white one because I'm just going to wait
for the five you know I don't know you
know there's a father you know that your
iPad and your iPhone don't match yeah
I've got the pipe okay actually I are
saying what you think a little bit well
you can always do a paint job Allah Adam
Lane yeah I could just you know I just
paint it although there there was that
service that sent you the faceplates or
you sent your phone and that was really
believable and it was actually pretty
much the same as a white iphone oh yeah
there's ways to do it I mean they
definitely saw the parts hmm I want a
green iphone or like a blue cool well I
think that will conclude the 11th
episode of the pocket now pocket casts
podcast thank you gents for joining and
thank you everyone who who s supports us
and listens each week and we'll see you
