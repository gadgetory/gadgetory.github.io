and today i've got another treat for you
it's overclocking your Android power
phone and setting up custom profiles so
that you're not going to run your
battery all the way dry let's go take a
look okay so routing your phone is
what's going to start this whole process
so if you haven't done that make sure
you head over to pocketnow.com use our
search feature to find out how to root
even if it's just a temp root on your
Android powered phone because you've got
to have that level of permissions so
let's go back and talk just for a minute
what is root well root is a permissions
level it's actually a user that has
complete and total access to everything
on a UNIX or Linux powered device well
since Android is pretty much a Linux
device you have a root user well to be
able to use that root users permissions
you've got to root your phone so that's
why you've got to go and do that now
once you've done that you can do some
cool stuff like installing custom roms
custom roms usually have custom kernels
custom ROM we talked about in our last
video so go back to watch that if you
haven't if you haven't seen that or if
you don't know what a custom ROM is but
a custom kernel what's a kernel well
it's not like the kernel it's in the
military a colonel in it's not like
colonel you know like in a popcorn but
the kernel in Android is it's the core
of everything think of it as everything
you need to run your phone all bundled
up in one really small little app if you
will even though it's not really an app
but you kind of get the point there so
what you do is you put all these drivers
all these instructions all these you
know the ability to get to the web
network stacks file systems the whole
thing you bundle it up in the kernel and
they're specific for each device so a1
kernel for say the g2 is going to be
different than say the Nexus One or the
galaxy s so it's very very important
that you have the right colonel well
these kernels from the manufacturer are
hard-coded to run the device at a
particular speed so you can't overclock
them because it's hard coded into the
kernel unless somebody gets their hands
on say an open-source kernel which all
these manufacturers are releasing their
kernels into
the open source so adventurous
developers can take them open them up
find out how they can plug in custom
settings and it's not just about speed
it's about voltages it's about
frequencies it's it's all kinds of stuff
and once you have these custom kernels
pursuits is a good example you can do
all kinds of cool stuff with them so
there's your background what cool stuff
can you do with these custom kernels
today we're going to talk about
overclocking so now that you've got all
the prerequisites out of the way let's
go ahead and take a look at what you can
do with this really really cool app all
right so the app that we're going to use
unlock all this overclocking potential
is called a set CPU for root users this
is its icon we'll go ahead and open that
up and the first thing you see is not
what you're seeing here it will actually
go out and figure out what kind of
device you're using and it will load up
a custom profile so it's not going to
overclock beyond what the kernel is
capable of and hopefully whoever wrote
that kernel knows what the device is
capable of so let's take a look you can
see this number up here it's jumping all
around it's going all the way from 245
all the way up to 14 ninety-five now
what are those that's megahertz okay
really easy this is a t-mobile g2 and
the t-mobile g2 is an 800 megahertz
phone so how on earth am I getting 1497
well running CyanogenMod I'm running a
customised kernel that allows for some
overclocking
now this overclocking max is set up so
it only goes to two just shy of 1.5
gigahertz that's real close to twice the
original speed of the device so you want
your phone to go faster no problem
you've got sliders let me show you there
you go you've got a 240 five megahertz
phone that's as fast as it's ever go I'm
gonna go and you're stuck there but your
battery life is going to be amazing you
probably don't want that dodea
this video is not about battery life
it's about performance so let's look at
what else you can do let's jump up and
let's say you know 800 megahertz is 20
fast for you so we'll try and land this
right around there and these sliders are
a little bit hard to get to but now you
can see I've set my max to 806 mega
so just a little bit faster than normal
but my minimum is 245 so now I'm going
to have the same level of performance
for the most part as I do on a stock
phone but I'm going to get better
battery life because you can see right
now my phone is not doing anything but
idle so it scales all the way down to
245 when it needs the speed it scales up
to 806 well carry that same metaphor
forward and now when my phone needs it
it's going to go all the way up to 1497
megahertz and when it doesn't it's going
to scale back to 245 so that's kind of
how you balance your battery in your
performance when you do this teamed up
with another little trick which will
come later later in the video I'll show
you basically you don't have any
negative impact on your battery life and
put a big fat Astra's after that and
we'll come back to that too so that's
the two sliders minimum maximum I always
have mine set to the minimum because you
know if my phone doesn't need the power
let it run all the way down to the
bottom that's fine if you want pure
performance set the minimum and the
maximum to the same run your benchmarks
your phone is going to fly but again
battery power it's going to need to
gobble a lot more to run it that faster
speed all the time scaling is the next
thing how do you want to scale this well
because there's a difference between the
minimum maximum we have to go between
the two somehow and there are these
different presets that we can use the
interactive conservative userspace
Power Save on demand and performance
these are called Governors and I really
don't know exactly what each one of them
is doing and in fact they kind of they
kind of seem not to do what you think
for example if I set this to a
performance for some reason my benchmark
scores are lower than if I set it to
on-demand I don't know just kind of
weird but it's just a different way to
scale between those two speeds Power
Save seems like it would be a little bit
more conservative in save use of power
so just playing around with those use
what works best on your device it's
going to vary device to device so let's
go ahead and keep looking I've got this
set to run on boot if you have a temp
rooted phone as long as you are temp
rooting when your phone boots then you
know you've got temporary
then this loads up and you can then get
all your overclocking fun out of it so
kind of cool you're going to probably be
limited because if you're tempering your
phone you're still using the stock
kernel and your stock kernel has a very
very narrow window of what it can
actually do as far as voltages and
frequencies and speeds and whatnot so
just bear that in mind that's really
cool now you want to see how well this
does your done all you got to do is go
back run quadrant see what your
benchmarks are come over here to info
and you can do some benchmarks short
bench says that this bench is at 223
milliseconds shorter is better long
benchmark says that it's running at 289
milliseconds again lower is faster so
you can compare these numbers to what
you get on another device and see you
know how yours
performs run a native bench and there's
a whole bunch of numbers that I don't
know what they mean but you know lowers
faster so there you go this by the way
is not affected by the the JIT compiler
or other vm optimizations so right there
so if you're running say a Galaxy S
phone that still doesn't have Android
Froyo or 2.2 I know some of them are
starting to get them but a lot of times
you know you guys are complaining hey
quadrant isn't fair because you know
you're comparing an Android 2.2 device
against an Android 2.1 device and that's
why we have benchmarked but the main
difference in speed there was because of
this JIT and VM it could actually run
faster because of the optimizations that
Froyo made over Eclair and well that was
a big chunk of the speed difference well
this bench even though it's not quite as
pretty as quadrant doesn't take those
into consideration it's agnostic to
whether that your your running JIT
or the the older styles of running the
apps but anyway we're getting too far
off on that one you can also do a stress
test I recommend doing this at least
once when you start out or whenever you
make some major changes this is as
exciting as it's going to get it's going
to sit here and run and run and run and
burn your battery as much as it can
stress out that CPU as much as it can
just to see if there are any problems
run it as long as you want
hit back you can see that I ran this for
a little while and there were no
when you overclock something that's
possible that you're going to run into
errors because your processor runs
hotter things are running through faster
the hotter something gets the faster
bits go through your CPU the more likely
it is to have errors so if you're
running a stress test and don't get any
errors you are golden you're good to go
so that's that now let's get into
advanced there are some settings I don't
mess with them if you want to go ahead
but I don't profiles this is really
where I want to spend some time and not
too much because this video is already
running a little bit long you can enable
and disable these profiles you can also
set it up to notify you I've enabled the
profiles set up a bunch of custom ones
and I turned my notifications off now
what are profiles and what do they do
well when I am charging my phone it's
plugged in I have set up a profile and
the way you do that is just tap on add
profile and set up the rules so going
through the first one if I am charging
or have a full battery then I want my my
battery murder excuse me my CPU to be
clocked maximum and this rule doesn't
reflect it I also want my minimum to be
maxed out so it's going to be running
full bore all the time and I really
don't care because it's plugged in it's
charging it's not costing me any battery
life I'm good to go and then I always
have my scaling set on demand leave the
priority alone and I save that well I've
already done that rule so we'll just hit
back to cancel it you can see right
there
140 or excuse me 1497 max 1497 min on
demand priority 50 while it's charging a
full awesome okay the next one I want to
show you is see if I can find it down
here I can't find it okay let's add it
so let's go in here and the condition is
screen off when my screen is off I'm not
doing anything with my phone it's
probably in my pocket so let's set the
speed all the way down to the bottom
minim max set to the same to 245 and the
scaling on demand priority 50 save that
there we go so now when we are screen
off I'm using the absolute least amount
of power to run my CPU as possible and
all of that is going to offset these
other rules so what are my other rules
well
the other rules are the default one
which is running all the time unless one
of those profiles is met so I'm using up
more power when I'm at 1497 but I'm
making that up a little bit because I'm
minimizing it down to 245 and I've got
these other rules set up for example
when the temperature gets above 50
degrees Celsius I want to make sure that
the max is 368 and the min is 245
basically what that's doing is it's
saying hey you know when the battery is
getting hot your or when the phone is
getting hot your you're working too hard
slow down and that will help protect it
if the battery is less than 25% I drop
it down to 768 and 2:45 if the battery
is less than 14% I run it at 368 max to
45 min if the temperature gets really
hot above 62 degrees Celsius I run that
the lowest possible amount and if the
battery is less than 10% I also run it
at the lowest amount so adding all those
up I get a big jump in performance and I
don't have any hit on my battery life in
fact if I wanted to extend my battery
life all I'd have to do is set that main
profile down to where it was running at
800 megahertz and scaling all the way
down to 245 or maybe you need a little
bit more performance up to you know 300
or 400 or whatnot
and that's fine so we said hey you want
overall consistent performance set the
minimum maximum the same so that it
doesn't scale between them if you want
to to maximize your battery life or
offset the additional power consumption
that's going to be running now you know
how to do that as well you know with
these profiles so really really kind of
cool stuff I really like this app I have
it on my phone my wife has it on her
phone there it is available in the
Android Market go ahead and download it
install it try it you do have to have
root permissions which we have talked
about previously in the video but it's
really nice that you can go ahead and
run all of these so how does that way
out well to hurry and fire up quadrant
here we'll run a full benchmark this
phone stock from t-mobile and HTC
benchmarks at 1600 points which is very
impressive
- some of the other phones out there now
the Nexus One not to be confused with
the Nexus S the Nexus One with Froyo
onic and benchmark all the way up to
2200 points right around that
neighborhood so that's a pretty
significant jump but it's because the
Nexus One is running at 1 gigahertz
whereas this is running at 800 megahertz
when you're running its stock
configuration so once we've done the
configurations that I've done I'm almost
running at a full battery what do we see
well running through all these frames
per second 58 yada yada yada I'm still
running at 1497 max but I'm scaling
between that and 245 so I do have a
little bit of lag to go between the 2
and my benchmark scores not going to be
quite as high as if I were running 1497
max both of them but there you go you
can see I've got some stuff running in
the background so my scores not
tremendous but 2146 and I've had this
all the way up to 2300 so that's that's
pretty impressive this time it was a
little bit lower because I got a gmail
notification in the background but still
1602 to 2146 that way out scores the
stock makes this one and it's just
amazing so one last thing to show you I
know this is jam-packed full of cool
stuff let's head into raw manager and
that's one of the things that I showed
you in a previous video let's come over
here to check for rum updates and what
there's an update to CyanogenMod today
six point one point one so I'll get that
a little bit later what I want to show
you however I didn't want to show you
ROM updates I wanted to show you which
one download ROM sorry about that
so over here you'll notice I've got
something called per shoot now what is
per shoot that doesn't make much sense
well pressure it is a dude and he's got
another ROM rather another kernel for
this ROM and what it is is it's an
overclocked under-voltage super
wonderful extra spiffy ROM that lets me
overclock even more past 1.5 gigahertz
so really cool I'm not going to show you
what that is today but if you want to
try it go ahead and do it Raw manager
lets you do it nice
and easy so really cool overclock your
phone without sacrificing battery life
using set CPU for root users is really
awesome give it a try and let me know
what your scores are before and after
and what profiles you think I need to
add to to my to my governors so leave
those in the comments down below give
this video a thumbs up if you like
seeing really really needy greedy stuff
like this and for pocket now I'm Joe
