this year given the Premium Package that
you get for the price of a mid range err
but ZT decided that it wouldn't be a bad
idea to actually launch a mid range er
anyway I'm hi meri behna with pocket now
when this is our review of the ZTE Exxon
seven mini for starters let's be clear
about the fact that many is not will
apply to this phone physically the axon
7 Mini is just 7 millimeters shorter
than the regular Exxon 7 visually it's
even hard to tell them apart given the
striking resemblance of both designs if
anything you'd have to look closely to
notice the different texture on the
front firing speakers and the fact that
the US version doesn't have capacitive
keys the feel in the hand is literally
the same which is to say great BMW
design works has come up with a
beautiful arc design that's free of
screws and interruptions and that feels
very premium in the hand the story is
more about internals instead of flagship
specifications we have a snapdragon 617
processor 3 gigs of ram and 32 gigs of
expandable storage dual-sim capabilities
are still here if you want to give up
over that expandable storage and the
batteries shrunk to 2705 milliamp hours
we have a 1080p M OLED display with
vibrant color in tow and Enki blacks
that make the experience immersive and
speaking of immersive have you ever
heard these speakers this is really what
makes it special we have a premium
package of hardware and software being
sandwiched into a beaut
the mini sports the same theater like
Dobby - that we praised on the X on 7
and if you snap a pair of headphones on
prepare to be just this amazed that
Swann was with its larger sibling
software is about the same as the X on 7
it looks like stock Android marshmallow
but it's actually a skin over meat favor
UI 4.0 it's got a frequently used tab in
the settings menu that's very convenient
and sliding down the notification pane
has the typical convenient icons that we
praised about nougat even if you're not
running nougat you can hide the
navigation keys with a quick tab at the
left and there is a voice command
feature by pressing and holding the bat
button that I actually don't recommend
yes there is even a voice print feature
for passwords but that's another feature
that was really hit or miss and about
everything else
again this phone behaves like if it was
stock Android and that's actually a good
thing I've been testing the ZTE axon 7
mini for five days in La Ceiba on
Buddhist phone calls were rather loud
thanks to the audio enhancements and the
phone does an admirable job at retaining
signal and fast data speeds these are
interfaces fluent enough for basic tasks
and the power efficiency of the
mid-range processor keeps battery life -
about a day of average use now you will
begin to notice the corners being cut in
things like graphics intensive games or
even just normal games where we're
talking about long load times and the
occasional stutter here and there and if
you test the camera
well corners continue to be cut even if
we have a 16 megapixel sensor with up
1.9 aperture color saturation and
contrast is what I'd call ok
the main problem is really the
experience in taking photos the camera
is extremely clunky at taking the shot
and this only becomes more intense and
low-light scenarios where it struggles
to focus on subjects and yeah those
low-light photos aren't really what I
call great either during the day
touching on subjects actually fully
overexposed the shot forcing you to tone
it down in
every single time and you'll notice
these effects to be also common in the 8
megapixel selfie shooter and as for
video recording yeah there is no oh is
included and clearly no sort of
electronic image stabilization
whatsoever as a yeah the video does move
a lot everywhere the bottom line is that
we do have to remember that the ZTE
Exxon 7 Mini is a premium mid-range err
it is not a flagship if you want a
better camera experience or are more
powerful device for playing games that
you might want to consider the regular
Exxon 7 as your best bet and really if
you think of it at $299 what stands
between this watered-down experience and
the premium experience provided by the
regular Exxon 7 is just the hundred
bucks and no by no means am I saying
that the exon 7 Mini is a bad phone but
it becomes really hard to recommend
given the meagre price difference
between its more powerful
