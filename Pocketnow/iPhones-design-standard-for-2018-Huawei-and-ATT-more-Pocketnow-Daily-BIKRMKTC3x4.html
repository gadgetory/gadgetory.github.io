reports of more variance to the next
iPhones those of you that were waiting
for the launch of the huawei mate 10 Pro
in the US well you only get half of what
you wanted and CES 2018 coverage
includes racer and TCL I'm Jaime Rivera
and we've got more content coming up
here from CES this was the less noisy
spot that I could find let's go through
the news this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with our
coverage of CES 2018 if you haven't
caught our videos we already have one of
the Razer project Linden which is
probably one of the coolest products
that I've seen this year and it's barely
getting started obviously there is more
to see at CES in addition to that we
also stopped by Alcatel we saw the 1 3
the 5 even though these are concepts and
there are more videos coming up some of
these embargoed stay tuned and speaking
of TCL for those of you that were bitter
because the BlackBerry motion is
available everywhere but the United
States it has just been launched in the
United States you can get it for $450 is
actually the suggested retail price and
I find it to be extremely aggressive yes
we do have the unit yes we will have a
review coming soon we will keep you
posted d now let's talk about Huawei the
company invited us yesterday to a
meeting they had their press event today
and we were expecting the company to
announce the may 10 Pro on AT&amp;amp;T and as
it turns out it's only getting launched
unlocked in the US for 799 Bucks
obviously it's Steve there are no
subsidies there will be a gift card for
those of you that pre-order of $150
depending on which retail you pick so
that's great and Huawei is also making
this huge move to have its brand being
recognized in the United States you can
learn more in the description now let's
move the spotlight over to iPhones
obviously territory that's not mentioned
here at CES but for those of you that
are concerned about the whole battery
thing and wanting to get your
replacement bear in mind you only have a
right to one replacement for 29 bucks
meeting if you feel your iPhone is slow
stop by the Apple Store they'll replace
your battery but that's it I mean next
time you want to get a battery replace
you'll pay 80 bucks which is still not
crazy considering that it's a lot less
expensive than having to buy a new phone
you can learn more details again in the
description and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
more iPhones we've been wondering when
the Refresh to the iPhone se is going to
happen and we've got some trusted
sources claiming a couple of things
number one that we should expect that
phone early this year we had already
covered that from other sources in the
past but now we also hear that this
phone will be all glass and the reason
why is because a Apple wants to make
their wireless charging across the board
meaning the new standard for iPhones in
2018 will be all glass it leads me to
the question today do you think that the
iPhone S II still has a market do you
think that Apple should launch it in my
case hey if they brought that design of
the iPhone 10 to the iPhone se I feel
that would be a hit if they abduct the
new 18 by 9 or whatever crazy aspect
ratio Apple has for the iPhone 10 but
hey leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
if you want to get the news earlier
