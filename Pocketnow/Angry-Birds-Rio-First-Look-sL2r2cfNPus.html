today I want to give you a first look of
Angry Birds Rio it's available free for
today if you're lucky enough to get it
today from the new Amazon Appstore head
over to pocketnow.com to see how you can
get that on your Android powered device
but I'd want to take a look and show you
what's involved it's kind of neat so
first of all we've got some loading
screens both Rovio blue sky and fox and
then we're met with the Angry Birds Rio
loading screen and of course this is Rio
de Janeiro okay so you didn't know you
thought Rio was maybe River and there's
a movie coming out called Rio that I
think we're trying to do some
co-branding here with that's why we have
the Fox relation there we'll go ahead
and play it and just like you used to
you know you've got your traditional
levels or level groups go into the first
one and I've already played a few levels
in here but to show you what it looks
like it first and get you the storyline
let's go ahead and look at level 1 yay
our birds finally got their eggs when
they're captured in this steel cage
carried by a helicopter down to Rio de
Janeiro there they're dropped in a
warehouse with some other birds in cages
and in true Angry Bird style of they get
angry so now instead of trying to
destroy pigs that have stolen your eggs
now you are trying to rescue these birds
that are in the warehouse with you by
breaking with the cages and letting them
all fly away of course you get some new
birds in the process so you have
different things that you can do which
is kind of neat one thing that I do like
is this is a lot more animated a lot
more interactive there's a lot more
involved to it I mean this whole level
completed badge just shook as those
stars came down stars are flying all
over the place and then your new high
school or stamp down there just kind of
shook everything so I guess it gives the
game a much more polished feel than the
the older Angry Birds games just kind of
like it looks a lot more polished
let's go ahead and go on to the next one
I'm not gonna play the whole game here
you for you as well but you know I just
want to show you kind of what what you
can expect first few levels are
ridiculously easy in my opinion but it's
kind of nice to see that you can give
this to a small child for example and
have them be able to have some fun with
it as well so really cool it's Angry
Birds Rio it is available exclusively
for now in the Amazon App Store for
Android if you head over there today and
of course today maybe yesterday
depending on when you watch the video it
is a free app otherwise it's $0.99 us so
it's something I definitely recommend
you head on over and get that will help
get you not only the Amazon App Store
but also a really cool really fun game
as well the like seeing this kind of
stuff if so give this video a thumbs up
if you haven't commented on the video or
on the game do that in the comments down
below we'd like to see you know what do
you like about the new version of Angry
Birds do you like the no longer killing
of the the poor defenseless little pigs
and the rescuing of your buddies in
cages or do you want to go back to just
wanton violence
let us know down in those comments head
on over to pocketnow.com not only to see
the write-up on this game but also to
see all kinds of other apps tips and
solutions for not only Android but other
smartphones as well for pocket now I'm
