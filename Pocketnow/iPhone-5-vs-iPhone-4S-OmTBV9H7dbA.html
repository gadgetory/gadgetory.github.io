pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to compare the iPhone 5 with its
predecessor the iPhone 4s let's get to
it
okay so wants to talk about here and
we're going to start with hardware we're
going to talk about specs screen speed
of the device how fast they are browsing
the web and also battery life so so
let's talk about hardware first as you
can see the iPhone 5 is simply taller
than the iPhone for us in fact if we
stack them side to side and give you
kind of a bottom view you can see that
they're exactly the same in terms of the
width down here on the bottom you can
see that the old iPhone had a speaker
here and a microphone here on the iPhone
5 you get speaker here and the
microphone here now one thing I wondered
was whether this speaker is louder than
on the iPhone 4s and I can say that it's
slightly louder but not by very much you
can also see that on the iPhone 5 the
headphone port is now on the bottom very
different backs on these two we've got a
glass panel here on the iPhone 4s which
as a lot of people know that have the
iPhone 4 and for us shatters quite
easily and finally they added sort of a
metal aluminum backing which does a
great job at deterring fingerprints it
looks nice but you still have glass here
and here that I can't help but wondering
what happens if you drop the phone and
these parts shatter they're probably
very difficult to swap out whereas on
the iPhone 4s a shattered back meant
that you just took out these screws slid
in another cover and you are good to go
something else I want to point out back
here is that the iPhone 5 has a sapphire
crystal lens cover what does that mean
well it means that it's much more
difficult if not impossible to scratch
the lens which is very important not too
long ago I crack the back here and I had
to get a replacement and when I swapped
the ODE back which included a glass lens
cover with the new back the quality of
my photos improved because as I then
discovered my lens was scratched and so
that's a big problem if you scratch your
lens six months into owning an iPhone
your pictures are going to come out
worse so Apple got smart and they they
put a much harder material here on the
lens cover we also
microphone here which will help with
audio coming from the back of the phone
and make HD video a lot better we've got
the same resolution camera here very
similar camera system but we've got some
new software and some small tweaks to
the iPhone 5 cameras to hopefully help
in low-light performance and we're going
to have comparisons on photo and video
quality in the final review on
pocketnow.com going over to the side
here we can see that the iPhone 5 is
essentially how thick the iPhone 4s
would be if you remove the top and the
bottom glass panels you just had the
metal bend it's essentially just a metal
Bend and Apple polish the edge of it to
give it a really nice look and as you
can see here the Micro SIM slot has gone
to a nano SIM slot and you can actually
cut a micro SIM to a nano SIM shape in
case you're wondering if you're on a
prepaid plan or if you're getting an
unlocked iPhone and you want to use your
existing SIM card you can do that if you
just cut your micro SIM to a regular SIM
up on the top not much has changed here
except there's no microphone here
there's a microphone somewhere else and
there is no 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack over on the side again not much has
changed on the iPhone 5 this is really a
minor detail the silent toggle switch
has moved up about a millimeter just to
kind of stretch out a little bit and
beyond that we stole the band's although
these bands are now color specific to
whether you have the black phone or the
white phone obviously they are white
because this is the white iPhone 5 now
let's talk about specs with both of
these we've got a dual-core 800
megahertz or so processor on the Apple
iPhone 4s and on the Apple iPhone 5
we've got a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor with a smaller manufacturing
process which means that it should be
more power fishing and definitely it is
smaller and that's very important
because Apple fit a lot of radios into
this really small form-factor which
actually feels it's really hard to
describe it actually feels smaller than
the iPhone 4s even though it's taller
now let's talk about other specs the
screen resolution has changed 960 down
by 640 across on the iPhone 4s that was
never
standard resolution they didn't adhere
to 720p or anything like that and they
didn't adhere to 720p with the iPhone 5
we've got a really weird 1166 resolute
or 11:36 resolution again a really weird
number that's hard to remember by that
same 640 so as we're going to see in a
few minutes there are apps that really
don't work to the full screen size so
you get a lot of apps that kind of hover
in the middle of the screen which really
isn't that big of a deal on apps will be
updated in the near future to take
advantage of the higher screen risk now
Apple claims that this screen is the
best screen on the market that has
better color saturation is that the
truth well let's see so we're going to
unlock and both of these devices have
nothing running as you can see so we're
going to do some speed tests but first a
note on quality of the screens and in
the unboxing I showed you the photos
icon so here it is on the iPhone 5 and
then look at it on the iPhone 4s up here
as you can see the yellows are a little
bit more yellow the greens a little bit
more green the blue is a little bit more
blue there's no question that the iPhone
5 is better color saturation than the
iPhone 4s in fact let's open up Google
Images and we'll open up a high-res
image and we'll compare something more
real-life side to side by the way what
you're seeing out is a white screen
these are both on middle screen
brightness and they're on automatic
screen brightness so technically they
should be about the same brightness
level what I'm actually noticing is that
the screening on the iPhone 5 is a
little bit more gray I'd say it's a
little bit more warm than the iPhone 4s
and that's kind of funny because the 4s
was warmer than the iPhone 4 which was a
very cold display okay so we're going to
bring up a common image here okay so I
just did a Google Images search for
beach I want to zoom in on the screens a
little bit and one thing that you can
see with the iPhone 5 is that because
the screen is larger you get to see more
on-screen elements so whereas before on
the iPhone 4s you have to scroll down to
see the pagination now it's all in one
frame so let's click on the same image
here and maybe we'll get a high-res
version maybe not we'll click full size
image here okay that's good so let's
zoom in a little bit and definitely the
color temperature on the iPhone 5 is far
warmer in fact
in the sand it looks like actual sand
over here it kind of looks a little bit
more white maybe this is a Caribbean
scene where the sand is actually white
but it just seems like the color
saturation is is better the sky here is
kind of a turquoise issue blue here it's
more of a deep blue and let's go back
and click on a different image let's go
to this one with the palm tree that's
nice get some green in there we're going
to go into landscape on both of these so
we get that full screen view
interestingly the iPhone 5 is really
taking its time on this particular
particular image we're going to do web
browsing speed tests in a moment but
right there it kind of failed so here's
what it looks like here's a palm tree
looks like we can zoom in and see kind
of the different details in the leaves
and again a very different color
saturation here a lot darker here on the
iPhone 5 some might like some may prefer
the cooler temperature of the iPhone 4s
and some might like the warmer tone of
the iPhone 5 which is probably a little
bit more true to life okay now let's see
which of these devices is faster
obviously the iPhone 5 is going to be
faster but let's see
to what degree we're going to open up
Facebook at the exact same time which
has actually is faster on the forest
which has been optimized by the way to
fill the entire screen unlike some of
the other apps that you're going to see
now Apple is encourage developers to
take advantage of the taller screen by
adding more stuff instead of just by
making the screen longer as you can see
Facebook didn't follow that and they
just sort of made the screen longer
which I guess works well in an app like
that let's jump back to the home screen
okay let's launch the camera now okay
significantly faster on the iPhone 5 and
you can see that Apple took better
advantage of the screen space by making
the shutter button kind of the same size
as you would get here on the same size
as the home button which is interesting
a lot of people now are using the plus
button the camera plus button to take
the photo but it's nice that for those
that like to use the on-screen controls
it's a little bit bigger in the iPhone 5
okay now let's test Siri what's the
weather going to be tomorrow
iPhone 4s is ahead okay
the iPhone 5 sprung ahead a little bit
faster let's do something else with Siri
what's 4 times 3 divided by 3 okay so
the iPhone 5 coming out slightly ahead
although interestingly the iPhone 4s
converted it faster but the five answer
the question just a little bit faster so
let's continue opening up stuff so we're
gonna open up settings here a little bit
faster on the five but really barely
let's open up a third-party app New York
Times app will open up newsstand and by
the way folders open up slightly
slightly faster on the iPhone 5 but they
still haven't change that and that's
kind of unfortunate and Android folders
open just so fast it's awesome in iOS
it's always been that little slowness so
we're gonna tap on new york times here
have it open this has been optimized for
the full screen size this opened a lot
quicker than the iPhone 4s ok let's open
speedtest.net it's another third-party
app hasn't been updated for the taller
display as you're going to see in a sec
well identical and as you can see this
is what happens in the iPhone 5 when
it's not optimized you get black bars
it's not that big of a deal some people
say you should get the black iPhone
because it's less apparent I don't
really notice the difference I kind of
wish that Apple had brought this to the
bottom though so it's closer to the
bottom of the phone so when you're
typing it's more comfortable now let's
do a Wi-Fi test over the same exact
Wi-Fi network be kind of competing with
each other ok faster ping on the on the
4s faster download on the 4s faster
upload on the on the 5 so that was
interesting really inconclusive there
and finally let's open another
third-party app let's just open the
Apple Store
you know Apple should tell their own
developers to optimize for the new
iPhone 5s because this is not yet a tits
up that most up to date okay now let's
do the all-important web browsing speed
test will launch a Safari C which opens
faster about the same there we're going
to go into favorites favorites opened
about the same we're going to pocket now
and iPhone 5 got there a little bit
faster not by much
scroll to the bottom go to the desktop
site here something a little bit more
intense if I can get at the same time
oops it's not so easy okay a little bit
uneven there we'll try it again in a sec
okay so the iPhone 5 is already done
there well zoom in very smooth the text
clears up almost instantly although it
does kind of likewise here on the on the
iPhone 4s will click on this image go to
the next page iPhone 5 finish iPhone 5
just has incredible web browsing
performance I can't wait to see how it
stacks up against the galaxy s3 let's
see how long it takes this video to load
it's a YouTube video another press maybe
ok let's go to another website now let's
go to the verge and here's another
example of where the iPhone 5s taller
screen is great you can see a lot more
of your favorites
let's go to the verge a little bit
faster out of the gate there with the
iPhone 5 ok let's move down the page
let's load their desktop site very
image-heavy ok they're off at the exact
same time
the iPhone 5 won the iPhone 5
outperforms the iPhone 4s and web
browsing there's no question about it
kind of move around the page let's just
click one more link for good measure
that won't jump into a little bit of
gaming
okay iPhone 5 and it's oddly loading a
video ok that's great
up there we go kind of far behind there
let's go back to the home screen alright
let's do a comparison with gaming we've
got Shadowgun here it's a high FPS game
pretty intense let's see which launches
it first
first of all though we'll play it a
little bit the iPhone 5 is a little
ahead and I want to deal with this Game
Center stuff and as you can see shadow
gun has not been optimised for the
higher res display so we're going to
play it just as if it were an iPhone 4s
which I guess is good because keeping
the playing field a little bit more
equal here so when hit play for some
time that was exactly the same and
shelepin original game keep easy alright
iPhone 5 slightly ahead there but barely
loading see if we can tell the
difference in graphics much much much
faster game times here we're still
waiting here only - for us
which means a good job is expected rest
okay since the iPhone 5 finish first
let's play with that a little bit so
we'll try to get in close on some
texture so we can see sort of the ground
let's look at some light see if there's
really any difference
very nice graphics let's take out the
iPhone 4 see if we can notice any
difference do the same thing we'll kind
of go over here I'm not to get this
video you know it's really help
difficult to tell the difference here
they both look really good and I don't
even think I'm in the same spot I'm
actually kind of confused up I want to
be able to hear there you go
Kevin kind of bad at this game so let's
see what the Sun looks like get the same
flares let's turn on and look how it
will get that fire same kind of thing
and we're kind of in the same area here
what is noticeable though is that the
fire is redder and more orange on the
iPhone 5 compared to the iPhone 4s and
finally we've some app updates here
let's see which of these devices
installs app updates faster I hate
waiting for apps to install let's see if
there's any difference between the two
hopefully they won't ask me for a
password okay good okay you can see the
progress bar is much further ahead here
it hasn't even begun there it's starting
on the 4s and as you can see it
simultaneously started podcasts before
Yelp was finished and that's really
interesting about the iPhone 5 it
installs multiple apps at a time whereas
the iPhone 4s only does one or two at a
time so podcast is almost done here and
it's done so app installations are so
much faster on the iPhone 5 which is a
nice little touch and what about battery
life well it's too early to tell we're
going to take this out and use it in the
real world but we can tell you is that
while filming this video both of these
devices have gone down by 6 percent
they've both gone down the same amount
we've been doing the exact same thing to
both of them so maybe that's an
indication that the battery life is
about as good maybe it's a little bit
bad
hopefully it is a little bit better so
if we you enjoyed this comparison of the
iPhone 5 in the iPhone for us the iPhone
5 is definitely faster generally
speaking installing applications
browsing the web launching most apps
although in some cases the iPhone 4s
keeps up just fine which is a testament
to how pretty good the iPhone 4s still
is the hardware is is really night and
day you no longer get that annoying
glass panel and it just looks so much
more mature and elegant with this metal
backing and the thinner design and the
polished edge it's just a really nice
package and I feel like this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching
that's it for now
