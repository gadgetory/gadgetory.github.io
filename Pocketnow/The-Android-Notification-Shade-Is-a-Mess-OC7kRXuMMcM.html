is how it handles notifications but
recently things have been getting a
little out of hand I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is why my
Android notification shade is a mess few
will argue the notification shade on
Android is a problem in fact it's one of
the better parts of the platform Windows
Phone for example doesn't even have a
centralized place to check your
notifications you instead have to skim
through dozens of tiles on your home
screen for scattered sparse information
Notification Center on iOS was a
flattering copy of Android Shade without
the helpful information in the status
bar to tell you about pending
notifications it was loosely linked to
the badge notifications found in the
upper right corner of app icons except
they were never really in sync with one
another the new Notification Center
looks better and it displays some useful
information but the actual notification
aspect of it is no more practical or
helpful than before on Android I've been
trained to peek at the notification
shade when I want to know what's
happening on my phone anyone who has
used Android for any amount of time
knows this and for all intents and
purposes it works exceptionally well
drag downward over collapsed
notifications to expand them or expand
notifications one by one for the two
fingers swipe down expanded
notifications often have additional
information at a glance and actions
built directly into them for instance I
can reply to or retweet mentions on
Twitter through plume directly from the
notification shade dismiss with a quick
and easy swipe left or right and a short
list of status icons shortcuts and
toggles can be accessed by tapping the
button in the upper right corner from
within the shade or a two finger swipe
down from the top of the display from
virtually anywhere in the operating
system on tablets the notification and
quick setting shades are separated
notifications to the upper left corner
quick settings in the upper right until
recently I've had literally no
complaints with the way Android handles
notifications in fact I still don't but
I do have a problem with how the
notification shade has become the
catch-all for anything and everything
ongoing the notification shade has
always been and should have remained a
place where I look for one thing
notifications
except through an ongoing status and
certain priority settings chosen by the
developer it's likely your note
vacation shade is littered with a
handful of nonstop notifications which
are always present take my motox for
example there are currently 13
notifications in my shade the only
actual notifications are multiple emails
from three different accounts one
Twitter notification from flume and
Instagram notification a Facebook
notification and a hangouts message the
remaining spots are filled with the
semi-permanent trusted devices
notification fixed to the top position
the Nerdist podcast and pocket casts a
Wi-Fi notification pebble notification
the one swipe notification from Action
launcher and clipper with the exception
of the playing podcast the rest are
virtually always there telling me
nothing new and taking up a considerable
amount of space more importantly they're
making my notification shade a whole
heck of a lot more cluttered and as such
more difficult to read and sip through
quickly the easy answer is to uninstall
and not use applications which use
persistent notifications or disable the
notifications altogether but I rely on
most of these apps and services and
without them persistently present in the
notification shade the system will
likely kill the app and any related
connections or functionality for
instance pebble it requires a
notification to ensure the pebble
application is kept up and running not
closed you can disable this notification
but the connection to your actual pebble
can get a little wonky and it's the same
for action launcher one swipe beta if
you kill the notification either through
the system or application settings but
one swipe feature the unique ability to
access widgets in your application quick
drawer from within any application may
be lost trusted devices is present any
time you connect your Moto X to a
trusted device this persistent
notification is there one to remind you
that your phone will not lock itself
while connected and to so you can
quickly lock the phone without
disconnecting your Bluetooth device
these ongoing notifications serve a
purpose and while some developers
needlessly require a notification to be
persistently present in the notification
shade many of them actually need to be
there to make some truly awesome
functionality possible it's not just the
Moto X either it's any Android device I
use the Nexus 5 the Nexus 7 etc and it's
only getting worse over time I can't
blame the developers for doing what
google has told them to do but I can
insist Google update the appearance of
ongoing notifications
to make them less obtrusive and annoying
there is a simple solution move all the
minimum priority ongoing Status Messages
such as the ones from pebble one swipe
pocket casts or other media playback
clipper trusted devices and the like to
be in the quick settings page below all
the toggles it would be just as simple
to access a view without making the
notification shade a stress-inducing
mixture of important information and
virtual placeholders leave a comment
below and tell us how you think Google
should differentiate and separate actual
notifications from an ongoing status
that never changes that's going to wrap
