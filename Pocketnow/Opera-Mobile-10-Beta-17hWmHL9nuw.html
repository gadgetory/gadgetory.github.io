pocketnow.com and this is a look at
upper mobile 10 beta which was just
released this is an update to upper
mobile 9.5 which is really the flagship
browser for Windows Mobile that comes
pre-installed on a lot of devices
especially those from HTC it really
beats out internet explorer Mobile in
terms of rendering fidelity speed and
some other features and now version 10
really tries to build on that with a lot
of new features so let's take a look at
how it works
it is a beta so it's a little bit buggy
you probably want to run this in
parallel to another browser like opera
mobile 9.5 Skyfire or whatever other
browser you use because it's not
completely stable and let's start it up
first thing you'll notice that it starts
up in about two or three seconds Opera
Mobile 9.5 starts up in about five six
seconds which may seem like an eternity
you're trying to quickly get to a
website so right off the bat here we
have a panel of six websites that you
can add to that you go to on a regular
basis kind of like Google Chrome so we
can tap the plus button we can select
from our favorites or we can just type
in address and manually and then it will
ask you if you want to add a thumbnail
and then it'll try to pull from the
website a small little thumbnail
although this is Google it didn't come
out so so nice hopefully when it comes
out of beta you will see a nicer
thumbnail so let's go through some of
the features let's first start by
loading up a web page and let me check
if opera turbo is turned on we're gonna
go through this screen in a second it is
turned on let me turn it off just so you
can compare
we're over Wi-Fi right now and I'm gonna
go to pocketnow.com now because this is
not a native application it doesn't tap
into the accelerometer so we don't get
to have landscape pages also this is
running on the hd2 right now we don't
have pinch-to-zoom
Opera Mobile 9.7 was built specifically
for the HD 2 and it was integrated so
well that pinch-to-zoom worked but not
the case in 10 so we have this load
pretty darn fast actually like I said we
can't pinch to zoom but we can double
tap to zoom in it goes in really fast
looks like it's trying to load something
right now
and what's really interesting about
opera mobile 10 is that you don't get
the checkerboard pattern anymore like
you would in 9.5 so let's kind of get
around on the screen a little bit and
see what it looks like to to move around
and let's click on a link
all right and here it comes that was
about seven seconds and we can scroll
down it doesn't support flash of course
we can DoubleTap the zoom in but note
how opera mobile ten kind of formats the
page weird this text should flow all the
way to the side here but it only goes to
the left side of the column that's
probably a bug with the beta it kind of
keeps the text shrunken over here so to
zoom in as you just saw when you double
tap to zoom out you press this button
down here
oddly double tapping again doesn't zoom
out so you have to press the button down
here it's not too big of a deal let's
open up a new tab opera mobile ten now
has a really cool way to manage tabs you
can press the plus button right here and
let's go to actually let's just go to
Wikipedia that's an easy one and here is
Wikipedia that was about seven or eight
seconds and now we can kind of pen
between pocket now and Wikipedia we can
actually see a little preview without
actually going directly into the website
then you tap again to get the tab panel
to go down really cool design let's open
up in another website and see how it
does when there are multiple sites open
let's open up and gadget and we'll go to
the full site
okay so that was pretty quick and again
notice how the text is kind of formatted
strangely I'm gonna flick really fast
down the page and you're gonna notice
that it really redraws the screen almost
instantly it doesn't even look like it's
redrawing it it's just there and we can
double tap to zoom in we can pan around
on the screen very nice and we can tap
on a headline to go to the next page and
that came through quite fast but again
the formatting is very very much off
here so we're gonna zoom out and let's
see how these multiple websites do how
fast they come up pretty fast and you
get this nice animation down here so
let's take a look at the settings that
you can change in Opera Mobile 10 beta
we can hit the wrench down here and we
get some options we can find a word in a
page which is kind of like pressing ctrl
F on your keyboard in a desktop web
browser you can check out the history go
to bookmarks or in our case we're gonna
go to settings not much you can change
here you can have it load images turn on
a portable turbo which we're going to do
this use a server-side rendering to
increase page load times kind of like
sky fire doesn't work as well but it
increases load times a little bit and
full-screen mode and what you're going
to see is that full screen mode nicely
hides the top address bar and the bottom
bar and you can hide it or bring it out
again by pressing that button
let's close the program and open it up
again just so we know that opera turbo
is indeed going to be on and then we'll
try loading a site that we've already
loaded before it see if it's faster
really fast load time let me just
confirm that we still have opera turbo
on and we do so let's go to
pocketnow.com now and see if there's any
increase in page load time before it was
about 10 seconds
okay that was about eight seconds it's
not completely done I think it's trying
to load some additional page elements it
was a little bit faster let's click on
one link just to sort of just to sort of
have a better indication and it's kind
of lagging right now I'm here it comes
with the patient we just clicked on
and here it is a little bit faster but
not really that significant I would
probably leave opera turbo turned off so
overall we like where operas going with
Opera Mobile 10 we think it's a really
good step up from nine point five once
they work out the bugs it's really great
how fast it turns on how there's no
checkerboard now although sometimes you
get white spots the interface has
cleaned up the tab management is better
just a step in the right direction we're
really looking forward to future builds
of this that take away some of these
bugs that cause the program to freeze
kind of on a regular basis when you use
it depending on what device you use the
program is free to try right now we'll
put a link up on pocketnow.com to tell
you how to get it we'd also like to see
these rendering issues kind of fix
themselves a little bit because they
don't look quite right when you're
zoomed out that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
