what's in the box
you read the title you know what's
what's in the box just go ahead and yes
if you read the video title you know
exactly what we're unboxing today and if
you are any kind of mobile geek you know
why that is important and awesome this
is the HTC hd2 one of the most versatile
smartphones ever constructed and while
we're not publishing it's throwback
review until Monday we thought we'd give
you a taste in this throwback unboxing
it should be obvious from the Android
logo on the box that this is repurposed
packaging this is not the original
retail packaging for the hd2 but we'll
overlook that if the device is in good
shape well I take the cover off this
t-mobile variant a mobile u.s. variant
of the world's most versatile smartphone
boom there it is and with the t-mobile
branding above the screen as we've come
to expect I'm gonna put it down I'm not
gonna spend too much time on the
materials here because I don't think
that they are gonna be worth looking at
too much actually there might be hold on
let's pop these out get this box out of
the way so the power adapter seems to
have been constructed to fall more in
line with the touch diamond you have
these really sharp you know angular
construction it's very interesting kind
of trapezoid I don't know what you call
this and it didn't even look like an HTC
contract but no boom there it is there's
the HTC branding you guys who owned the
hd2 I'm gonna call on you to leave your
remembrances in the comments anyway but
I'll ask you to to tell me whether that
charger is original I'm sure other guys
in the pocket now team I couldn't tell
me but I would like you guys to let me
know here's the battery it is a 1230
milliamp power pack seems pretty
diminutive compared to what we're used
to in the modern world
here is the here's an extended battery
door it looks like for the back of the
device take the device out of the pouch
itself
this was advertised as new when we
bought it from our from a dealer so this
is pretty cool look at the back panel
here so we have a soft touch
construction on the bottom and the top
as well as a metal mid plate here now I
personally never owned one of these so
this is all new to me and that's with
HTC Sense called out specifically back
in the days when you didn't necessarily
want to advertise that you were running
Windows Mobile because it was fast
falling out of favor with the common
focus pull off the screen protector
quite please and there she is
as we pop off this battery door to get
the battery installed I want to repeat
my urging that you folks leave some
comments down below let us know what you
want to see from the forthcoming
throwback review which will go live on
Monday with some added context as well I
swear I'm not like a sweaty guy that's
just it's just yeah you know the thing
is the device was cold it was sitting on
the on the truck for a while okay boom
stick together there's our t-mobile
splash screen bright as day using the
old branding from I believe 2009
possibly 2008 there's the traditional
info down below the boot info from
windows mobile 6.1 I believe is what the
shipped with don't out worry we're going
to have man I remember that branding
we're gonna have very detailed analysis
but please leave your comments down
below let us know what you want us to
retreads share some of your best stories
from the hd2 from its hackery and even
if you just ran it stock we want to hear
about it we will be putting a SIM card
in there thankfully we do have a demo
sim from t-mobile USA don't worry about
that we will skip it for now we have a
little tutorial on using the on-screen
keyboard and there's the Terms of
Service we have to agree to to proceed
we will go ahead and agree typing on
this device not all that different from
what I remember we'll set all these up
later let's just see if we can get to
the home screen right now skip it please
thank you
and yes it's yes next and finish
boom there's that homescreen with thee
Blockbuster Video pre-installed
transformers this device truly a sign of
the times pretty pretty awesome
there's our Start menu with its
honeycomb layout this is going to be a
lot of fun and one last time I'll ask
you to share your stories down below so
that we can include them if possible
pocket now is throwback review of the
HTC hd2 will go live on Monday March
