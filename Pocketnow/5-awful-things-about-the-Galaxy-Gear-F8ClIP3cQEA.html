now according to Samsung if you don't
believe it turn on your TV to see the
company's nostalgic ads pushing its new
Galaxy gear which looks suspiciously
similar to another company's ads Hawking
another product a half decade ago well
we've been using the gear for about a
week and we found a lot to like about
Samsung's take on the future of wearable
computing see our companion video 5
awesome things about the Galaxy gear for
those in this installment though we're
going to take a look at the new watches
less desirable features i'm michael
fisher with pocket now here's 5 awful
things about the Samsung Galaxy gear one
of the great things about wristwatches
is their utility pocket watches fell out
of vogue for a few reasons of course
unfortunately and one of the big reasons
was simply the added practicality of a
timepiece you could wear on your wrist
instead of withdraw from a pocket
Samsung goes a long way toward
replicating that practicality in the age
of the smartphone but falls short of
making the gear waterproof now the gear
is rated to ip55 for splash resistance
and mild dust exposure but it won't take
the kind of prolonged submersion that
many standard wristwatches can we at
least like to have seen Samsung maker of
the Galaxy s4 active match the immersion
and ingress ratings of some of its
competitors ok we opened with a softball
you might not care about water
resistance but odds are you're gonna
care about battery life especially when
you start charging your gear every night
because you're going to have to sure you
can eke out one and a half to two days
even if you're not the type to get a lot
of notifications and you're very very
judicious with your screen on time but
that's still three times a week you need
to charge your watch in addition to your
smartphone in addition to your tablet in
addition to your Fitbit or whatever
other accessories you carry around it
gets tiresome and no matter how good
Samsung's made its charging cradle look
it's still a cumbersome little charger
that's a pain to carry along on
overnight trips away from home
but you can get past that odds are if
you're considering a SmartWatch you're
willing to accept some compromise in
exchange for the core convenience of
carrying such a device the notifications
on your wrist and yes the gear does a
nice job of letting you view and dismiss
things like inbound calls and calendar
appointments and you can even preview
texts and emails provided they come in
via the stock Samsung Apps for SMS and
email but woe be unto the person who
uses an alternate mailbox application
like the far superior Gmail app for
email or the more flexible Google Voice
app for SMS the gear won't show messages
received through those instead it'll
make you view them on the phone and that
goes for Facebook as well and Twitter
and Instagram and basically anything
that's not a stock Samsung messaging
application and that sucks
because those Samsung Apps kind of suck
when even if they didn't
it's confining to be forced to use any
custom app just to get notifications
sent to an accessory not every watch
requires this after all
speaking of compatibility the gear is
not compatible with almost anything
almost everyone who's noticed my gear in
public has asked if it will work with
his or her phone my reply is always the
same question do you have a recent
Samsung Galaxy device if yes then the
answer is maybe eventually if not then
the answer is no the long and short of
it is you can only use the Galaxy gear
with a Samsung device that's a list
that's growing steadily by the day yes
and it makes all the business sense in
the world for Samsung to continue
developing its own exclusive ecosystem
it's just disappointing because you
shouldn't need to put up with TouchWiz
on your phone to experience awesomeness
on your wrist
and finally you also shouldn't have to
shell out 300 bones for the privilege
yes the gear is well made and feature
packed and a desirable gadget in a lot
of ways but it's also got all the
hallmarks of a first generation product
with all the pitfalls that come along
with that description we don't generally
recommend first generation products from
any manufacturer and we think Samsung is
asking a bit much given the gears
current state it's a very cool gadget
but it's not $300 cool not yet
and once again folks if you want the
brighter perspective on all this hop on
over to our companion video 5 awesome
things about the Samsung Galaxy gear and
if you bought a gear of your own drop a
comment down below let us know how the
experience has been for you and feel
free to toss us a few questions you need
answered and we'll try and get around to
those also hop on over to our comparison
video where we compare the Galaxy gear
with the pebble smartwatch and stay
tuned for a lot more from pocket now in
the days ahead follow us on social media
so you don't miss any of it but most
importantly thank you very much for
watching this has been michael fisher
with PocketNow we'll see you soon
