each other very much you get something
that looks like this the achieve odyssey
for Verizon Wireless is Samsung's first
windows phone 8 device for the United
States I'm Michael Fisher this is pocket
now let's review it the TV Odyssey is a
mid-range offering available now on
verizon wireless for fifty dollars on
contract for the full text of our quick
review including benchmarks photos and
more visit us at pocket now calm and
follow us in the links down in the
description but like its higher-end
sibling the achieve s the odyssey isn't
necessarily going to turn heads across
the room but close up it's a fairly
attractive device it's 11 millimeter
thickness is substantial relative to its
125 gram weight but it doesn't feel too
tight in the hand and it's medium sized
means the power standby and volume keys
are always within easy reach the display
though is disappointing it's 4 inch 480
x 800 resolution is typical for the
mid-range but for some reason pixels are
especially visible on this Super AMOLED
panel and color reproduction is off it's
a serviceable display but no more than
that the ateam Odyssey doesn't lag too
far behind in the spec sheet it packs
the familiar Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 plus
at 1.5 gigahertz backed up by a gig of
ram there's only eight gigs of on-board
storage available but that's augmented
by up to 64 gigs of microsd expansion
and the 2100 milliamp hour battery is
also removable for quick swapping the
primary shooter is a 5 megapixel module
the odyssey packs plenty of horsepower
under the hood especially for the price
it's just a question of how willing you
are to deal with a lackluster display
and the typically oversized verizon
branding that determines whether you can
live with this phone for a two-year
contract period the atif odyssey we
tested was running one of the latest
builds of Windows Phone 8 and it
delivered the consistent near 121
responsiveness and the stability and
reliability we've come to expect from
Windows Phone Samsung's suite of custom
apps is still pretty anemic compared to
Nokia's but there are a few new tight
here so at least it's growing some
titles from other OEMs have also been
made available across the entire Windows
Phone 8 line up and Nokia Drive beta
worked just fine on the Odyssey it only
got us lost in suburban America once now
Verizon has loaded the Odyssey with some
bloatware but it's not much and most of
it is pretty useful out of the box
there's an NFL mobile app for fans of
the pigskin VZ navigator paid service
which we found pretty useful in a past
review and Microsoft's excellent data
sense utility which we've also reviewed
positively again you can find those
right upset pocket now calm all told on
the software side Samsung is still doing
a fair job on Windows Phone 8 it's
custom app selection isn't the best but
it's also not the worst and it's still
growing testing the achieve Odyssey in
the urban Greater Boston and rural
eastern Long Island service areas gave
us the chance to see how the device
performed on both LTE and CDMA data
networks reception was good with the
device averaging higher LTE speeds than
were used to seeing from verizon but 3g
performance was quite slow voice calls
were clear over the ear piece but as
usual the speakerphone needs much higher
gain in phone calling mode to be useful
on our end the noise cancellation was
pretty inconsistent but color said we
sounded about average as long as we were
in quiet conditions the camera was the
big surprise with the achieve Odyssey we
weren't expecting much from the 5
megapixel shooter on the back but
despite the lower resolution the unit
delivered results that were on par with
the achieve s in our earlier comparison
meaning the results are also on par with
the very good galaxy s3 and Galaxy Note
2 cameras at least in terms of color
saturation white balance and so on how
long you'll be able to take those shots
before the battery gives up is as always
dependent on your usage the odyssey's
battery is about average in terms of
capacity and its performance in that
regard followed with moderate usage it
should last you a full day the achieve
odyssey is yet another installment in
the increasingly long line of good
mid-range windows phone 8 devices it's
not the bomb blast we were hoping for
from Samsung's first wp8 device for the
US but
fifty dollars on contract on America's
largest carrier it's a solid value if
you can put up with the lackluster
display and the ho-hum physical design
this is a good windows phone for your
money we give it a solid seven out of
ten
