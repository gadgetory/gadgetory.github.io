pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to show you touch flo 3d 2.5 built
in 1919 if you subscribe to our youtube
channel you've probably seen touchflo 3d
2.5 before but this new build bring some
new functionality including twitter
twitter integration better facebook
integration and some new visual changes
we're likely to see this version of
touchflo 3d on HTC leo which is coming
out soon it's likely to be the first
windows mobile device with a capacitive
touchscreen display ok so let's take a
look and let's start on the Home tab new
to build 1919 is the ability to
customize the background wallpaper by
adding animated wallpaper or whether
animated wallpapers so if we go into
menu here and we go to home wallpaper we
can choose an animated wallpaper which
may be distracting to some but it's
probably a cool touch that many will
appreciate so if we wait a minute you're
going to see a little bit of animation
in the background there those little
circles are flying around on the screen
there's another option which is pretty
cool that doesn't always work because of
course this is a early build it's the
weather wallpaper so if it's cloudy
you'll actually gets clouds clouds
floating across the screen if it's
raining you'll get water droplets as you
can see it's not working right now now
you've also probably noticed that these
icons along the bottom are now colorized
we saw this in a previous build but now
the larger icon that flashes on the
screen when you just slide your finger
across they are much bigger and they
look much more bold and higher
resolution than they did before of
course with this version of touchflo 3d
we get the HTC hero like clock with the
weather integrated we can flick our
finger we can add our favorite contacts
or a bookmark or a link to a program
which is really convenient way to sort
of access the things that you use the
most going over to context we've seen
this before this is the new style of
context for touchflo 3d before you had
to flick through that ugly carousel that
really made it difficult to sort of
select a contact but now you get the
grid view which is great nothing's been
changed in messaging when you see it
change down email and let me show you
that so now you can actually read a lot
of the email
right on the screen whereas before in
touch flo 3d you got that little
envelope and you can only read two or
three lines this is a much more usable
way to kind of look through your email
over in the internet tab nothing really
has changed we can have thumbnails
devoted to websites you look at on a
regular basis can launch the browser
from here and also of course do a Google
search up top now the calendar
application is a little bit different a
little bit more refined so we can go to
the agenda view which looks a little bit
different than it did in previous
versions of touchflo 3d of course we can
flick our finger to go down the October
back up to September we can go to the
year view through this screen so some
small refinements to the calendar
application not terribly different than
what we've seen in previous versions of
touchflo 3d stocks is pretty much the
same of course we can tap on a stock get
the chart pictures there's a new feature
here so if we go to a picture and we tap
on it and bring it up we now have
facebook integration so if we tap on
this new icon here we can upload it to
Facebook put it in an mms or email it
you have to set up the Facebook in the
settings I haven't done that yet and of
course this is the the new landscape
view and we've seen that before too
okay we've seen music and that also is a
new landscape view with cover flow and a
very beautiful display of your music
weather is the same HTC footprints which
comes from the HTC touch cruise is now
in this rom for those unfamiliar
footprints lets you sort of keep track
of where you go and assign geographical
coordinates to pictures that you take of
certain places and you can tap on one of
the pictures that you take it'll do a
little screen animation and turn over
and show you you know the places phone
number or where it's located or maybe
you recorded a voice note for it
somewhat useful feature if you do a lot
of traveling or maybe you live in a city
you come across various restaurants and
that's included in this rom would it be
surprises HTC started including this in
all their future versions of touchflo 3d
now we have twitter integration and at
first when we posted about this on
pocket now calm we thought that perhaps
it was a developer add-on but as it
looks now it looks like it's built in
from HTC it's actually an HTC developed
program and it looks very similar
through the Twitter program from the HTC
hero again bringing elements of sense UI
to Windows Mobile so here we can kind of
see the most recent tweets that have
been occurring if we tap on all tweets
here we're taken into a screen that kind
of let you drill down by your @ replies
your direct messages your favorite
people and back to all tweets and there
are some settings here which help you to
kind of get a more granular level of
control so we can go to settings we can
determine how many tweets show up on the
screen at one time and get to 250 which
is a lot you can specify how often the
tweets should download you can use
twitpic or we can use twit goo to upload
your pictures and I'll show you in a
second that the photo integration is
fantastic your URL shortener can be
changed to a variety of services and
there are some other options here to a
very nice Twitter application and it's
very well integrated a touch flo 3d now
let me show you what happens when you
add a new tweet when you want to tweet
something new so what are you doing and
now you have a nice button here that you
can use to go into your photo gallery or
really quickly take a picture of
something and have it automatically
upload and have a twitpic link
associated to it will go out of that
so very nice job on the Twitter
integration we're really looking forward
to that and over to the right we have
settings stuff that we've seen before so
overall it looks like a lot of new and
great changes coming to touch flo 3d we
can't wait to see this on the HTC leo
with a beautiful 4.3 inch display and
hopefully future HTC devices as well be
sure to follow us on Twitter for more on
new versions of touchflo 3d and new
builds of windows mobile 6.5 twitter.com
