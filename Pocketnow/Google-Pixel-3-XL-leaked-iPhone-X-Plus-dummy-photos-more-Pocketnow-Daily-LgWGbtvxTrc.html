three that show us new color options
along with storage capacity new
additional leaks of iPhones emerge and
it looks like if we're getting the real
deal from what we've seen and it also
seems that iPads are about to kill
things like the headphone jack in 2018
I'm Jaime Rivera and for all of you that
asked for this show to go on a podcast
it is now live we have to pocket out
daily in a podcast and link in the
description follow us there this is
pocket out daily sponsored by Nord VPN
the official news today begin with deals
I don't recommend the Google pixel book
not because it's not gorgeous it is it's
just an overpriced Chromebook but if you
want a very powerful one on Amazon it's
currently $300 off it'll end up being a
hundred eighty bucks again it's up to
you if you want it but it's there it's a
great laptop but that's just about it
now let's talk about Samsung as we've
heard rumors of the company working on
it on display fingerprint scanner that's
gonna be ultrasonic now this is to
triple cameras on its Galaxy S line
we've got trusted sources claiming that
it's not just coming here apparently
there is an optical version of that
fingerprint scanner that's gonna come -
it's a lineup and we also hear that this
triple camera module might make it to
the a lineup as well so it seems you
might not necessarily just need a
flagship for this stay tuned now let's
talk about iPads we've got trusted
sources on separate end showing us
things that are both good and bad on the
positive front we've got a bezel as iPad
that apparently is gonna bring face ID
there is no touch ID here that's all
great it seems that the also it's gonna
change in form factor to a certain
degree where the smart connector is no
longer going to be on a horizontal side
it's actually gonna be at the bottom
along with the Lightning port so it
seems that you're gonna have to use
accessories vertically on this iPad the
thing that I don't like is the separate
rumors to show us that this product will
not have a headphone jack what's the
excuse Apple like seriously imagine a 15
hour flight there are no headphones in
the market that lasts for 15 hours what
am I gonna do with this thing if I can't
charge it and I can't listen to my stuff
while I watch a movie now let's talk
about iPhones as we've got leaked dummy
units that show us both the iPhone 9 and
the eye
ten plus in the case of the ten plus it
is pretty much just the blown out iphone
ten with smaller bezels that's all great
now in the case of the iPhone 9 it's
actually positive to see that the bezels
are no much bigger than what we
currently see on the iPhone 10 and we
also see that at the back at his glass
with just one camera lens now some of
the renders being shown looked more like
an iPhone 8 and everything just moved
around but we'll see and finally the hot
news today have to do with the Google
pixel 3 pixel 3xl I am looking forward
to these phone stay tuned for an after
the buzz of the Google pixel to excel
coming soon what things are coming or
polarizing people don't necessarily like
Naches this is probably the largest
notch I've ever seen but there's a
purpose there's also a chin at the
bottom meaning there are stereo speakers
coming to this phone that is awesome
what the cameras are gonna do I notice
two modules is still up for grabs but
other things are storage options 64 128
gigs are now being confirmed that's
great and it seems that the back is
fully glass in addition but we can't
confirm if there is wireless charger or
not and today's question let us know
what do you think about the rumors the
leaks do you like this very white or I
forgot the color white option but yeah
do you like the design do you not like
it because in my case you know launches
are everywhere I'll be fine with it but
leave us a comment down below we'd love

ask you to stay till the end for a word
