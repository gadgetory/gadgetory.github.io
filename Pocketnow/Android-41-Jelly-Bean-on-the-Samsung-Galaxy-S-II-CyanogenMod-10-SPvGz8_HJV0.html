pocketnow.com the Samsung Galaxy s2 is
still one of the best phones out there
and we're talking about the s2 not the
s3 it's super thin super light it comes
in a variety of sizes and shapes and
configurations and best of all it is
super fast now what happens when you
take jellybean and put it on an already
fast device Samsung will be coming out
with jellybean for the galaxy s2 most
likely this year but you can get
jellybean now if you want to make your
Galaxy S 2 even faster so in this video
we're gonna talk about a CyanogenMod 10
preview running on galaxy s2 let's check
it out now we've already shown you
preview builds of CyanogenMod 10 jelly
bean for the HTC One X the samsung
galaxy s3 and the samsung galaxy note
and we'll put links at the top of the
video here so you can jump back because
those three devices have very far along
builds especially the One X on the
galaxy s3 if you have either of those
devices I highly recommend you root your
phone put on a custom bootloader and get
the CyanogenMod 10 preview because it is
blazing fast on the note it wasn't as
blazing fast and the same can be said
here on the galaxy s2 it's definitely
quick definitely good enough to use as
your daily driver but as we're going to
see in a few moments it's it's it still
has some work left so here we're flick
flicking through the app tray that's
fast and responsive just some small
details to point out we're gonna bring
out the One X over here which as
mentioned is a little bit more far along
if we open up the app tray at the same
time watch the difference okay so the
One X was much faster going back to the
home screen much faster yes the One X is
a quad-core processor but it just goes
to show that also the software's not as
far along and I really don't think that
the quad-core processor has much to do
with how fast a folder opens for games
maybe but the point is that the
CyanogenMod
10 preview here for the galaxy s 2 is
not as far along but still plenty good
so we are going to go into the web
browser ok and we're going to go to
engadget.com
the keyboard is nice and responsive
we're to load the desktop view and
loading butter flip down the page and
just like we saw on the other jellybean
builds everything is already there it
loads it in fast it doesn't show you any
white space or any checker boards I mean
this thing flies and we can go into
portrait and portrait does work or
orientation change because in the galaxy
note cm10 preview it did not work and
let's go back into porch it's kind of
easier to see the page in that view
let's zoom in on some text see how long
it takes to clear up pretty fast there
so probably about half a second who's
keeping track well we are so web
browsing is definitely very good that's
going to pocket now real quick we also
have some complex graphics on that site
so we can take a look at how the galaxy
s2 is handling it zoom in on the page a
little bit of whites white happening
there again so it's it's it still has a
little bit ways to go before it is as
fast as the 1x in the galaxy s3 assuming
it can never get that fast because it's
got slower hardware but it's pretty darn
good so galaxy s2 run Chile being on
your phone if you've got a galaxy s2
it's definitely faster than even the
release candidates for CyanogenMod 9 in
our opinion we'll put links in the
description so you can download this
particular rom these are Knightley's so
you get updates about every night really
that bring new functionality and new
stability to the operating system so you
definitely want to keep up on those if
you want the latest in grace if you
liked this video please give us a thumbs
up let us know what your arm you're
running but if you're gonna leave a
comment drop the comment over on
pocketnow.com where the actual article
is because that's where we look at the
comments the comments on youtube just
come too fast too furious it's difficult
for us to keep up so anyway thanks for
