letter from Parker now calm and here
we've got Steve was going to give us a
quick demo of how the HTC docking
station for vehicles works tell us about
it Steve so what we call is a fairly
simple format when you basically use
your power static normally
with your fascinating either be the
number tangina need a fancy bluetooth
car can't write a bluetooth
Stereo are you to run a cable
all of those things reliable secure
anything what we paint those given an
option
just a simple toggle basically what you
have here is 3.5 mil tax when our snail
you want to notice me any other steady
source tell you anything team that what
you've got also charging dock until the
appetizer unit and a very simple peeling
button so it has a battery it has about
insider retail value inside ok so you
connect us to the car stereo here
connect it to the car stereo and then
you can connect your device straight to
it all right one of the benefits for the
one in spencer's you've got this car
blocking these things the next level
obviously that's great for connectivity
that means that Michael
as
connected to car stereo anything
the standard interface
I agree the funds are great small but
lead to touch right near for potentially
dangerous if I want to use navigation
I've got to go in terms I've gotta find
navigation exact all of you the whole
course makes it complicated basic
complicated therefore dangerous all
right you're driving down the road you
can't see what's going on you're trying
to concentrate tapping button to the
phone so what we've done is clean this
whole car but they caramel activates
automatically when you plug into the
dock so there's so so we need we need
first of all we need the dark yep for it
to activate car multimedia yes and
obviously we need the dongle yeah are
they sold together or sold separate so
little bailable say whether some
countries do packaging on those not much
yeah usually happens that's right oh so
explain to me how does it work so the
dogs very simple this is your home treat
right and actually when you rip the
phone if you press the home button it
will always take you back the screen off
the sound of not the standard phone
systems here I get Chuck toten right
you're not going to accidentally go char
coaches out nice and ordained for us
you've got lots of them feel you a nice
clean easy standard part we've got them
here the music that way okay we've got
all my king connectivity details for a
Bluetooth GPS signal strength Barney
online pizza we've also got over here
any notification safdar as you can see
brewing a message we've got the numbers
from the tame it landed actually as well
can actually tap into your more straight
weave everything is huge on the screen
gray the reason behind that is you're
not sitting trying to aim your friend on
something small right all big clumsy
button versus exactly what makes it nice
and safe and easy if I go back to the
home screen here we'll see still in one
sitting even when I swipe this it's all
ball screens right thing so really
really easy and need to buy through here
and then this UI only activates when you
use the card okay there's no way that
you can use this without the move you
can go and I believe me to go in a
forced on food so let me just have a
Wookiee
so we've got car there so I can go in
and start it's a very interesting why it
would be cool to be oh there we go there
we go so I can't force it to work ok
there is the easy ok i voted
professional that button
so this is a very cool air base to have
and yes it's available no matter whether
you have an obligation to show you if
you if you didn't have the docking
station and all you have is a car
o'clock so just a cheap easy compound
you could put it in that car compact to
beat the mold and off you go okay so
simple one straight weeks music so music
need easy here I can dive in Tartus I
can divert as in c street at we this is
all really big finger pester right right
but that's me in that's why musically
number of features here I can't I'd back
and see what's going on dive back into a
time I can change my goof around super
bo-duper welcome everyone it would
provide Beats Audio even get green today
to the user at the bottle one of the new
things the responsibility is this focus
on this
so whereas before the beach profiles on
the view available you plug careful in
10 pizzas don't go enter everything
within the built-in speaker yeah so the
beat is the map designed to give you an
experience on all the different type
music news so very neat easy so we've
got sent there I can dive through my
music concerns are very very easily time
you got home so you can see the
Australian edible I've got internet
video so we build tunein radio and TV
you can download now we've integrated a
end to the product so you can and
internet radio stations so I can have
new listen to their radio stations there
you know one of your needs may be spent
more money in a TV in this car back here
we go we go to their radio stations we
drive down the road
we've got the map there I've got
navigation they're very simple and easy
gives you previous locations
appointments all once again big clumsy
buttons they even have okay I can dive
deeper into navigation there and I've
got quick and easy search I'm driving
the road like I'm running
penn station to find it really can't you
speak to it or currently it's only for
tab and companies only potatoes okay so
it's very simple it's shameful but you
look how easy dies it is i the right way
I'm gonna Harvey need a beer there we go
there we go hey don't hit left obviously
not going to leave the car epic so so
very simple easy and obviously Bush
would work from hong kong
let me search tool all my recent calls
and convey them to people at Humber and
four different numbers once again you
can see the UI is designed to be very
makin finger-friendly not focus so by
using this unless I have converted my
car into full bluetooth car kit yeah
fool Bluetooth navigation pet and the
music cupboard account so all in one
arch very simple and easy if we change
my car that can take it with me thank
you very much Steve this is high memory
