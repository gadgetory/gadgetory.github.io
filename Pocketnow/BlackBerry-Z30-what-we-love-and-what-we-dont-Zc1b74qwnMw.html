q10 we have cured the office and I'm
captivated by a few really compelling
features that a handful of advantages
that that make me want to carry
blackberry again as my daily driver but
then I'm confronted by some of the
things the platform can't do and I'm
reminded of just why it can't be my
daily driver
well those ups and downs have been
ported almost entirely to BlackBerry's
new flagship the Z 30 and that's what
we're here to talk about I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow this is the
BlackBerry z30 and here's what we love
and what we don't it's always kind of a
bummer to end a video on a list of
Downers so for this one we're going to
get the bad stuff out of the way first
some of this will be familiar to those
of you who've seen our reviews of
blackberry z10 and q10 for new viewers
follow us on the feeds so you don't miss
future videos from pocket now on the
software side the number one sticking
point with bb10 continues to be say with
me the apps I know we're beating a dead
horse here so we won't dwell on this but
even in the curated front page view of
the BlackBerry app world there's just
that much here it's not like the
situation with Windows Phone which is
managed to fill many of the high profile
slots here there are still big gaps with
a lot of big-name titles missing so
while you might be okay if the c30 is
your first smartphone if you're coming
from any other ecosystem you're going to
be sorely disappointed in the lack of
native apps and speaking of native
titles even some of the out-of-the-box
software needs work for every
wonderfully crafted app like the clock
or the compass there's something like
maps which is just horrid in terms of
functionality and friendliness voice
control is still thin on features and
speech-to-text is hit and miss at best
little things like text manipulation are
more cumbersome than they should be and
some no-brainer features like mark all
as read in the hub are still annoyingly
non-existent we've been waiting almost a
year for blackberry to fix some of these
and the weight is getting a little old
in exchange for these shortcomings
though blackberry 10 gives you one of
the most fluid and fun interfaces around
granted that's an opinion from an
admitted fan of gestures but even if
you're new to swiping your way through
your smartphone rather than just tapping
BlackBerry's approach is more intuitive
than some others using the z30
has a flow to it that's efficient and
enjoyable all at once
a combination I haven't experienced
since the glory days of Palms webOS and
the app gap is a bit easier to deal with
if you're willing to do a little legwork
the latest version of blackberry tends
Android runtime supports jellybean apps
and thanks to the awesome BlackBerry
developer and fan community particularly
at crackberry.com it's relatively easy
to sideload those apps onto your device
tinkerers will be pleased to hear that
many major titles are available with
more coming at a regular clip and if
your app needs are basic you might be
able to find a gap filler without
resorting to apks apollo is a good
example a third-party app for Pandora
which does a really nice job and even if
you're stuck using native shortcuts like
the browser for YouTube there's still a
silver lining here audio continues to
play while the video is minimized making
multitasking just a little bit easier so
from the comprehensive and quick
system-wide search to the intelligent
active frames that minimize apps into
de-facto widgets to the new lock screen
notification previews and the new
notification banners to the outstanding
predictive text of the software keyboard
to the hub which ties it all together
blackberry 10 is a very smart very easy
to use interface that makes a lot of
sense and one which frankly doesn't get
the respect it deserves
one of the reasons for that it may be
due to BlackBerry's hardware which was
pretty unremarkable on the z10 and
unfortunately even less remarkable on
the Z 30 while the newer device adds a
little bit of personality to what
essentially resembled reference Hardware
on the z10 it's not an exciting
personality the rounded corners conflict
with the bright line delineation of the
silver chin and the 170 gram mass makes
it seem fatter than it actually is
at nine point four millimeters the
design is neither inspired complexity
nor elegant simplicity it's just there
it looks more like a generic smartphone
from two years ago rather than the new
flagship of a resurgent platform even
the glass weave on the back can't save
it from its near total blindness
fortunately aesthetics are relative and
if you find the XIII's casing appealing
well there's a lot to like within it -
first of all it's comfortable to hold
that soft back and the rounded corners
make for a nice in hand feel despite the
weight the five inch Super AMOLED
display may only be 720p but it renders
gorgeous colors the batteries embedded
but it's a big one at over 2,800
milliamp hours there's a removable
microSD card for storing media and
photos taken with the eight megapixel
camera which doesn't like exposure
extremes and could use a friendlier
viewfinder but it does a nice job in
most lighting conditions and little
touches like the dedicated mute and
voice command key and of course the
traditional red notification LED round
out a phone that gets the job done in a
uniquely BlackBerry kind of way the z30
isn't for everyone but neither is it for
no one there's a lot here that's easy to
like and a lot more that makes us
hopeful for what blackberry might show
us in 2014
