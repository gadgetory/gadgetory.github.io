into the budget smartphone market we've
now spent an entire week with this
extremely affordable phone are there too
many sacrifices or is this phone one
that you shouldn't pass up I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is our
full review the motorola moto g we'd
also like to thank our pals over a clove
for lending us this moto G for review
check out clove code at UK to see about
buying your own moto G considering the
price of the Moto G you can't expect a
whole lot out of its hardware in fact
when we ripped open the box we expected
a cheap flimsy toy like phone instead
not only does the moto G look a lot like
it's more mature sibling the Moto X it
feels even more substantial in the hand
thanks to the additional 13 grams of
heft and it's slightly thicker build the
hardware is quite nice not just because
the tiny price tag it is genuinely great
hardware it feels a lot like the Moto X
in hand it bears the curve back which
allows the device to centre itself in
your palm really well and the ports and
buttons are all in the same places of
course the insides of this smartphone
are more telling of where corners were
cut in order to keep costs down but
keeping price in mind which is
impossible not to do with this phone
they're still rather respectable it's
powered by the Snapdragon 400 chipset a
1.2 gigahertz quad-core CPU and Adreno
305 GPU it comes in either 8 or 16
gigabyte variations has only one
gigabyte of RAM a five megapixel rear
camera and a 2070 milliamp hour battery
the price savings are felt through the
lack of some features which come
standard in most Android smartphones
these days LTE connectivity NFC and
Wi-Fi AC the display surprisingly isn't
bad at all measuring 4.5 diagonal inches
it doesn't stretch edge to edge like the
display on the Moto X and also unlike
the Moto X it's not an AMOLED panel it's
a 720p resolution LCD panel which boasts
fairly accurate and vibrant colors
decent contrast and very wide viewing
angles
blacks are somewhat washed out but
White's are balanced and we have very
few overall complaints with the display
its sharp at 326 pixels per inch
and by itself it looks great far better
than we imagined on a $200 foam in fact
that's how we feel about this entire
device every aspect of the Moto G's
Hardware exceeds our expectations of
what a $200 smartphone should feel like
software is an interesting story on the
Moto G unlike Motorola's initial claims
the Moto G's does not ship with KitKat
the plan is now to update the 4.4 kitkat
sometime in January for now though it's
running 4.3 jelly bean and it's missing
the vast majority of the cool features
found on the Moto X mainly due to the
hardware requirements it does not have
touchless control of a wrist flick
camera shortcut gesture since those both
require Motorola's x8 mobile computing
system and it doesn't have active
display notifications since it requires
an AMOLED display to conserve power but
it does offer a few things from Motorola
such as motorola assist for calendar
meetings or sleeping not driving which
also requires the x8 computing system it
has Motorola Care migrate and device ID
and if you use a passcode or pattern
lock when you connect a bluetooth device
you can add it to your list of trusted
devices when connected to trusted
devices the Moto G will not lock when
they disconnect the pattern or passcode
is required to access the device again
outside those few add-ons this version
of software is virtually bone stock
Android and that's important on a device
like this since both storage options are
rather small for the time being we have
no complaints when it comes to the
software but we can't wait to see what
this phone runs like on KitKat
performance isn't exactly incredible on
the Moto G the Snapdragon 400 is visibly
stuttery at times to anyone seeking a
mostly smooth experience on the cheap
however it doesn't get better than this
on Android at this price applications
open and switch smoothly and relatively
quickly flipping between home pages or
panning and zooming in the browser is
like butter but the biggest current
limitation of the Moto G is its 1
gigabyte of RAM applications are closed
more aggressively than we're used to
with 2 or 3 gigabytes of RAM we feel the
forthcoming KitKat update could make
things better in this aspect benchmark
scores are respectable and gaming
performance isn't anything to scoff at
either this device isn't meant to be
again
powerhouse but it can hold its own even
in titles like asphalt 8 it has a
tendency to drop frame rates throughout
asphalt races but it's usually quick to
pick up the slack and muscle through and
finish the race the speaker on the
backside of the Moto G is fairly loud
and quite crisp it's strong in the mids
and highs and light on the lows this
doesn't help for the speakerphone
performance which is laughable caller
sounded robotic and tinny often
distorting the sound enough to make it
difficult to understand that said calls
through the earpiece sounded great with
plenty of volume the lack of LTE was
quite noticeable in web page load times
and streaming music we hit peak speeds
at around 5 megabits per second down and
2 megabits per second up but the average
speeds were closer to 2 megabits per
second down the 20 70 milliamp hour
battery inside the Moto G managed to
impress us to some extent the lack of
LTE Snapdragon 400 and 720p resolution
display were likely helpful in the Moto
G's stamina which consistently managed
to power us through a full day of
moderate to heavy usage on days of it
normally heavy usage though we needed a
supplementary charge mid-afternoon to
last its into the night the camera is
admittedly the low point of the Moto G
even in the very best lighting
conditions pictures weren't all that
impressive there's all on colors like
sufficient detail and are packed with
noise and artifacts and they're
noticeably light on contrast as well we
managed to take a few decent pictures
but they weren't anything mind-blowing
and the instant flight becomes the least
bit scarce image quality suffers
significantly there were many sacrifices
made in order to make the Moto G
fortunately Motorola cut costs in the
least intrusive way possible the Moto G
is a fantastic looking and feeling
handset at a 300 or 350 dollar price
point but it's only a hundred and
seventy nine or 199 depending on
capacity and for anyone who might even
consider a $200 smartphone as a daily
driver to begin with the Moto G is an
absolute steal it's not for everyone
as the stutters and performance reveal
but it's a fantastic option as a
stocking stuffer this holiday season or
a first-time smartphone buyer or even
veterans who don't have a lot of needs
or disposable income it also makes for
an ideal backup phone for those dire
circumstances
and that's why we give the moto G a
seven point seven out of ten that's
