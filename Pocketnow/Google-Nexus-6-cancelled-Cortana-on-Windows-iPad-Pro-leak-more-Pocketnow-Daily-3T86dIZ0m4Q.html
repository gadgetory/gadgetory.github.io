Nexus program already no Nexus 6 leak
down just show a possible iPad pro in
the works we've got a ton of links of
the next Galaxy smartphones in the works
I'm high memory data and in a perfect
world we would all select which day we
want it to be friday and i would just
multiply it this is parking out daily
yes there were some official news today
but they were kind of boring so let's
talk about rumors as Microsoft is the
new job posting right now looking for
developers to work in the company to
bring Cortana to windows and the dot
posting is very specific we did hear Joe
Belfiore confirmed that when those would
get Cortana at some point then specify
when and obviously this is part of the
plan that they should execute before
everybody as this would be the perfect
way to differentiate Cortana from
everything else before Siri gets there
obviously WWDC is around the corner and
Microsoft is always kind of slow now
let's talk about Apple and the kobe
bryant and i know not all of you love
him but he's a good player still you
spotted an apples campus according to
some leaks and according to the league
he was spotted with Johnny I've now we
do know that the iWatch could be coming
soon and obviously the smartest thing to
do if you're gonna focus on health and
fitness us to get you know athletes to
try it out so it seems that Kobe will be
part of the deal stay tuned uh this is
kind of early and speaking of Apple
let's talk about the ipad pro which we
thought would not be launched until next
year according to some analysts but we
got the first leg shots of the chassis
of the tablet and yes it's a 12 point
nine inch big tablet though this is a
very rough cut from machining obviously
the hole for the camera is not drilled
yet the hole for the apple logo is not
drilled yet even though a lot of people
are skeptical that this is real it's not
like if anybody's got this machining
thing at their house that just give it a
try right so it could be that this is
real it could be that Apple is just
testing our prototypes and hopefully it
runs OS 10 now it's all about Samsung
and boy do we have a lot as famous
tipster leaks was on a roll today first
of all he found a lot of the code names
and carriers that will be carrying a lot
of the galaxy phones in the future
we've got the galaxy s5 Prime we've got
the galaxy s5 active / sport we've got
the galaxy mega too and we've even got a
variance of the gear also in these code
names and carrier listings and I could
take all day just giving you the list
links in description for full details as
a hopefully we will be getting some of
this at the event that's happening next
month and finally for the very sad rumor
of the day again famous tipster efflux
was on a roll today and in his tweet
today he said that the Nexus program is
over there will be no Nexus 6 which
makes you wonder what will happen to the
nexus 8 it was rumored from HTC as well
apparently this is the end there will be
no more nexus smartphones which is
really sad as this was the way to stir
Android we didn't really think this
would happen obviously if Google wanted
to make something a standard it would
use the nexus smartphones to do so but
then again we know that the company's
been doing a lot for OEMs to abide to
google standards when it comes to
android sad news hopefully this is not
the case as definitely this will make me
buy a nexus 5 but that is you see the
question of the day what do you think
about this are you sad are you happy are
you looking forward to Android silver or
will you prefer the Nexus program to
continue because in my particular case
unless Google figures out a way to make
this better you know Android silver
better than the nexus program I even
like the name I would be very sad but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
if you want to get the news earlier

channel as well you'd also follow me on
twitter Jaime underscored iveta please
