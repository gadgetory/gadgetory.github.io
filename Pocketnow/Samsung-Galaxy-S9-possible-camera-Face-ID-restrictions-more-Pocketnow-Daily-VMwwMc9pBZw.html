camera innovations on the oddest
smartphone thinkable Apple confirms that
face Heidi will continue to have some
restrictions at the moment and we get
some interesting details and deals for
the Google pixel 2 on Verizon I'm Jaime
Rivera and this video is pre-recorded af
as by the time the video goes live I'll
be travelling like crazy this is
PocketNow daily the official lose today
begin with deals that are extremely
interesting the Google pixel to excel is
one of my favorite phones the Google
pixel 2 is one of Wands and for those of
you in the market Verizon currently has
it with $300 off regardless of which
variant and if you also get that deal
you can also get the Google home for
half the price
that is crazy $300 off is just crazy I
suggest you learn more in the
description other interesting news have
to do with something we reported a
couple of days ago remember that
Microsoft edition Samsung Galaxy Note 8
that was 930 dollars and had a ton of
things that were Microsoft being sold at
the Microsoft Store well we just got
confirmation from Samsung that this is
not a Samsung Microsoft Galaxy Note 8
it's just a note 8
that's preloaded with some Microsoft
software but there's really nothing more
to that and I don't even understand the
purpose of the statement other than you
can currently get a ton of
buy-one-get-one-free deals for the node
8 and you would still have to pay 930
bucks for this note
so yeah and speaking of Microsoft the
very interesting twist today is that the
Microsoft edge browser has now left the
beta for both iOS and Android you can
download it and use it the interesting
part is that I'm still not exactly sure
what differentiates it there are ton of
things that differentiate edge on
Windows 10 and I still don't use it I
prefer chrome but you know it leads me
to ask you do you use third-party
launchers or do you stick to Chrome and
Safari on iOS because that's usually
what I do and for those of you that want
to add somebody else to your way of
unlocking the iPhone 10 through face ID
though I don't know exactly why you
would ever do that but a couple just
wrote correct federighi recently and
asked you know when is that function
going to be added as you have that
functionality with touch ID where one
person adds one finger and the other can
add another you have a limit of five
fingers I believe well Craig respondent
that that whole thing of various users
to unlock an iPhone was never really the
intention and allowing various fingers
for it such ID and therefore we
shouldn't expect that to be a feature
for face ID it's just one face and
that's going to be it and I think that
that's the less creepy way to do it and
just give somebody else your PIN if you
will of that and finally the very
interesting nuisance they have to do
with Samsung and their announcement of
the W 2018 flip phone and I know you're
already scratching your heads over why
is this the hot news today the flip
phones rarely leave China or Japan but
this one isn't special because well
we've got this interesting camera that
has fixable aperture you can fix it
between f1 point five it's currently not
available on any smartphone all the way
up to f2 point four and then the selfie
camera has F 1.9 aperture which is you
know not necessarily something that we
expect from a phone that we don't
consider to be high-end even though the
specs are kind of high-end this is
rather interesting it means that Samsung
brings this really interesting
innovation to camera technology and it
actually leads me to the question today
would you like that fixable aperture
option to reach the galaxy s 9 because
in my case I would love that because
there are certain photos that I was able
to take with the galaxy s6 on F 1.8 that
I can't take with F 1.7 or F 1.6 just
too much light
like for example taking photos of the
crescent moon so I would love to be able
to dial that up or down without
necessarily manual controls and do it
just you know with hardware but hey
