leaked photos that doesn't learn the
lines of belief iOS 10 has a couple of
new perks that actually prove that water
resistance is coming and t-mobile has
justified the odds of roaming with new
deals for the Rio Olympics I'm hi Mary
vera and where I'm from we actually
called Thursday's small Fridays how
about in your case this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals if you are in the market for the
Moto Z or Votto z-force and i highly
suggest you do these feelings are
actually really cool best buy is
offering some new deals for pre-orders
if you pre-ordered today either one of
these phones you're actually getting a
free JBL speaker which is a lot of money
but in addition to that you get forty
percent off every other one of the moto
mods and pretty much every single one
which is a really really good deal
mainly because some of these are crazy
expensive anyways you learn more of the
link in the description other important
deals were announced by john leisure
today t-mobile is now going to be
offering during the whole month of
august not necessarily just for the
period of the Rio Olympics the fact that
you'll be able to be getting free calls
texts and actually high speed roaming if
you are in Brazil using your tmobile
account and that is crazy good you can
imagine how many people are actually
going to be they're not necessarily sure
how many will actually use tmobile that
again after this deal I don't know why
you would consider it twice oh this is
rather interesting as users continue to
dig into what iOS 10 beta 3 can do one
of the ones that we detected today was
actually the fact that the phone can
detect if the Lightning port is wet
something that we currently see with the
galaxy s7 lineup meaning that obviously
since the Galaxy s7 is a water resistant
product that makes all the sense in the
world for to tell you not to charge your
product at a specific time which is what
we can expect for the future of the
iphone if you're getting that same alert
stay tuned moving the spot over to
Samsung after the whole controversy with
consumer reports in the fact of the
galaxy s of an active was a fully
water-resistant ip68 because it didn't
pass the submersion tessic cetera et
cetera Samsung has just come on record
confirming that there is a small batch
of phones that actually has a problem
and that the company has detected an
isolated the problem now
is the interesting catch though if your
phone is within that batch they will not
replace it until you actually have a
problem with it meaning you actually
have to go submerge it for 30 minutes
under a metre of water and test if your
phone's going to survive so let us know
how that went and finally the very
hotness they have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy Note seven we've been covering a
ton of blurry videos we've been covering
a ton of blurry photos and displays and
everything but not until today do we
actually see a full-fledged full-blown
photo of the galaxy note 7 and its full
glory in black and the phone looks
gorgeous again following the topic that
we talked about yesterday with the video
the phone looks extremely sleek which is
not the case with the galaxy note 5 that
was a very beefy phone compared to all
the s lineup that we saw before that so
it's very interesting to see whether
Samsung will actually bring us the large
battery that we're expecting or not
which leads me to the question of the
day look at the leaked photo are you
okay with the fact that this phone looks
sleek and probably will sacrifice
battery life or would you prefer it if
your phone or a version that actually
brings the battery in my case I want the
battery but i also want fast charging on
that thing or at least fashion the
galaxy s7 active because my active takes
forever to charge leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion bren-ji know the way it goes if
