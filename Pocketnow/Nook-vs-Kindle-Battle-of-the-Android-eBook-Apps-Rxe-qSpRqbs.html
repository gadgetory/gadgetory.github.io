just recently Amazon released their
Kindle app for Android and just today or
yesterday by the time you're watching
this Barnes &amp;amp; Noble released their Nook
Reader for Android so we thought what
could we do to find out which one's best
well let's get the same book on both and
see how they do okay so what I've done
is I've gone out to amazon.com and
barnesandnoble.com respectively I've set
up accounts on both and I've purchased
iRobot by Isaac Asimov I thought it was
fitting because well this isn't Android
and iRobot talks about robots so hey not
every ebook that you find is going to be
available for Kindle or for Nook so
doing a one to one comparison was
actually a little bit tricky for me to
find a book that was on both of them I'm
sure there's an awful lot of overlap but
keep that in mind you might have to have
an account on both which I'd really like
it if there were a unified ebook reader
that would read either Kindle or Nook
books but that's a topic for another
article so let's jump right in since the
Kindle app came out first let's take a
look at it now I am running Froyo on a
nexus one so you can see it launches
pretty quickly I added this just a
little while ago and you notice that
automatically upon starting the app
right now I've got a robot in there I
haven't opened it I haven't done
anything with it but using whisper sink
which is Amazon's automatic syncing
protocol it's automatically pushed that
to my phone so I've not seen how fast
this stuff loads so let's go ahead and
take a look okay right there we're in
the book and it opened right to the
introduction page it skipped over the
cover the contents the foreword right to
the introduction you can see here it's
it's pretty good it's pretty quick it's
very very readable if I want to jump
into anything I can do that by using the
go-to I can set a bookmark
see how that's done just like that and
you can see I've got a little doggie er
up here you see if I can zoom in a
little bit there I've got a little dog
gear up in the corner to show me that
this is page marked I don't really like
that because doggy entering your pages
isn't the best practice for books I'm a
hardback fan myself and I don't like it
when people dog in my pages so I would
like to have seen like a little bookmark
icon or something to let me know hey
here's here's where your your page is
but you know what doggie er works just
fine you can see when I scroll to the
next page
that dog ear stays on the page also I
can change my view options change the
background color to sepia which is a
little bit easier on the eyes change it
to white text on black which is a lot
better for battery life and I can also
adjust the brightness if it'll let me
slide this so it won't let me slide but
it'll let me tap various positions
apparently so I can change the
brightness here and that helps with
battery life as well so overall not too
bad I'm gonna go ahead and remove that
bookmark scrolling between the pages is
very quick which I like in the Android
version a lot more than the actual
Kindle version so it does this job it
does it pretty well not bad let's go
back now and you'll notice down here
that it saved the furthest location
Kindle will synchronize your bookmarks
and your books across many devices so I
could go to a Kindle if I actually had a
Kindle device and be able to pick up
right where I left off reading in my
Android phone which is really a cool
feature the desktop version as well so
next let's jump into nook tap on Nook
takes a little bit longer than load or
it looks that way a little bit different
user interface and you'll notice right
down here my robot is in my library but
it's not downloaded yet so to do that I
actually have to tap download and I'm
over Wi-Fi here didn't take too long at
all as ebooks are generally relatively
small so we'll go ahead and open that
now I like to cover on this a lot better
the experience looks better and if you
notice down at the bottom here
we've got this a little stroller to
scroll you through the pages so I think
that's kind of a neat user interface
element it lets you jump through large
sections of the book kind of like
rifling through the pages of a paperback
or a hardback book but let's get to page
turning now you might not have seen that
let me show you here a little bit slower
I can grab here and look at that you see
how I've got kind of a page and I can
flip it all around here it really looks
like I'm turning a page and the same
thing goes backwards it looks really
nice it's very fluid turning the pages
is just as fast here as it is and I can
go through really quick if I want to
without much animation at all but if I
just kind of want to leisurely turn the
pages I can do that I like that a lot
more than I do on the Kindle app and it
really surprised me now you'll notice up
here a little plus sign you tap on that
and it'll dog-ear that that I assume is
there bookmark feature so if we go to
look at bookmarks sure enough but mark
page five just by tapping on that again
I don't really like the dog-ear user
interface if you will I'd much rather
have a little bookmark coming over the
top but they both handle it the same way
that having been said this book cost me
a little bit more on Barnes &amp;amp; Noble than
it did on an Amazon for Kindle so I
actually ended up buying the book twice
that to me is a problem I bought the
book I should have the book it just goes
without saying I would really like to
see hardback books especially hardback
come with a digital copy that you can
just write there you've got it you can
scan a barcode you can type in a code at
Barnes and noble.com and now you have
access to the digital copy of the book
in addition to the paperback I don't
know how they do the page syncing
hardback - digital version but that
another technology altogether now as I
understand it if I want to synchronize
where I am here I have to push either
that sync button or that sync button it
doesn't look to me like it automatically
syncs though I could be wrong
which might be okay you know if you
don't want to sync stuff up you have
control over your synchronizing whereas
on the Kindle app it automatically syncs
for you there's something to be said for
each method both apps as you can see
have a relatively good user interface I
happen to like the way the Nook lays out
your library a little bit better than
the way the Kindle app does but both of
them if you go to shop for ebooks
immediately kick you over to the website
so I don't necessarily like that I'd
like to have some kind of a store inside
the app rather than having to go to a
mobile version of the web but you know
that's just me
you know if I wanted this I could go
ahead and tap to buy now and as long as
I have my credentials saved in the web
browser for in this case Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
it'll automatically deduct that amount
from my credit card and I'm good to go
but if I want to go back to here I've
already got that saved here and the same
thing goes with Kindle I've got my
credentials my username and password
saved in the app it doesn't pass that
over to the web browser and it shouldn't
because they're separate apps but it
makes for kind of a disjointed user user
experience and I don't really like that
however if I'm gonna be buying these
books I'd really like to buy them on my
desktop computer on a really big version
of the website and then just have it
automatically synchronized with my phone
and they both did that very well
so overall the Amazon Kindle I really
like the Amazon Web Store a lot better
than the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble web store I'm
there a lot more but the Kindle app
isn't quite as good as the Nook app in
my opinion and most of that comes from
this page animation and the ability to
just very quickly rifle through the
pages using that scroller on the bottom
so I want to know what do you think
which ebook reader do you like is a nook
or is it Kindle or is it another one go
ahead and leave me comments down below
this video if you've got one that you
really want us to review let me know
that too if you've had a different
experience with Nook or with with Kindle
I want to know that as well if you liked
the video give it a thumbs up if you
like reading books on your phone thumbs
up as well of course to stay up to date
with everything having to do with
smartphones and the mobile lifestyle
you'll want to subscribe to our youtube
channel and showing you the difference
between the Nook and Kindle apps for
Android I'm Joe for pocketnow.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
