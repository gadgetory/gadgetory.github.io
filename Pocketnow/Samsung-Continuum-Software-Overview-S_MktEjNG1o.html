now calm so far in regards to the
Samsung continuum you've seen us unbox
this device you've also seen us give you
a better look at the hardware that makes
up this unique device well now it's time
to actually dive deeper into the
software and show off mainly that ticker
screen that this device brings to the
table let's go ahead and get started all
right now one of the main things that
we've talked about this far with a
continuum is once again that ticker
screen now what Samsung is actually done
is incorporated what they call a grip
sensor so actually on the sides of the
device itself it has a sensor that when
you actually pick the phone up and put
it in your hands that ticker screen and
only that taker screen will actually
turn on and show you something here in
notification so we're go ahead and give
you a demonstration of that right now as
you just saw it actually turned right on
and those are my notifications their
meaning I have to email and to google
talk messages you can actually now slide
this and we can for example press the
google talk it will automatically unlock
it and it will actually show us or bring
us to those messages we can go to all
chats and now we can actually see them
just by opening them up right there
that's where my buddy of mine named Dave
Valley now the same time we can also
come back down here and you see we have
to email so we can actually press the
email shortcut button and that will
bring us right to that portion and there
we go right there looks like we have an
email we can see right now so it's very
cool it's a it's a very fast way to
actually get to what you're looking to
see now on top of that it's going to
always be on always giving you that time
while you're in this menu so that really
takes away the the need if you always
had that need to show a digital clock
here on the home screen because you
always going to have that now but on top
of that you can also incorporate you on
RSS feeds so for example we have ESPN
sports right here and this will actually
cycle and give you many many different
RSS feeds if you click on it it will
actually bring you right into the ESPN
viewer itself and give you that story so
this is actually a custom application
designed for that ticker screen now you
do have some settings you can actually
customize what you want so if you
actually click on the settings menu
you're going to see all of you
for feeds here so these are the ones
that are currently on the device by
default that are automatically set up
and that is SNS RSS as well as events
which of course the events will be the
email the gtalk that sort of thing and
these are all of the RSS feeds right
there now if you want once again you can
actually change your settings there so
we will go right to the settings menu
and will actually kill a few birds with
one stone by showing you first the
version of software this device has
which is android 2.1 so actually show
you that right there 2.1 as you can see
hopefully it's able to focus incorrectly
and the model number of this device is
the i-400 but now we'll go back and we
will actually go to the ticker settings
menu and this is where you can actually
change what will show up there so you
can have weather show up there if you
want to that was actually what's on the
left side here that's that's the weather
if you actually click on that will bring
up the weather which I'll do right now
I'll actually bring up the weather
screen for us there we go for Boston and
of course this is showing a movement
some clouds right now because it is
nighttime or it's getting to be night
time it gets fairly dark in New England
this time of the year so that's why
showing the moon but it also is cloudy
so if I were to do this in the morning
it would bring this icon more or less
and show it down here which is very cool
we're going to go back to you back to
the settings menu now though so we can
see that one more time and kind of dive
deeper into what this offer so once
again you of the social networking too
it's actually if we click on this you
can see you can put Twitter MySpace and
Facebook to actually show up on that
ticker now one caveat i do want to point
out was that as you saw here we had the
email icon showing up as well you're
going to have messaging voicemail email
phone as well as the IM gtalk instant
messaging whatever it may be now that
email symbol is just the generic email
client it doesn't appear to support the
gmail email application at this time so
if you wanted to see your email you'll
have to set it up if you're using gmail
for example you'll have to set it up
using the generic gmail or the generic
email client which as you can see here
will actually go to which is this guy
right here so I'm using gmail but we're
also using Nicias so that we can see
though
is pop up on the ticker now what I want
to do real quick is actually send a
quick test text message so you can see
what happens when that message is sent
to you when your phone's off all right
and we've just pressed send on the other
device so you'll see what happens when
that text message actually comes in so
you're going to get the typical sound
notification as well as the vibration
that's what you have it set to but it's
not going to let your entire screen up
it will actually light up just the
ticker as you just saw there that popped
right up giving us that notification now
if you want to actually click on that so
for example we have the grip sensor so
now we can actually click on the message
itself and that will bring us right into
it there is quite a bit of software here
that we could spend much much time
talking about but instead we're going to
show you a few key aspects aside from
that ticker that we already showed you
you're going to of course have the Bing
search bar which is an acquired taste
either you like it or you don't but
they're also going to include the
blockbuster application so you can watch
a streaming video in that sort of thing
online now you can see we have the VZ
navigator however we've installed the
google maps navigation which is the free
version instead now they've also
included nuance voice commands for their
version of the voice dialing and that
sort of thing naturally this is actually
going to pop right up and it's not going
to work because I'm going to be talking
while we're doing this and unfortunately
if I have it call someone it shows their
number I'm just going to show you the
list of commands here as you can see you
can call someone you can send someone a
message you can go to a certain menu you
can add locations it's very cool what
you can do this is pretty in-depth as
well from the social networking aspect
of things they've actually pre-installed
twee droid right here as well as the
facebook application so those are
already at your fingertips right when
you boot the device up for the very
first time skype and kindle are also
installed right when you build it for
the very first time and one of the main
things that we briefly mentioned in our
Hardware overview was the ability to
dock this device now as you'll see here
there's two applications one says car
cradle and one says desk cradle now this
makes us think that they might be
releasing a dock of some kind in the
near future and that's because this
device has the micro USB port on the
side instead of on the top now to give
you an example of why we believe that if
we click the actual desk cradle app here
let's go and turn it into
the landscape mode and as you'll see
it's a nice big clock with some icons on
at voice search alarm gallery your daily
briefing for news music all that sort of
thing if you want to change the actual
color you can do that if it's you know
on your nightstand whatever it maybe
this would be perfect if there was an
actual dock here that you could dock
your device into apps on your nightstand
with a nice big screen nice super amoled
screen showing you that time so we'll
have to wait and see now also once again
there's that car cradle version 2 and
this is what you're going to be using if
you're driving in the car it's a take on
HTC's version of the car navigation kit
as well you can do a voice search you
can do the navigation you can actually
navigate right to a contact if you have
their address in there may be a pizza
joint whatever it may be wherever you
want to go this will make that much
easier and take your eyes off the phone
and keep them on the road that's the
intent here this device does make use of
Samsung's TouchWiz UI so that's
something to keep in mind if you are
interested in this device you may or you
may not like TouchWiz it's not for
everyone and lastly one thing that I did
want to show very briefly is the
on-screen keyboard it does feel somewhat
cramped at times when you're actually
trying to type on the screen it's
somewhat narrow and it can be a pain to
hit certain characters however it does
do a very good job I've actually making
sure that things are accurate if you do
miss a letter the auto prediction and
the autocorrect is very good so this has
been the software overview of the
Samsung continuum we're very excited to
see what's capable and what's able to be
done with this ticker screen down here
on the bottom we can see a future where
you can even type out full Twitter
updates from that screen without even
having to unlock your phone so we'll
have to wait and see what happens
there's definitely a lot of potential
there if you like this video please give
it a thumbs up and as always thank you
very much for watching everyone and stay
tuned with the next video where we'll
actually test the Samsung continuum
against one of its brethren the samsung
galaxy s thanks for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
