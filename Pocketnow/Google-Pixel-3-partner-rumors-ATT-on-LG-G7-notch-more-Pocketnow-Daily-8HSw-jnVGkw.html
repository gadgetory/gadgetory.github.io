for the Google pixel 3 and 3 Excel along
with some renders LG explains why AT&amp;amp;T
ditched the LG G 7th in queue and
apparently the notch had everything to
do with it and we have an essential
phone don't worry it's not going
obsolete anytime soon I'm hiding that
our Iveta and the pre-recording is the
way to go as again I record in a country
edit in another and then post from
another this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals as
a buy one get one fries continue from
t-mobile and this time not just buy one
manufacturer or variant you can get the
LG G seventh in queue you can get the
Galaxy S nine you get the iPhone 10
there is a list of devices out there and
obviously there is a catch like with
everything but you can learn more about
it in the description now let's talk
about Nokia and hmd usually I don't
cover software updates but this one is
in order I really like what hmd has been
doing for Nokia how they've revived the
brand and they're doing its part I mean
Android what is their way to go and now
they've confirmed that Android P is
going to be available for every single
one of their Nokia phones why because
none of their phones are more than two
years old I find that to be really cool
you can learn more about you know
details and everything in the
description as well now let's talk about
essential as we heard rumors that the
company was looking for investors are
probably selling or whatever for those
of you that currently own an essential
phone don't worry the company has just
confirmed on Twitter that you will be
getting software updates for the next
two years and there will be security
patch updates for up to three years
there was no word over a ph2 coming or
what things will happen over time we
just hope that the company remains and
we hope that they bring another
essential phone at some point now for
those of you wondering why AT&amp;amp;T and LG
didn't work together to bring the g7
thank you it turns out that the company
actually wanted an upgrade to the V 30
because they wanted an OLED display that
provided better color and contrast for
their DirecTV services and they wanted
the experience to be uninterrupted by a
notch so it seems that carriers actually
don't feel as well about the new design
changes and choices that have been
brought by smartphone with OMS thank you
AT&amp;amp;T hopefully you continue doing that
going forward and finally the most
interesting news today I have to do
again with the Google pixel three pixel
three excel there are renders of what to
expect for those of you wondering why
we're getting a knotch
according to the new source we're
getting dual cameras at the front for
reasons we don't understand as again
portrait mode is really good right now
on the pixel too as it is apparently
there will be dual firing stereo
speakers at the front that could be
using that hold notch as well and
hopefully I'm sure there will be a chin
here so it makes sense for them to add
you know the speaker there I wonder what
other companies don't do that a
snapdragon 845 from Qualcomm is well
powering the show and apparently it will
be a Verizon exclusive again and today's
question Allah doesn't know I mean look
at the renders let us know what you
think about this design do you like
where Google is going or do you hate the
fact that it's following ship is in my
case I'm still mixed but I'd love to
know your opinion in the comments down
below
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier photo was I'm talking about
