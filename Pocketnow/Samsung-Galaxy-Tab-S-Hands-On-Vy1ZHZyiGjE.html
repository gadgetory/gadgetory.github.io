launch of the new Samsung Galaxy Tab s
series of Android tablets and after the
presentation we got to try them out for
the first time big thing about the
samsung galaxy tab s is the new Super
AMOLED screen we've known about the
advantages of AMOLED screens for a long
time on smartphones but this is the
first time we've seen them on tablets
will start with the 8.4 inch version
it's very thin and light it's only six
point six millimeters thick of course
there's a thin power button on the side
with the volume control you've got a
microSD slot under the flap as well as
micro USB port for charging there's an
eight megapixel camera on the back with
an LED flashing a 2.1 megapixel camera
on the front take a look at that screen
the colors look great the blacks look
great the video playback looks great we
didn't get to take it outside into the
sunlight but supposedly it looks great
there too we also didn't get to try the
auto white balance that adjusts for
ambient light but that sounds like a
great feature to when compared to an
iPad you can see the difference in color
reproduction and contrasts it's very
plain to see that the galaxy tab s has a
far superior display the 10.5 inch model
is just as nice this bezel hardware
buttons are along the bottom edge when
held in landscape mode as opposed to the
8-inch versions more portrait
orientation hardware home button on both
also is a fingerprint scanner and you
can configure it for multiple users when
you create a new user it goes through
the whole new set of process when you
log in with a separate gmail account and
all that then the user selection menu
will show up on the lock screen both
models include some software
enhancements and bundled gifts as Samson
kassam the gifts app list them all out
for you and you can selectively download
the ones you want or install them all at
once many of the content related gifts
are really just trial subscriptions to
end after a few months bility free
gravity movie is really nice there's yet
another new music app from Samson and
this time is called milk the interface
is very unique with some kind of
circular dial that lets you rotate
through different stations that
there are sliders to lay control
different aspects of the playlist the
size sync feature is something that is
quite interested in since I love that
capability on Windows Mobile a decade
ago unfortunately Samson sidesync demos
seems very slow and laggy there will be
some nice accessories for the galaxy tab
s talus there's a comer that has
multiple folding options that will set
the tablet on a table at various angles
both tablets also have bluetooth
keyboards available for hard plastic
keyboards without a hinge but they do
have a latch so you can attach the
keyboard to the tablet for protection
and travel 8.4 inch Galaxy Tab s will be
3 99 and the 10.5 inch model will be 499
both with 16 gigs of storage when
released in July thats it for our quick
hands-on with the new samsung galaxy tab
s tablets at the launch event here in
New York City be sure to give this video
a thumbs up and thanks for watching
