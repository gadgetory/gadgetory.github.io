we are back at the Samsung move because
we wanted to compare the samsung galaxy
note 10.1 2014 with the Apple iPad I
know it's comparing apples to Samsung's
in this case but let's take a look
anyways probably the first and biggest
difference between these two tablets
nothing to show with these two models
but the concept behind these is an apple
intensity using iPad in a portrait
orientation well the samsung galaxy note
and samsung's intention is for you to
use it in a landscape layout aside from
that comparing these two both screens
are super high-resolution screens we
know about the retina display on the
iPad with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
2014 has a whopping 2560 by 1600 elution
which is w q xga resolution this act on
that the third biggest difference is the
addition of the s pen which is the new S
Pen of course on the iPad you won't find
anything similar course there are
third-party applications which allow you
to draw with your fingers but that's not
the real deal Apple has been renowned
for having awesome bill quality awesome
materials of course the ipad is pledged
ipad is chunky his big is heavy but
note the police box in his dimensions
it's much much lighter than the ipad and
instead of using an aluminum backgrounds
just like the ipad it has the new
background which is this goal letter
just like on the samsung galaxy note 3
of course comes in black and white in
terms of materials of course this is all
glass the button is plasticky and we
have a bow aluminum trim across the
edges while the ipad is full of glass
and of course the home button which is
present on both devices you don't want
to get rid of those talking about the
software this is a tricky one even
though iOS 7 will come out the basic
principles of iOS will still remain the
same we'll have a huge list of icons
which will most probably remind you of
the application drawer on android of
course you can create your own folders
and you can arrange an organized stuff
but aside from that and the addition of
the notification trade iOS is let's face
it boring however Android has its
widgets and
can customize it to your heart's content
the key to the samsung galaxy note 10.1
2014 is the S Pen and as it was
mentioned it is a key to unlock the
tablet and the entire application shoot
try to demonstrate air command right
there which you can pull up like this
and of course you have shortcuts for
Xtreme NO scrapbooker screen right
search for a spider and the pen window
everything can be of course navigated
with the use of the S Pen of course the
back buttons are now capacitive you no
longer have to switch from your S Pen to
your finger to do that so it's a great
implementation of applications which are
tailored and they are inviting you to
use the Esper even though you can't
really compare the specifications on
paper of these two tablets samsung
tablet just kills the iPad in terms of
raw horsepower it oftentimes legs a
little bit especially when turning it
into a other orientation you'll have to
wait a couple of good seconds for it to
actually react even though you should do
this all day long it will still take
like two or three seconds to rotate here
and it's these little things which are a
little bit annoying not to show me about
Android itself because jellybean is fast
it's the implementation of the
applications done by Samsung well as the
iPad whatever you decide to do with it
launch applications get back to your
home screen we don't want Wi-Fi go into
your settings go back you can bug it
down relief it's a fast operating system
and that's really the key to apples
devices so this was a very very short
and quick look at the samsung galaxy tab
10.1 2014 and the apple ipad the apply
but will receive a refresh soon iOS 7
should be out soon if you
has been taken out if you're into the
apple ecosystem take the iPad I've been
answered denied Michael Fisher behind
the camera says I'm moving 2015 thank
you very much for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
