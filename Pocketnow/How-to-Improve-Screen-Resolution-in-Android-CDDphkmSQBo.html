pocketnow.com every screen that you see
has a resolution meaning the number of
pixels down by the number of pixels
across it determines how things look on
the screen the clarity of icons the size
of icons the general use of screen space
if you have a rooted android phone you
can actually change the resolution of
your phone to get better use out of
every pixel on your screen and in this
video we're going to show you how to use
LCD resolution to change the pixel
density of your phone let's get to it
now your Android phone has to be rooted
in order to force the DPI to be
something different than it ships with
so if your phone is not rooted go over
to xda-developers or another android
development community and root your
phone so you get super user permission
now this also works a lot better if
you're doing it on a phone that has a
high resolution display for example this
is the Samsung Galaxy Note it's got 1280
down by eight hundred across you've got
a lot of pixels to work with so when you
make things smaller by changing the
pixel density you can still see the
icons other great phones to do this with
would include now the Samsung Galaxy
Nexus the LG nitro HD the HTC Rezound
anything that goes beyond that WVGA 800
by 480 screen will really you'll be able
to do some cool stuff with so let's
change the screen resolution we're using
an app here called LCD resolution it's
free in the Android Market and literally
it's a slider that lets you change the
resolution by default we've got a 320
dpi pixel density on the galaxy note
let's change this a little bit let's go
down to 290 and we're going to reboot
you're going to see how everything is
going to get smaller and more space
efficient ok here we are and what you'll
notice immediately is everything smaller
on the screen you can fit more on the
screen at one time even the Android
notification bar up here has become more
skinny there's more space between the
icons and thus we could add more if we
wanted to and you can see more things on
the screen at one time a better use of
the display in my opinion when you go
into your other applications for example
the settings you get to see more
settings on the screen at one time it
goes all the way down to privacy now
let's bump the dpi up even higher let's
go all the way down to 240 things start
to break when you go much below that
especially on the galaxy note here the
Android Market may not work the phone
dialer doesn't work so there's a balance
that you have to strike to get the right
dpi that works for you and your device
ok here we are at 240 dpi the icons are
even smaller more stuff is on the screen
the Android notification bar up here is
much smaller it takes up a very small
portion of the screen if we go into
settings we can see down to language and
keyboard even a little bit into voice
and input so you really get to maximize
my screen space but if you go into the
dialer for example it's kind of broken
and if you go into the Android Market
certain apps won't work on your device
because your device is telling the
market that it has a screen resolution
that is not a phone it's not a tablet it
just doesn't work with anything so the
sweet spot on this particular device I
think would be an LCD resolution of
around 300 but you'll you have to mess
around on your device to see what works
for you and let's see what happens when
we change the resolution of the Samsung
Galaxy s2 we've got a lower res 800 by
480 display we're running a third-party
launcher here ADW launcher e^x because
TouchWiz doesn't like when you change
the DPI unless you apply a patch to it
so by default we're at 240 let's go down
to 180 and you'll see what happens okay
here we are we're back we've got more
space on our home screen again the
Android notification shit-shit takes up
less of the screen so really you're
you're getting to see more screen
contents here and ADW launcher works
very well with the higher ppi let's go
much higher than that and see what we
can do with a really really really tiny
a very very small density 198 let's go
back and see what it looks like ok and
now things are kind of unusable you can
barely read the notification tray up
there everything's super small but of
course this means that you could fit
probably 40 icons on your homescreen if
you wanted to but everything else works
pretty well if we go into settings you
get to see almost every setting in one
view that's kind of the beauty of
changing your pixels pixel density
setting you can
take advantage of the screen space to a
higher degree than it comes with from
the factory so again the program's
called LCD resolution you must be rooted
to use this and it's a lot of fun
especially if you have an Android phone
with a higher resolution screen check it
out and let us know what you think let
us know what is a perfect dpi setting is
for your particular device and give this
video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
