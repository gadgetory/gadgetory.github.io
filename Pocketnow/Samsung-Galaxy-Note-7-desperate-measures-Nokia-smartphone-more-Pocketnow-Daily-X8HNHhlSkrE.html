measures to reclaim the galaxy note
sevens in the market more reasons to
believe that Nokia will bring us a
smartphone just emerged and Android is
on a rise but not at the expense of iOS
I'm high metal iveta and aren't there
some Fridays where you just don't feel
like doing anything no right this is
parking out daily official news today
start with statistics for those of you
that are wondering what company is
reigning supreme right now or at least
what I form this is rather interesting
as well even though Apple is kind of
stagnated and a little on the Quai when
it comes to iphone sales that doesn't
mean that the company doesn't hold the
same amount of market share that it has
forever very interesting part is that
Android has grown to eighty eight
percent of the market share worldwide
and if you're wondering where the rest
of the monitor is coming well it's
coming from Windows Phone even though I
do like that alcatel you know idle for
us with Windows it's a beautiful phone
and the operating system looks nice so
far this is rather interesting Evan
glass just recently tweeted a photo that
has to do with Windows Phone it shows a
device that pretty much looks like what
the surface phone should have always
been very interesting part is that
according to blast within his twink he
is kind of referring to the fact that
this product was going to run was going
to run on an intel laptop type processor
so it seems that this project was
happening we're not exactly sure if that
means that it won't happen anymore it
speaking of the company that pretty much
saw it's the mess in the smartphone game
after being acquired by microsoft a very
high-level executive from nokia just
came on record to state that the company
is planning to bring as an android
smartphone and then we should expect
that this quarter now this quarter was
halfway through almost over we wonder
exactly when but then again it makes all
the sense of the world for the company
to make a big splash at CES next year
let's see if that's the case a company
that really needs to figure out how to
not lose market share at all is samson
with the whole galaxy note 7 thing until
the point where there is one thing that
stands out as always
terrible for software updates but we do
hear that there is this beta program in
the UK for nougat now you wonder exactly
why the company is going through all
this ordeal of a beta program just
launched the damn thing like seriously
and finally the very interesting news
they have to do with Samsung again and
the Galaxy Note seven we have a ton of
news actually three the first one is
stating that Samsung is going to push
its software update to limit battery
life for every device in the United
States that's one the second one is that
apparently in countries like New Zealand
same thing is even launching a software
update on November 18 that will block
the devices ability to connect to the
network good the third is that
apparently samsung claims that
eighty-five percent of samsung galaxy
note 7 units have been reclaiming the
United States meaning there are still
units out there that have not been
switched and it leads me to the question
of the day are you comfortable with
there being galaxy note sevens out there
or do you think that some people just
want to keep them as collectibles in my
case I am not comfortable please go swap
