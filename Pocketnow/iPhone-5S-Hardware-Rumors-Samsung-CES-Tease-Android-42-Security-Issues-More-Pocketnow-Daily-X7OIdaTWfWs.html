teases their CES 2013 event for January
eighth and Android 4.2 scores terribly
when it comes to security I'm hi meri
beta wondering if this is the galaxy s4
teaser and this is fucking out daily
that's right we're probably a full year
away from the launch of the future
generation iphone and we've already got
rumors of the hardware coming in the
iphone 5s according to Business Insider
it does seem that Apple will be
experimenting with different colors when
it comes to the next generation iphone
not just the black and white devices
that we currently know now this is kind
of hard to believe considering that
Apple was very reluctant to bring colors
even to the ipod touch lineup but
apparently this is the same process that
we will see what the next generation
device we're also hearing a June
probable launch which I see even more
far-fetched but we'll see about that now
something that's sort of cool is that
apparently xda-developers has figured
out a way to get the nexus 4 to support
4G LTE on AT&amp;amp;T sadly the catch is that
apparently the nexus 4 only supports LTE
on one string band that's not available
everywhere on AT&amp;amp;T it's only available
in certain areas so if I were you just
follow the links in the description for
details on how to get it done on your
device and you can probably get lucky
though we're not going to promise
anything speed of the nexus 4 university
just conducted a test on android and
after throwing a staggering a thousand
two hundred and sixty samples of malware
to android 4.2 jellybean guess what it
was barely able to catch 193 of these
samples which barely scratches the
surface of twenty percent well
third-party applications on this same
tests were able to catch from fifty to
one hundred percent of these samples so
it does seem as of android 4.2 has a lot
of track to cover when it comes to
security though they didn't test iOS or
Windows Phone for that matter we're not
sure you should be alarmed many of us
don't really carry malware protection
software but it's just one thing to keep
in mind and if Microsoft Office is what
has you waiting to jump into an iPad or
an Android tablet from your current
netbook more rumors do have it that we
will be getting these applications in
early 2013 in the past we had heard
rumors that this will happen in March
2013 the only problem is that we
don't know if this will be a full
version of office or not we could be
getting a crop down version of the
services just to not compete with the
surface but time will tell and finally
for the hot news of the day Samsung is
just in our teasers for their CES 2013
event to be held in las vegas on January
eighth they don't provide details as to
what will get the teaser only says that
will be getting something new the cool
thing is that both Michael and I will be
covering the event live in Las Vegas on
that date so while we're at that that
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think Samsung will release at
this event my predictions are galaxy s4
but it could be far-fetched so leave us
a comment down below and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hi Mary
later thanks for watching see you
tomorrow
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
