experience aren't as cool as Galaxy
smartphones but bit sales keep soaring
even with all the smart watches in the
market and Amazon starts playing
hardball against Apple and Google I'm
high Meadow iveta and the phone is too
cool for James Bond then what am I doing
with this iphone this is parking out
daily official news today begin with
AT&amp;amp;T LG and Samsung as the carrier has
just confirmed that it'll be picking up
the watch urbane 2nd edition aka the one
with the cellular data capabilities in
addition to the gear s2 that's also
lte-capable and the price points start
at two hundred dollars was a contract
for either one of the watches or you can
also just pay fifteen dollars a month
for 20 months and the paying 300 bucks
which is actually not that bad if you
compare it to the other option and for
those of you to remember those news of
Amazon considering ditching the Apple TV
and who will chromecast on grounds of no
Prime TV options on these uh to set top
boxes well amazon has just fulfilled its
the threat you can no longer get an
Apple TV or chromecast in the store now
this is seem like if either company are
trying to reach a negotiation which
means you'll just have to look for
another store I don't know where Amazon
is making money here and for those of
you that are in the market for a nexus
6p and Huawei watch this is probably the
best time as a you'll get a fifty dollar
discount on the Nexus 6p if you buy a
huawei watch along with it you just have
to remember that the Huawei watch will
end up costing you no less than three
hundred and fifty dollars at a time when
the asustas and watch will cost you just
129 depending on the variant that you
want it's just the really weird deal but
then again it's a deal and if you've
been wondering what sells more fitness
bands or smartwatches you're in for a
surprise even though apples up analysts
consider that the company sold as many
as four million smartwatches and then
you've got around 400 to 500 thousand
other smartwatches being sold it turns
out that the Fitbit is not losing any
market on the contrary the product is
actually selling as many as five million
units per quarter we're talking 4.6
million than 4.8 million in the second
quarter and now we're talking about five
million
or probably more in this quarter that's
about to end which is a lot of fitness
trackers and yeah you have to consider
this in price points here but then again
it's rather interesting to see that a
product with much less functionality
that is a little overpriced is still
selling more than smart watches and
finally the very interesting news of the
day have Daniel Creek aka James Bond and
the spectre director claiming that
xperia smartphones aren't good enough
for James Bond according to them James
should only use the best then it turns
out to be samsung galaxy phones
eventually we ended up learning that it
was a promotion deal apparently well
Sony was only giving away 5 million
dollars to Craig in addition to 18
million for promotion of the movie and
then Samsung offered the same five
million dollars to Craig but 50 million
dollars for the promotion so yeah you
can expect bond to be using a samsung
galaxy but it does lead me to the
question of the day what do you think
about this i mean the the fact that
James Bond use a galaxy phone make you
actually want to buy a galaxy phone and
not a Sony experience because in my case
it doesn't and sony xperia smartphones
are superior than galaxy phone than
certain things leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know what you think
friends as always you know the drill if
you want to get them over before this
video was filmed sure you follow us on
finding out conscript range of channel
