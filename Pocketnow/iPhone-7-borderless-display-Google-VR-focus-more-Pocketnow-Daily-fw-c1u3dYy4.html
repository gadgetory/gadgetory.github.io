on the display and the fingerprint
sensor within some additional ones also
claimed that Google will take Android vr
seriously and I'll Jesus decided to
compete with the GoPro in a more
productive way I'm hi Mary Vanna and
yeah you can bet that I have my calendar
set and I'm waiting for the new Voltron
like there's no tomorrow this is parking
out daily know the official news today
did not begin with deals those were kind
of hard to come by today instead we have
official news of another deal that
happened where sandisk just got acquired
by Western Digital for sixteen billion
dollars for those of you that are not
familiar as to what sandisk is let's
just say that the reason why you have a
microSD card on your phone is because
sand is pretty much invented it even
though back then they were called trance
flashcards if anybody remembers that but
yeah sandisk is moving on let's see what
Western Digital brings other very
interesting news are LG's launch of a
new cam LTE that pretty much honors its
name it's an action camera like a GoPro
but the idea here is that it's also
connected to LTE because it allows you
to stream whatever it is that you're
doing live which I don't necessarily
believe most people want to actually do
and they prefer to post edit things so
that you know at that time where you
fell off the bike won't be shown on
video or the fact that if you're surfing
you most likely don't have reception
there but hey that just got launched
let's see when we get it now twitter has
been on fire yesterday mainly because of
some acclamations that Google will take
VR seriously in i/o we had heard that
before a couple of weeks ago where it
seems that the major selling point for
Androids feature has to do with VR we've
kind of seen things and Android in that
we haven't been able to confirm but
apparently again this will be a separate
platform we're not talking about using
your phone and turning it into a VR
headset even though that's not
necessarily bad we'll see what we get
and speaking of Android those of you
that are wondering which platform is
reigning supreme right now well we
always know that Android is the one
that's winning
but now it's by a larger margin right
now it's currently owning seventy-seven
percent of the market and the that
company that owned the twenty-six
percent three quarters ago Apple they
only own 21.1 percent it is clear that
Android is on a roll obviously it has a
lot to do with the broader availability
of Android which Apple is addressing
with the iphone as e but also because
hey android phones this year are really
good and finally the coolest news today
have to do with the iphone 7 suppliers
weren't too happy with the fact that
apparently not much innovation is coming
but according to some other sources we
are getting no borders on this display
apparently the fingerprint scanner will
be a bit on to the split just like we've
seen with the LG technology and we know
that LG is the apples major partner so
it could be that we are getting this
display matt this makes sense i mean
what was the last time you held your
iphone with your fingers like this
through the bezel nobody does that
people hold your phones widely all
around the device and as long as that's
sturdy enough i don't think that that
wouldn't make sense but hey it leads me
to the question of the day when you like
a phone to have this feature is it's
something that you would look out for
because i would definitely like to see
something like that mainly because that
would allow Apple to give us a larger
display on a smaller chassis it would be
really cool leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get these news earlier before
the video was filmed but was on Fargo
calm and hit that subscribe button down
below for more videos like this one just
you could also catch our videos on
vessel vessel calm / pocket now and
follow me on Twitter Jaime underscore to
be better on Instagram it high medley
