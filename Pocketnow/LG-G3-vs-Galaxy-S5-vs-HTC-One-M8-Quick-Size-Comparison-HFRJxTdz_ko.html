the new LG g3 to be a monster smartphone
into a degree you'd be right it's quite
a big handset but then again so is every
other modern android flagship I'm
Michael Fisher let's see how the g3
stacks up against its immediate
competition in the footprint category
with pocket now's g3 vs s 5 vs 1 m8 size
comparison flanked by its opposition the
g3 strikes a kind of middle ground in
terms of shape it's not quite as bulbous
as the one I made but it's also nowhere
near as sheer cited as the flat Galaxy
s5 it's also the middle child in terms
of thickness and coming in beefier than
the s5 but slimmer than the HTC device
get it next to the One m8 in the hand
and you can see how big LG's focus was
in maximizing screen real estate though
the g3 packs a 5.5 inch display to the
htc's 5 inch panel the dimensions of the
face are about the same thanks to HTC's
boomsound speakers around the sides the
color difference here combines with the
M aids clever curvature to create an
optical illusion the g3 looks thicker
though the opposite is true in the hand
the difference in material choice
between aluminum and plastic makes the
One m8 seem even beefier than its 160
grams while the g3 feels lighter than
its 149 that situation reverses itself
when you bring the galaxy s5 into the
picture at 145 grams the s5 is almost
the same mass but it feels less
substantial somehow probably thanks to
its more conventional box-like
construction also thanks to that the
Samsung device feels thicker even though
it isn't and of course we see the same
screen size discrepancy up front 5.5 to
5 inches overall we're left with three
great examples of how choices and
materials and design have a big impact
on the perception of a device while we
still think the One m8 has the market
cornered on a premium look and feel the
size penalty imposed by its front firing
speakers is noticeable when the g3 is
packing an extra half inch of diagonal
higher res display and while the galaxy
s5 might be more appealing on paper to
those with small hands in the real world
it's boxy unremarkable design actually
makes it look and feel clunkier in
certain scenarios while it's still early
in our review process we can safely say
that the attention LG is paid to
industrial design with the g3 won't go
to waste in the detailed comparisons to
come will have full comparisons and a
full review up soon at pocketnow.com
stay tuned for that and make sure you
subscribe here on youtube and on social
media so you don't miss them till next
time this has been michael fisher with
pocket now thanks for watching and we'll
see on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
