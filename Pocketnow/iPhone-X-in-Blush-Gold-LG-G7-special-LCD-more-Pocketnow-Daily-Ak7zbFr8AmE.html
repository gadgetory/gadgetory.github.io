still a possibility according to some
sketchy leaks the LGG seven might bring
yet another LCD display but it's not
just any LCD and the iPhone 8 plus is
being questioned when it comes to water
resistance I'm Jaime Rivera and let me
know if you agree in the comments this
is the coolest t-shirt ever
thanks ripped apparel this is parking
out daily official news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for the
Google pixel to excel and I highly
suggest you do right now it's currently
$200 off on the Google store obviously
there's a catch you have to grab the
phone on financing which actually makes
even more sense if you're eligible you
can learn more about the deal in the
description now it's all about HTC as
the company has just announced its vive
pro and made it official that pre-orders
have begun today 799 bucks but that buys
you a lot you get six months of vive
port in addition for those of you
wondering why would you buy this one
well you got 78 percent more screen
resolution you get HiFi stereo you know
earphones in addition to a couple of
other improvements and for those of you
that still want to get the old vive we
can get that for $4.99 which is not bad
at all and for those of you using an
iPhone 8 plus I would highly suggest you
don't dip that thing in water at least
for now
Apple has requested Worcester on its
manufacturer of the iPhone 8 plus to
halt production for two weeks and
apparently the reason why is because
there are sketchy rumors that there have
been counterfeit parts being used for
the water resistance that's not good so
again just buyers beware this is a
problem with the A+ let's well the
spotlight over two LG we're still
waiting to see when we get the new g7
I'm personally waiting for it but as it
turns out it's underwhelming a lot of
people because the rumors are that we're
getting another LCD fare in mind
LG's attempt at o LEDs hasn't really
been great particularly with that new LG
V 30s thank you whatever I'm getting
screen burnin or whatever you call that
thing
so yeah apparently this LCD won't be any
sort of LCD it's
gonna be 35% more power efficient than
any LCD out there which is great we
can't wait to see what we get and
finally the most interesting news they
have to do with the iPhone 10 as
apparently Apple plants to bring another
color option and these are sketchy
rumors they emerged on Twitter where we
see the sim tray in the blush gold color
option and if you remember when rumors
began of the iPhone 10 we always heard
that there were three colors and for
some reason the blush gold just didn't
make it
apparently Cupertino is still planning
to bring the phone when we don't know
probably in this event that's gonna
happen on March 27 we don't know yet
we'll keep you posted but and today's
question let us know do you think that
another color option is going to help
Apple saram sell more iPhone 10s this in
my case not that color at least for me
but leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion France again
