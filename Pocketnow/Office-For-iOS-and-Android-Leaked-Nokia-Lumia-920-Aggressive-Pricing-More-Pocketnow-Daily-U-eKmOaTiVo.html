gets leaked noga gets even crazier about
their pricing for the Lumia 920 an HTC
is down yet again in results I'm hi Mary
vera and yeah I dunno we lost the game
today but this is still my team and this
is out daily that's right if you
thought that Nokia went crazy by pricing
their Lumia 920 for just 99 books after
2-year contract on AT&amp;amp;T well think again
because if you try to get the phone off
contract you only pay 450 bucks talk
about it insane price though you'll
still have to get a plan to be able to
buy the phone at that price range still
this is a very premium device and I
would call this a very good deal you
should consider now let's talk about the
new battle and this time for 1080p
displays on devices first of all we've
got CTE teasing a new windows phone it's
got a 5.9 inch display and yes 1080p
resolution talk about something that's
much bigger than a phablet I don't even
know what that's going to be called but
then we've got Sony teasing a new Yuga
device and you guessed it with a 1080p
display though no dates for that and
then we've also got a new sharp device
with a 1080p display though we're not
even going to talk about that those
devices rarely ever get to the United
States or Europe now speaking of
phablets galaxy note 2 customers can now
rejoice or at least those on sprint
because Samsung just pushed a new
upgrade that allows multi window support
if you remember this is one of the
features that we praise a lot in our
international galaxy note 2 review but
sadly wasn't included on the US variants
so make sure you hit the over-the-air
update feature in sprint and we'll keep
you posted on the rest of the devices
now sadly one of the bad news of the day
is that HTC has just posted their
quarter results and well they're
extremely bad they're down a staggering
61 percent wouldn't compared to the same
quarter last year just to give you an
idea for every dollar that they made
last year they've barely made 39 cents
this year and by the way that's actually
nineteen percent below what they made
last quarter these are terrible results
for HTC and we are hoping that their
event happening on November 13th with
verizon will help them bring a new
device that will help them regain their
glory or at least we're hoping for HTC
is a great company and finally for the
hot news of the day leaked images show
version of microsoft office in the works
for iOS and Android eventually according
to the source the Iowas version of
microsoft office will be available
sometime in March 2013 and then the
Android version will follow shortly that
leads me to the question of the day how
bad do you want office on your iPad or
Android tablet in my case if this is
just another version of microsoft office
that's mobile not really interested but
if they figure out a way to bring
full-blown office on your iPad or
Android tablet meaning pivot charts in
Excel just about everything to be able
to create on your mobile device I'm
definitely interested leave us a comment
down below and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on parking now calm
please give this video a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw I'm hi never
