final out selling digital music
downloads but even film is making a
comeback
why is Kodak resurrecting ektachrome
because of this bad boy here a little
outside of our normal event coverage
this editor grew up playing with old
film cameras so we have a soft spot in
our hearts for this soft fuzzy vintage
look of 8 millimeter film and now we can
capture that footage with modern support
features like an articulated LCD to
frame your composition and a jog dial to
control settings on the camera the kodak
super 8 camera is a delightful throwback
to an era when we all weren't walking
around with video production equipment
in our pockets the camera uses super 8
film cartridges each with 50 feet of
film inside cranking at 24 frames per
second that's a little less than 3
minutes per cartridge the camera frame
rate is adjustable between 18 24 and 36
frames per second modes what's new for
this kit here is the ability to record
audio using the line in saved to an SD
card and exciting modern advancement for
film thanks to an image splitter behind
the lens while frames are being exposed
output can be referenced via the LCD or
can be fed out through an HDMI cable to
a proper monitor Kodak is using a
standard C mount screwing the lens to
the front of the camera body the super 8
will ship with a fixed focal length 6
millimeter lens from Rico but any lenses
using this mount will be compatible even
older in vintage glass all in a metal
housing with extremely high build
quality and a clean attractive look now
film is a cool throwback but most folks
probably won't be showing their
masterpieces on projectors and Kodak is
taking a few more steps to bring this
content into the 21st century included
in the price of processing Kodak will
also deliver 4k video scans for editing
or sharing footage it's a compelling
package for the purist who enjoys film
and the infrastructure of processing and
digitizing will be appreciated by people
looking to move this content into their
workflow as efficiently as possible the
super 8 camera will launch initially in
very limited numbers with the special
edition body in gray we don't yet have
an exact release date or pricing
information the initial batch could be
collector editions close to $2,000 a pop
but the actual consumer release later in
the year will be much more accessible
it's a sexy little shooter merging the
best qualities of what indie filmmakers
of old loved about film with an updated
twist bringing the experience into the
modern age I want one I want one so bad
as always thanks so much for watching be

our full CES 2017 coverage and help us

Carlos bag now some gadget guy on
