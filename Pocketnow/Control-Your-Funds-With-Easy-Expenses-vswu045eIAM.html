now calm and today I'm going to show you
a little application that will help you
balance your checkbook and keep track of
your expenses and the program is called
easy expenses and as you can see here we
have a flow sheet and it gives us the
data that we have input as a positive or
negative balance and if you're like me
you know how difficult it is to keep
track of your balances so this actually
makes it a lot easier than just writing
in a checkbook ledger so the first thing
you'll notice is we actually have a
spreadsheet of our expenses and our
income so we give you a positive mount
and then all your negative mounts and
you can scroll over and make notes about
what you spent and what kind of expenses
you had so we're going to go into
options real quick and this is where you
can actually change your location of
where you want all your data to be saved
so it's in my easy expenses right here
and you can make your own folder if you
want so okay you can also change your
receipt number so if you want to start a
new receipt you can do that as well and
you can add it finger friendly entries
which I'll show you that in just a
minute and you can also do this this
neat little program is called a quick
quick edit so save that and I'll go into
new item okay so right here we can
actually go so quick entry and it gives
you many categories the only thing about
this program as it doesn't know how you
edit your own category so if you want to
pick something generic just I guess pick
entertainment or something so it gives
you the date so you can pick the date so
we'll just say it's for yesterday okay
and we're gonna make it like thirty-five
dollars to say it's gas so thirty-five
dollars and forty-five cents and next if
it's an income you can add in kemah
don't make it a positive balance so
we'll go next I will say my cash and
myself paid for it and we'll just play
gasps okay
and okay and there it will give you
it'll show you the expense that you just
had and your AC number so it was number
10 and gas and we'll just say
entertainment and now if we go here on
to menu and then show info would totals
it'll actually give you the total
balance for this month and last month in
your grand total so if the positive was
2870 1.68 and you spent 670 4.92 the
total is 2196 dollars and seventy six
cents and i'll show you the total for
this month as well so because there is
no positive balance it'll show you a
negative 7546 okay and you can also copy
that to the clipboard so just copy you
know what it'll you can paste it
anywhere and your windows mobile device
so okay okay if we go down to menu we
can also perjurer entries so if one
delete entries from a certain date so
this one will delete it will also give
you calendar so we will delete anything
before march second so a month ago so
we'll just a cancel so we don't want to
do that and it just came out today and
this is actually version 0.94 dot 4 and
it's a premie application if you're the
type of person that has problems trying
to keep track of your balances and your
checking account because and as we all
know it is pretty easy just to swipe
that card and have your expenses taking
directly out of your account and many
people I know have overdrafted their
accounts before just because you lose
track of how much money you have in your
account so anyways thanks for watching
I'll post a link on pacquiao com that's
how to get</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
