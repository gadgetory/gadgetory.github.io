galaxy s6 variants for MWC 2015 HTC
Smart Watch plans seem to go beyond just
Android wear and believe it or not Apple
is now worth more than Microsoft and
Google combined I'm Jaime Rivera and I
think the sound is fixed so now if I
could only figure out the studio
lighting this is pocket out daily
brought to you by lynda.com the official
news that I have to do with Apple love
it or hated the company broke another
record as of yesterday it was the first
company in US history to close with 700
billion dollars in market capitalization
which is just crazy but the stock market
went even crazier today as at the time
of recording of this video Apple was
with seven hundred and twenty two
billion dollars after what happened and
that means that it's now worth more than
Google and Microsoft combined with her
which are shy of seven hundred and
eleven billion combined together that's
really crazy for a company that builds
only a couple of smart phones or table
tablets computers and software but as
Tim Cook mentioned in his interview
today well a lot of it has to do with
the Turner growth which went from a 1
billion dollar business to 38 billion
dollar business in a few years and it
continues to grow and Apple is expecting
more let's see what the Apple watch
brings now let's move the spotlight over
to Apple's biggest competitor Samsung
has we have Bloomberg reporting that
they have trusted very trusted sources
confirming what we should expect for
March 1st with the galaxy s6 and it
pretty much repeats most of the things
that we've already heard number one
we've got two devices one with a wrap
around which is a niche display and
another one with a regular display at
both devices will have a 5.1 inch
display as well and apparently there are
some very interesting specifications
like the samsung processor that we've
already talked about etc listen
inscription to hear what we are getting
hopefully we should learn more on March
1st now one of the biggest mysteries of
2015 is the HTC One m9 not because we
don't have enough leaks we do problem is
that apparently HCC is using decoy so we
don't really know what the device looks
like and even though we are not fans of
concepts or renders you
Emily's got these really interesting
leaks of the front panel of the device
and we've got this designer providing us
some very interesting final designs that
we should expect for the HTC One m9 and
every single one of the elements is
considered here from the back that we've
seen in leaks to the front that we saw
from M leaks really interesting photos
looks and links to the description
because the device looks this beautiful
indeed
and speaking of HTC let's begin the
rumors on the HTC Petra as apparently
this is the codename for the company's
first SmartWatch and reports are that it
won't be an Android wear SmartWatch
account it'll be running this rtos rtos
and apparently this OS is going to be
based on Android somewhat probably a
fourth version of Android but it'll
actually be built to support fourth iOS
and Android and was probably Windows
Phone given the fact that we have HTC
Windows phones in the market and there
are some very interesting additional
leaks that we are waiting to confirm
we're most likely not going to hear
about this product at MWC but hopefully
we're wrong and finally for the very
interesting and disappointing news of
the day we've got some statistics on
wearables and it's not a pretty picture
in a full year full fiscal year of 2014
only 4.6 million units were sold and
we're talking about all wearables pebble
Android wear and everything and that's
what we actually want to talk about
Android wear barely made 15 percent of
that market meaning they only sold seven
hundred and twenty thousand smartwatches
last year which is really crazy
considering the fact that we've got some
really cool Android wear devices and
there is so much Android in the world
it's the biggest platform in the world
why is it that Android wear has not sold
as much as the rest of its competitors
and it leads me to the question of the
day what do you think is wrong with
Android wear for it not to sell so well
in my case I'll be honest with you that
battery life that is pretty much it for
me if it had great battery life I
wouldn't care but leave us a comment
down below what do you think is wrong
with Android wear and folks have you
