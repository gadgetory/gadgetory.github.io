hey everyone danny webster here from
parking calm and today i'ma show your
new program called Smart Money and it's
actually a game pack and we'll go into
some of the games so the first game we
have here is dual blind so 12 that and
we just enter the game so the objective
of this game is its kind of based on
like a chess or checkers well you have
to fight and you have a king and a queen
and your pawns and of course all your
other pieces so you kind of like duel
with each other so if i go here and then
that peaceful tool and it will actually
show you which one wins and which one
loses so now we have another piece here
we can go here if I want to and they can
either you can either move your pieces
back and forth and if you win then
they're pleased eyes so you have to go
through the entire thing and it depends
on which one wins and which one loses so
if if you lose all your pieces then you
of course lose and if you lose your king
of course lose and it the same goes with
them so we'll go back so the next game
is just simple checkers and we all know
how to play checkers so it's pretty
simple and we'll just close out of this
game next game we have here is dig in so
just enter the game and this one's
pretty difficult you actually have to
you have to get three or more pieces of
fruit to be next to each other but the
only way you can move is let's say you
have to move a line or another line to
switch it so let's see here and it gives
you points or minuses points based on
your move so it's pretty difficult um it
definitely requires a little bit of
brain power so close out of this one so
we have the next game is get edgy this
one's that this one's a pretty good game
you have to actually find puzzle pieces
that match each other so we can go into
enter game let's see here so each color
has to correspond with another color so
let's see here
and then once you find a sequence of
colored squares you actually win and you
level up so we can go to the next one
and it just becomes increasingly more
difficult so close out of this game the
next game is ghost slider so I'll just
enter this game so it's another puzzle
we have to arrange the pieces to
actually get the correct sequence of
images so there we can see that it's the
correct image and it becomes
increasingly difficult throughout
throughout the game so the next one we
have a four right for right now we have
a three by three of course that becomes
a lot more difficult than the last one
so let just close out of this game so
the other games on this game pack argha
moku memory peg solitaire poker mania
reversi Sudoku and who is who and that's
extra puny game cuz you it's kind of
like a code breaker game in which you
have to play as bunnies and find the
correct sequence of bunnies to unlock
the next level so i'll post a link
apartment outer columns to how to get
