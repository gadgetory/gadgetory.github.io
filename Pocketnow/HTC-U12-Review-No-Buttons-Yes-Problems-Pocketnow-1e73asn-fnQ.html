of you that were worried about the
future of the company after the whole
Google transaction this is proof that
they're here to stay but there are some
interesting changes to the way
smartphones are approached here some
good some bad
the question is is it really worth 800
plus dollars let's find out I'm Jaime
midal you bet I would pocket now this is
our review of the HTC u12 plus launching
a phone in late May early June is tough
and specially if you price it high at a
time when the oneplus six was just
launched that being said the HTC u12
plus is a very nice-looking phone I've
heard a lot of people praised it for its
design I have to admit that I'm kind of
mixed there are things I like things I
don't I definitely do praised this
translucent back it is unique it is
something that we need in the market om
is trying to figure out new approaches I
also like how it feels in the hand as
well and I like that there's a case
bundle in the box
because I'm sure these won't be easy to
find I also like the internals we have a
brand-new kwaka snapdragon 845 in
addition to Six Sigma bytes of RAM
options for 64 or 128 gigs of expandable
storage in addition to a 3500 milliamp
power battery no wireless charging in
tow I'd be 68 water it does resistance
where I'm mixed about this design is
everything to do with this display and
not because of its quality the six inch
Super LCD 6 is gorgeous I find it to be
one of the best implementations of an
LCD great blacks great color saturation
my biggest problem really is the fact
that these bezels make this phone look
very dated for this day and age but hey
for those of you that complain about the
case of notches and 2018 this is
probably one of your best options right
now
other things that I don't like her
honestly small little details Lynne the
fit and finish minor things like how the
display protrudes the chassis which
reminds me of the 1:9 we all hate it and
then the other case is these buttons or
the lack thereof like I have no problem
in making the move two capacitive
buttons if that's the future the biggest
problem is the implementation where I
press the button up here and I feel the
vibration down here and then you have
the issue that sensitivity options are
rather limited to mostly what you could
do with edge sense and that's about it
and speaking of edge sense there are
some really cool things that come with
the blend of software squeezed once to
launch the camera at least in my case
that's my favorite gesture right now
squeeze and hold you've got another one
and I really like this new feature where
you DoubleTap on one side of the display
to get it to become one handed mode to
that side DoubleTap the other and it's
lights to the other
these are definitely features that make
a lot of common sense now the fact that
HTC Sense is now launching without a
number version means a lot the company
continues to downplay its relevance as
stock becomes more important
I love the duplicate apps continued to
be a non-issue
I love the widgets I consider them to be
my favorite my biggest complaint with
the service is really the fact that the
company addresses bloat from third
parties but provides bloat of its own
sure you can turn off blink feed and
turn off the notifications from news but
I hate the fact that they're activated
at the beginning and then you've got the
HTC Sense companion which uses a I and
theory to try to suggest things you
might care about when honestly I just
really would not like to be bothered
again these things are optional I just
find that ironic that the company says
that it's addressing bloat and yet well
we get most is that particularly from
its own services now I've been using the
HTC you 12 plus for about two weeks on
and off between New York City and
whether I'm at a city now I like things
like for example phone calls
I love the sound quality of the stone I
love the speakers
bro abbreviation for professional which
in turn stands for something or someone
I can't really say that I like the
approach to audio with the headphone
jack because there isn't any I don't
remember getting a dongle in the box and
I'm not sure if all of you are gonna get
the you sonic headphones in order to be
able to take advantage of the whole
approach to active noise-cancelling a
thing that's decent I would say is the
battery it's not the best out there
considering the size of the battery pack
it'll get you through the day you'll
just have to get used to the fact that
at some point it'll probably struggle a
little depending on your usage and then
when it comes to the elements of the
user interface I will tell you this much
the phone performs great with things
like graphics intensive games it just
delivers and it has a lot to do with the
specifications the funny part is that
even though this user interface lacks
bloat where you will notice some stutter
and this is odd this is actually the
first HTC phone that I would say that
I've noticed any sort of stutter and
sense when you launch the app tray for
example but it only happens once and
then once you start using it probably
once it loads in RAM then it'll just not
give you any issues afterwards so just
keep that in mind
probably a software update will fix that
now the camera runs because we've got
four cameras here are actually really
good for the most part I mean they got a
great DxO mark rating the experience is
interesting though for example these
twelve ultra pixels on the primary
shooter are great they have me really
impressed bright color saturation and
detail no less than what you'd expect
from a flagship in this price range and
performance in low light is also killer
with some amazing performance in really
dark scenarios portrait photos are good
we know that most phones struggle with
this and even portrait photos with the
two selfie cameras are really good again
not perfect mainly because we've
experienced that a lot of companies
don't get this right all the time I
guess my main disappointment is video
and things I wasn't expecting where for
example I only noticed the belies a ssin
at 1080p video and the primary
but 4k video doesn't seem to brani to
the experience and as much as I'd like
to praise the wide-angle experience with
selfie video again I don't notice any
stabilization included here to conclude
I have to say the HTC u12 plus is a
really good phone what I would recommend
it checks a ton of the buttons of what I
would expect from a flagship in 2018 the
biggest problem is the fact that this
phone was launched too late and priced
too high
I've always said this HTC phones are not
launched in a bubble there's competition
out there and when you have devices like
the Samsung Galaxy has nine plus now
being offered a buy one get one free or
you have the one plus six price really
aggressively and providing comparable
features and experiences to the e 12
plus it's really hard for me to sit here
and say yes buy this over that I can't
if you're an HTC fan then definitely go
for it significant improvements when
compared to the U 11 but this is not the
best phone for $800 not at that price
range but then again this is just my
opinion let us know in the comments what
you think of the HTC u12 plus while
you're at it make sure you follow us on
