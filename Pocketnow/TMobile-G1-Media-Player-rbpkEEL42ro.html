we're going to look at the music
capabilities on the t-mobile g1 so I
start from home I can go and search some
music
and we get the screen with four big
white boxes and agreement on them and
you have to choose which type of media
you want to search for so for the album
you see all our albums are living with
it most of them don't have album art I
think this through windows media player
on the desktop and it works well it
shows up as a USB device you can sink
too but Albemarle is not transferred as
it is with Windows Mobile unless your
mp3s or your WMA files have em are
embedded already you can fix this by
using my technique to the album art to
display on touchflo 3d on the touch pro
in touch diamond there's some software
they can use to embed images as album
art and then when I think they should
define so it's kind of like the iphone
you have to scroll through here like
this however it's also kind of like
Windows Mobile in that we can search
see that I just type the letters and get
a life that includes those words very
nice easier class
sandwich songs
not bad
now one thing that was annoying is if
you plug in USB port for audio you can't
charge it and play music at the same
time unless you turn off the USB mass
storage mode so it doesn't realize that
you're charging instead of thinking on
the computer so you have to manually go
into the settings and shop that USB mode
in order to listen to music while
charging the device i use the HTC
adapter in the car it's the same HTC
port so which I've already got for the
other HTC devices so that's really great
and then we have some music playing with
the album I shine
good point there we are we've got
shuffle repeat modes up here there's are
now plain button
and it's really basic mp3 player again
settings we can do library party shuffle
users ringtone delete at playlist
there you go now one thing about this
android is there's no video player
included by default but you can download
one and it requires that you manually
convert some videos into a proper format
and list them on there it's not a easy
sink and go thing like I'm windows
mobile we just set up on that playlist
so that's it for media</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
