surface many that I mean the surface pro
3 and we snag a demo device the LG g3
makes the most of its last week in the
shadows by leaking even more of itself
to a hungry public and musician Ali
Spagnola drops by to tell us what it's
like to compose a ringtone and a lot
more all that and much more ahead on
episode 097 of the pocket now weekly the
once-a-week audio podcast where we
discuss smartphones tablets wearables
and other gadgets you dreamed of owning
when you were a kid from boston
massachusetts I'm your host Michael
Fisher and sitting in the copilot's seat
somewhere west of Kitty Hawk today's
co-host Taylor Martin and welcome back
to the show sir how do you know I'm not
in Kitty Hawk I know that you know
you're never and no one's in Kitty Hawk
there's a museum there in some Hills
that's all I've been there it's actually
really nice I would like to go some day
actually I'm actually used it in
aviation I'm just gonna throw this out
there i'm actually about two months from
probably moving to the coast Wow living
in wilmington man well that'll be eyes
you will you two will come to know the
smell of the sea and its bountiful
riches and I'm my gonna tan I doubt that
will happen requires like I said and
that's pretty much impossible for me so
well Taylor hasn't been on the show in a
while but that's not the big news the
big news of the day of course is that
for the first time in history and I
didn't know this until immediately
before the show we have Microsoft maven
and senior editor and most senior
pocketnow member in terms of in terms of
time in grade Adams elane Adam welcome
to the weekly brother hello there I'm
really glad that you're joining us it's
going well Adam joining us from a from a
car outside of it somewhere in somewhere
in new york i'm taking a Quester and
watch the westchester new york calling
in from a Lumia 1020 because why how
else would Adam Lane me joining us I
love this and Adam is here primarily to
talk for the first part of the show to
talk about the surface pro 3 Adam do you
have the surface pro 3 with you right
now the review device not right now it's
on my desk okay that's all right you're
gonna work from memory that's all right
I trust you to do that Taylor did you
watch any portion of the live
announcement or were you busy I did some
live blogging I didn't do it I read some
live blogging and actually during the
live blog i was talking with a microsoft
employee who was also sitting across
from me in the coffee shop Oh kind of
sort of ignoring me because I don't
think he wanted to talk about it so it's
more like me talking to him asking
questions and he's like looking up at me
every so often like kind of sort of
nodding his head so I'll shut up you
know maybe he might have been on the
surface mini team it might be waiting
bent out of shape about that it was very
upset so we should talk about that last
week on the show if you missed it we SAT
here and we talked about what we were
expecting for the microsoft event which
happened on on tuesday and i SAT here
and i said something like you know like
we had run a story i think i'm i wrote
it a news stories like surface pro 3 to
launch on Tuesday at tuesday's event and
we're all sitting here on there just
going basically like no that's crap that
of course that's not going to happen
like the surface pro 2 has only been out
for six months why would they do that no
it's just going to be the mini what is
everyone smoking and so of course today
I'm eating my hat because what we saw at
the event was the surface pro 3 not at
all the surface mini it looks like those
surface many rumors were pretty much
spot on and the only reason we didn't
see one was due to a directive from
management to halt the the announcement
to put that on the back burner and to
save it for another day Adam are you a
her with us I heard a rumor that they
halted it so that they could wait for
the touch version of office to be
available right which would make sense
and if it's a RT device so it would be
similar to the ipad version of office
which is actually very very nice the
ipad version volunteers yeah i did a
video on it yeah and i used all three so
it's Word Excel and PowerPoint and all
three of them PowerPoint is kind of
obviously the the it's there they did it
just to say they did it i think i still
want any cell in work i really want to
meet the person who like builds
powerpoint president
patience on his tablet like Adam I know
you've probably got about you you would
do it on the surface pro or something
like that but you know yeah I don't know
I can't see building a PowerPoint
presentation on an iPad but I don't want
to get too far away from this because I
mean what's interesting to me most
interesting about the mini is that neo
when did some really fine reporting on
this and have kind of gathered
everything together into one post and
from what they can tell the surface many
went through a first production run so
there's like 15 or 20 thousand units
sitting in a warehouse somewhere waiting
to launch which would make sense if they
were ready to announce it today right or
excuse me and that's it this week but
this thing apparently started life as
this rumored Xbox many xbox tablet xbox
pad or whatever I don't know what they
were going to exhale surface and then
when they decided a gaming tablet really
didn't make much sense in that context
it kind of rebranded and stuff so it's a
very interesting story we have it in the
rundown and linking to that to that
source but that'll be an interesting
thing to see there's some great new
features in the surface pro 3 that i
think would translate really well to the
mini for example that what that new pen
where you click it and it goes straight
into OneNote and then you can start
running you know writing your notes
right away that would be really nice out
of mini yeah because a mini is something
you're more likely to be carrying with
you at any gat time yeah in a pocket at
jacket pocket Adam you were there what
is your what is your like your favorite
part of the surface pro 3 before I start
peppering you with questions you've had
the device for like two days yeah my
favorite part is definitely the screen
the 12 inch screen previous to the
surface pro I used to use other tablets
from like HP or whatnot and isles had a
nice 12 inch screen so this new 12 inch
screen is you know it feels really
perfect to me and the aspect ratio I
like a lot yeah that's an interesting
thing is that it's 322 right yeah yep so
I don't know I can't remember really
seeing that aspect ratio on a lot of
tablets as you go up till now but it
certainly looks like it makes a lot of
sense I think they were comparing it to
a legal pad at the unveiling right yeah
it feels a lot like a you know a thick
magazine with the width
on Iran or no oh well depending on what
kind of magazine you got ya actually let
me tell you last night I compared it to
the surface 2 and if you've tried one of
those it is extremely similar like I put
it down on a table in macro close-up
look at the thickness the surface pro 3
is a hair thicker I thought that they
had proper cpu and fans yeah so it's I
know it's not add what about is light
and in terms of weight yeah it's 800
grams which honestly I've sitting here
watching and not having handled the
device i was a little bit let down when
I compared the weight because you know
I've got the ipad the fourth-generation
ipad sitting here and I've always
complained that that's way too heavy and
the Lumia 2520 is about 600 15 grams and
that's that's a pretty beefy tablet so
800 grams I wasn't that wasn't the that
didn't make me the happiest but
considering that they've blown up the
screen to 12 inches i can I I respect
the hardware accomplishment I just sort
of editing possible or I seven and eight
gigs of ram and yeah 512 gigs of SSD run
right now it's a monster we actually
have a thought thread here that I sort
of want to sound the chime on and and do
because Christopher drummer wrote in to
ask us hello pocket no team my question
is quick and simple would any of you be
willing to switch your MacBooks or heirs
for the surface pro 3 and I want to dive
into this a little bit deeper in a
minute but assuming I was going to do
this okay say I was going to give up the
macbook air I use every day which is a
2012 model that's pretty pretty spec
packed for the surface pro 3 which one
could should I invest in what is the
difference here between i3 i5 and i7 for
someone who does not necessarily follow
processor architecture very closely I'm
not sure if I can really answer that to
accurately you know the i7 is the most
powerful one so you'll have the most cpu
usage there but i'm pretty happy with
the i5 I've been running Premiere Pro
and photoshop and all sorts of high-end
programs and they're running extremely
smoothly and this one has eight gigs of
RAM
as well and 256 gig SSD so I think it's
kind of a middle-range model and tailors
just have dropped off some specs in the
thread here what are you looking at
there these are this is the price list
yeah so it take us through that Taylor
what are the actual prices on this thing
for entry mid and high end okay so the
the base model is the core i3 with four
gigs of ram and 64 gigs of storage and
that's eight hundred dollars for 799 so
if you pair the 130 dollar keyboard with
that you're a 929 for a base model yeah
yeah and then that goes all the way up
so if you go to the i5 the base I five
is going to be 999 that's 128 gigs of
storage still four gigs of RAM if you
double the RAM in the storage that goes
up to thirteen hundred dollars and the
base I seven it's eight gigs of ram 250
gigs of storage that one is 1550
basically damn and then the top end
model that's maxed out fully maxed out
with everything without a keyboard
that's I seven eight gigs of RAM five or
so half a terabyte of storage and that
one is 1950 throw in a keyboard you're
looking at 21 80 plus tax and yeah and
28 the justification that Microsoft is
using to justify them is to say that the
surface pro 3 is finally the device you
can buy if you don't want to sacrifice
if you don't want to compromise if you
want to get a tablet laptop hybrid that
is actually going to do the job of each
equally well then this is finally the
device for you finally like that's that
was the impression I got through the
entire hour of the presentation that I
watched yeah from a hardware perspective
Adam and I mean build when you're when
you have the thing on your lap and oh
that's been the biggest frustration for
me with the surface with the 2520 and
its power keyboard with pretty much any
tablet and it's going a keyboard case it
doesn't work as well you know with a
laptop I can get the hinge down around
my knees and like extend the you know
fold the screen all the way back and
then it's it's well balanced it's not
going to fall over but with something
with a with a deployable kickstand
around
back that's tougher to do and you feel
like you're kind of cramped the screen
is too close to your stomach when you're
sitting how is it but yeah for you
what's what's the story on that is this
friction kickstand solve that problem or
or we sell having trouble when I'm using
it on my lap I hold it like a tablet so
I don't even use a keyboard I put the
full the keyboard back and then you know
you're holding it right hang up and you
use the stylus to do all the input okay
so you want that give this one a dream
look comfortable sure that's definitely
it's always comfortable but if you want
to like yeah if you want to really
hammer out some stuff you're sitting on
a bus or a plane and the stupid tray in
front of you is broken or it's not big
enough as often happens to me yeah and
we want to put it at lab can you type on
it comfortably like the point you made
you do have to have a little more area
on your knees for that kickstand to sit
on something there yeah so the keyboard
does get closer to your stomach there so
yes that is an issue right and that's
just a it's not a defect I mean it's
just part of the design of how the
surface is and most tablets with with
kickstands are built which yeah is still
frustrating you know to me that's still
an innate compromise that you have to
make with something like this for its
this the weight distribution because if
you have a laptop all of your components
and everything are in the bottom and all
your weight is in the bottom everything
like your display is just there it's
like a fraction of what the base of the
computer ways this all of your weight is
in the top now i'm just--my board so
that was something i realized when i
tried my first ipad keyboard because it
was a i can't remember exactly what it
was but i would sit with the ipad on my
lap in the keyboard and it would just
fall off the back my needs all the time
to know it wasn't an ipad it was the
transformer yeah from a sous so i would
put it on my lap and i'd be typing and
like the keyboard would lift and bounce
when i would type yes certainly that
happens on pretty much every keyboard
accessory for a tablet i've ever used as
well but Adam there's a different
there's a strip here right there's a
magnetic strip on the yeah on the type
cover that locks into the bottom part of
the service which certainly looks like
it rigid eise's the thing a little bit
it does it makes it the screen is more
stable like if
don't have that strip and you touch
screen the it kind of wobbles against
your knees with the kickstand uh-huh but
when you attach that little magnet it it
becomes much more stable so you can
touch the screen and it doesn't move see
that's interesting and I wouldn't have
expected a result that you profound just
as a result of changing the mounting
point of the keyboard from the port on
the bottom to like you know changing the
load-bearing joint as it were yeah
that's interesting to hear it doesn't
solve that problem that Taylor that you
bring up which is the weight
distribution issue but it does at least
rigid eyes the whole thing and I imagine
makes it a bit more comfortable what
about the trackpad which has been
miserable on every single surface oh yes
it's much much better it's actually
clickable now so there's a click if you
press it hard enough there's a
mechanical click on the yeah yeah okay
but you can also do the tapping just for
a single click and is it larger so you
don't need to have like dainty little
fingers to fit us hmm i believe they
said sixty-eight percent larger so it's
more like a normal laptop as opposed to
a tiny netbook respect that I've been
looking through just some random tablets
and and I was trying to get a feel for
weight because 800 grams doesn't mean
anything to me um if you look at a
tablet we looked at at CES samsung
galaxy tab pro 12 22 yeah that it's 740
grams so this is a snapdragon SOC three
gigs of ram and more tablet esque
specifications and it weighs almost the
same and it's a very similar size that's
a solid point yet has nowhere near the
powder processing by aura of even the
well i'm not actually prepared to say
that i was about to say even the i3 but
i have no idea frankly how the
snapdragon 800 matches up against it as
well but uh so i want to talk about how
you cool those processors Adam have you
heard the fan of the surface pro 3 yet
because certainly we spent at the time
of their you have yeah no I understand
that that was supposed to be you know
really heavily diminished did you have
to really ramp up the horsepower on the
thing too yeah yeah running how'd you
stress test it Premiere Pro Photo Shop
No
without being big files and adobe of
course was a big a big presence on stage
at this thing how have you found the the
premier sweet and stuff how does it how
well does it run oh very well yeah
there's no rendering time between you
know adding dissolves or effects or
edits it just press plane it's like it's
already done Wow well that is impressive
the I understand the fan bridge is still
there from what I see and you say that
the hardware is very very similar to
what's gone before but would you say I
don't mean to dwell on this fan thing
but you know even Panos Panay said it on
stages like yeah you know it's hip to
not have a fan we had to have a fan but
we made it invisible basically so I gay
it's very quiet it's kind of like a very
subtle hiss okay we and that's only when
it's under load right yeah okay tell me
Adam this just popped to mind does the
for those who are thinking of picking
this up but in addition to the desktop
power they want some really well honed
to tablet apps obviously Windows 8 has
some really not a lot what is the story
with that emulator that you told me
about about a year ago the ANFO
bluestacks what's that called bluestacks
yeah yeah I haven't tried that recently
I should install that yeah I knew I'd
like to see that when it cuz your review
is gonna land what next week probably
yeah see how quickly I can make that
happen I would love to see that to see
that covered because you know I think a
lot of people when i'm sitting here and
I'm looking at the the Microsoft
offerings or I'm walking by the
Microsoft Store and I'm like wow which
one would i would I actually get you
know I really liked the 2520 except i
can't stand windows RT because it teases
me with with ability and then it hits me
in the face and tells me no but so i
would get if i were investing i would i
would get a full-featured windows 8
device but only if it could also match
my need for for tablet-optimized stuff
no I guess I don't have that big in the
util I mean save the pen yeah the pen
saves you from a lot of that yeah
I don't know if it does matter let's
talk about it yeah that because the pen
has been designed to like a Bic pen
right it's it's comfortable to hold I
take it right yeah it's a aluminum metal
no it's it's a little thicker than the
previous one also feels much more
substantial does ever better in it yes
as three batteries a quad quad a battery
and then two small watch batteries oh
all right come on wait a second ago
batteries there's one type of one better
in two types of another yes get out of
my face okay how long does the battery
out how long is the battery life on the
pin I'm not sure yet but it's work it's
been working fine so far so at least
that far it's not better than the dell
venue pro battery which is a really
horrible okay all right that stylus so
in exchange for this battery that
requires three three birds this pan that
requires three batteries does the pen
come with the device by the way I am
pretty sure it must yeah I don't know i
mean the type cover doesn't call yeah it
was in the box it was underneath the
device in the box sorry yeah but a
replacement one is 50 bucks okay well
that's fine just don't lose it that's
fine yeah uh but all right so what do
you get in exchange for this for this
large pen that doesn't have a silo can
you stick it in the type cover sleeve is
there a port yeah that's right our type
cover has kind of like a little loop or
fabric loop stretchy fabric okay so you
can stick it in there and it stays there
pretty pretty securely I'm gonna go a
good aspects of this pen in a second
Adam but I just got to say like isn't it
isn't it annoying that there's not and I
know they had a big miniaturization
challenge with this device but isn't it
a little irritating that they couldn't
find a way to integrate the panas as a
as a siloed component because every time
I see ya but with it just bolted on I'm
like ah that's so cumbersome that ruins
the lines you know yeah but it's the
tablet is thinner than the pen that's a
good fella put it inside there you're
right and they didn't want to go super
thin with the stylist because they
wanted to make it a natural fit for the
hand like a yeah okay reminds me of the
I think it's called Kozma
up I had it my roommate stole it it's a
stylist for it's a capacitive stylus but
it's shaped or made to be like an expo
marker or like a whiteboard marker Oh
interesting and it feels it feels really
natural to use except for there's a
little air gap between the outer coating
and like the inside and it doesn't
register unless the tip touches the
inside so you have to press and that's
why I stopped using it but it was really
really nice to use and hold it just
wasn't very accurate which i guess is
really a high point of the surface pro 3
is pin yeah is that if they it's
supposedly very very accurate and that's
been one of my big frustrations with
pretty much every stylist up to and
including the ones on the note line you
know Samsung sort of owns the market on
this where it's like yeah this would
this digitizer registers 10,000 levels
of pressure sensitivity that's great but
when I'm writing a note the input still
lags behind the pen tip by like a few
millimeters in a few nanoseconds and
it's or sometimes it's enough sometimes
it's a few pixels off where you're
trying to touch exactly right and that's
nothing more annoying than that and on
stage microsoft called this sort of the
parallax effect Adam they say they've
solved it what is the story is it does
it really feel like writing on a piece
of paper with a pen or is that over
blind it's looking pretty good I think
you could slow it down if you put a lot
of load with other open programs and
other stuff going on at the same time
mm-hmm but it's been working really
nicely one thing about this new pen is
it's kind of a downgrade from the
surface pro 2 in the levels of pressure
sensitivity that it supports this one
only does 256 levels whereas the surface
pro and surface pro 2 had 1024 levels of
pressure sensitivity now why is that so
explain that don't they they went to a
completely different technology the
previous surface pro used Wacom which
doesn't require a battery in the pen but
this one has a n-trig digitizer so it's
a completely different tech huh but the
other the other advantage a new
advantage of the pen with batteries in
it is the clicky button at the end
you know with that you can do different
controls like launching the camera or
watching OneNote and so that's that's
kind of a cool trade-off I'm not sure if
it's worth the loss and pressure
sensitivity but well you know I I guess
if they change the focus than it is
right because this is not there
certainly Microsoft is not pitching the
surface pro 3 as a as a high-end artists
yeah like as a creative thing you know I
went when Panos Panay was using the pen
and some scenarios he was editing a
screenplay you know his brothers
screenplay so it's like oh okay yeah
this is good for taking memos and it's
yes it's good for using OneNote they
didn't and yeah they trumped out the the
adobe stuff for a little bit but it
wasn't like like a samsung galaxy note
presentation where he had people making
huge oil paintings on their tablet or in
like that and you know it I think if
they can position it properly it'll be
fine because 256 levels of pressure
sensitivity would be fine for me to take
a note I don't know about you guys yeah
and I'd make that sacrifice if it meant
that writing on the thing was a lag less
experience with none of that parallax
effect I just don't know if I would
carry the pen around all the time what I
usually do when I'm using it the surface
pro 3 also has magnets on the edges so
instead of you know slugging it
somewhere you can actually just stick to
the side and it'll hold it there but if
you're gonna put in your bag it's
obviously you know it's gonna fall off
right of the magnet so you got to put in
the loop if you're gonna store it on
your backpack you know being a gospel
some of those like state switchable
magnets that they're talking about for
project ara where you slap the thing on
there and you hit like a fix or whatever
and it changes the you know the polarity
of the things that just locks it in
place and you have to arrest a button to
unlock it i think that would be pretty
sweet but even in its current form
magnets to hold a pen on there is pretty
cool so Taylor I sort of know your
answer but what about the thought thread
what about Christopher drummers question
is there anything about the pro 3
assuming cost is not a factor that would
make it i mean i want to take the
surface pro 3 over a macbook hosts were
not a factor well I don't have a macbook
air i have macbook pro okay and i missed
my macbook air because it's of the
weight penalty of the program okay yeah
so that's one thing that would make me
say i would
for service maybe if I had a maxed out
one maybe i5 or i7 I probably would not
go I three that's just my experience
with I three mm-hmm it's been a while
since I've had anything other than a
macbook though so windows for me is just
something that I've never really wanted
to go back after i used ubuntu and
various different builds of linux and OS
10 I really haven't ever wanted to go
back to Windows I've used windows 8
haven't used Windows 8.1 but I don't
know it's that's a really tough question
I'd like to use one for a while I've
never actually used a surface tablet or
Windows 8 tablet period that's Windows
8/rt that's no windows 8 tablet ever hmm
so that's a very difficult question for
me to answer if you factor in cost i'd
get a macbook air over at any day that's
why i think this is a good question
though because this is the question that
people are going to be asking themselves
at least in certain markets because I'll
tell you when I walk around Boston I
every single coffee shop it's it's
hilarious I mean I'm sure there have
been many comedies written about it you
want a coffee shop and the windows are
completely dominated by Apple logos
every single young professional has a
macbook air a macbook pro or a macbook
and it's like it's it's it's absurd so
you have this kind of saturation in in
markets where I don't think people are
necessarily jumping from one platform to
another just have fun but there are
going to be people who are like tired of
the mac experience or maybe they don't
like it for one reason or another they
want to do this thing that Microsoft
assumes people want to do which is
converged the tablet and the laptop and
they don't want to buy two devices they
want to buy one so but I think that it's
a massive ecosystem leap first of all
because I'm the same way yes i would
like to carry a tablet around it's the
surface pro 3 looks like beautiful
hardware I'd love to try it out the type
cover I'm certain I could get used to if
I can get used to the nokia power
keyboard but there's i would have to
learn an entire new video editing
program I my workflow change completely
you know I mean like and see for me i
wanna try a surface tablet and of all
the surface tablets to date the service
pros
seems the most logical to try no
question yeah i mean that's that's
pretty obviously but I I don't know like
I want one I really really contemplated
buying a surface pro 2 so I might buy a
surface pro 3 eventually but the price
is just for me the price is really
difficult to swallow it I think the
price argument is contingent on
Microsoft on that bet that Microsoft is
making that people want to go out and
buy one device because if you add the
cost of a macbook air and the cost of an
ipad air well then you're starting to
get in the neighborhood of this
convergence device this surface pro 3
right yeah and one thing they didn't
mention is you could also plug in a TV
tuner and a 4k display and replace your
TV to wait hold up but I don't I don't
get a hold on a second you play a 4k
display and replace your tia a TV tuner
USB okay so that goes to the cable box
Oh ed center installed on tablet you got
a ten-foot interface yeah like but no
yeah the capability is there sure of it
like your docking station yeah I don't
know popped on a docking station now
it's got a DVR so much utility too right
yeah these media center still around is
that still a thing yeah yes awesome you
know actually media center sort of blew
me away back in two thousand six when I
got a I got a big beefy HP pavilion like
the top of line everything with a
commercial money from shooting a
commercial and I was like this is Media
Center's awesome i'm using my remote on
my laptop from across the room and
that's cool but then it kind of didn't
really go anywhere like I thought it got
folded into xbox and sort of forgotten
about but it is kind of forgotten about
it but it's still there and it still
works interesting honest isn't it I
would still use it too if I were running
on primarily on window stuff I'm sure I
would still use media center because I
actually liked it quite a bit one last
question that i have i'm going to make
sure Taylor gets a chance to ask his
final question but how's that side
windows key man like i like that they
moved it because it gives you the
impression that you should use the
surface
portrait as much as you do in landscape
and it actually looks pretty good but
how is it on a day to day functionality
basis I do not like it you prefer it
does in the on the long side yeah if
you're using the pen and you're using
the tablet in like landscape mode
getting you rub your hand over to the
right side of the edge that button is
not rejected when your pen is near the
screen like everything else on the
screen so no I have been accidentally
opening the Start menu when my hand goes
over there because my hand is resting on
the screen and if it slides way over
there too much yeah it might it might
activate the Start screen oh that's
rough maybe they can fix that in a
firmware update because that's it seems
like a very like large oversight that
seems like something that would pop up
very often in a test case yeah it seems
like it should be fixable yeah Wow
because I mean that's what happens with
say the Galaxy Note 3 or any of the
galaxy notes because they have
capacitive input and then they have
inductive input with the stylus so when
inductive input is near the screen all
capacitive input is turned off
completely oh really yeah it'll tend to
like the palm rejection thing I don't
know it's been a while yes denote yeah
yeah so when they they're digitizers or
Wacom digitizer 'he's which or inductive
and when the stylus gets near the
display all capacitive input is turned
off period huh yeah so I don't know yeah
like this uses what sort of digitizer I
haven't even looked into it I don't know
adam said it before what it is inductive
if it's inductive so yeah why not just
go for all capacitive input yeah even to
harper buttons Wow yep oh well I
probably knew that once but I forgot it
yeah hmm I had to replace it with more
relevant information right yeah well
thank you for the for the for the primer
on that Adam I know you got to go get
lunch but one last question before you
go what's the what is your feeling on
the battery life so far on the on the
pro3 pentose but I said it has a year's
worth of standby time which is hilarious
oh I don't know about that but it's it's
been very good it's about the same as
the surface pro 2
you know all day don't I don't carry
charger around so it's been pretty good
oh and it has connected standby now so
that's a really good addition give us a
refresher on that what's connected sama
the previous surface Pro's when they
went to sleep they didn't get skype
instant messages or emails okay so it's
just now either sleep now that it'll
snap but it'll still listen for
notifications and will it be a little
time if you get something yep that's
very nice so I do have one final
question and it's about the cover the
type cover are the keys loose on that
because in the picture for your hands on
video the keys all look like they're at
a different level yeah I never use one
of these like that yeah are they
actually like way off like they look
really loose in that picture no they
don't seem loose too much it seems about
the same as the previous type cover you
know when typing on it oh I see what
you're talking about yeah yeah it looks
like if you'd like took it and shook it
around a little bit they'd like yeah I
know if it's like that again yeah it's
like you look at anything interesting
there yeah yeah look at shingles
shingles on the side of a house yeah
yeah would sleep that's really cool that
I mean it just it looks like there's a
fair amount of travel and as is that the
case Adam oh you can definitely feel
when they're pressing down so yeah it's
very good that way the first gen touch
cover was actually a type cover was
actually pretty good too did they make a
touch cover for this thing I don't think
so no haven't heard anything about that
it's probably best I really adored the
touch covers looks but functionally I
couldn't get it to work too well for me
yeah I think this is the most exciting
surface and it is certainly in history I
don't know if Taylor once wants to do
the review rebuttal on this but ice yes
like to do it too yeah I do because I've
never used a surface tablet that's nice
alright anyway Adam I we all cannot wait
to hear what what the story is on this
thing what you're gonna compare it to
the surface pro 2 correct yeah and
probably the surface to these surfaces
well you have a surface 2 um I borrowed
one last night and
got some time with that hold on it we
went to the Microsoft Store and then we
went to the apple store where our
surfaces it's that wait hold up is that
the one you were talking about before
when you were talking about the
thickness test to reach I'm with the
surface pro 2 surface to the arc t1 oh
good yeah because yeah but the surface
pro 2 is legitimately thicker right yes
yeah that's why i was confused before
it's like what are you talking about
dinner ok ok i see awesome all right
good so you remember the original
surface the surface pro 3 is about that
thickness and add weight which is
awesome yeah Adam doubt as our has our
house surface RT and man that thing was
was super futuristic in the way it was
then do you miss the clack of the
kickstand I'm done with questions after
this I promise but it still flex up in
the way it works is the first you know
little bit you know kind of like the
similar to the original surface that
part moves very quickly oh and that
starts and then it gives a bunch of
friction so when you want to change the
angle it's it's much more stiff right no
I get the friction brought I just
thought it was from from the start it
started doing like fruit but it actually
flips out and is spring-loaded to a
certain degree let degree setting yeah
yep oh well good then they guy still do
fun choreographed dance commercials
which I don't do this is great Adam
would you buy one I mean knowing what
you know now I know your review isn't
done I'm just kind of trying to get a
sneak preview I really prefer the wacom
stylus with much more pressure
sensitivity so I'm not sure if I would
you know I really like the 12 inch
screen though and the much thinner body
and much lighter so it's it's hard to
decide understood well I will ask you
again once your full review got up and I
read it will be talking about this
device more on the show and I'm looking
forward to Taylor getting some hands-on
time with it as well so we can get a
different perspective from someone who
has been criminally negligent about his
exposure to windows I have not been
negligent and just been deprived of them
depend approved and neglected from you
guys he collected in my book you don't
have parallels yeah well no I do i do I
tried windows 8 I just I needed i want
to try it on a surface on a prior device
that makes sense yeah I want to take
crack out because I want to run dosbox
and run my old games on the surface and
now all that will make me run a surface
pro 3 do you guys mind if i put linux on
it yes ya can't mind a lot I I
appreciate you coming by Adam thank you
for for carving out the time in your day
to college from your phone and let's say
talk again soon I'm really glad you made
it to the weekly let's not make it the
last time alright cool make you talk to
you like you later I didn't realize that
was the first time that Adam Lane had
come on the weekly we've been trying to
get him on forever but I thought it was
on but i was i was actually realized
afterwards that I was actually thinking
about the editorial round table for the
young HTC One m8 yeah yeah well he was
on that one and he was on the next one
yeah that's right says crit yeah he was
that's what it was that's where my
confusion sprung anyway it's good to
have them on the weekly we need to close
out windows move into Android and then
we have the feature segment later with
Ali spagnola which amex very excited
about but let's close out windows here
we have a lenovo windows phone coming
late this year is the report actually
this one comes right from lenovo i
believe this is from Lu Jun whose name I
can't pronounce yet the chief of
lenovo's mobile division there were
previous rumors that have been talking
about lenovo windows phones for a while
to at the end of the summer because
lenovo is one of that massive cloud of
new OEMs that Microsoft spat out but
that this has been postponed / reworded
rights aunt and a nudge to indicate a
more vague time frame I mean maybe
they're postponing it to make it a
motorola device the thing yeah i don't
say it's bad news in the sense that like
it i just i just wanted to see it I
ideally I want just like we've seen the
lenovo android phones i want to see the
pre motorola acquisition lenovo sweet
and then the post motorola acquisition
sweet were you about to say you want a
motorola windows phone no I was gonna
say that I'd much rather see it as a
motorola incarnation than a lenovo foam
because I've never has lenovo Lenovo's
made phones before correct yeah lenovo
has a whole line of actually writer
sweet-looking android phones
right but they're just not really all
that compelling well yeah and they also
have been around that long I don't think
they're priced right they're not offered
in ever in a lot of markets like it's
their mobile offering was really
half-hearted until the equatorial
acquisition they don't have the clout
Motorola has as a smartphone maker where
is the reason they bought them Yeah
right and why not put that purchase to
good use I'm saying I and I have just
been thinking of we're getting x + 1
rumours not that kind of stuff but man
wouldn't it be great to see a motorola
windows phone after the lenovo
acquisition because that would seem to
be a really good way to leverage the
acquisition of motorola and it would
also be a really great way to fulfill
Lenovo's obligations to microsoft as a
vendor I'm just envisioning like a
Windows ified Moto X with touchless
control plugged into Cortana which I
think would be amazingly cool I also
admittedly have never used Cortana or
Windows Phone 8.1 yeah because your icon
is still running the official build 48
which is what you use for that
comparison yes yes which is a perfect
segue into man or it was until you
called it out oh no it's still perfect
so this comparison is a pretty good
comparison I thought I watched it
shortly before coming on the air I did
jump around a little bit it was pressed
for time but your camera shots were
plentiful we got to see the meat of this
comparison the Xperia z2 versus the
Lumia icon the phone I called the best
camera phone for android right now up
against one of the best camera phones
for windows phone yeah and sure what was
your takeaway go ahead well the one
reason that I say it's a perfect segue
ever was a perfect segue is because
every one who is just I guess fighting
or pulling for the Lumia icon mm-hmm was
mmm I just terribly upset that I did not
take into consideration windows phone
8.1 and I did I noted it in the software
section i said if this were running 8.1
it would be a totally different story
and i would have a much more difficult
time choosing which phone one the
computer so in order to recommend
choosing which one to recommend i did
in a consideration Windows Phone 8.1 but
it's not officially official it's
official but it's not available to
consumers it's a developer preview
exactly and even though it's been
updated recently it's still not final at
the only final versions are the ones
that are shipping on the 630 and 635 we
talked about last week yeah and we can't
we don't compare unofficial versions of
software so a developer preview is not
really an official version of software
yeah which is out of consumers confused
I get it that it can be confusing
because we do review the developer we
reviewed the developer my view of a time
one so I mean I get and and my takeaway
was the only reason that I really
recommended the easy to over the icon
was the fact that it's not running
Windows Phone 8.1 because when this 18
feels very stale and Windows Phone 8.1
although I haven't actually used it
myself add some much-needed spice too
and otherwise aging oh yeah build of
windows home yeah it wanted something
I'd rather enjoy it right so that was my
only takeaway and everyone took that for
whatever reason as it happens yeah
that's fine internet comments and such
lob lob it was a good comparison I mean
I it was the photos were most
interesting to me and I I want to know
what your your thoughts are I mean I
know you said you would prefer the icon
but it was a real edge case this was a
situation where these were very
well-matched cameras part of the problem
was that I didn't get a lot of time with
the z2 so it wasn't that I'd like had
half-hearted thoughts throughout this
script or anything it was just that I
wanted more time to test the phones yeah
beside one another so I didn't get that
full effect but I did you know test the
cameras in different scenarios and in a
few at least it was surprising because I
expected the Lumia icon with optical
image stabilization to just below the Z
2 out of the water in low light and that
wasn't the case aussie to is it
surprisingly capable in low light yeah
actually yeah it is and well it kind of
varied because if you were in really low
light the z2 just fell apart because i
took a picture in an elevator and this I
included this in the videos of it the Z
tues picture in the elevator I took them
side by side at the exact same time held
in both steady and the z2 is turned out
like this horrible blurry no detail mess
and the icons was actually a really good
picture oh and then but probably because
of hand movements though because the OAS
kicked him then maybe yeah maybe cuz i
don't know use the z2 and low-light like
I'm talking about pitch dark like 11 at
night shooting a photo of the Starship
Enterprise on my porch with no flash and
that thing came out like in stark relief
against the night sky this white like it
auntie shadowed it was amazing I was
like I can't believe this said well
maybe an hour before that I was eating
lunch in a very very dimly lit
restaurant and I took a picture with
both of them and the z2 is just blew the
icon out of the water it looked the z2
looked as if exactly true to life it
looked exactly how the food looked on my
plate and the icons was blurry and not
that detailed and it was cold a lot of
the icons pictures are very cool and
that doesn't bother me because I always
edit my pictures afterwards so I don't
really take into consideration or
heavily into consideration like the
temperature of pictures that you take
with a phone camera but still with the
optical image stabilization the hardware
shutter key which I much prefer on the
icon those II tues I didn't really like
that much has a much more limited range
of motion and it's smaller and it's
harder to find and yeah the icons beated
and and the consistency of the camera
speed so the shutter speed and how
quickly it takes pictures I would choose
the icon I couldn't cram all of that
information into the script because it
was already ten minutes long but yeah
that's cuz you had to interest but yeah
oh yeah i was watching i was like wow
you could have shaved off like a minute
if you just did that second intro
instead of the first one I know but then
I can't show my face and and I'm really
working through some audio issues from
my intros see that yeah yeah that that
will be fixed in my next video I got a
lot of comments about that in the last
week so well as you know i'm working on
it i'm just testing some things and they
didn't work out some lipstick and
plastics made it yeah it's good to have
that have a lot of people are asking for
it I almost jumped off a bridge three
times while making that video so glad
you didn't what say we sound the time
since we're already talking about an
android phone let's say we move on
to the android section where we have a
ton of quite exciting news would you
would you second that motion ah I
suppose but I'm back then it's done I
have a question Taylor uh-huh do you
ever use the speakers on your smartphone
every damn day now why you you have
earbuds Taylor I know and I have tooth
speakers and an expensive headphones and
expense it yeah why would you ever use
the speaker on your smartphone that
doesn't make any sense I know apparently
I'm an idiot apparently and the only
person in the world that does according
to this is some people one of my
favorite editorials to pitch and it's
the headline that town and I eventually
come up with was think smartphone
speakers don't matter think again and
this is this came to us I think probably
about the same time because we've had a
lot of blowback every time we put an HTC
One up against another device and this
is actually been happening since last
year people will immediately dismiss
boom sound as a differentiator and
they'll say only jerks who listen to
music on the bus yeah out loud care
about this stuff and you guys are idiots
for thinking the you know HTC has fooled
everybody into thinking that that
speaker quality matters and as no longer
can find HTC now we have sony with the
front firing speakers on the z2 even
though they're not very loud they're
still there there they sound I want to
make that very clear the z2 speakers
sound great but they are so quiet
they're just Wyatt yeah yeah and people
look it's because they're waterproof no
it's because they're tiny slits and they
don't have any sort of resonating
chamber or anything they're just tiny
little itty bitty speakers that sound
great no oh no and z2 had to do they had
to do that in the sea too because water
yes it is waterproofing but also it's
freaking wafer-thin device I mean it's
yeah you can't you know you need to if
you're if you're going to do it right it
needs to be a big device which is why
all of HTC's phones are taller than the
competition but anyway and even rear
firing speakers the icons is really loud
but its rear from the Moto X really loud
and really x
but rear firing so anyway it's not an
HTC thing it's it's a speaker phones are
excellent thing and here's why because
you know not everyone is a shut-in which
is my immediate respondent
counter-argument to this thing of like
why would you ever not use earbuds to
watch a movie well first of all it's not
always freaking convenient to have
earbuds in even when I'm by myself but
if I'm watching it with someone else
Mike hey let me show you this youtube
video real quick we want to share
headphones like it's 1991 and you have a
Walkman with this duel headphone jack
attraction pretty cool but f it you know
yeah that comes up every day that that
happens to me if not every day probably
every other day yeah I mean all the time
and it literally it happens exactly the
way I explained it in the article
somebody wants to show a video on
youtube and the speakers aren't loud
enough on their phone so they're like
hey Taylor your phone speakers are
really loud you play the video that
happens all the time and if this isn't
something where it's a thing like like
the leader of your local popularity
chapter like you need literally to know
one other human being with whom you
occasionally like to share media okay
that's all you need to realize the value
of this thing and like it's it sucks if
you don't have that but also shut up
because it's worthwhile and it's not a
counter-argument to say like well that
never happens for me this is gonna sound
lame so lame but my friend and I back
home before I moved Charlotte he and I
would sit at a Waffle House um pretty
often he was he goes there seven days a
week and since four hours and drink
coffee but that's pretty cool life I dig
that yeah but there's nothing to do in
that town like literally nothing there's
ever wondered horrible i was in town
that's that's the case yeah there's one
bar it's called the country corral and
you just don't want to walk through
those doors you will you will come out
of that place a changed person just
don't go um so he goes and sits at the
Waffle House and everybody knows us but
we'll sit there and people will just
join our table and just hang out and
sometimes we'd play videos we play
youtube videos I did it on my iphone for
a few hours one time and it was just
like we huddle Brown really closely I
mean a lot of background noise but
huddle around the speaker nobody could
hear anything so we'd go outside and
listen
or watch this video and every time I
come with a new phone we try it out just
to see how the speaker was and the only
phone that I ever brought up there that
was actually good enough was the first
the one in seven I have a min baggage
but the one m7 was great and eventually
I just stopped caring and bring bring a
Bluetooth speaker with me just because
that's the only way that we can do that
now yeah and that's not convenient my
bluetooth speaker is literally it's the
shape and size of a an energy drink and
one of the giant like monster energy
rockstar give it to have a beats pill no
no no it's a bigger and it's better than
a beats pill it's the ultimate yours
boom if you want a bluetooth speaker
that is the one to buy hands down no
question about it I don't know official
word on Apple beats by the way if
anybody wants to know if I'm gonna
leverage that Segway I'm not yeah all
right all right right so the point is
there is a cogent assembly of arguments
in favor of speaker phones and why they
are not irrelevant and they are linked
in the rundown I just basically put it
in here because it's such a I agree so
vehemently with this editorial that it
needed to be said it needed to be talked
about and if you have a counter-argument
listeners I know my tone suggests that
the next words out of my mouth are gonna
be shut up that is not the case I want
to hear from you if you have an argument
shoot it at us I'm a podcaster
pocketnow.com is that is the email
address really oh cuz it's an
interesting dialogue to have I can't
think of a counter argument that all
right ray with but I'd like to you yeah
like alarm clock I'm playing music
ringtones beaker phone call there's so
many things and people will be talking
about yeah and people like no I never
use my smartphone speaker I guarantee
you that is a lie yeah that is a lie uh
what and I want to read just one more
line then we're done yeah one more then
that's good it's it's the end of it if
you disagree you're either lying to
yourself basing your conclusion of never
having used a phone with a great audio
experience or you're one of those
weirdos who runs around literally
everywhere with LG tones around their
neck then I wanted to read that on air i
wanted to because i have a group of
friends that there are four or five of
them they wear LG tones on their neck
everywhere they go we go to bars is that
a bluetooth headset it's this bluetooth
headset that like has this band it's
like a rubber neck band that's like it
hangs around your neck and then it has
magnetic it has ear buds that are
connected to it I'll Grande's the
earbuds are connected via wires to the
thing that goes around your neck yeah
hate those know people who wear glass
should not be punched in the face people
who wear that those weird contraptions
Jude well should also not be punch that
nobody should be punch to the face but
people should get grief for wearing LG
tones I think that I I think so too and
I had to throw that in there I had to
say it on air because I mean as much as
people love these things like everybody
I know who's ever tried LG tone just
love them Hey look ridiculous looks and
all of my friends wear them everywhere
now we go to a bar we go anywhere my
friends are wearing these around their
neck and it is so dumb I am no one to
tell other people they can wear I but up
until like two minutes before the pod
get started I was literally wearing a
Star Trek comm badge on my chest but you
know hey do what you want all I'm saying
is those things look too but yeah all
right uh I want to ask you Taylor Martin
if cases excite you are you the kind of
guy who gets jazzed about flip flip
cases on smartphones not really i'm
actually the kind of person who rarely
ever gives us a case on my phone however
the m8 has changed me I'm with you and
it why has the m8 changed you because
it's brushed metal and I don't want it
to get damaged alright alright alright I
feel so chilly what case do you use I
have to speaking cases that I use now
Wow wack sauce you the only answer the
only right answer that question is the
dot view case because they know it's not
a bad ass mfn thing ever it looks cool
and it's awesome when it's closed but I
want to use your phone a period that's
the worst case evidence of what it's one
of those for me it's one of those
trade-offs that I will make I use
minimum as my keyboard and so gross yes
yes i love menuhin but i can't use menu
with the dot view cage because the
keyboard like when you're typing it
bounces around system yeah it's like
we're just gonna be nuts these
inflatable houses that you jump around
in your kid the one that flew 50 feet
see there the other day yeah I heard
it's your three kids that's not the one
I'm talking about
that was in particular is not now not so
anyway the the dot view case I too was
like you Taylor I don't I like my
phone's naked I do not like cases on my
devices but a while back some cases
started to change my view there the
galaxy s4 is the one I'm thinking of
with the S view cover I think they
called it which was the first time that
I had encountered a phone where when you
close the flip cover it had a window in
it and the screen would adapt to it and
display content only in that window in a
really cool way so did we did a short
video and it was like wow this actually
makes me want to use the s4 a lot more
often than i do and plus that window is
not just a hole in the case it's got a
layer of plastic so it protects the
screen the whole thing is protected i
could still use it that's awesome and
then the dot view case which we've
already talked about LG has made
official it's before the g3 even
launches they've released the teaser for
their quick circle case Taylor look at
this for two seconds and tell me you
don't want one this is I don't looking
that is crazy why don't you you're a
nutso person well okay so the appeal is
that what you just said you can use your
phone with it's still being completely
one hundred percent protected and this
looks really cool because it makes me
think moto 360 because it's the circular
display no people what it is um it's
it's like the you just said it'll cover
it SVU case or yes you case over yet
yeah somebody else put the flip cover
but yeah all right I don't know but it's
like that but it has a circular cut out
to interact with the display and it's
not just like for notifications or music
you can actually use the phone because
it actually should chose you'd like a
back navigation button so you can swipe
and you can open up various applications
I don't know if those are limited to
just a few or if you can customize that
doesn't show that but you can um go into
settings and do different things and
control your phone yeah and then you
still have a back button so you can
actually use it a little more than you
can with Samsung S view case or whatever
yeah it looks pretty cool but
it looks really cool like it's the
interface is circular so it's like a
rotary interface you've got all these
circles that line the perimeter of the
thing yes you can do the camera if you
watch the whole video which I'm sort of
trying to do now without it yelling in
my ear I just me to this really really
low yeah you can make and take calls you
can see the time and date you can play
music you can looks like activates some
sort of health feature that probably
talks to that LG health band that I'm
probably not going to buy there's other
stuff going on here but it looks and
there's a lot of utility to it without
even having to open the thing but like
you say you know we can do some of this
on the S view cover already the note 3
has that big ol window and at the LG
what the g2 has one like this but it's
not that it's like the g pro 2i think
has a case like this where you can do
about with the weather thing glows but
this is special because it's circular
and I think you said it right it looks
like a moto 360 bolted onto the front of
a smartphone I bought those icons are
just hideous the software software it's
probably not gonna look for you it's
offer is hideous yeah and I can't get
behind that yeah yeah uh have to wait
and see on the supper but you know it's
funny you mention that because when i
was looking at this thing you know what
that circular thing would be perfect for
the knowing the google now cards view
microphone google voice search thing
that should be a center of that thing
all the time you should just be able to
press it and interact with the phone
vocally with via that circular window
and an outer layer built for it now that
would be exciting yeah if that was the
case then maybe if that were the kid but
it looked off its like L see L here but
I wear layer there Optimus UI and yeah
I'm fine to that stuff I can't get
behind it now if that's something like
that for the one a mate were to happen I
might change my mind but I don't know
whatever it doesn't need this mess don't
use like useless very limited
functionality that's a dismissed
notifications and that's about it and
you can have it calls oh yes see the
weather but like and that's a
ya know so this offers a lot of utility
and I really hope that it's I echo your
hope that it's customizable and that LG
does not exert a vice grip on this thing
to prevent you from using it with apps
that are not LG created you know and I
mean I hope you can throw in like it
would be so cool to if somebody built a
circular twitter app for the thing like
i would use all the time they'll
probably include what their to slide
apps oh we both just yeah i think i
think we're gonna have to go i'm sick
now let's let's move on before because
we're gonna you know we're gonna be
talking by the g3 a whole lot next week
and we are along with another device
that i just learned that we're going to
be talking about next week and another
device we can't talk about that we're
going to be talking about next week next
week's gonna be a busy busy show before
my yet so good because we're because we
I have to be I know yeah um additional
galaxy has five hands on videos reveal
more and more of upcoming phone it's an
interesting title choice you made Steven
I think he basically didn't want to say
gs5 active because we're not sure this
is the galaxy s5 active but it sure does
look like it this is coming to us from
TK tech news AKA prepaid nerds on
twitter who has been dropping science on
us ever since he got ahold of what he
called a galaxy s 5 prime which turned
out to be the distinctive physical
characteristic of it was a case that you
can get on ebay for like ten bucks but
it was indeed a different hurt so
basically a bunch of people called him
out and said it was a faker and then he
dropped like 10 videos showing this
galaxy s5 active which is I do not think
is a fake it looks like something
Samsung would build I don't know if
that's a compliment it reminds me of the
does AT&amp;amp;T push to talk phones whether
they call the rugby yeah yeah reminds me
of like what a rugby for would look like
or something it's it's beefy I don't
think it looks very good but the point
is it is a hands-on video there are many
hands-on videos and he's not done yet
what I understand he's got like a
backlog of unreleased devices that he's
going to reveal to the world so we're
gonna keep reporting on these it's
interesting it's definite us reminds me
I haven't actually have not looked at
these videos you should they're there
i'm looking right now yeah the side of
this so-called galaxy s5 active yeah
looks a lot like an iphone case that I
had back in the day that the slanted
grooves yeah it listeners it's like it's
like diamond plate except it's just
parallel lines going in the diagonal
across the thing and yeah it looks like
a galaxy s5 that you put a huge bumper
case on excited not because the button
the hardware buttons are different we
have the hardware keys below the screen
as we didn't ask for active and it
basically it looks to be answering the
question of why do you need a galaxy s5
if the galaxy s5 active if the s5 is
already waterproof and basically it's
probably going to have meals back well
well not mil-spec but does he talk about
specifications at all I actually do not
know he's in the settings menu right now
as I watch it it's the g8 70a is the
model number SMG 870 a android is two
for two for two is nothing really
special about the software build on here
but I think it does have some
recognization i agree i don't know that
it's not clear that it's mil-spec i mean
certainly not it just looks like a bunch
of rubber but oh man if you're gonna
call if you're going to release your
flagship phone is a waterproof phone and
you are still going to do the active
thing then you have to make it rugged
you have to make it abble to withstand
some abuse because we know the s5 he's
not necessarily a fragile phone but it's
not you can't like really throw it
around without effing it up a little bit
you know he was banging it on the table
said it was military-grade something
well he was shaken it before like one of
his first videos of it was and I love
I'm not making fun of my like I like TK
a lot but he was shaken ages like guys
optical image stabilization any kind of
like shakes the thing around for 10
seconds so you can hear a rattle inside
I don't know that that means optical
image stabilization tinley sometimes it
does so I've on Twitter I'm like cool
scientific test there bro and he's like
yeah straight out of MIT um if you just
scroll down to the comment section
though
going in the comments on these because
after the the absolute beating that TK
tech news got four running his first
first videos like you're a fake this is
a large garbage why are you wasting our
time I I just like watching this
avalanche of confirmations like if these
are fakes get these aren't fixed like do
you agree Taylor like yeah that looks
legit is absolutely legit and it looks
like Samsung is not the only one the
only OEM that is going to be dropping
stuff from do want to know what these
little dots around the buttons or the
brown the the back and menu or task
switcher button there are dots what are
what are the dots I don't know oh yes
yes those maybe just test markings for a
pre production unit or styler stylistic
elements not really sure but the buttons
the physical buttons look lifted right
from the s4 I don't think they've change
those at all except to make the leftmost
one of multitasking button probably know
anyway uh yeah if you're interested the
s5 seems legit stay tuned for more on
that certainly does seem legit get into
the end of the android section two more
stores before we go one other leak this
one from more commonly known of leaks
the HTC One m8 prime so called with the
strangest render I have seen for an LG
product this is a rough render LG
product at a LG HTC sorry this is a
rough render if it is an official one
it's an early one because it just it
looks like a desire 816 that somebody
bolted a big ol red rim to camera onto
the back of what do you think about this
like like when you say bolton you mean
bolton you don't mean just like somebody
put it on there it looks like it was
physically just someone actually screwed
this onto the bass somebody got some 3m
tape and just stuck a circle the back of
the thing and put a dual camera lens
above it but that's the thing that's
what we you know that's why we know this
isn't a desire right because it's the
this big protruding red-rimmed camera
lens but above it is the duo sensor to
the left the distinctive dual flash as
well so ass looks flagship great even
though the render is ugly as sin but you
don't agree you think it looks good yeah
and mainly that's because I'm a little
biased towards grey and orange Oh OMG
you're so bias well not know what I'm
saying what you're saying is i love the
gult the grey and orange and grey and
green color combinations obviously but i
haven't made that clear right now right
I love those color combinations and
that's this is right up my alley this is
that these are the same colors that I
chose for my original moto x so it
reminds me of the evo it reminds me of
some of the incredible lines verizon
back in 2011 this is this looks like if
somebody back in 2010 wanted to theorize
what the future of HTC looked like this
this looks like it I just don't buy this
render render but then again we said the
same thing about the renders for the one
ma then whatever yeah and and this is
actually fuel for an editorial you said
you wanted to talk about that I'm
writing right now so it's not done but
this was fuel for that because I love
the MA I carry it that is my daily
driver right now and when i mate yeah
yeah the 1i mate so not the PM a prime
but i'm using the one of eight right now
and i love the size of it and this is
rumored to be bigger I don't remember
how much bigger but I read somewhere I
can't remember where but it's rumored to
be even bigger like five point five
maybe six I don't know so do we think
this is the new one max the one probably
not the one max the woman expects sucked
they didn't suck hold on a second the
one Max's specs didn't suck they just
know they just matched the ones specs
from last year right right it was a no
they didn't you yeah was it Snapdragon
600 so then suck they just ported the
same specs to a bigger chassis basically
and took half Oh is and that was the
difference yeah that was it yeah and it
was built like crap comparatively yeah
really was I'd really did like the max
at all so maybe maybe it is I don't know
either way that that's kind of what
fueled this editorial idea for me
because I had to come up with one really
quickly but it's what your next phone be
bigger or smaller and I write this
because I've tried practically every
smartphone size ever I mean I reviewed
the Z ultra which was the full
made me a cynic and then I've used
everything from the HPV r and the HTC
aria if you remember that phones yeah
yeah 3.2 inch display that phone was
literally the size of my was so tiny i
really liked that thing as a yeah it was
it was super tiny i love the color
scheme of this phone because it was gray
on the outside but if you took the
battery door off this was when HTC would
give me these like tiny little touches
when you took the battery door off this
thing was like Ferrari yellow yes and
they did it with the first draft
incredible they did that you pulled off
the battery door and it was bright red
on the inside whoa that's awesome yeah
and the evo i think was like way too so
yeah but this film was so tiny like
literally palm-sized so i've used all of
these and i've gone back and forth back
and forth wanting a big phone wanting a
little phone and I'm just kind of done
with it hmm so yeah I'm totally cool
with with the size of the Nexus 5 what I
made five inches is like my absolute
sweet spot having tried everything and I
just want to stress that because you get
the one a mate and say this m8 Prime
comes with exactly what we wanted out of
the one I made which is say a 16
megapixel camera or a much higher
resolution camera which is what everyone
said the one inmate mrs. or is not yeah
that's some now I'm not the right person
to talk to you about this area I'm not
gay I'm not gonna give this because
right now I cuz I can't really talk but
it it is a load of crap that when people
go to the look at the m8 and they say
that all the all this thing needs is a
higher resolution camera and they make a
lot of specific comparisons to a
specific device and they're like gee
this is all the m8 needs you just come
from this you put it in this no that's
not what you do in fact that's crap so
right Don and that's not what I'm saying
I'm saying that is the one thing about
the phone that just kind of irks me even
though I take great pictures with it
every day it's just that is the low
point of the phone and say they they put
a higher resolution camera or a better
camera not a high resolution camera a
better camera in this phone but they
make it bigger
you can never get the best of both
worlds never like but I just neck
success this render though I think this
is really ugly looking fun but that
that's the thing this render looks
really really Elementary so I'm going to
wait for two or three passes of the same
thing like we're doing for the four LG's
software yeah the g3's first software
they like a month ago Mike let's wait
and see hold on let's just let's just
see what it is now like wow this is
really gross looking all right yeah it's
always it's always nice to wait for the
release day so that's what we will do is
keep reporting on that finally in the
wearable news moto 360 everyone's
favorite new SmartWatch Motorola has
opened up a contest to design your own
watch face for it which is pretty cool
looks like a pretty simple engine you
throw in whatever image you want it
pastes it on a render of the watch and
it looks pretty good even if you don't
put too much effort into it anyway the
contest one of the prizes you can win a
360 yourself which is pretty sweet but
that's not the thread of this story that
we focused on in this news report from
Steven shank from a couple days ago
instead it looks like there was some
hidden hidden information in here
Motorola has made reference to the same
price that was rumored before two
hundred fifty dollars it looks like a
the contest terms and conditions call
out a value of the wearable that is the
grand prize as 249 so do you think
that's a realistic price for the
motorola 360 Taylor you're the only one
on the team who has a pebble steel at
the moment which is was sitting on the
same price range for a while yeah um
what do you mean for a while is it still
250 yeah okay I was just covering my
butt in case I was wrong i'm pretty sure
it's right um i don't think it's changed
but yeah I paid two hundred and fifty
dollars willingly for the pebble steel I
actually only ended up paying 225
because I did that little thing we would
have paid 250 if you pay the regular
price yeah I bought it at 250 and they
gave me 25 dollars back so is the Moto
360 from what you know of it so far mean
are you surprised by this pricing is
this right on the nose with what you
expected um it is exactly what I
expected
really maybe a little lower I would have
expected around 300 just because this is
a circular display it's a color display
and it has seemingly more functionality
than pebble voice and pebble yeah pal
and and the gear watches are really the
only frame of reference we have for
smartwatches anymore so I figured you
know 250 to 300 bucks this is on the
lower end of that I'm happy I'll buy 1
i'll buy one and i want to compare it
with the pebble and then i'll choose
which 1i keep certainly I'm and I'm
happy as well with if this price does in
fact turn out to be accurate but I'm
also surprised I have to say I thought
they would try and move the Moto 360 a
little at a slightly higher price point
but at the same time that does not
factor in I'm disagree with myself right
now because it doesn't jive with what we
know of Motorola what the company has
always tried to do or has recently tried
to do since it got acquired by google is
to push the entry barrier down on stuff
that we're seeing that with the Moto e
with the Moto G eventually with the Moto
X when it didn't sell well its original
price point yeah and it's and it's funny
to think this is actually only one
hundred dollars cheaper than Motorola's
flagship smartphone right now right yeah
so you can actually get a moto 360 or
will theoretically be able to get a moto
360 and a moto x for the same price as
say an HTC One m8 well I think about
that yeah yeah that's while so it
actually doesn't surprise me given that
context but maybe I've just been so
blinded with the possibilities of what
the Moto 360 could be from an appeal
standpoint because I think it is the
most appealing smart watch out there I
don't think I'm alone on that definitely
the most appeals oh yeah konjac thing
much anyway the only thing that it will
need is some sort of high IP rating
because yeah alright yeah that's the
only thing that that it's not really has
a pink um I'd what I think the other
thing is I'm really concerned about
battery life I do not think it's going
to be haven't well really if it's the
doc that they showed
word that I've seen somewhere where like
you saw the click the blue tint around
back so that tells me that it's a
wireless charging some maybe hopefully
you because wireless charging always
requires a blue tent on the bay no no no
it just there's no port around the
outside of any of the renders oh I
Syrian oh yeah so that would be the only
thing that would kind of sort of make
sense as some sort of charging mechanism
so if it's that and it comes with a
stand and you drop it on the stand and
it charges every night then I don't care
absolutely i mean it is still
inconvenient if you travel all the time
but yeah like my pebble steel lately
when it's paired to the one I made it
dies every other day so I went from
having nine days of battery life 22 when
I got the win a mate and hmm wait and
it's just you're one of me destroyed
your pebbles battery life yeah it's a
common issue with newer phones like the
galaxy s5 the m8 and a couple other new
phones me but I thought it was because I
was running like the pedometer or sleep
as Android or something nope Wow my
phone gave me I turned off notifications
I connected it to the m8 and let it sit
for day and it died the next day wow so
it's it's the the firmware if you update
I think the pebble app maybe oh and yeah
I think it'll fix it I didn't mean to
get off the F track here because i was i
was looking for motorola devices that
exists that have wireless charging cuz i
was about to say is the Moto 360 going
to be the first moto device to support
Chi out of the box but it looks like
verizon's advertising the droid maxx as
she compliant but i don't know if that's
with a case or what I don't remember and
remember either but it is the toys max
need I skipped on that one yeah I guess
it's the droid ultra yo yeah that's
right I guess it didn't really doesn't
really matter because whatever if it has
Chi that's gonna be amazing but still on
even if it has Chi and you know how much
I love that wireless charging standard
I'm gonna be annoyed if I charge that
thing every day I just I have to say if
it's a two or three-day better in life
I'll be happy if it if it matches the
galaxy gear after the update then I will
be happy which i think i was getting
about three days or four days something
like that
but I'll be happy but I won't be upset
if I have to charge it every night as
long as the charging solution is ok if
it's not some obtrusive like cuz you
gotta take this thing off and do this
put this together and put the screw in
and close the door and put it in the
microwave yeah and stand on one foot hop
ok well that is the news in windows
phone and android not much compelling
from iOS except for some iphone 6 rumors
we're not going to cover Taylor we're
not going to cover them because we have
some important stuff to do we gotta go
talk to Ellie spagnola what do you say
we do that Oh folks our transition track
is called radiation and when we use it
on the air I usually say something like
this you may recognize it as one of the
ringtones on your nexus 4nexus s4 galaxy
nexus and it's also a full-length song
by a musician called le spagnola an
artist with millions of fans and a lot
of fun to her live shows and concerts
ali also has a bunch of very fun videos
at our youtube channel and at le
Spagnola com both of them linked in the
description below like I say I usually
say this and it's always true but I
don't usually follow it up by saying we
have Ali Spagnola right here with us Ali
it is a pleasure to have you thank you
so much for joining us the pleasure to
be here thanks for having me I'm really
really glad to have you out I once again
I on the air I should Express Taylor
Martin's sadness that he can't be here
listeners Taylor got hung up writing an
editorial so I lied the last time we
were on the air he's not coming back but
that's okay because we have plenty to
talk about if you are not familiar with
Ali some stats if you're not familiar
she is an internet personality a pop
culture vlogger a visual artist a
performance artist and expert at
drinking with the helmet but most
importantly a musician of uncommon range
from ukulele folk to rap Ali what do you
call yourself if someone asks you to
encapsulate yourself in are like one
sentence I can always love a drinking
composer with a music problem that's an
awesome tagline
I want to hear a little bit about that
particular element later on but if you
okay with you I want to kick off by
starting by talking about your youtube
channel yeah absolutely it's I've spent
the last probably 40 minutes 45 minutes
watching binge watching Ali Spagnola
video and the channel is kind of this
monument to to absurdity to awesome
absurdity you've got everything from
made up lyrics to the jay-z solange
thing to commentary and Michael Bay's
CES meltdown our listeners would
remember that to a story about how you
got banned in michigan so it is all the
latest yet but but it also it's also
like really genuine though I mean it's
it's entertaining yes but your presence
on the channel is is intimate and it's
very real and it's in contrast to some
of your album work where you're
presented you know much more
conventionally is like here on the
artist and this is this is the music is
your YouTube personality how close is
that to the real you is my question yeah
that's me I just make a mess once a week
and put out a video so you're seeing
like you're hanging out in your part in
my apartment with me that's that's
honest and is it really just once a week
that you do videos cuz I mean there's
there's so much content there it just it
seems like it comes out more often but
it's just once a week yeah unless
something comes up but mostly it's once
a week or if I'm traveling it's less
than so oh yeah true um we have a
YouTube is a giant part of what we do
here at pagano so it's always it's sort
of fun to hear what kind of vision other
people have for their own video channels
what do you see the future of that part
of your life being relative to touring
and such like that because you know you
seem very at home in front of that
particular set of cameras so do you see
that expanding in the future or do will
strike this balance yeah I'm still sort
of figuring that out I mean those like
weird transition period where I'm making
a new album and I would call it my
sophomore album even though it'll be my
fifth one because it's the most recent
one that I had put out is the one I'm
known for and so now sort of like I got
to follow that up and really you know
knock it out of the park to to follow up
the one that got me so much attention
and I'm yeah I figure out how I can work
that in with my youtube channel but I
mean it's like the reason it's so real
is that it's just like a fun experience
experiment for me right now and I'm
saying
they go along well it's it's definitely
mean that that rawness comes through but
not in a you know amateurish way it's
all done really well it's all day it's
really cool thanks with your most recent
album you're talking about is that the
ego or is that free of style which one
is the more recent one the most recent
one actually is the power hour one so
that's the one that sort of got me all
the attention and now I'm gonna Luke
step away from that and even though I
gave you my short bio that's funny it is
very pin holy or I'm stuck being a
drinker and I'm gonna move towards the
musician yes so is that is that like
your sense that that most people
perceive you is like oh yeah okay Alice
Pagano she's the one that like drinks
all the time and like does the drinking
music is that what it is or yeah I'm
pretty sure that's how I'm known oh yeah
on Twitter just being like the drunk
comedian kind of thing well alright then
then that bleeds perfectly in my next
question tell us tell us about how you
were banned in michigan please can you
can you wrap that up for us in a in a
nice little bow yeah it's pretty
complicated but basically i was going to
play a show at a school that i call tech
they also call themselves tech actually
and um everything was booked and great
and ready to go and then like it the day
before my drummer was already driving
out there and the venue cancelled on me
mysteriously and so i rescheduled and
that venue cancelled mysteriously and
then i rescheduled and kissed hanselman
seriously and this whole time all the
students are helping me to try and
reschedule and would just don't realize
like understand what's going wrong and
it turns out that there was someone out
to get me in Michigan that had the cops
involved and the State Liquor Control
Board and they they basically said I
cannot perform in Michigan just one
person out to get you well it seemed to
be one person that was sort of
spearheading at all and then he got like
everyone else on board to kick me out of
the state they it got to the point where
i was driving there and the students
were just setting up a meet and greet
where we weren't even gonna play my show
that's may or may not be illegal in
michigan it was just gonna be like
hanging out and the cop said no ali
spagnola cannot hold an event in
michigan wow yeah in altum so i actually
didn't get to the end of your
so that happened like that was a that
was a cancellation you did not have any
kind of event in Michigan ultimately
exactly I just went and hung out in a
bar and there happened to be other
students there at the time but there we
were not allowed to hold an event Wow
yeah this is this has to do with
something that we should probably
explain we this is a result of the
nature of your show right this is
because of of the power our concept can
you explain that really quickly yeah so
my live show doubles as a drinking game
and when I'm performing the audience is
playing along and so it's like an
interactive party and also something
that apparently terrifies the whole
state of michigan and it so you people
as i understand it take a shot of beer
every time you start a new song and one
of these could have concerts right yes
every song is a minute long so every
time I change the music everybody cheers
together and drinks that sounds awesome
unless you live in Michigan in which
case it sounds awful apparently the one
person who has great sway over everyone
else yeah that's unfortunate i'm sorry
to hear that that happened i review how
far have you traveled i mean it is it a
nationwide kind of tour or you I forgot
what you said earlier I know you're
working on another album right now we're
on tour right now well at the end of
last year I finished up my biggest tour
so far which was my freedom victory tour
and I went to 20 cities across the u.s.
so yeah the whole nationwide thing which
was really cool and so now yeah but
working on new music awesome now how did
you this is such a lame question but I
am very interested in how you started
with with your musical career because it
is so far ranging and at one point you
in 2008 wikipedia says you were doing
custom artwork for like things like
visual artwork yeah in 2008 I don't know
Wikipedia is not trustworthy I'm still
doing that project I've been doing it
for seven years really yeah this was
called at one point is still called
fritters for president no it is not that
is also wrong no no no the project is
called remaining oh jeez that's much
more straightforward I don't understand
why thanks a lot more sense than
printers for president I think it's
whatever my mom my power our league of
fans likes to mess with me apparently
that's why that's on there I don't know
just when we thought we could trust
Wikipedia I thought I was done hearing
about how
wasn't a trustworthy primary source but
okay well that's that is awesome I I'm
sure that your origin story extends four
layers and layers beyond that I want to
talk a little bit about the the context
with which you you you and pocket now
became accidentally intertwined
listeners you may remember this from I
don't know how long ago this was now but
it was probably about 10 or 10 or 15
episodes ago so we introduced a segment
a feature segment using radiation which
is a trek we're going to talk about in a
second but it's a tract of alleys and le
you know what it's like to be too busy
right indeed I do yeah so your brain
doesn't work right and I had put
together this episode I forgot even who
our guest was but we we led into the
feature segment with radiation it worked
perfectly I was like this is great and
then I put the music credit in the thing
and I'm like wow I got that track
because it was sitting on a folder on my
desktop if full of ringtones because I
have a lot of ringtones from many
devices cuz we use them for various
things and I'm like you know this sounds
really you know this isn't a
notification tone this isn't something
that I can just kind of like take and
not think about this is a song let me
see if I can find this on the internet
and then of course i did and i came to
le spectre nola.com like oh it seems
there was a musician behind this song
and then I reached out daily on Twitter
thought better of it and reached out to
her privately and was like hey we lists
we used your music and I think probably
we should not have because now i realize
that crap this is say we should strike a
deal and listeners rather than you know
sue us into oblivion le very very nicely
struck a deal with us and that's why
we're able to use radiation on on all
the show so while we have you on the air
thank you very much frizzle thank you
too for being honest I mean you could
have just kept kept using it and I would
have been on the wiser well actually I
would have been wiser so you this is
funny before you even contacted me I
knew you were using it because I have
pingbacks from my wordpress site and you
did link directly to me and so I got an
alert that was like someone's talking
about you
and I just check it out like oh cool
they use my music whatever so I wasn't
it so I was aware so I appreciate you
you coming to me and being honest oh
absolutely yeah no it's my background is
as an artist of a sort and I really
don't like when people use my work
without permission or attribution or
anything like that so I'm very glad and
and you know the benefit to all this and
despite the fact that we get a really
cool track to use on our show is that we
I never thought about where ringtones
come from before like at all in any
sense night I don't know if a lot of our
listeners have thought about this but
all but these things have to be created
and they're not just made out of whole
cloth there are some firms have in-house
orchestras and they do their own things
and stuff you know we see this kind of
stuff from from LG in particular where
they get the Vienna Boys Choir to do
some special stuff for them though you
know contract out but radiation is
special because it actually is it is
made from the the sound pattern of
radiation interfering with a with a set
of speakers can you talk about how this
track came together I mean what's what's
the story with this I well I had always
been interested in that sort of sound
and the rhythms that that interference
makes and so I initially wrote the track
for free of style which you had
mentioned earlier that was an album that
I was commissioned to do for a dance
convention that was going on in
Pittsburgh so it was supposed to be like
break dancing music that people would be
you know busting a move to and it went
on that album and then it caught the ear
of some people like at Android and that
the rest is history so then they decided
to build it into yeah the phones elicit
before the Galaxy Nexus Nexus 4 in the
Nexus S &amp;amp; but that wasn't the that
wasn't the only one so Palma before we
move on from radiation because I'll get
ahead of myself here can you talk about
how you actually captured it I mean we
all know that sound we know what happens
we have an incoming call and you're
listening to music or something you get
that interference pattern but what kind
of I mean did you arrange the did you
know the beads that the composition
stuff was this uh like a like a team
effort or was this entirely or your baby
this particular track
my baby so it was me in my studio led
close to my speakers callin my mother
and a recording directly the feedback
that I got from those speakers and then
I chopped that up into samples and I
actually like um made a whole keyboard
set sweet so like I pitched it up you
know half step for each note and I can
actually just play like i have now my
keyboard is radiation sound so i can
just play like a regular piano but have
it sound like radiation ferris bueller's
day off when it's doing the six hands
yes exactly yes exactly like that okay
to get super nerdy with you because I
know people will want to know what kind
of phone was that do you remember oh
yeah I was probably like a flip phone it
had to have been a while ago right cuz
that sound doesn't happen anymore with
the g4 or 4G or whatever yeah with LTE
it's a different you can get it to make
it sound but it's a different
interference pattern entirely it's
nowhere doesn't have nearly the
character of the old gsm sling and
that's another thing it probably wasn't
verizon or sprint i'm gonna guess it was
probably AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile right yes sir
late in t nice sweet well done nerd cred
is intact but amazing well that's that
is awesome and then so radiation goes
out it becomes this this ringtone and
then there's interest in in whatever
Google department is in charge of the
ringtone situation in another track
right yeah robots for everyone yeah
and old circuits and smiles all right so
I listen to this for the first time just
a couple minutes ago before we got in
the air because I radiation I'm obsessed
with and I love it but this one I hadn't
really heard him and I just found it on
your website and I'm listening to it and
I'm like okay it's obviously you because
it's quirky and it's light and it's fun
but it's got lyrics which is unusual for
a ringtone so weird it's surrounded by
all this electronic stuff it's the one
would like some random strumming guitar
white girl singing I just don't get it
it's it does it's sung in a much lower
key it's got lower energy you know how
did this happen I mean I'm not gonna say
that you sound unhappy you're doing good
but you're definitely like it's so it is
the lowest energy i've ever heard from
any bit of your performance so like what
was it like to record that was that just
like a one-off contract kind of thing or
is that something you came up with her
yeah so that yeah it is super chill and
very different like you're saying from
all my other stuff that was from awhile
ago that I did that as a part of my
senior project as I was an art major and
so I did an animation of these robots as
a band and I wrote that track to be the
robot band yeah it's more like little
nuts and bolts dancing on the keys and
stuff it's yes you did she was well
mm-hmm yes okay and then they like at
Google they were familiar with my music
and they liked this one too so they
added that in Wow and that was on the
same batch of handsets and that that
when I was now that one I had not heard
before and that's wild so between Rick
yeah and then there were some that were
remixed for the t-mobile some t-mobile
branded handsets the mytouch 4G and
stuff uh-huh Jeffers like the funny
thing about that the robot 12 is that
like if you notice the lyrics are nuts
and bolts circuits and wires right yeah
but there's like a pause after the first
word so I sing not
and like there's enough time to answer
your phone so basically it's just like
the nuts ringtone and like the majority
of the world has just heard me say the
word nut nuts actually I'm gonna grab
that now and that's gonna be my ringtone
for a minute I just want to see how
quickly i can pick up the phone no so
all right you've got these things that
you've got the remixed ones on the t
mobile phones you've got it on android
phones all around the world at some
point you had to stop and realize that
millions of people were picking up their
phone because a piece of your art is
commanding them to how is that it was
that was that weird do you remember that
moment we were like wow how about that
it's so freaking awesome and it happened
right now again like every time I think
about it I'm like I can't believe this
it's too cool I'm wondering like you
know Michael Jackson's probably up there
in terms of like most played artists
right but like you got to think about
like text messages and and rings and
whatever like maybe I'm catching up to
him god yes and just like total gross
plays right exactly yeah and then you
got to think about like what phones at
it cuz you know we know what phones it's
on but then you can port it to other one
so now I'm thinking I'm like we've
they're all these phones that have
superior hardware like man I'd like to
play this on like it HTC One with those
crazy boomsound speakers &amp;amp; lubes it's
sweet and then some plays are worth more
than others it's like oh great I we've
been talking about these older phones
though I mean other plans for for more
tones can you talk about that at all
because you know it's been a couple
generations since the last the last
built-in round of Ali Spagnuolo
ringtones yeah it has been a while but I
mean I don't have any news about on that
front I will still love Google would
love to work with them but sorry I got
nothing to report you heard it here
goober give ali another call because
these are pretty cool tones can we throw
in i'll ask you i'll ask you again out
there but if we can throw in robots
under the show would be cool well i
might have to because it's hip it's cool
but it's also it's just so weird I can't
after watching your videos for so long
and then to hear robust my god before we
we sort of wrap it up here I want to
know when you when are you touring next
if people are listening you from the
United States we do have a fairly large
American audience on the show where can
they see you next well
semenax on the internet I do a live
stream show so I don't even have to come
to you or vice versa yeah what would let
that story on that well it's called the
no-pants power hour because you don't
have to put pants on to come out and
party with me just hang out in your own
place your own place that's exactly
right that's a beauty of working from
home too but yeah and we do a live
stream show and a live chat room where
I'm talking with everyone and in the
audience I don't know it's it's a good
time think like a late night variety
