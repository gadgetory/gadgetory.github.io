pocket now calm when we first receive
the samsung continuum from Verizon
Wireless we were very excited to get it
unboxed in that unboxing video we just
took a quick look at what to expect when
you first put the device up as well as a
brief overview of the hardware well now
it's time to go into depth and go into
more detail in our heart overview of the
Samsung continuum let's get started and
we're back with the Samsung continuum
now we've mentioned that this is
actually a very unique device and in
this video we're going to start to tell
you why and we'll continue that in our
software overview video and the reason
for that it actually has a secondary
ticker screen down here now we're going
to bring the device closer so you can
actually see the reflection hopefully
this is able to see you seen on camera
we have the main screen here as you can
see which is the Super AMOLED screen
that we're going to have a black trim so
it's actually a separation here then
followed by the ticker so you're going
to have your Android capacitive buttons
here and then you'll have your ticker
screen down here at the bottom now the
top main screen is a 3.4 inch screen
it's once again a super amoled screen
that has a resolution of 480 x 800 so
it's a relatively high resolution screen
and the bottom screen is also going to
be super amoled however it's much
smaller at one point eight inches with a
resolution of 480 x 96 now before we
turn the screen on and actually give you
a quick look we're actually going to go
ahead and take a look at the rest of the
device first as you'll see you're going
to have these Samsung as well as the
verizon wireless branding and if you
turn the device over you're going to see
the new Galaxy S logo signifying to you
this is actually a galaxy s device now
let's go ahead and start on the right
side with our quick hardware tour on the
right side we're going to have the
camera button as you'll see here we're
also going to have the micro SD card
slot now in this slot itself you'll
actually have a card pre-installed and
that's going to be an 8 gigabyte card
however this is capable of handling up
to 32 gigs one great little tip but
that's typically looked over is that a
vise also has some internal storage on
its own measuring at around two
gigabytes now after we've install
many of our applications as well as the
initial boot up we are seeing about 1.6
2 gigabytes to be exact so if you round
down to 1.5 gig plus the 8 for the
memory card you of course have the 9.5
but if you do out of 32 you actually can
increase to 33.5 gigabytes if you so
desire moving to the top of the device
next you're going to see the power and
lock and unlock button as well as your
3.5 millimeter headphone jack next on
the left side we're going to have the
volume rocker up and down as well as
that nicely placed micro USB port a lot
of the Samsung devices have had that
port on the top it seems that this one
now is on the side and personally we
hope that this stays that way the top
kind of makes things somewhat difficult
with some situations whether it be a car
dock or a home doc whatever this will
actually open up the possibility for a
home dock which will actually go over in
our software overview and then last on
the bottom you're going to have the
actual microphone port place on the
right side which is somewhat tough to
see now on the back of the device you're
going to see the 5 megapixel autofocus
and camera with LED flash as well as
your speaker port or your speaker grill
down here as well as i hear there's
actually going to be too so you're going
to have the stereo speaker sound coming
out of this device if we go ahead and
pop the battery cover off you'll be
greeted to the 1,500 milliamp hour
battery which is becoming typical in
samsung fashion at least on the Galaxy S
line of devices Samsung is estimating it
to provide around seven hours of
talktime and about 300 12 hours of
standby time we'll see how that performs
in our testing at the heart of the
continuum is a 1 gigahertz hummingbird
processor Samsung's hummingbird line of
processors is very highly regarded
currently in the smartphone especially
the android market now lastly before we
get to showing you those two different
screens for connectivity you're going to
have wireless 802 11 BG and n as well as
Bluetooth 3.0 now to the moment you've
all been waiting for let's go ahead and
turn on the screen now as you'll see
here going to have two different screens
the main 3.4 inch as well as the sum
our ticker at the bottom I should go
ahead and unlock this real quick this is
going to be a brief look because we're
actually going to cover this more and
our software overview of this device now
as you'll see different notifications
will actually pop up down here while
you'll have your typical main Android
feed and enjoyed display up at the top
now if you want to see us go into more
depth with this with this ticker make
sure you stay tuned for our next video
which will be the software overview as
always thank you very much for watching
everyone and please give this video a
thumbs up we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
