number of different ways for you specs
junkies you can pause the video here to
get a quick look at the hardware
differences between the two now with
that out of the way in part one of our
big phone dual-camera showdown we're
pitting huawei's mate 9 against what
will likely be one of the top-selling
phablets of the year the iPhone 7 plus
both are rockin 1080p LCDs both have
fingerprint sensors both have stereo
speakers and both have crazy-cool dual
camera systems these displays are pretty
evenly matched with a slight brightness
edge going to the iPhone Apple scores
for having better color accuracy but
it's incredible to see how much screen
Huawei has packed into a frame nearly
the same size as the iPhone looking at
overall build quality both phones feel
solid aluminum frames the iPhone landing
a touch thinner but that's less a
concern with such large devices
personally I prefer the rear mounted
fingerprint sensor on the mate as
dancing a slippery phone around in your
hand is daunting at this screen size
however we do appreciate that Apple
includes enhanced water resistance for
the durability win speaker performance
is also a fairly even matchup but the
headphone playback shows a wider
difference the mate 9 is more convenient
for having the jack built-in but Apple's
headphone adapter delivers higher
quality audio and a quick look at
battery life the iPhone 7 plus is our
undisputed champ for benchmarking but
the main tonight doesn't land too far
behind 30-minute streaming HD video over
Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the seven plus drained
three percent of its battery while the
mate drained for both phones easily
lasting all day or two days with light
use and power saving options the script
flips on recharging though where the
mate is a screamer using the included
charger for 30 minutes the iPhone topped
off 19 percent while the mate 9 hit a
fantastic 58 percent recharge lastly
we've got to talk about these cameras
and for two dual camera systems they
couldn't be more different in feel and
application Apple has stayed consistent
with the simplified interface while
Leica and Huawei are delivering a fairly
full-featured photography layout in
general looking at full auto to full
auto shots the iPhone remains the more
consistent performer in image processing
and we like that
Apple seems to play more with the color
of afternoon light California Sun gets
warm in the evenings mate photos tend to
be a bit stark with the white balance
airing on true white but we are happy to
see that this dual camera system still
delivers on what we liked from the p9
images have terrific dynamic range with
excellent detail and the larger camera
sensors produce softer bouquet it
doesn't take much of an adjustment from
manual modes or an editing to fill in
some without warm or white balance
apples dual sensor design incorporates a
zoom while the mates uses info from both
sensors to improve light color and
contrast Huawei utilizes a number of
fancy / scanning tricks for image
processing Apple's Hardware delivers a 2
X optical zoom which can be further
cropped while the mate over samples the
image to deliver a 4x hybrid zoom which
still retains the 12 megapixel
resolution of standard shots the iPhone
output is a bit sharper but while weighs
performance here is surprisingly good
for this kind of software processing and
gets it just a touch closer to your
subject before cropping adding Hardware
stabilization to the mate 9 is a huge
step up over the p9 and we also get you
HD video using h.265 compression to keep
file sizes from getting out of hand
one minute of UHD video on the iPhone
weighs in at 325 megabytes while the
mate 9 is saving you more than 100
megabytes per minute for comparable
quality o is is appreciated but Huawei's
implementation is noticeably busier
software stabilization can have some
issues with panning but apple's solution
is formidable and produce a smoother
output especially when trying to hold
still the mates videos just livelier
though it's important to mention that
the iPhone still loses on audio capture
with a mono signal while the may not
only delivers stereo audio it can also
focus those microphones to hone in on
the direction of your subject the other
handy advantage of having dual sensors
is the ability to use depth information
Apple has released the portrait mode
beta and it's a smooth operator using
the zoom lens to help deliver a prettier
bouquet blur to your background when you
line up the shot under the right
conditions the effect pops into place
nice and easy the problem is this is an
automatic filter if you're too close or
the camera
besides there's not enough light the
effect won't activate this is
problematic for the zoom lens as that
camera is using a smaller sensor with a
smaller aperture so it's already not a
low light champ the mate 9 on the other
hand is able to use both sensors
together since the lenses have the same
focal length like as wide aperture mode
doesn't require any specific distance or
lighting conditions and users have the
option of adjusting blur after the shots
been taken so even close up under dim
indoor lighting you can still apply the
background blur effect these to deliver
on very different philosophies as I
personally prefer shooting on cameras
which give the user more control I'm
obviously going to lean towards the mate
but I also have to admit that this
system has one of the steeper learning
curves for folks looking to jump in and
start shooting if you're apt to shoot
full auto you'll likely be better served
by the iPhone so let's wrap this up
where does that leave us between the
mate 9 and the iPhone 7 plus these
Titans deliver a brutal battle nearly
option for option where one might take
an advantage the other will top on a
different feature even personally where
I enjoy the mates camera I prefer
listening to music on the iPhone I
personally prefer Android but emu i5 and
huawei's customizations still need to
prove themselves against the performance
track record of iOS and Apple's history
of support and updates for my money I'd
still pick the mate but for anyone
considering an ecosystem swap this is a
tough choice between two monster devices
