model seems to be the first US carrier
to get it and Microsoft begins having
piracy issues in their marketplace all
the sins are coming up right now come
over when I'm high never be better with
pocketnow.com and welcome to Windows
Phone view the show we wrap up all this
week's good and bad inside the wall of
microsoft's windows won't lat form the
start this week off what's good well
let's begin with your typical nokia
microsoft news as we do every week the
nokia lumia 710 is finally available and
shipping and it seems that worldwide
availability will be rich soon rumors
have it well not really sure if these
are rumors anymore but it seems a
t-mobile will be the first carrier in
the US to have it so let's expect that
to be true and that to be the same
reality for other carriers in the future
assume future now how exactly do we know
about that Lumia t-mobile deal will set
your calendars for December 14th at 7pm
as we have none other than t-mobile
having an event that has no key branding
on it could the Lumia 710 be the only
windows phone that will get on the event
well it only says t-mobile and Nokia
doesn't say how many phones are we
getting so we could also be getting the
lonely 800 as part of the package now
say your calendars and tune in to our
website as we dig in for all the details
for you out of this week's coverage make
sure you catch Adam lanes recent video
this xbox live game called hasta la
maleta which means until death in
English it's kind of this weird survival
3d game that's actually looking more
like a 2d cartoon in graphics catch the
video and simply will pay three bucks if
you like the game also catch Stan
Webster's Windows Phone app round up
every week where we review as many as
five applications in 30 seconds each
only here every week now let's talk
about Windows Phone 7 and NFC whoa
Coleman from Microsoft in the UK
recently came on record stating the
windows phones already supports and of C
but whatever does he mean by support NFC
of no OEM devices
that really happened could it mean the
vos is ready and designed as a portent
of seat could it be that current devices
that are already shipped have NFC inside
them well we haven't really seen any
indications that there's any NFC ship on
the battery covers or anything so it
could be the case that it's just support
within the operating system though it
could mean that OEMs in the future could
just come out in surprises with some NFC
support just call this a weird rumor for
now but it's really cool to see that
it's already being supported let's see
what happened in the future and before
we get to the bad section it's kind of
funny to see that we're getting windows
phone buildings and towers much faster
than we're getting phones I mean calls
an irony but Paris just got their own
windows phone tower from Nokia and okies
also building towers of phones just
about everywhere how about if they
figure out a way to have those towers be
built within their buildings and let's
just get more phones because hasn't now
the lineup of windows phones out there
is nice but it could be so much better
that doesn't for the good let's continue
on with what's batting what piracy seems
to be the new thing in the windows phone
marketplace it seems that porting nokia
applications the other smartphone OE
ends has become so easy than microsoft's
not liking it now here's the funny part
parts have figured out a way to pull
Nokia's navigation software pirated
upload it to the marketplace and have
the application of through by microsoft
tire mark eurasian now how does marcus
off the old with this row you don't see
the application anymore on your device
and you installed it well that's because
microsoft ended up pulling it now it's
kind of sad to see that things happen
this way but imagine the case where we
could probably get malware on the
marketplace approved by microsoft
because of their lack of curation it
could happen so well first of all let's
hope Microsoft figures it out because it
seems that this is something that has to
do with their service and their
procedures and I necessarily what
pirates can do well it's ingenious Singh
piracy let's call it that way that's it
for today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm high never iveta remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
