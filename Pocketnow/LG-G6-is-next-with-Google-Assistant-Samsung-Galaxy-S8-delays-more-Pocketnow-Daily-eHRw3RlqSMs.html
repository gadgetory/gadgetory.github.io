few Google technologies the samsung
galaxy SI is reportedly going to take
some time to launch and the HTC you
ultra may be closer than we thought for
a launch I'm hi Mary vera and could we
take a break from all the political news
on a Monday you know it's bad enough
this is parking out daily the official
news they have to do with some
interesting developments guevara former
vp of google and yes robot eyes the
correct way to pronounce his name has
now announced that he's also leaving
shown me after a couple of years of
being in the company we have seen an
amazing turnaround with the company
internationally and that's what was
there to do but according to him it
seems that the environment all the
traveling has taken a toll on his health
it's great to see that is making a
decision for his health primarily we
just wonder what his future will be
mainly because he did an amazing job at
Google's Android apartment I would love
to see him back now talk about the hcc
you ultra i really like that phone the
time that i had with it in vegas and i
cannot wait to see when to get it got
some trusted sources playing that we
might see this phone launched in taiwan
as soon as a month from now meaning it
could happen late februari and it makes
all the sense of the world we are close
to mwc by that date so hopefully
overview will be ready by then a very
interesting way to start art they had
everything to do with the samsung galaxy
note 7 those of you that were wondering
exactly what happened the company just
confirmed two things number one of the
first batch of phones exploded because
of a faulty battery design the second
because batteries were fixed but then
there was a puncture from the hardware
so design was also to blame and no point
does the company really apologize but i
don't really mind that accompanies
apologized enough it has confirmed that
it's implementing a crazy amount of
steps for checking batteries going
forward so let's see what we get the
spotlight over to the samsung galaxy s 8
for those of you that are wondering
exactly how those crazy amount of steps
the check batteries are going to affect
the future bathroom stands like product
well we get to hear that the company has
confirmed that we will not be getting
the samsung galaxy estate announced at
mwc it's traditionally been announced
for the power
three years at that event or I would say
almost but it seems that the company is
now saying that it will be announced in
time between h1 of 2017 that is a long
time that's six months so well could be
that we get another unpacked event in
New York and I hope that I'm there to
cover it and finally the very
interesting news is they have to do with
the LG G six mainly because we've got
trusted sources planning but this will
be the first phone that's non pixel that
will be running the Google assistant
bear in mind the guy that's delivering
the news right now held an HTC you ultra
which is also supposed to launch with
the Google assistance it makes you
wonder exactly which of these phones
will be sure we know that LG and Google
have a great relationship and
partnership with the Nexus lineup but
then again the current pixel was
designed by HTC so anyway it leads me to
the question of the day how important is
the google assistant to you do you think
that this is a deal breaker for your
next smartphone because honestly in my
case i have been using the google
assistant for a bit and I stand by my
review of the Google pixel it has great
promises but it still can't really
assist you in many things a lot of these
things are still potential I can't wait
to test that but anyways leave us a
comment down below we looked in on your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
