pocketnow.com and today we're going to
take a closer look at the hardware on
the kindle fire from amazon so sit back
relax and enjoy the show so let's start
out looking at the actual 7 inch
displays you can see we got this turned
on right now IPS display it's got
Gorilla Glass here so we can stand up to
a lot of abuse if you turn it just
slightly you can see the spot spear that
happened on some displays but not on
others not terribly important it doesn't
detract from the viewing angles or
anything like that to say anything like
that rubberized a border that goes
around the edge here adds a little bit
of a grip otherwise I think it's just
there to hold the glass I don't know
that it has any specific purpose at all
brightness on the other hand this is at
the lowest brightness right now and if
we kick that brightness all the way up
to full bright because it gets a lot
brighter color levels are good in
comparison with like the galaxy s2 and
say another you know Android devices
this is a little warmer in color than
the galaxy s2 like the epic 4g touch but
it is the color depth and the contrast
isn't as good as say on a super amoled
screen it does have another sensor up
here which we talked about in the
unboxing this turns out to be that this
this might be the light sensor and it
just is currently disabled in this
version of the Amazon tablet android OS
whether or not it remains to be seen if
they're going to reenable that
brightness functionality apparently was
buggy so that's why it was left out but
to the sensor is still there which is
great on the bottom of the device here
we can see the power button which lights
up as you charge it so it's green when
it's charging or rather it's green when
it's fully charged or when you power it
on it turns on green for a moment orange
when it's charging it's got a standard
micro USB charging port which is
fantastic which means that you don't
have to rely on any
prior Terry cabling use any micro USB
cable you like if you plug it into your
computer it still will charge from your
computer although it up that'll be a
little slower then you would if you Paul
you two doing the wall wart that's
included headphone jack is as you would
expect by some reviews I have scenes
talked about the fact that this also
produce a lot of clicking and popping I
didn't experience any of that and I also
didn't have any problems with clicking
or popping or humming noises occurring
when I wasn't in human unity music or
audio was playing that said they also
found out that while the kindle fire
does not have a microphone port in it if
you buy the right combination of
microphone / headphone you can actually
use the microphone on the headphone unit
two broadcasts or record directly into
the kindle fire which is a great feature
on the top and here we've got the
speakers and as you can see they're just
a couple of pair of speakers and when
you hold on to it vertically as you
would or rather in landscape mode as you
would with let's say netflix or amazon's
video store you're actually holding on
to one of these speakers so then the
sound becomes quite small and and then
really with these sort of speakers you
can't expect to have too much else from
them other than a small sound they're
not going to be a powerhouse they're
going to work just fine but they are
what you expect on the back of the unit
we've got the Kindle logo and as you can
see here it's got kind of a rubberized
feel that does pick up fingerprints
pretty readily but it does allow for you
to have a pretty firm grip on the device
it's got a 4400 milliamp hour battery
according to the folks at the exit site
and frankly I found that the battery
life has been fantastic with this unit
even though though it's a little smaller
than let's say the ipad 2 we'll come
back to that more in the comparison side
of the video tour but really I've been
very pleased with the
life on the device Wi-Fi only on this
device although the chipsets again from
the teardown that we've seen online also
includes the bluetooth and FM radio so
it remains to be seen if somebody can
get that enabled in a custom rom or if
Amazon is going to include that in the
future eight gigabytes of flash memory
all of that is available to the user to
in-store things from or i should say all
that a small amount that will save the
OS and swap space and that sort of thing
unlike the nook color which is only
designed to allow for a small amount of
user set aside space so you can load
this up with as many videos as you like
of your own devising as well as
streaming video content through amazon
service or through netflix etc 512 megs
ram that does make the device a little
bit sluggish at times but frankly i've
found that for this type of device it's
perfectly serviceable very snappy some
reviews have mentioned that touching the
items on the screen causing the launch
very slowly I haven't found that to be
the case I've found it to be more often
not it's when I'm tapping the screen I
miss tap on you can see my daughter has
been watching miss tap on the actual
large icons specifically with this the
carousel view here is where that has a
tendency to happen but you can see here
I'm able to flip through this very
quickly without any problems and if I go
into the apps here my app tray i can
scroll up and down and there's very
little hesitation or lag you can see a
little bit there as I'm going up and
down I think that has more to do with
the android OS than the actual processor
and ram because of these items down here
with the arrows on them will cover more
of those in the software review but
that's how you get access to some of
your other previously purchased amazon
apps that aren't downloaded to the
device it's got a dual core 1 gigahertz
texas instruments omap 4430 processor
again is very snappy and i have found it
to be very comparable to other devices
that I've got it's not the fastest up
you know android tablet it's out there
but for what i'm doing with it namely
reading books and occasionally watching
video
reading comics it's really really snappy
thickness of the device has not been
really too much of a problem it is
larger than say the ipad 2 thickness
wise but it feels really good in the
hands reading a book with this form
factor has been really nice and
convenient feels very comfortable and
frankly I find myself using this quite a
bit around the house to read content
specific comic books or say I amazon
books that sort of thing some website
browsing although you have to do a lot
of pinch to zoom more than you would on
a larger tablet device that wraps up our
closer look at the hardware on the
amazon kindle fire if you have any
comments or questions would like to see
something specifically covered in the
software tour coming up soon then leave
a comment below and we'll try to cover
those items for you please leave us a
