know that a special new tablet launched
today I'm Taylor Martin this is pocket
now and this is our unboxing of the 2013
Nexus 7 so google just announced the
nexus 7 the successor to last year's
Nexus 7 which was affordable
groundbreaking and quite a nice tablet
but we had some problems and Google's
answered those this is the 16 gigabyte
Wi-Fi model and other than that there's
nothing to go on about about the very
bright blue vibrant box so we're going
to get inside this thing here if we can
just and pop the top off the bucks we're
going to set the Nexus to the side for a
minute and inside the box I can't
imagine we have too much because this is
only two hundred and twenty nine dollars
starting for the 16 gigabyte model plus
tax of course and in here we've got
pamphlets warranty and safety and some
instructions on how to get started and
beneath that we have the AC adapter with
a micro USB cord so nothing too fancy
there just your standard contents
nothing special inside the box so we're
going to put that aside and go back to
the tablet right off the bat it's easy
to see that this thing is a lot smaller
and more narrow than its its predecessor
it's easier to hold in one hand it's
it's about six millimeters narrower and
it's one point eight millimeters thinner
so it's noticeably smaller more
lightweight and it feels really good at
least the size but let's get the plastic
off really quick and look at the tablet
maybe I'm having trouble with just about
everything so put that to the side so in
the front here we have a 7-inch 1920 x
1200 display which is noticeably more
dense at least before we turn it on then
the original Nexus 7 which had a 7 inch
WXGA display and around back we actually
have a camera this time it's a 5
megapixel camera your horizontal Nexus
branding your Seuss's course the
manufacturer and you've got your power
volume rocker and what looks to be a
microphone on the lock or
on the right edge nothing on the left
edge the top has your 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and some speakers that
point outwards and along the bottom
we've also got two more little speakers
that point out and your micro USB
charging port other than that there's
really not a lot on the hardware except
for your 1 point 2 megapixel
front-facing camera inside it has a 39
50 million power battery and a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon s4 pro
chipset so that's not the best news ever
it's not the worst it's also not the
best it has two gigabytes of RAM which
is nice and it comes in 16 or 32
gigabytes and storage and it will
eventually come in an LTE model which
will also work with tmobile AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon the same model which is really
nice it's unlocked and it will work with
any of those which is nice and maybe a
little positive note for the future of
Nexus and carriers and LTE of course but
let's power the display on and see what
this actually looks like because I'm
interested to see if it's the one of the
problems we have with the the original
Nexus 7 is how poor the display is not
only was it low resolution it didn't
have great color reproduction or
contrast or much of anything it was
really kind of just there alright so we
have this thing finally set up at least
enough to where we can get in and look
at the display now it's it's hard to
tell because I don't have a nexus 7
right here beside me but this looks
noticeably more vibrant than the one
before it's the color reproduction looks
pretty great at least so far I can't
tell these these colors look maybe a
little pale pillar than they should be I
don't know it's hard to tell without any
kind of comparison right now but the
blacks look pretty dark they don't look
very dark hair there's a little a
difference between the bezel and the
blacks on the display but it does look a
little better than what I remember the
nexus 7 to be and we do actually have a
little lag here so it's actually trying
to download a bunch of my apps so that
could be the problem but stay tuned for
more nexus 7 coverage in the next few
days in the coming weeks and I'm Taylor
Martin this is pocket now and this has
been an unboxing of the new Nexus 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
