produced a full overview on the g6 we
wanted to take a quick closer look at
the display on this bad boy and
considering the 5.7 inch diagonal the
overall footprint feels surprisingly
small in the hand over previous G Series
phones the extra real estate comes from
making the screen taller specifically
delivering a 28 80 by 1440 resolution
display which is a 2 by 1 aspect ratio
or 18 by 9 or even a 34,000 by 17,000
aspect ratio all the same thing really
when you reduce your fraction now the
corners of this phone have an almost
battlestar galactica vibe happening now
LG reps claim that this curve will help
disperse the force of an impact if you
happen to drop it on a corner I probably
won't be the one to do that kind of drop
test the display comes ready for HDR
content supporting both HDR 10 and Dolby
vision and will be compatible with
content produced by Netflix and Amazon
with this 2x1 display it makes split
screening apps a pair of perfect squares
okay your navigation dock cuts into one
of those squares but we see LG is trying
to make use of that extra display apps
and services are expanded to improve the
quality of information delivered there's
more room for multitasking and the LG
camera app makes fun use of that screen
height LG has historically led the way
in putting bigger screens and smaller
phone bodies though rumors are pointing
to some other manufacturers which might
deliver phones with similar screen size
experiments in our initial youth the g6
delivered some subtle benefits to camera
capture we really like the amount of
info you can keep when in split-screen
mode but video playback was a bit funky
for whatever reason we're totally
comfortable with letterboxing on phone
screens but pillarboxing looks a bit out
of place also if you're rocking a stumpy
thumb like mine a color display makes
the notification shade more of a reach
so what do you think of LG's experiment
here well LG lead the way on a new
aspect ratio standard
