pocketnow.com and i've got a little bit
of a treat for you today this is a HTC
sprint hero and the problem with this
phone it's a gorgeous spoon but it's
stuck up with android 1.5 so a lot of
the apps that I've been showing you in
my previous videos just aren't available
they don't run on it so sprint has
promised us that they are going to
release an update to android 2.1 for
this really really nice phone but we
haven't seen it yet in fact we've had
lots of rumors and lots of Miss dates
they just say that they'll get it to a
sometime in first half of 2010 the first
half is quickly going away and we just
missed another rumor to update window
but as part of that somebody found a
leaked version of the ROM and I just
happen to get my hands on it so what I'd
like to do is show you how to install
that on your HTC sprint hero so let's go
do that
okay the first thing that you're going
to need in this process is the HTC sync
software which you can get by going to
HTC com you'll want to navigate into the
support section and then into product
support for the HTC sprint hero you can
see the page here on screen see there
are two downloads one is the user manual
which if you've lost yours there you go
and the other one is the HTC Sync update
version 2.0 point 33 that lets you do
some synchronization and some other
stuff that we're not going to worry
about but the main thing we need out of
that is the drivers so I've gone ahead
and installed that on the machine and
I'm going to plug in the phone here and
right away you'll see HTC sync up here
USB connected so we've got all of that
done that's great the first time you
plug this in you're going to have to go
through quite a bit of a process while
it goes through and detects all the
drivers took me about five maybe eight
minutes to do that but once you've done
that you're great the next thing that we
need to do is run the update which in
this case is the ruu hero sprint 22 765
1.5 are something i'll have a link to
that in the article notes so you can
find where to get that now this is an
unofficial rom it is not supported by
Sprint but it is signed by Sprint so
this is as far as you can tell exactly
one hundred percent legitimate they just
decided to pull it before they release
it while they went through and did some
other stuff rumor has it that was so
that they could pull some tethering
capabilities out of it so this might
actually be a better run than the one
that they finally release when they do
that so we're going to go ahead and run
this and Windows is going to tell me
that it needs UAC or permission to run
that in administrator mode go ahead and
say yes to that it'll run through the
first time now it's very important that
you have a good charge on your battery
when you start this process
rom flashings very tricky you don't want
to run out of juice in the middle of it
luckily we're getting power through the
USB cable as well so we're going to let
this turn for just a little while say we
understand and agree to all the stuff in
the readme next and turn on your Android
phone connect your pc using the USB
cable provided we've done that disable
the standby and hibernation mode on the
pc all you've done that and make sure
the battery power is more than thirty
percent we're going to hope that's the
case we will check the box and we will
hit next verifying the information on
the Android phone please wait ok and
we're going to say next continue the
image version here is 1.5 6.65 1.2 and
we are going to click the update button
ok the current version it says is 1.5
6.65 1.2 so that last screen was
identifying what version is currently on
the phone the new version is going to be
2.2 7.65 1.5 and we'll hit next continue
because that looks right during the
update process the following things are
going to occur the android phone will be
prepared for the update process the
progress information will be displayed
both on the pc screen and on the android
phone and the update completed screen
will be displayed on the pc so we'll say
next to that it reboots the phone up
into the bootloader which should take
minute or so
and as you can hear it's loading up some
additional drivers the android
bootloader interface just installed
successfully so that's good and at this
point it's sending the ROM over to the
phone this is actually downloading that
ROM image onto the phone itself and it
says that this process will take about
10 minutes so I'm going to cut right
here because I don't want you to sit and
look at the HTC logo for 10 minutes and
we'll be right back when there is more
cool stuff to show you okay so after
about three minutes we've gotten to the
point where it's updating the signature
on the phone and the status bar which
before filled the entire bar is now over
to this point so it cycled all the way
through once and now it's to the next
stage and it's showing us how far
through that process we are again we're
about three minutes into the flashing
process right now it's updating the
radio and we now have a status bar on
the phone itself okay at this point
we've just passed one hundred percent
some user data was updated on the phone
I don't know exactly what that is right
now but we now have and congratulations
screen says the rom update has been
completed we're going to go ahead and
click on finish and over on the phone
itself you'll see that the HTC logo is
up like I've said in previous videos
first boots sometimes can okay so what
I've done is I've gone into the settings
screen specifically into the software
information you can see we're running
android 2.1 update one with a baseband
version of two point 42.0 1.04 point 27
kernel version is two point six point
two nine dash be c0 d to c FF whatever
all that means and just a whole bunch of
cool stuff browser version is 3.1
primary version 2.2 0 prl is 606 64 and
that I hope is enough to convince you
that we're running android 2.1 on this
phone some things that i can't show you
there are no live wallpapers that come
with this
we come in and I keep forgetting this is
a sense device so we get to the
wallpaper from going to menu in
wallpaper but you'll notice we now can
apply wallpaper to the home screen add
to the lock screen I don't know if
that's in addition or not we have an
option for photos and HTC wallpapers but
no live wallpapers that's simply because
this doesn't have the 1 gigahertz
processor that the newer Android two
devices have like the Nexus One and the
desire and the HTC incredible it's a
little bit slower so they've taken some
things out that's the first one the
second thing is and I don't know where
they have filed this away is over here
if we look at the photo gallery the
photo gallery is just the stock gallery
it's not the 3d gallery which
theoretically means that you're going to
have the full color photos and not the
16-bit photos that you have on the other
version as well so those are the only
two things that I'm aware of that this
version of android 2.1 doesn't have that
other 2.1 versions do have as you can
tell from here this is really really
snappy it's really quick I it still
looks gorgeous it still has that HTC
Sense UI on top of it and overall I'm
really impressed with it one thing that
I do want to check here before we go and
that's pinch-to-zoom because I know a
lot of you are interested in that so
let's see if we have pinch to zoom here
in the browser and look at that pinch to
zoom just like that beautiful you also
have pinch to zoom on the home screen
where you can pinch to zoom and see all
2 4 5 6 7 screens right there select
which one you want and it animates back
again pinch to zoom that in thumbnail
view or zoom out just by tapping so
really really cool your first look at
android 2.1 running on the HTC sprint
this is not an unlocked phone it has not
been rooted this
is an official yet leaked rom and there
you go so for pocketnow.com I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
