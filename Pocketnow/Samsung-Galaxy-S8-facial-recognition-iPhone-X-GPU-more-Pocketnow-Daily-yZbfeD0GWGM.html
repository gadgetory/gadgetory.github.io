biometric security in the works sprint
and Motorola joined forces to the deploy
5g since everybody is doing it now
and the next generation iPhone might get
a significant boost in graphics I'm
Jaime Rivera and am I the only one
that's complaining about the snow
forecast for tomorrow
this is sparking out daily the official
news today began with another snapchat
ripoff that comes from Facebook Believe
It or Not Facebook has done an amazing
job at pulling Instagram stories then
whatsapp status everything to compete
with snapchat and now the company has
come with facebook messenger day where
the functionality is pretty much the
same the user interface is pretty much
the same it is just unapologetically
snapchat snapchat you should have sold
yourself whatever you could now let's
talk about 5g we saw at MWC how ZTE
teased its 5g gigabit phone and the
project we've also seen how Samsung is
partnering with Verizon and now Motorola
is partnering with Sprint for their
gigabit phone apparently this device is
going to be as close as the next
generation moto Z we're not exactly sure
of moto mods will continue but
definitely it seems that wireless
technology will be the deal about this
next generation smartphone we'll see as
well the spotlight over to the next
version of Android which we're gonna dub
Android Oh going forward because that's
the next letter that's up we've got some
trusted sources claiming that there is
going to be a new feature called copy
less and the whole idea here is that
whenever the search engine text that
you've been searching different things
whatever you're gonna try to send
somebody your address for example or
search results or whatever it seems that
either the keyboard or the user
interface is gonna be smart enough to
detect that and obviously suggest that
instead of requiring you to copy and
paste the information from one page to
the other makes a lot of sense we just
the obviously will have to wait a long
time to see that now let's talk about a
new development coming from imagination
technologies apparently there is this
new fury and architec
sure that the company has developed for
its GPUs in the future and the reason
why this is important is because
apparently you will be able to play VR
and 4k at 120 frames per second that is
a lot to be able to pull from a
smartphone I don't even think that
that's currently you know a thing and
the desktop variants of VR but I could
be wrong most important thing is that
obviously because of the commitment that
Apple made with imagination technologies
it seems that well the next generation
iPhone might bring this new chipset even
if Apple hasn't really made a thing that
VR is coming to the iPhone but anyways
we'll see and finally the very hot news
that they have to do with the Samsung
Galaxy s8 again we are just a few weeks
from it launching so expected to be the
top news and we hear that the company
continues to innovate with biometrics
first of all definitely the fingerprint
scanner is coming in the oddest
placement ever the second thing is that
we should expect the iris scanner which
was popular in the galaxy note 7 but
third is that apparently there is going
to be a facial scanner because it just
wants to make the phone even more secure
we've been hearing that this is going to
be a major feature for the next
generation iPhone
apparently Samsung wants to do it
earlier and that is all great but it
leads me to the question of the day
if you have to choose between a specific
biometric feature which one would it be
or would you like them all in my case
honestly I like the concept of all but
I'm not gonna lie I really like the iris
scanner as much as I criticized it
before I actually got to test it I got
to see just how useful it is leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion frenzy - the way it goes if
we want to get the news earlier before
the videos filmed follow what's not
 out on come and hit that
subscribe button down below for more
videos like this one

underscore Evette on Instagram but hey
might be better please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
hi metadata thanks so much for watching
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
