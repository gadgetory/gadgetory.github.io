City HTC and Verizon said they'd crafted
the ultimate Droid does the brand-new
Droid DNA live up to that lofty
assertion let's find out I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is our
full review of the HTC Droid DNA the
Droid DNA is standout feature is of
course it's 1080p display first for the
United States but in most media that
spec has been overshadowing the beauty
of the rest of the device
HTC said they designed this phone to
resemble a muscle car and that's
apparent in its perforated red accented
side panels clean lines and aggressive
styling overall as we've mentioned in
some earlier comparison videos it
doesn't have a hint of phablet in its
nature this is very much a smart phone
and it feels like it in the hand the
weight is perfect and the build is slim
and clean with a boat shaped Crescent
design making it sit very nicely in the
palm the size does create a problem or
two notably in one-handed use we like
that HTC has gone taller without going
wider but that creates a real challenge
in thumb swiping the notification bar
pressing the top mounted power standby
button also isn't the easiest of tasks
given its awkward positioning and almost
non-existent physical feedback we wish
HTC had placed it off to the side on the
back is the typically understated HTC
branding dead center of the non
removable back cover above which is the
prominent 8 megapixel camera lens with
flash as well as a nice surprise a rear
mounted LED notification light so you
don't miss out on notifications if you
put your phone face down on a table down
below there's Verizon's 4G LTE branding
reminding us of the 1.5 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro humming along
inside and the Beats Audio logo above
the speakerphone which has its own
dedicated amplifier back around front
the curved Gorilla Glass 2 of the
phone's face is actually very beautiful
the edges are so smooth they make the
glass look a lot like a puddle of water
about to spill over the edge and
it almost feels that way to a thumb as
well down below the display are the
three HTC capacitive buttons for home
back and multitasking up above is the
wide angle 88 degree lens for the
front-facing 2.1 megapixel camera the
earpiece and the Verizon Wireless
branding dead center powering on the
display reveals the real crown jewel of
this handset the five inch 1080p Super
LCD 3 panel delivering 440 PPI
and some insane viewing angles its
laminated like on the older 1x so the
graphics appear to float right on the
surface of the glass and HTC claims it's
50 percent brighter than the galaxy s3s
display it's hard to tell on camera but
the display really is incredible but
once again check our other videos for
side-by-side display comparisons with
the Galaxy Note 2 and the lg optimus G
to our surprise though science tells us
we shouldn't be able to see much
difference the screen just takes it to a
whole new level in normal navigation in
video and in reading ebooks in in every
usage mode it's absolutely beautiful
it's the best screen we've ever seen on
a smartphone what's running on that
screen is Android jellybean 4.1.1 with
HTC Sense 4 plus running on top in the
past we weren't huge fans of the Sense
layer because of its impact on androids
performance historically it's been a
very heavy UI on the Droid DNA though
since is very smooth we're not sure
whether we have the s4 pro jelly bean or
Sense optimizations to thank it's
probably a mix of all three but whatever
the reason we're very happy it's still
possible to bog Sense down if you try
it's not as smooth as naked jelly bean
or even TouchWiz but all but the most
anal UI enthusiasts will find it very
serviceable visually since fourplus
isn't all that different from the
earlier 4.0 there's still a ton of
widgets available and the skin still
retains that grey somewhat understated
look compared to the more cartoony
TouchWiz HTC is also built in new
functionality to many of its stock apps
most prominently the gallery which now
allows you to group photos by event in
addition to the standard album you can
even view your photos in map view if you
want which is a nice touch
the camera software features some nice
customizations as well including
sightseeing mode which lets you bypass
the lockscreen and jump right into the
camera viewfinder if the camera was the
last thing you were using when you lock
the phone burst shot is back as well as
the unified viewfinder and there's some
handy UI customizations to make using
the new front-facing camera easier in
all since 4 + is more of what we're used
to from HTC it just happens to run
without a lot of lag on this hardware
which is a great thing lag was a big
source of heartburn for us with earlier
versions of sense and it's nice to see
it fixed now all HTC needs to do is
build in some of the handy utilities
other companies have adopted like the
function toggles in the notification bar
which we miss dearly from our time with
Samsung and LG devices during our test
period the droid DNA delivered solid
performance in terms of day to day
responsiveness data speeds over LTE
voice clarity and general utility most
of the things you need a smart phone to
do the Droid DNA does very well and of
course it looks amazing on this display
speed wise Verizon's network was a
little inconsistent in the Greater
Boston area but we averaged a very
respectable 11 megabits down and almost
5 megabits up during our test period
reception was good both in cellular and
Wi-Fi modes and the software kept up
with the connection speed the stock
browser rendering pages quite quickly
and rendering Andry flowing text
beautifully the gaming was predictably
just fine the full benchmark scores can
be viewed in our full review at
pocketnow.com but they back that
performance up voice calls were clear
and crisp and the stretched body of the
device made talking quite comfortable
we're not sure if the Beats speakerphone
amplifier engages during voice calls but
the speaker delivered one of the loudest
and clearest calling experiences we've
had since our days with Nextel phones we
were frankly disappointed in the Droid
DNA's camera quality HTC told us at the
launch event that the optics were the
same as those in the 1x but that tuning
had been improved on the software side
well we can confirm half that the optics
do look to be the same pictures in good
lighting outdoors actually come out
pretty nice but
the device in mediocre lighting
conditions and that quality just
evaporates jagged edges washed out color
a high susceptibility to flare and glare
it's not a great experience video is
pretty solid with excellent macro
performance though the audio is somewhat
tinny and the white balance auto correct
timing is about average we've definitely
used worse smartphone cameras but we
were hoping for more given the caliber
of this device on the other side of the
equation the front-facing camera which
I'm using to shoot this segment delivers
on its promise to bring a best-in-class
experience may not be the highest bar to
clear but it's seriously many folks
expressed concern about a 2020 milliamp
hour battery powering a 1080p display
and that's valid the Droid DNA does
better in this regard than we expected
it to but considering the battery isn't
removable power users unwilling to carry
a spare charger will want to take care
when considering the DNA we were able to
get a cell a day and a half of usage out
of the device but that's with light use
the general rule is that the more time
the screen spends powered on the worse
the battery life gets and that's
especially true for the DNA it's a champ
in standby but the screen on time is a
real drainer with light to moderate use
you should expect the phone to get you
through the day anything more than that
and you're gonna want to carry a spare
charger to replenish that embedded
battery speaking of embedded components
the memory on the droid DNA is limited
to 16 gigabytes and there's no
expandability so if you have plans to
carry your entire music or movies
library with you this is not the device
for you but if you make use of online
media options like Netflix and Spotify
or you don't otherwise need a lot of
on-board storage then you're in the
clear as usual it all depends on your
usage so the Droid DNA isn't quite the
ultimate smartphone it's makers claim
like all handhelds it had to make its
fair share of compromises to see the
light of day the limited storage and
battery life will immediately disqualify
it for some power users but it's 1080p
display and beautiful hardware
we'll make it nigh irresistible to
others if you can live with its
limitations this is a beautiful piece of
technology that feels amazing in the
hand includes the best display ever on a
mobile phone and provides a solid
software experience delivering on all
those fronts while also pioneering the
1080p smartphone revolution can't have
been easy but HTC has done a solid job
of it we give the HTC Droid DNA an 8 out
of 10 folks that's going to do it for
