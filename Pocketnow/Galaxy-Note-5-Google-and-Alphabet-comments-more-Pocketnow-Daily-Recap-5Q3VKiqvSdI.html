recap I will go jump into the Sun good
luck with that cornea slappy no ever smh
right benefits your face is shining how
you do that it's called my shiny
forehead syndrome mixed with the fact
that I'm allergic to make up that's
right it's that time of the week I am
hina annette up this is fucking now and
this is the Vogon out daily recap for
last week one day was about the future
of the lumia smartphones I asked you if
you care about them because we have
rumors of when we might finally get them
we have 753 comments we start with like
seriously who buys a Lumia with nobody
making applications for them it's hard
to consider Lumia even as a smartphone
they make great cameras they have the
design the operating system is good
obviously the application gap is
something that will be fixed in a way
with Windows 10 but I do get your point
it's another a pill battle is that in
the performance of Windows OS and
looniest yes I am interested in a
flagship Lumia device it's just that
they're taking too long to arrive and
that's just typical Microsoft
performance dude I like my lumia 920
because of the customizable tiles and
these in camera but a phone has to be
more than that unless the new lumias
bring more to the table my next phone
will likely be a motorola and yeah
that's pretty much been the case with
all of us i was a big windows mobile fan
and that i moved to Windows Phone 7 and
here i am using an iphone tuesday was
then a major day for changes you saw
that larry page and sergey brin found at
another company called alphabet google
now belong south event in the CEO of
Google is now sundar Pichai I asked you
what do you think about these changes we
had horns only do comments we start with
dark days are coming for Android dark
days and I wonder why they miss a
comment as to why do you think that is
because I actually like the new Android
even though it doesn't perform as well I
think Google has run out of ideas once
you build up a big brand than a big name
like Google why split seems like a waste
and i do not think it's a waste it's
actually great for google to want to
focus google on its core services and
not expand its reach into different
things and
address things that are important just
because they're focusing on self-driving
cars for example wait alphabet owns
Google never would I have thought in a
million years that another company would
own google they're the same owners buddy
Wednesday was about for such technology
we heard what Apple plans to deal with
it apparently it'll help you interact
with your iphone with a lot less
gestures and making everything easier to
use and I ask you to be care about it we
have 653 comments out of which we start
with I'm being forced touch just turns
out to be some fancy Apple version of
long press oh yeah that's pretty much
what I see that it is just with a
hardware element because you do feel
that it works differently I prefer long
press and not for such actually watch
such seems pointless it accomplishes
nothing that a long pressure DoubleTap
couldn't already do and a simply apple
creating the way to over inflate prices
of the success relative to the six and
actually no iphones have cost the same
ever since the iphone 3g the
second-generation model so i don't think
it's gonna be a price inflation but yeah
it's just the fancier long-press way to
do things your force touch is actually
made useful that i might consider it but
i also wouldn't mind seeing a little bit
of a bigger battery as well yeah we all
want a bigger battery on the iphone
forget about it it's probably not going
to happen but then again yes it for such
this makes the UI better than great but
yeah I get the point of other people by
saying what's the whole point if we
already have long press thursday with
samsung galaxy day we had samsung's
impact we've got the galaxy note5 the
galaxy s6 edge plus we got a teaser for
the gear s2 and i asked you what was
your favorite announcement for this day
we had 552 comments out of which we
start with my thoughts they don't line
up is dead rip to the samsung galaxy
note5 i don't think it is the note 5 is
actually a gorgeous phone I just don't
think that the next version of the note
will sell well of the they continue
removing things I was looking forward to
getting the note 5 but now I can't I
need to be able to add memory or change
the battery this really sucks and yes
for me expandable memory is important
particularly because of the price tag
but the
another commenter eventually made the
point how often do you actually buy a
second battery not everybody does that
but it's always great to have the option
and that's where I do agree with you
sensing really let me down today I was
hoping for something special up their
sleeves for the no power users instead
we got a big s6 with a stylus will be
switching to the rumor at LG g4 pro and
yeah for me I've always been a note user
since the galaxy note 2 I am extremely
disappointed as well the problem is my
note edge is terrible when it comes to
its software so i might be forced to
upgrade we'll see and then finally
friday it was all about the Samsung gear
s2 I asked you what do you think about
design as Samsung is posting a lot of
posters teasers of what to expect with
this design we had 641 comments we start
with the gear s2 looks better than the
Apple watch and dude beauty lies in the
eye of the beholder I don't like either
of both watches sadly I think the gear
looks very promising they're only
teasing but you and I know these guys
will wage a war against apple for best
SmartWatch in the market you have to
love that round shape though I do love
the round shape I just hate the fact
that it looks like a cheap polar and
that's really why I wish they would have
come with something fancier but then
again it could be that we're just
looking at the sport model gear s2 looks
cheap I'm bought a moto 360 for its
design and my opinion is still the same
and I did the same buddy I have an Apple
watch I use it mainly because it's
currently within my review period but my
favorite watch will always be the Moto
360 ken's down and I'm not talking about
the smart watches I'm talking about
watches in general it's been my favorite
watch of all time because of its design
and I feel that this is the only company
that's figured out the fact that watches
need to look good because it's
fashionable but hey it seems that that
is still a work in progress that's it
for the park and I'll daily recap thank
