calm and say we're going to unbox the
HTC Rezound one of the first devices
with the Beats Audio for verizon so
let's get you the unboxing so the HTC
Rezound comes boxed in a pretty simple
black box and it's a square as you can
see we have the verizon emblem on the
top and the HTC emblem on the bottom on
the sides all it says is HTC Rezound
with Beats Audio you can see the glare
and on this side it says verizon 4g LTE
certified on the back we had the HTC
Rezound with Beats Audio the standard
lithium ion battery a pre-installed
microSD card the I needs headphones the
wall USB charger Quick Start Guide
product safety and warranty brochure so
let's open up the box and it slides open
it's a pretty simple box to open and I
believe we just opened up through the
bottom okay so on the top we have our
SIM card for the 4g LTE and i will pop
that in in just a few minutes we have
our headphones here as you can see those
are the I beats headphones and we have
the HTC Rezound inside the box and it
feels adequate leaf then it's not as
thin some other smartphones but we'll
get to that in just a couple seconds so
let's open up this it's interesting that
the headphones are not boxed or packaged
in their own separate package they're
kind of just you know out here let's see
what else we have we have our micro USB
charging sync cable and we have our
standard wall charger that's for the US
and this has a USB port on the side we
have a carrying case with our for our
headphones here and it's kind of a cool
carrying case it looks as though it's a
snap case and it does have extra earbuds
and also a little clip so you can attach
it to your clothing so you don't lose it
let's see what else we have consumer
information about radio frequencies
emissions and is probably also our
warrant information so let's just move
all this other stuff to the side so the
HTC Rezound is an adequately sized 4G
LTE device it's pretty similar in size
to the droid charge here we can compare
the thickness
as you can see there are about the same
thickness as well as the same height and
width as the droid charge the HTC
Rezound is about the same as the droid
charge so if we compare it to another
device here's an iphone 4 iphone 4s
they're about the same they're about the
same i guess width but in terms of
height the HTC Rezound is about oh I
don't know about one and a half
centimeters taller than the iphone 4
iphone for us and of course the HTC
Rezound is much thicker and the iphone 4
iphone 4s is unable to get the LTE 4G
speeds so we'll take off the back
battery cover to see how large the micro
SD card and also how large the battery
is that comes with this HTC Rezound so
it's nice that it has this red accent
and it does come with a 16 gigabyte
microSD card let me just pop out the
battery and it looks as though we have a
1600 and 20 milliamp hour battery and
that's a lithium-ion battery so we'll
see exactly how this pans out in terms
of battery life I'm going to pop in the
LTE card and then we'll get finished
with our unboxing video so the HTC
Rezound with the Beats Audio is
available now through verizon for a
subsidized price of two hundred ninety
nine dollars and a full-out price of 640
999 so if you like our videos make sure
he gives up thumbs up and also leaves in
comments down below stay tuned for these
software and hardware reviews coming up
next and also the final review in the
near future thanks for watching
