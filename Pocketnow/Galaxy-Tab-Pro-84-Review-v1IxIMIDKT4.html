best Galaxy Tab yet we've spent the last
five days testing using and abusing it
to try to answer that question I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is our four of you of the Galaxy Tab pro
8.4 if you're keen on Samsung's more
recent tweaks to us design language this
particular tablet will be right up your
alley in terms of look and feel it's
virtually a scaled-up Galaxy Note 3 it
has the same photo their backing found
on the popular Galaxy Note series fake
stitching lines the perimeter of the
backside and the trim along the edges is
a full brushed metal made of plastic
while the materials may not feel utterly
premium the tablet is built
exceptionally well but no bending or
creaking when you grip and twist the
tablet it's incredibly lightweight at
just 331 grams for the Wi-Fi model and
the bezels upfront art for the most part
minimal its physical footprint is
comparatively small for the size of
display it houses 219 millimeters tall
128 point five millimeters wide and just
seven point two millimeters thick its
width makes it quite easy to grip with
one hand and unlike other similarly
shaped tablets this one feels pretty
natural in portrait or landscape the
internals are also pretty impressive a
2.3 gigahertz quad-core Krait 400 CPU
and Adreno 330 GPU to make up the
Snapdragon 800 chipset 2 gigabytes of
RAM 16 gigabytes of fixed storage with a
micro SD card slot for up to 60 for
additional gigabytes and 8 megapixel
camera on the back and a 4800 milliamp
hour 19.2 wide our fixed battery it also
sports infrared Wi-Fi AC and Bluetooth
Low Energy but it lacks USB 3.0 and NFC
but let's not gloss over one of the most
impressive aspects of this tablet the
display at 8.4 inches the Super Clear
LCD bares a resolution of 2560 by 1600
pixels and overall density of 359 pixels
per inch the result is a display that is
extremely bright has extra wide viewing
angles great contrast relatively deep
blacks and colors that pop the
temperature of the display is a tad warm
and it appears as if Samsung is boosting
color saturation as some videos look a
tad unnatural especially with skin tones
it still looks fantastic
even with slightly exaggerated colors in
all the hardware aspect of this device
is not quite as nice as some of its
competitors
such as the iPad Mini with Retina
display or even the understated design
of the budget-friendly Nexus 7 but we
can't complain about the specs or how
well-built the tablet is the software
situation has improved somewhat with the
most recent generation of Samsung
tablets and the latest iteration of
Android KitKat the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4
runs Android version 4.4.2 in it
features Samsung's newer Flipboard
powered magazine UX from the home screen
you will find two tile pages by default
with user definable information such as
a calendar Science and Technology news
and calm office and other Flipboard
style news feeds the main home screen by
default is still the basic Android style
home screen icons widgets and a
wallpaper the application drawer is
still accessed by a button in the lower
right corner the notification shade has
been improved and optimized for larger
screen devices it's no longer fullscreen
and it's in or aligned the UI has been
flattened and simplified throughout and
in the notification shade and Settings
app in particular we noticed a Tizen OS
inspired appearance to little surprise
settings icons are now circular which
brings us to our main point the software
seems very conflicted and confused
it doesn't feel completely finished as
there is disparity between the icons in
the notification shade and the home
screen the notification shade looks like
a mash-up of old TouchWiz and Tizen and
the Settings app is still the cluttered
jumbled tabbed and pained mess it's
cumbersome to use and slightly altering
its appearance hasn't helped its
usability at all Samsung has seemingly
trimmed down its smart offerings on this
tablet however narrowing it to smart
stay smart rotation and smart pause and
it has improved the loved multi window
feature at least in how its accessed a
pool from the right edge of the display
it's no longer indicated by a small tab
which clings to either side of the
display aside from that it's business as
usual with no notable improvements
however our own Michael Fischer did
discover some unusual layout problems
with a multi window in landscape
particularly with Twitter and YouTube
comments they seem to work just fine and
portrait though we're happy to see the
software at least looks much nicer in
this most recent version of TouchWiz but
all the kinks aren't ironed out just yet
performance on the Tab pro 8.4 or so you
would imagine should be great in gaming
multitasking even watching video or
browsing the web is fantastic in fact
this may be our favorite tablet for
gaming yet thanks to the combination of
the size at weight Snapdragon 800 and
the gorgeous display Need for Speed Most
Wanted has been more addicting than
usual on this model but performance
isn't exactly buttery smooth all the
time opening apps returning home task
switching and your most casual tasks
work fine with few to no hiccups but we
could very nearly create lag on demand
by opening an app returning to the home
screen and trying to flick between the
pages a large portion of our time with
this tablet this would cause a split
second hang once or twice before the
system caught up it's as if the home
screen is so large and resource
intensive it causes a short drop in
performance if you can cope with this
performance is about as good as it gets
in gaming benchmarking and the usual the
speakers are one of the most upsetting
aspects of this tablet and not
necessarily because the sound they
produce but because of their placement
sound is loud I'll be at rather tinny
but the stereo speakers are along the
bottom edge they don't offer great
stereo separation and they're incredibly
easy to muffle especially in landscape
mode
if you plan to watch a movie or play
games on this tablet do yourself a favor
and plug in some headphones battery life
has been acceptable thus far through our
testing gaming and other casual use we
have yet to kill the tablet in a single
day but we don't feel that's impossible
to do especially with how bright the
display gets or how hot the backside can
get during intense gaming the 19 point 2
watt hour battery will likely last most
one to two days per charge and the
standby is particularly great the camera
performance is hit or miss as with most
tablets it's not a priority and usually
feels like an afterthought
the Tab pro 8.4 is no exception to the
rule the 8 megapixel camera around back
set to capture at 6 megapixels by
default works well for stills but will
likely leave you wanting more the images
aren't as sharp or colorful as we'd like
and the field of view is narrow not only
will you look out of holding a tablet up
to take a picture you'll look even
stranger than usual holding it up and
taking several steps backward to fit
everything in frame at the end of the
day the Galaxy Tab pro 8.4 is a solid
entry from Samsung one that will compete
with the likes of the iPad Mini with
Retina display quite effectively we
still wish Samsung would use finer
plastics or even metal in its design but
we won't complain too much about the
leathery texture around back this time
software has improved somewhat but
hasn't gotten any easier to use or
navigate and it's brought a few tiny
performance bugs along for the ride of
the smaller tablets we've used to date
this is easily the most enjoyable form
factor and Samsung deserves some kudos
for that for more in depth detail in the
