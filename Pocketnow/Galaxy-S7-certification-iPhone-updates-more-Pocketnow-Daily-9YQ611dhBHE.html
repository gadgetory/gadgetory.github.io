certification documents in certain
countries apple launches software
updates to fix a ton of bugs on the
iphone 6s and bestbuy just made a cool
old motorola phone look hot again I'm hi
meri behna and it's that particular
moment when you hit the record button
and it starts pouring rain to add noise
to your video this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with an
old but very good phone the Moto X 2014
probably one of my favorite phones of
all time still today if you are in the
market for a phone right now and you're
on a budget that phone is right now
available in its black variants for 234
bucks on best buy in addition to other
color options I haven't suggest you hit
the links in the description again if
you're in the market this is actually a
very good bye so long as you put up with
the battery life and speaking of good
products those of you out there in the
market for a Windows computer the Dell
Venue 8 Pro is one of the tablets that
we recommended last year particularly
because he got the full windows
experience on an 8-inch tablet that's
how we've just got an update right now
it's now running Windows 10 it has four
gigs of rams apparently it should
perform better the only problem is that
it still costs four hundred dollars
which is rather steep for what you're
getting and Noble continues to bring
some major updates to its google play
store in a way that actually doesn't
have anything to do with the store for
those of you that have noticed that now
you get the option on the browser
whenever you're looking at something
searching for something and find the
particular application and the
suggestions you'll notice that there is
a new install button bear but good thing
is that now when you hit that button
it's not going to take you to the google
play store to look for the app it'll
actually install the app automatically
on android this is a very good update
it'll most likely reach your phone very
soon if it hasn't and now moving the
spotlight over to Apple there are a ton
of complaints when it comes to the
iphone 6s particularly because of the
battery indications it seems that the
phone is not really telling you exactly
how much battery it has and that's not
necessarily a good thing for a phone
that doesn't have good battery life but
hey seems that Apple has just committed
to an update but in addition to that
they just launched an update today nine
point two point one and I mean though
we're not really sure if it actually
fixes the 6s problem
we'll keep an eye and let you know if
that's exactly the case and finally the
very hot news today have to do with the
galaxy s7 we are just weeks away from
mwc we will be covering the event live
even though we're still waiting for
samsung invites we expect this phone to
be launched here just like it was last
year and the reason why we're almost
certain that this will happen is because
now we're getting certification
documents from governments starts with
Indonesia meaning that the phone is
already out there but this is rather
interesting it seems that there are no
phablets being certified only the
smaller galaxy s7 and galaxy s7 edge
meaning these two phones are coming but
hey it leads me to the question of the
day would you mind if Samsung doesn't
launch the phablet's right now well you
just want the smaller phones or do you
want both in my case I'll be honest with
you I like my galaxy s6 edge+ so much I
don't want it to be obsolete already so
I would rather wait for an update later
this year but that's just me leave us a
comment down below what's your case

you want to get the girls earlier before
