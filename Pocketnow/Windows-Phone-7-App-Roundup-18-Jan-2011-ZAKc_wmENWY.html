pakka calm and this is another episode
of the windows phone 7 app roundup in
which we review five applications in 30
seconds each so let's get started ap
mobile is a great international news
application that has hundreds of
different articles during the day so as
you can see I can see my top news sports
showbiz US News all those other great
stuff I can view videos and media
directly on this application I can just
scroll over I can get weather
information I can search for news all of
these other genres of news so let's
check my weather real quick and it will
locate my location and now will give my
whether based upon accuweather com
carnivale showtime is a really fun
launcher game in which you must shoot
our carnival character up into the
atmosphere and we'll aim our cannon here
and what we want to do is to move him up
through the top of the screen to this
one's goal so i jus do is tap on the
screen to lock on to what my character
here oh and apparently i just lost so
now i will try again shoot there again
hold on to hear i just hold on and
release whenever i want to shoot my
character and then the game continues
like this until we reached the top of
the level flight controls are really fun
you're challenging in a game in which
you must control all the aircraft's and
designate them to their own landing pads
so and runway so we'll hit continue and
now i will just speed it up here and
what i have to do is move this aircraft
right here and when more and more
aircraft show up on the screen it
becomes much more challenging and if two
aircrafts enter the same area they will
actually crashing into one another and
then you lose the game zombies is a
tower defense style game in which must
place pieces and what i want to do is to
place one of these tiles on one of these
are one of these pieces on one of these
white tiles i'm going to place it right
here and now hit accept and now i want
to place my zombies somewhere that i can
destroy them all in a single move so i
have for zombies than any place so 1 2 3
or and now to fight the zombie I have to
roll this diet for better than I win and
these Ombey losses so I got five so
that's a victory the weather channel is
a great application if you want to get
accurate weather forecasts in your area
or anywhere else in the country so all I
have to do is search for a landmark x
for disneyland right here i can be the
current temperature i can go over and
view the forecast and get forecast
details i can also be the radar map
