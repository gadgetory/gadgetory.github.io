important smartphones of 2018 they are
right here
one is famous for being the best
all-rounder that money can buy and the
other is known for challenging that same
premise at nearly half the price let one
of the toughest comparisons begin I'm
high metal even it was pocket now when
this is 1 plus 6 vs samsung galaxy s2 18
has proven to be a great year for
flagship smartphones but not for their
price tags we spent a greater part of
this year praising how many devices
we've seen but phones ain't getting any
cheaper so that's why this comparison is
so important from a hardware perspective
let's just call this one a tie right off
the bat both devices are gorgeous they
are well built and both are great to
handle the galaxy s 9 plus is actually
three millimeters taller one millimeter
thicker and eight grams heavier with the
1 plus 6 being just 2 millimeters wider
there are various color options across
the board each with fingerprint loving
variants but the 1 plus 6 matte approach
to midnight black and silk white
continue to be my favorite I feel that
all glass phone should be made with this
finish in order to look better in daily
use I also prefer 1 + 6 cases as they
feel like if they blend better with the
phone though the Galaxy has the
advantage to better third-party case
support with mojo offering some amazing
options in leather internally things
aren't really that much different both
devices have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
processor and both started 64 gigabytes
of storage the galaxy wins given its
expandable storage options slightly
larger battery fast wireless charging
capabilities and the fact that it does
have an IP rating for water and dust
resistance where the oneplus X wins is
with the options of up to 8 gigabytes of
RAM dual-sim capabilities and that it's
- charging is seriously second to none
in the content consumption battle it's
really hard to defeat Samsung even if
oneplus is using pretty much most of the
same technology sure the oneplus six has
a slightly larger display in paper but
the knotch steps over as part of it the
Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus is quad HD plus
capable versus full HD plus the curves
on the Infinity display also make for
the experience more immersive than the
one plus six to that side double tap the
other and it's lights to the other face
last but not least the dual firing
speakers on the Galaxy or also an added
bonus compared to the single firing on
the one plus six though yes both devices
do support a headphone jack with great
output again this seems more like a tie
what one phone doesn't have it
compensates with other benefits
where the tie ends is in the software
Department I have absolutely nothing
against Samsung's experienced UX I
actually like the iconography plus the
grid of icons on the launcher
I love essentials like the edge
shortcuts and this continues to be my
favorite always-on display in the market
the wrong one really lies in how slow
Samsung is to adopt new versions of
Android and out of experience I sadly
doubt that that will change up until the
next Galaxy
the oneplus 6 on the other hand is a
different animal oxygen OS is not just
lean and based on stock Android but it
also digs deepens applications and only
loads crucial elements making fluidness
of the experience more immersive it's as
customizable as a dream launcher should
be with up to nine button options and
navigation or gestures if that's your
new thing first of all it runs the
latest version of Android out of the box
and you can also load Android pee on
this device right now samsung has
benefits like secure folder but you can
also lock applications on the oneplus 6
with your fingerprint software
definitely belongs to the one plus six
when it comes to user experience I have
been using a combination of both of
these devices for weeks in New York City
both on the t-mobile network phone calls
on each are great and they're glass
builds enable them to do great and
retaining network connectivity if
playing games is your thing both devices
have their own approach to gaming mode
to enhance the experience though I
consider the oneplus 6 approach to be
the most useful of them both
yes you now have fingerprint scanners
that are well placed on both both have
facial unlock capabilities where the
galaxy wins isn't offering a more secure
option with a combination of the iris
scanner but boy is it unreliable in most
situations I would definitely stick to
the fingerprint scanner on both devices
if I were you now the talk of battery
life is really controversial because
even if the galaxy s 9 plus sports a
slightly larger battery
I feel the oneplus 6 does a better job
at keeping that battery charged don't
get me wrong both devices get through
the day just fine but I've always ended
the day with at least 20% more battery
on the oneplus and honestly I think it
has everything to do with all the
applications that are loaded in the
background on this device but if we had
to narrow down the most important
feature of these two phones
let's move the spotlight to the camera
Samsung is innovating with one of the
first variable aperture cameras in the
industry oneplus on the other hand has
made significant improvements in
features like HDR but its approach of
just providing a depth sensor in the
secondary camera is kind of
controversial while we get telephoto on
the galaxy photos during the day are
nearly indistinguishable between both
we've got great color detail and what I
like the most about these two devices is
the speed at which they take a photo
they are epic bring both devices to
low-light and this is where things tilt
towards the Galaxy at F 1.5 aperture
low-light shots on the Galaxy are just
hard to beat the oneplus X tries hard to
keep up and does a very decent job I'd
even say decent enough to challenge more
expensive phones in the galaxy as ninety
R I would also say that it does a better
job at handling moving subjects than the
galaxy in certain scenarios
oddly I also prefer portrait photos on
the one plus six and not necessarily
because they're better but because I
don't have to step back to take the
photo as I do with the galaxy Lexie has
been my favorite for months mainly
because of its wide angle shots and its
detail that being said selfies on the
oneplus 6 are great there are now
portrait selfie capabilities with a
software update and you do have more
megapixels when it comes to video we've
got stabilization across the board and
both devices do a great job we also have
4k video at 60 frames per second on each
device as well the oneplus 6 doesn't go
as far as 960 frames per second when it
comes to the super-slow-mo but it can
record 480 frames per second at a full
minute while the galaxy can only record
for a few seconds at a time
now selfie videos are not my favorite on
either device because of the crop but
then again stabilization on each device
is great to conclude let's just say that
there is a very big reason why this is
one of the toughest comparisons of the
year both devices look great feel great
in the hand take good enough photos in
each case and both devices have unique
benefits that will tilt the scale on
either side depending on what you prefer
the main problem arises the moment you
stack the price tag of each device
side-by-side
I mean seriously ask yourself the
question are you really getting three to
four hundred dollars more of a phone
with the galaxy than with the one plus
six my answer is no you're not the one
plus six is almost as good a phone for a
lot less money will complicates things
at least in the United States is the
timing of the one plus six US carriers
are already loaded with
buy-one-get-one-free deals for the
galaxy and you can't really subsidize
the one plus six in the US either now if
this were my money if all I could do was
pick one out of these two phones believe
it or not I would pick the one plus six
I don't subsidize phones so the extra
money could serve me to buy a SmartWatch
or even a Nintendo switch for that
matter
and I find it to be more of a
future-proof product over time given its
approach to software now regardless of
my preference you really won't go wrong
choosing either of these devices they
are both great candidates as the best
smartphone of 2018 which one would you
pick
