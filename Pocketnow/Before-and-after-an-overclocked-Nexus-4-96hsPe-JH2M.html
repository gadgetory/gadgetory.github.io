one that's overclocked I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow and this is a before
and after with an overclocked Nexus 4
we the nerdy minority often take pride
in having the latest greatest and
fastest devices but we make an exception
for virtually anything barring the Nexus
brand and the Nexus 4 is a perfect
example of that at the time of its
release it did actually include what
many consider the best chipset of 2012
the Snapdragon s4 pro for CPU cores and
a clock speed of 1.5 gigahertz it's
still nothing to scoff at but in light
of newer devices with faster clock
speeds and newer chips
the Nexus Wars age is beginning to show
if only slightly as any Android
enthusiast will tell you there are a few
ways to breathe new life into a device
to instill munis even on aging hardware
new roms themes software updates and of
course custom kernels for my Nexus 4 I
chose the Mako kernel which comes in
various forms it comes with either stock
CPU frequencies called the mainline
version and in turbo boost versions with
maximum clock speeds up to 1.8 3 6
gigahertz and 1.9 4 4 gigahertz of
course it wouldn't be interesting if I
didn't choose the highest clock speed so
I picked the 1.94 4 gigahertz turbo
boost maker kernel and flashed it
to flash the carnal simply download the
zip file to your device the XDA thread
is linked in the description below and
boot into recovery select Install zip
from sdcard choose zip from sdcard
navigate to the file you downloaded
confirm and flash wipe the cache
partition and the dalvik cache and
reboot this reboot will take longer than
normal but once the reboot finishes
you're good to go
the Nexus 4 certainly was not sluggish
before overclocking but it's definitely
a little faster after the fact to the
naked eye and views separately is
difficult if not impossible to tell the
difference in performance from before
and after flipping between tabs and
chrome opening and closing applications
and perusing Google+ all happens in the
blink of an eye even switching between
applications happens quickly and
smoothly with few instances of lag or
hesitation
the most notable difference in actual
usage is how easily the overclock mixes
for powered through Facebook while the
stock Nexus for stuttered and suffered
from slow wait times when quickly
scrolling to the bottom of the news feed
the overclock nexus for loaded older
posts much quicker the overclocked nexus
just felt snappier in most scenarios
ever so slightly pinch zooming felt a
tad smoother app switching and loading
seemed faster and upon returning home
the home screen was redrawn more quickly
maybe it's a bit of a placebo effect in
other areas or maybe it's actually a bit
faster the two were even very close in
synthetic benchmarks the stock nexus 4
actually scored higher and n22 than the
nexus with the overclocked kernel in
other n22 tests it also scored
significantly lower while the
overclocked Nexus 4 consistently scored
in the 16,000 s running at one point
nine four four gigahertz the overclocked
Nexus 4 also scored higher in Geekbench
2 than the stock version and it shaved
some time off the SunSpider javascript
test breaking into the 1200 millisecond
range versus the Starks consistent 1500
millisecond average best of all unlike
our HTC one before and after video the
nexus didn't seem to run abnormally warm
but it did tend to tear through battery
life faster than before through the same
amount of stress the battery drained at
about 1.5 times faster than the stock
kernel and clock speeds that's all for

compares the one that's overclocked of
course you do I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow
and this is a before and after of an
overclocked do you don't know let's get
to it
