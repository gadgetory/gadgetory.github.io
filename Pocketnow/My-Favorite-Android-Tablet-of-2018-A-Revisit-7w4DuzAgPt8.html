fruit logo brought a couple of you
asking about a good Android alternative
in the comments and yes there are
actually some really good ones out there
that cost nearly half as much as an iPad
pro cost with some added benefits I'm
hiding that I'm with pocket now and
let's revisit the huawei media pad m5
pro which is actually one of my favorite
Android tablets of this year I've said
it repeatedly I rely heavily on tablets
for things I can't use a laptop for in
my workflow you guys know I travel a lot
so battery life for me is key as I
script my videos entirely on tablets and
then use these as my guide for my shot
list I also love the form factor of a
tablet because they feel like a note pad
at least most of them so for me tablets
have to achieve three key essentials
number one they have to be thin and
light for me that feel of the note pad
has to be there number two they have to
be durable I haul them around a lot so
glass on glass is not necessarily my
favorite approach and number three they
have to have stylus support so for me
one of my favorite alternatives was
actually this media pad m5 pro which we
saw at MWC and which my colleague Anton
reviewed post MWC so let me begin this
video by telling you what I like about
this tablet for starters the hardware I
never thought I'd say that I preferred
gold in a tablet but the aluminium
finish on this one does a really good
job in deterring fingerprints I also
never thought that I'd like a tablet
with a 16 by 10 aspect ratio but because
this one weighs only a little more than
a pound the weight distribution is
really on point a wide aspect ratio
means a better experience for watching
typical video standards we've got a ten
point eight inch IPS LCD of 2560 by 1600
that's very bright and vibrant and then
the cherry topper for content
consumption are these four speakers
tuned
Harman Kardon is at how the pixel uses
the added space on either side of the
knotch these are seriously some of the
best speakers in the industry hands down
and then there's this em penned by
Huawei which honestly surprised me I
never thought that it would be this good
latency is seriously not an issue and
the feel of the tip reminds me of a
surface pen and best of all it charges
through USB C so no need for spare
batteries or gimmicks for me really the
stylus is all about highlighting my
scripts and OneNote for Android is my
tool of choice in this combination but I
feel that probably the most important
reason why I recommend this tablet is
because as I've mentioned you've got
great hardware you've got a great
display you've got the stylus support
and this tablet cost a little more than
$400 if you go to stores like B&amp;amp;H which
for me is just surprising I mean if you
compare this to the only other tablet
that I would say that competes with this
one in the Android space which would be
the Samsung Galaxy Tab and for that one
is $250 more expensive not the problem
you have here and let me not even
compare this to an iPad when it comes to
the price tag now there is a very
interesting trend happening lately when
it comes to Android tablets I think to
keep the price down and it's the fact
that they launched with last year's
specification so that's something that
I'm a little mixed with and I do believe
that some of you might be concerned
tucked inside we've got a keren 960
processor with 4 gigs of RAM options for
64 or 128 gigs of storage a 7500
milliamp hour battery and certain models
do include LTE connectivity the thing is
even if emui is not my favorite coat of
paint
I really wouldn't be concerned about the
specs I mean this tablet does perform
great it glides through many as well it
launches applications quick and I love
that the Google feed is accessible from
the launcher which is really hard to
find lately
also there's this cool trick as the
tablet does support desktop mode those
of you looking to work in multiple
windows on Android can do so by just
switching it on best evolve the USB C
port on this tablet can actually be used
for things we regular consumers use it
for if you
God flash storage and you want to
connect it and you want to use the file
manager this tablet actually does have
that option another advantage with emui
honestly is just like in the case of
every Huawei phone that I've reviewed
battery life on this tablet is actually
quite epic I've ended these just fine
with it but probably the coolest part is
because I've been reviewing so many
tablets lately I literally left this
tablet alone for about two weeks and I
had no idea that it was on and by the
time that I switched it on again I
believe it still have like 67% battery
so definitely standby time on this
tablet is great seriously I'm not saying
that emui is great I just wow it does a
really good job at just zipping on power
while you're not using it now I can't
really say that there are things that I
don't like about this tablet but of
course there's no such thing as a
perfect product so there are things that
could improve like for example the fact
that this tablet is still on emu I ate
on top of Android Oreo and I don't know
what huawei's track record is when it
comes to updating tablets I do know that
they do a good job on phone so I'm
hoping that that's gonna get fixed soon
and then the second thing is honestly
the design of the small factor I mean
this tablet was designed to be used in
landscape mode which is fine I mean
you've got the logo at the bottom you've
got the camera at the top but the
biggest problem is the fact that you've
got the home button which is the
fingerprint scanner and also dubbed as a
way to navigate on the side and then
you've got the buttons on the side these
things are fine so long as you're using
them horizontal but the problem is when
you flip it into vertical these buttons
are at the bottom and the home button
makes sense to be at the bottom that's
fine but then you've got the power and
the volume buttons at the bottom which
is kind of awkward I guess I find myself
like when I use it in portrait mode and
like where the buttons they should be
here on the side and they're not so
that's honestly a design choice that I
don't really understand but I think
that's just me nitpicking I don't think
that it's necessarily an issue because
you could still turn on a tablet with
the home button which is an advantage to
conclude well you guys asked me for a
good Android tablet and I believe this
is it not just a great content
consumption device but good for
productivity good in battery life and
seriously a very good deal
we consider all the features you're
getting for the price it's definitely
not perfect but I feel that the things
that I could complain about could be
fixed with a software update and
seriously for a little more than four
hundred dollars it's really hard for me
to recommend any other tablet in that
price range I feel that this is
definitely the better buy let us know
