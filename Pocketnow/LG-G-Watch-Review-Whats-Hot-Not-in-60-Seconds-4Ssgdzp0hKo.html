type wearable but is the LG G watch the
Android wear device for you the answer
in pocket now 60 second SmartWatch
review starting right now with a
no-nonsense water resistant design and a
vibrant display the G watch does a good
job at its primary function being a
watch its robust notification support
lets you keep your phone in your pocket
more often it's software is beautiful to
look at and the first few third-party
apps we've seen make great creative use
of this small screen here's what's not
hot Android wear is still in its infancy
with big shortcomings in speech
dictation and an inconsistent
unintuitive UI plus the battery lasts
only a day or so between charges and the
screen is lower resolution and less
vibrant than the one on the Samsung gear
live the upshot the LG G watch brings
more raw capability and a bit more fun
than most other smartwatches but it's
held back by its software and it doesn't
pack enough improvements over the
Samsung watch to justify its added cost
until Android wear get some upgrades
this makes it tough to recommend the G
watch to all but the most devoted
tinkerers for more time and more detail
on the G while check out our full video
review and visit PocketNow later this
week for our Android wear written review
until then this has been michael fisher
with pocket now thanks for watching
we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
