fans of the BlackBerry key one lover
hate the keyboard this phone pushed a
lot of the right buttons for being one
of our favorite workhorses for 2017 now
if what made you hold back was things
like the spec sheet there's a new kid in
town to address that I'm he might have
even I would pocket now and this is the
BlackBerry key one black edition brought
to you by pot pockets so let me try to
explain the differences between all key
one models as it stands we all know the
silver key one which we reviewed
recently the space black Edition that is
just launched on AT&amp;amp;T and it's actually
the same phone same specifications just
a different color and the AT&amp;amp;T logo this
blackberry key one black edition is
pretty much the expansion of the model
we recently saw launched in India but
now for the rest of the world or almost
let's call this more the blackberry key
1.5 because most of what you're getting
is the same phone with a few key
improvements this means that internally
you still have the same snapdragon 6 to
5 processor and the same 3505 battery
what changes is the boost to four gigs
of ram and 64 gigs of storage those of
you who use the key one know that's
sticking to the Qualcomm 625 is crucial
for its legendary battery life and the
boost in ram will allow the phone to do
a better job in handling all of its
security layers on top of android
providing more of a fluid user
experience for my quick time here in
berlin checking it out i do notice
applications launching faster and the
camera performing faster as well this
addresses my main complaint with the
phone as all it really needed was a
snappier experience from the user
interface and a little more reliability
and being able to deliver all the time
and everything else you've got the same
build quality and feel I seriously love
how the key one feels in the hand and
the darker tone just adds an extra touch
of elegance to the experience the only
downside is well it seems that this
phone won't be launched in the United
States and that's rather sad the color
is really not as relevant for me as the
booths and specifications so hopefully
that changes over time
