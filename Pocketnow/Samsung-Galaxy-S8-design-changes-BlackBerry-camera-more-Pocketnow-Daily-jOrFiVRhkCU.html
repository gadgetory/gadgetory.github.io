contradict some of the previous leaks we
hear more details on the camera
technology of the new blackberry we get
a glimpse of the LG watch violin don't
really like it I'm hi Natalie letter and
that I apologize for the noise it's
pouring rain outside and if you don't
hear at them great but if you do again
I've tried everything this is firing out
daily the official news today beginning
with deals you have been seeing a lot
for the galaxy s7 and Best Buy and
that's just continues today you're not
getting a free 32 inch TV this time but
that's why is actually offering do
hundred dollars off pretty much any
Samsung TV of your preference with the
purchase of a samsung galaxy s7 or
samsung galaxy s7 edge you can learn
more than leg of the discussion i was
all the spotlight over to motorola the
company has not made the big splash that
it was expecting with the Moto Z but the
Moto G lineup has always been very
famous for how affordable it is today we
learned that there are some leaked
images of the moto g 5 and addition to
specifications snapdragon 430 processor
a possibility of a full HD display this
time 5.5 inches and well the design
looks a lot like the Moto Z in the front
then the bag looks like something else
but anyways lets you will get now it's
all about the feature of android wear
today we see the first leaked images of
the LG watched bowel which is rumored to
be one of the Nexus or pixel variants of
Android wear or it will just be an LG
Smart Watch the point is well if this is
going to be a flex of SmartWatch we
wonder one why there is no heart rate
sensor it's considering the fact that if
you look at the leader image you'll
notice that Fitness is a big deal for
this watch pretty much all we see are
the Google style bands and stuff so
anyways I'll see now let's talk about
the new blackberry the company has made
a lot of headlines with its future
smartphone mainly because it's the retro
design a lot of people don't like it but
I'm actually part of the people to do
it's unique it's different and I wish
more companies did this but for those of
you wondering what the specification
Sarpy CEO has been really provide
in much details what we do here is that
we are getting the same Sony IMX 378
sensor in the camera that we have on the
Google pixel and again for those of you
that follow me on Instagram I love the
photos on the ghoul pixel but bear in
mind that the software plays a big role
here so take this with a grain of salt
let's see if these are just as rape and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with the samsung galaxy s 8 the
fact that there are some leaked renders
and these leaked renders actually match
some of the leaked photos that were
pretty much as shown during the weekend
obviously there is no daily that covers
that period and well there are a lot of
interesting elements in the design to
change first of all in the past we saw
that the flash at the back was really at
the top not on the slide like we see on
these renders the fingerprint scanner is
beside the camera and I wish somebody
could explain to me why is it going to
be so high up if there is so much real
estate below that's why it made sense
for the flesh to be at the top and the
fingerprint scan it could be at the
bottom but anyways everything else shows
us that the front is pretty much going
to be everything about display the
Samsung logo so it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about these design changes do you like
the flash on the top or on the side do
you like the fingerprint scanner so high
or would you rather change it in my case
yes I would rather it be marg anomic
Samsung has been an amazing job when it
comes to the ergonomics of its
smartphones that leave us a comment down
