last year is that it could make a damn
fine SmartWatch and this year Fitness
takes the stage this is Adam Lane and hi
many that are reporting from New York
City for PocketNow and let's talk about
the Huawei Fit you've heard me say it
over and over again Android wear and
fitness don't really match that well
unless you buy certain offerings from
polar we actually don't blame Huawei for
just skipping the whole drama and trying
to figure it out differently and are
actually pleasantly surprised by the
approach of the Huawei Fit we were
recently invited to a private event in
New York City to showcase the company's
holiday gift offerings that include some
of our favorites like the case of the
huawei mate book or the honor eight it
also served for us to learn about the
new Huawei fit which blends the elegance
of the Huawei watch design on a sleeker
chassis and a more efficient approach
the watch is made of aluminum and even
if it includes a polyurethane band for
working out it disappeared while a watch
20 millimeter band so you can swap this
for leather if you want the watch is 580
M water-resistant rated for ip68 and
wastes less than 35 grams there's a
built-in heart rate sensor for periodic
tracking and the charging port requires
Huawei's proprietary charging accessory
the 80 milliamp hour battery is rated
for 6 days of regular tracking and it
charges in less than 2 hours
now the reason why this watch is so
efficient is because it supports a new
1-inch memory LCD that's black and white
supports touch and is 208 by 208
resolution Huawei has provided a new
proprietary user interface that surfs
are tracking your workouts and that
syncs through bluetooth 4.2 to your
smart phone through the Huawei where
application then the huawei wear
application which works on both iOS and
Android provides even more detailed
information about your workouts
afterwards now if you're debating if
this watch is right for you let me put
it to you this way the Huawei Fit is a
very beautiful watch that costs just 130
dollars yeah that's $30 more than your
standard limited fitness band I'd
suggest that you go for the black unit
which I chose and actually prefer but
you want other color options there are
the silver variants which includes bands
in both orange and blue we'll be testing
the Huawei Fed over the next couple of
weeks but from where I stand so far the
price and the beauty of this watch make
this a truly compelling product friends
