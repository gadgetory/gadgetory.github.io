out tres invitations for its iphone
event Samsung surprises us all with the
gear s ahead of Aoife and yeah today we
will talk about the google nexus 9
specifications I'm hi Marilee that I am
the fact that something scripted and I
forget to mention this just proof of how
much I needed coffee yesterday this is
pocket out daily the official news today
are packed as companies are not waiting
for Aoife they want to announce their
products today the first one is LG they
have just made their LG G watch our
official today and it's not only usual
suspects when it comes to specifications
looks or for the details on that what
makes this product special is that aside
from having around display this is
actually a full round display it's got
this p OLED technology that will allow
you to utilize the whole display and not
just part of it like the case of the
Moto 360 because of where the wirings
and connectors are so really interesting
we love the fact that this pretty much
looks like a real watch that's actually
what we were waiting for so stay tuned
as we have our hands on a t5 alright
fine let's talk about the google nexus 9
thank you for pointing it out not sure
why i forgot to mention it yesterday but
rumors are that there are the cpu z
details out there that explain that this
product will be rocking a Tegra k1
Denver processor and what makes this
product cool is the fact that this will
pretty much be the first tablet running
a 64-bit processor that's great we have
been waiting for this obviously this
product is going to be made by HTC we
know that Nvidia HTC get along a lot
even though they've had some Tegra 3 bad
experiences in the past but anyways we
should be expecting this product in the
fall we just don't know for wet up next
we have motorola and the Google Nexus X
as yes there are some leaks out there
from retailers that are already
mentioning what we should expect from
this product first of all Snapdragon 805
so it could be that we are getting a 2k
display in addition to a 5.2 inch
display and apparently we are getting
options for 32 and 64 gigs on this
product which is great it's great to see
that we will have these storage options
that we do not know if this is
expandable storage or not and this will
be called the Nexus and
everything let's see what we get at the
motorola been happening in chicago and
taking the stage now is Apple the
company has finally sent out press
invitations for its event to happen on
September 9 so yes the iphone event is
happening on September 9 and is now
confirmed we do not know if we're
getting both iphones at those events as
these are the rumors and we do not know
if we're getting the iWatch but these
are also the rumors now even more
interesting it seems that the event will
happen at the flint center in cupertino
not the Moscone Center in San Francisco
as it's always happened and the the
reason why this is interesting is
because this is the same center where
the original Macintosh was announced in
1984 so it turns out that we're going
back to this event and it apparently fit
for a lot of hands-on areas so it could
be that we're getting various products
at this event stay tuned for that and
finally for the hot news of the day
Samsung has just announced its gear s
this is a SmartWatch that is a
smartphone it's got everything 3G
connectivity Wi-Fi Bluetooth it's got
applications like navigation from the
here applications it's got its own
keyboard that you really don't need a
smartphone but you can pair a smartphone
to work with it if you want to that's
your thing you get both options and
specifications are interesting the
design is interesting it's a very big
display and it's curved which is really
cool but that leads me to the question
of the day would you buy a gear s is
that something you're looking for
because in my case I carry two phones
for a reason but mostly because I have
to make phone calls with one and data
with the other so you know this could
solve a lot of my phone call problems if
I wanted to and not carry two phones but
it'll all depend on how good this
product is leave us a comment down below
