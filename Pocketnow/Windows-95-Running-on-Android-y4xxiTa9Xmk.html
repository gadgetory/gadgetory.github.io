i've mentioned in the past that the
smartphones that we're seeing now are
really maybe even sometimes more
powerful than the desktop computers that
I had when I was a kid so that got me
thinking
couldn't we run a desktop operating
system on one of our handheld computers
or our smartphones turns out you can
let's start out with Windows 95 I'll
show you how to do it
okay so what we have here is a nexus one
that running Froyo and this nexus of
course can install non-market apps I've
already configured it so that I can
install apps that come from other
sources other than the market some
Android phones on some carriers that
have the initials AT&amp;amp;T might not let you
do this
so if you've got one of those phones
that won't let you install a non-market
app you're out of luck for this but for
everybody else let me show what you need
to do first and foremost you're going to
need two different packages if you will
the first one is the apk the SDL app
then I've got links to that over in the
article on pocketnow.com
I've already installed this to do it let
me show you how to do it here you just
not that one you tap on the app okay
tell it to install and it goes ahead and
installs the app for you okay normally
we'd open it but I want to show you the
other part so I'm going to say done the
second package that you're going to need
is the SDL folder now inside the SDL
folder are a series of images binary
images in this case which include your
BIOS your VGA and whatnot so you're
literally setting up a VGA video adapter
computer BIOS and then loading in a
operating system image on top of it so
it's really kind of cool you're loading
up Windows in a virtual machine in this
case so let me show you how that's done
let's come back out here and run the app
now the name of the app is Lib SDL and
it's right over there so we're going to
tap that and that's going to read all of
the information from those image files
and what you can see here is it's loaded
up the the BIOS and the VGA BIOS as well
and it's starting up Windows 95 now
there are several different windows 95
images that you can get this is the
second one that I tried the first one
was in Russian and I don't speak Russian
so that didn't help much
this one is in English so it helps me
quite a bit but there's no splash screen
the Russian version had the windows 95
splash screen with the animation going
across the bottom so it was kind of cool
okay now I wanted to be quiet there for
just a few minutes while it played the
windows startup sound it's been a long
time since I've heard that what you can
see here is you've got the background
which is kind of bleeding through the
boot process and that's what's blinking
in the background the reason for that is
Windows 95 doesn't like non-standard
display resolutions so here we're
running at 640 by 480 and that's pretty
much what we're stuck with we can't
expand it to fill everything out without
getting into some some low-level hacks
and tweaks in the Windows 95
image itself but that having been said
here you go it's windows now a couple
things to note is windows was not touch
friendly Windows 95
so instead you've got your mouse pointer
right there to move it you've got to
touch your finger on it and drag it and
it's not all that accurate you can see
now I've positioned it down by the Start
menu it's kind of difficult to click on
something because when you touch your
finger down again it tries to reposition
the cursor but there usually have
finally after three or four taps have
been able to select the Start menu I'm
going to use the scroll ball which is
analogous to the up and down and left
and right arrow keys we're going to go
to programs and then we are going to go
down to Internet Explorer which is right
there and we're going to load out up now
unfortunately it doesn't tap in to your
network so we're not going to be able to
see anything but we're going to fire up
Internet Explorer and look at what this
was and I don't remember if this is ie
one or two maybe we'll go in and take a
look at that it is taking a little bit
of time but there you can see we've got
Internet Explorer loaded up and we'll go
over here to help see if we can get to
it
help
and it's not letting to do it but in any
event is Windows 95 it's on your Nexus 1
if you want to go in and use your
keyboard
here's a another Android tip for you
we'll go down here to the address bar
and tap in it and then we'll press and
hold the menu button and that brings up
your on-screen keyboard and we can go to
and you can see it's not in there but if
I could position the mouse there we go
go to Pocket now.com and doing this on
camera is a lot slower than doing it in
real life I'll hit the back button to
get rid of that keyboard and there you
go it's redirecting me to home that
Microsoft comm but it's not going to get
there again because I don't have any
networking I don't have an awful lot of
stuff I can't install any programs I
can't do a lot of things with it but I
can show all my buddies look hey I've
got Windows 95 on my phone why because I
can one thing to remember if you
remember from Windows days you can't
just exit the app you have to go down to
the Start menu I can get it and tell it
to shut down otherwise the next time you
boot up you're going to see the scan
disk and it is going to go through and
run scan disk for you and I don't know
any way out of that so you're pretty
much out of luck if you don't shut down
properly each time but that said why run
Windows 95 on a nexus one the answer
because you can now go and impress your
friends enjoy if you like this tip give
