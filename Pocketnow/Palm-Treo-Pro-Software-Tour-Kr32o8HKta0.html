pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to go through the software on the
palm
before I do I'm gonna show you two
things that I missed in the last video
the hardware tour the first thing I want
to show you is that there's actually an
infrared port on the trio Pro you can
see it if I kind of tilt the device and
the light there there it is we don't see
many devices these days with infrared
ports but pom decided that it's a needed
addition the other thing I want to show
you is where the microSD slot is and
unfortunately it's behind the battery
cover so if I remove the battery cover
and look to the other side here you can
see it it's kind of right near the
stylus silo and they're really hard to
reach place and I really don't like that
very much
I prefer to have it out on the side or
on the top or bottom where I can easily
swap in a new micro SD card now if you
watch the hardware tour video you may
remember me talking about the screen and
how it has this milky white tint over it
that makes it really hard to see
outdoors it cuts down on the color
contrast and how black blacks appear on
the screen well Tom sent me a
replacement unit because they they were
certain that this wasn't the case and
indeed they were right the unit that I
had right here was a defective unit with
a defective screen let me show you the
new version or the new unit I should say
where everything seems to be much better
in order the blacks are black the colors
come out very nicely so look at the
black at the top of the screen here on
the old model and on the new model the
black is just much more black you
probably can't tell on YouTube but
there's a big difference on this end so
scratch what I said about the screen
being defective with low contrast and
color quality it just was an issue with
my particular unit and call me good on
it very fast ok so out on the box this
is the today's screen that you get on
the trio pro you don't get an interface
replacement like touchflo 3d but that's
ok this is a professional device so palm
has kept it clean which we're fine with
since this is an HTC device we get the
HTC task manager in the upper right
corner which lets you close programs
selectively or close all of the running
programs in Windows Mobile if you want
to get back program memory and of course
through this task manager you can also
select what the X button does in the
upper right corner as you know pressing
the X button in Windows Mobile
hibernates the program it doesn't
actually close it and with this program
you can change that so here on the Today
screen we've standard entries we have
quick tour which will just give you an
overview of how to use the trio Pro and
I find this kind of weird it cuts off
the top of the screen Oh miss does this
almost as if it's not optimized for a
320 by 320 display I can't read the text
on the screen and I'm sure you can't
either this is very silly I don't know
why that is
what you see down here is the weather
and the time here in Philadelphia Tokyo
and Los Angeles this is a trial version
of world meet unfortunately you don't
get the full version of world mate which
is kind of silly I mean I just bought
this five hundred and fifty dollar
device and palm only includes the trial
version but that said world made is a
good program this is the main interface
we can click on weather center and get
weather for the next five days if we
click on satellite it tells you hey you
got to pay for it if you want to see it
which I'm not going to do if we click
world weather that's something that we
can use without paying the price for the
software and there are other things that
this program can do which are pretty
cool I'll cover it in the review there
are a bunch of converters that we can
use if we're traveling so it's a pretty
good tool if you're traveling I just
wish that pom would have included the
full version of that so let's go into
the Start menu from the Start menu we
can off open office mobile all four
programs of office mobile are included
so that's good let's go into the Start
menu now looking down the Start menu we
have communications manager and this is
what it looks like it's skinned with a
special palm skin looks pretty nice you
can turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and
everything from this screen we have the
camera and I'll talk about the camera in
the review it turns out it's not that
great of a camera it doesn't have a
flash doesn't have autofocus
it doesn't take great photos
unfortunately going down the list Google
Maps is included we've something called
internet proxy there which I'm going to
talk about in the review I'm going to go
back to the today's screen for a second
because there's a button here that says
internet and Internet will take you to
Pocket Internet Explorer unfortunately
this device doesn't come with Opera
Mobile or a better browser such as
Skyfire it just uses Pocket Internet
Explorer that said of course I recommend
that you download Opera Mobile 9.5 beta
it's a fantastic browser I was using it
earlier and it renders quite well on the
three
28 by 320 screen and here we have seen
it calm loaded which is pretty complex
webpage and of course an opera mobile
you can you can span around by scrolling
you can double tap to zoom in on a comet
or resize and it works just really well
in the Palm Treo Pro now something I
should note is that there's no flick
scrolling built in to the Palm Treo Pro
which is kind of silly so if you go into
context or a long list you have to use
the scroll bar to move up and down or
you can use the d-pad that's unfortunate
going down the list we have quick GPS
which is assisted GPS so that you can
get a faster GPS signal when you're
using you know Google Maps or TeleNav or
something like that it comes with remote
desktop which is pretty nice using
remote desktop on a 320 by 320
resolution screen may be difficult but
if you're trying to retrieve an email or
something and you're on the road and you
want to get into your home computer that
may be a good thing to use going down
the list we have a full version of
sprite backup which is good because
sprite backup is a really good backup
program we have sounds which we'll just
link you to the phone settings that will
access in a minute but it's a good way
it's a good way to quickly access you
know the text message sound new message
and that sort of thing we've TeleNav but
it's just a trial you can't use the
voice guided navigation as you would
have if you if you actually buy the
software we have streaming media so that
we can watch mobile streaming videos
from mo youtube.com so that's a welcomed
addition and that's pretty much it for
the Start menu now let's go into
settings here in settings we have key
guard and what that will do is when you
take the device out of standby you can
choose to have it require you to do an
unlock sequence so that you don't
accidentally call your grandmother in
the middle of the night going down the
list we have standard stuff here we have
a full version of Microsoft voice
command which is good poms been doing
that on all the trio devices over in
system we have backlight and there are
no settings really for the screen we
can't change the contrast we can't do
auto adjust it doesn't have a light
sensor and that's that's unfortunate I'm
right now it's on medium brightness and
this is what it looks like at maximum
brightness but save battery power I'm
going to keep it down a little bit going
down the list we have let's check
memory we have a bunch of programs open
right now the trail pro only has 128
megabytes of RAM which it's enough but
if you're doing a lot of multitasking if
you're using opera and email and other
programs like navigation and that sort
of thing you're gonna run pretty low in
the device to make it kind of slow I'll
talk about performance more in the
review and going down the list that's
pretty much it
let's go into connections where we just
have the standard bits that will allow
you to modify Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
settings and everything like that
now something I do like about the trio
Pro and you'll find this on any windows
mobile device with a keyboard out front
is that it's really easy to dial
someone's number so if I want to dial
Chris I just type his name from the home
home screen or that's today's screen and
I see all the matches for Chris and from
here I can text him I can cause home or
as his house number his work number and
everything like that and something else
that's good about the trio Pro is that
you can search Google right from the
home screen and that's an easy way to
look up things quickly without having to
launch pocket Internet Explorer first so
the Palm Treo Pro does a really good job
at keeping things simple fast and and
minimal which is good for the business
user but I mean if you look at previous
palm devices like the 700 W it really
brought along some innovations that we
hadn't seen so far in those days for
example we could have play pause and
rewind and fast-forward controls for our
voice mail we could do picture call a
picture speed dial from our today's
screen it just had a lot of little
things search from the home screen that
just raised the bar for usability in the
windows mobile world the Palm Treo Pro
is is very usable I mean it's a great
device it just doesn't raise the bar and
bring that extra Palm element to the
table so that's about it for the Palm
Treo Pro watch out for the review on
pocketnow.com where we'll talk about
battery life
we'll take speed benchmarks and talk
about everything good in everything bad
about the Palm Treo Pro and come up with
a conclusion at the end on whether this
should be your next phone that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
