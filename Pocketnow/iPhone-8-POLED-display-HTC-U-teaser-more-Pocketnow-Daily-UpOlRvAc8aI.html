being a major peel that supplier HTC has
just teased something for you coming at
CES or at least later and the statistics
for how many Galaxy Note sevens are
still in the market is quite alarming
I'm Jaime Rivera and I apologize for the
hissing noise I'm in a 9th floor and it
is very windy and what the mother city
since yesterday
this is parking out daily the official
news today beginning with deals as a
Microsoft as a major deal event
happening right now now there is a catch
these are bundles if you're interested
for example in the surface pro 4 you get
up to 4 and $30 off depending on the
bundle and if you don't want deals on
the surface book you get that up to $400
off but again depending on the bundle
you can learn more in the link in the
description other very interesting deals
come from daily steals but if you only
got 5 days for this one it's the LG v10
unlock that's the AT&amp;amp;T variant and yes I
know the v10 is a year old but it's
still one of our favorite smartphone
cameras it's got great expandable
storage expandable well replaceable
battery it's a very rugged design so I
would highly suggest you consider this
for 216 bucks
believe it or not it is still December
we are still talking about the Galaxy
Note 7 mainly because it's alarming to
learn just how many devices are still in
the market apparently in countries like
Korea there are still 25% of these units
still in the market which is about
140,000 units even more alarming is that
in certain cases certain countries it
even surpasses the LTV 20 and the amount
of units that you can find out there it
tells you a lot about the b20 which is
sad because it's a great phone but yeah
seems to people are not returning the
device and speaking of samsung we've got
some very interesting rumors from
trusted sources claiming that the
company is preparing to ship up to a
hundred million peel LED this place for
the next generation iPhone and this is
weird mainly because we've heard the
same thing from LG we've heard the same
thing that sharp is going to be the
supplier so it's really hard to predict
which company is going to do it what we
do know is that appeal that display will
help you get yourself a curved screen so
yeah this could mean that we are getting
a curved display for the iPhone 8 it's a
rumor that's
and happening for the longest time well
it doesn't really matter who supplies it
but we do know that Sam shanks got an
amazing oh let this play we'll see and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with HTC we received the very
interesting teaser this morning the
company is telling us that we will see a
device that is focused on you and it's a
big you in the teaser now the company
has been working on involving its
product design its product strategy for
the longest time we did love the HTC 10
a lot I wish I could say the same thing
about the bolt but I did love the 10
mostly because of everything we got I
could have said the same thing about the
price tag sadly I think that that was
the part that wasn't really competitive
so it makes you wonder exactly what
we're getting and the most interesting
part is that apparently we're not going
to learn about this device until a
couple of days after CES so it leads me
to the question of the day what would
you like to see HTC bringing to the
market in my case I don't don't get me
wrong I would love for the HTC tend to
evolve with the stereo speakers that we
love the vm8 and I don't know a couple
of enhancements but we would love to
know your opinion in the comments down
below
