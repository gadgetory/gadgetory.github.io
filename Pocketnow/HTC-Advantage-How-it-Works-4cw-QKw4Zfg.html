pocket now and HTC has just announced
HTC advantage a new benefits initiative
for buyers of flagship HTC smartphones
so if you or a friend or family member
are considering buying an HTC One One
Maxx or One mini here's what you need to
know the first prong of HTC advantage is
something we've seen already
now commitment to timely Android updates
the company says it will commit to major
Android updates for two years after the
launch of a product
now that means incremental updates may
not all be guaranteed but a major
revision like jellybean to KitKat will
be covered again this is more a
continuation of existing policy than a
new development and so as the company's
plan to maintain its HTC backup offering
with 25 to 50 gigs of additional online
storage in concert with Google Drive the
real news here is the broadening of
HTC's warranty terms for the one product
family the deal here is that if you buy
a 1-1 Mini or One Maxx and you crack the
screen within the first six months of
ownership HTC will repair it at no cost
to you all you need to do is ship the
device to the company's houston-based
repair center and you'll get a
replacement phone for free within a few
days if you can't be without your phone
for that long you have the option of
paying $29 for a replacement to be
overnighted to you instead
in either case HTC Americas customer
service department will walk you through
backing up your device with HTC back up
making restoration easier when the new
or replacement device arrives again this
is not an insurance plan or a carrier
related offering this is an expansion of
HTC's warranty just for the one family
and speaking of one that's exactly how
many times you can break your screen and
get a free repair once so if you're a
real butterfingers you'll still want to
tread cautiously and maybe buy a case
just to be clear folks these are offers
and guarantees from HTC Americas this is
not a global offer and the warranty
component only applies to devices bought
on or after today's date February 18th
there are a few other terms and
conditions and more details on this
program in the press release and the
full story including quotes from HTC
officials
a few more questions answered during our
recent interview at pocketnow.com that's
the first link down in the description
below folks who head on over there read
up on it and let us know in the comments
whether this affects your decision if
you were thinking about purchasing a 1:1
Max or 1 Mini in the meantime please
like this video if you did enjoy it and
stay tuned to pocket now on all the
various social feeds so you don't miss
future news and features from our site
in the meantime this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow thank you very
much for watching and we'll see you very
soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
