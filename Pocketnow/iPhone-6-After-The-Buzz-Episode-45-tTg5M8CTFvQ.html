over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's have a second look at one of
the best-selling smartphones of the year
and the latest iteration to the
smartphone that redefines smartphones
I'm high memory better with pocket now
this is Apple's iPhone 6 and this is
episode 45 of after the buzz the iPhone
6 has garnered a lot of fame over the
last nine months since it was launched
and that's mainly for two very separate
reasons first of all this is the
company's boldest departure from what
our phones have always been over the
last eight years and this time throwing
one hand a usability out the window with
its new designs second well no other
smartphone has sold so many units in so
little time by now you've probably
noticed that most of your friends are
already using one so if you're
struggling to the side of that's worth
it to buy one after the buzz you've come
to the right place
iPhones have always been prone to
polarizing opinions when it comes to
hardware and this one is definitely no
exception
some find this to be one of the most
beautiful phones in the market and then
others hate the horrible antenna stripes
at the back and the device's infamous
protruding camera I'm inclined to not
really like it but I feel that most of
these changes have actually helped the
phone age well Apple's decision to move
away from Shaam furred edges with this
model was actually a very good move as
it still looks like new for the most
part I've carried this particular unit
bear in a sleeve for the last three
months and after two minor Falls all I
have is a Nick on one of the sides so
it's clear that Apple has reinforced the
aluminum to a certain degree
not all has been positive though so it's
fair for me to admit that this is
actually the second iPhone 6 that I
carry in the third display that I test
since launch date
see there's clearly a problem in the
front-facing camera assembly where a
very small white film seems to offset
itself over time and threatens to cover
the camera lens even without false to
cost this I've never really experienced
problems with a selfie camera when this
issue arises but I always get my device
replaced every time I go to an Apple
store with the issue so you should
probably do the same if you're having
the same problem I've also noticed that
even though touch ID is more accurate on
this unit the button does make some
cracking sounds after a few weeks of use
something which could also warrant the
trip to the Genius Bar other than that I
really have no complaints with the
devices hardware some of you may
consider the devices IPS display
technology to be dated when compared to
AMOLED zin the market but I still find
the color reproduction here to be good
enough definitely not better than AMOLED
the antenna stripes haven't really
suffered from coloration on this
particular space grey unit and the
horrible camera hump hasn't really found
that he scratches even though I was
waiting for it to do so this also
continues to be the most pocket friendly
phone I've ever owned and even though
some people feel that it could be to
thinner light it is definitely one of
the phones that I enjoy holding the most
particularly because of these curves on
the sides software has also aged well in
my opinion iOS 8 was definitely the
buggiest iteration Apple has ever made
public but the company has proven that
it can work quickly and ironing things
out I've noticed a significant drop in
app crashes with iOS 8.3 and the promise
of a more conservative Iowa's 9 is
definitely a good thing one of my
biggest complaints with the early iowa's
8 was third-party keyboards delaying
when switching with the emoji keyboard
and that has been solved for the most
part by allowing these keyboards to
provide their own emoji
on the other hand other features like
widgets are sadly something that I
rarely use given the odd placement for
everything else iOS 8 continues to be
the most simplistic mobile operating
system in the market some of you might
hate that but even the fact that Apple's
target is really not oriented to power
users the rest of the world seems just
fine with it if you belong to the Apple
ecosystem you'll find a lot of things to
be cool like getting your phone calls
diverted to your Mac or iPad with iOS 8
continuity is also something I found
very useful at times and having app
suggestions pop up at the bottom over
your lockscreen when you're close to a
movie theater or whatever you arrive at
an airport is definitely something
that's really cool now my user
experience with the iPhone 6 has been
rather mixed except for a brief period
of time when I replace the iPhone for a
Moto X back in February this has been my
daily drivers in Zion boxed it which
trifid me most prefer it has been
software reliability its app
availability and the fact that it can
handle graphics intensive games like a
champ I'm using the 128 gigabyte model
of the iPhone 6 and after packing it to
the gills with games music and videos I
really have no complaints when it comes
to its performance other things like
call quality continue to be good and
data speeds really don't disappoint with
this phone
getting a crazy 50 megabits per second
down over LTE in some areas this picture
is particularly cool if you own a Mac or
iPad as connecting the iPhones hotspot
can now be controlled by these devices
remotely if they're on the same Apple ID
sadly not everything is H well and one
clear example is the iPhones battery
life if you're not using an Apple watch
you'll probably get through the day of
moderate use just fine but oddly the
Apple watches made my experience much
much worse I'll really get through 5
p.m. on a charge lately and I've noticed
that the iPhone overheats constantly
when on LTE something which didn't
happen before iOS 8.3
the second example of aging done wrong
is the iPhones camera it is still one of
the fastest smartphone cameras in the
market and it also is a great performer
when it comes to most scenarios whether
it's low-light photography or during the
day you get the job done well but well
is sadly not enough for 2015 the eight
megapixel count on the primary camera is
sadly dated and the cameras color
reproduction when compared to new
champions like the galaxy s6 galaxy note
4 and LG g4 is also outclassed it's
really hard to take a photo with this
camera and not feel like if the results
are dull when compared to most modern
shooters Apple clearly has a high point
to improve with the next iPhone
iteration video recording on the other
hand continues to be on par with
competitors if not better and things
like slow motion video recording in
addition to time-lapse mode overall this
is the story of buying an iPhone in mid
2015 this is definitely Apple's best
iPhone ever and the very cool device for
the average user but it doesn't change
the fact that some of its features have
been outclassed by 2015 competition if
this was February 2015 I would have
probably recommended this film blindly
to anyone but it's really hard for me to
do so now with so much awesome
competition from Samsung and LG and when
the next iPhone is poised to improve all
the shortcomings of this particular
device if you absolutely must have an
iPhone now then yes this is definitely
the best way to go but if you don't then
I would highly recommend that you wait
for the next iPhone
