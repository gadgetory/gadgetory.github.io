pocketnow.com webos is dead or at least
HP isn't going to be dealing with webOS
anymore we might see it in the future
but that doesn't mean we can't review
the HP pre three the best webOS
smartphone ever and it might be the last
one to so let's get to it
so this device was delayed and it should
have been released many months ago
because it really doesn't measure up to
what's out there right now but it's
still the best webOS smartphone it
finally pushes the resolution beyond the
HVGA
that is found on the pre 2 and the pre
plus and here it is the HP pre 3 got a
larger screen a faster processor really
upgraded in every respect to be really
the ultimate webOS smartphone again HP
is killing webOS or at least passing it
off to another company at some point but
this is really interesting let's move
around the box and see what we have so
we've got the pre three cubed smartphone
battery this is the European version
that you can get at clove Co UK it is
see if there's any specs on here doesn't
look like it so we can slide it out I've
got some pretty cool packaging here need
to cut through this
pen pull off the tape and let us see the
I was gonna say Palm Pre 3 but it's the
HP Cree 3 so we're going to compare this
to the press and to the pre 2 in a
minute let's see if we get any goodies
in the box
HP is here to help well not for that
much longer um see what we have down
here standard charging stuff we've got a
UK charger in there because again this
is a phone intended for Europe
specifically the UK it's not going to
work on networks here in the US although
there will probably be a version that
will have for example AT&amp;amp;T fans and
maybe eventually bans for t-mobile
so let's slide that off slide that off
take a look at the pre 3 so definitely a
bigger device than previous
generation freeze because we've got the
larger screen the 800 by 480 resolution
screen got the biggest keyboard yet this
is really interesting to see we've got
to compare this to the family here so
zoom in a little bit and we'll pull out
the pre - one of the problems with webOS
devices is that they all look the same
it's just the same hardware
it was nice looking in 2009 it was ok in
2010 by the time 2011 came around it's
just old and so if we slide this over
and we put the pre plus over here we
still have a very similar design they
flattened off the front of the screen
you can see the sound absorption foam
reflecting here and then they released
the veer 4G on a tee trying to come out
with a phone that really was inventing a
segment that really didn't need to be
invented small phones no one really
wants a small phone with a small screen
sales of the Viereck have been poor
sales of the pre plus and the pre were
pretty poor sales of the pre - were poor
and you can probably understand why
webOS is is shifting hands to another
company they can hopefully give it the
attention that it deserves so here we've
got the pre three again high resolution
screen processor clocking in at over a
Giga hurt we'll talk more about specs in
a future video again with same kind of
backing here the same kind of design the
camera in the upper left corner we've
got the speaker and on the bottom this
time the pre three is definitely pretty
slender and again it's got that very
nice hardware keyboard pretty clicky
let's compare that the size of the
keyboard between these other devices and
as you can see the pre three has a
keyboard that is probably significantly
bigger than than the pre 2 and
definitely bigger than the vir
let's turn it on and see what happens on
the first boot wash let's pop out the
battery and check out what kind of
battery it has so this lifts off
hopefully it does and nothing is going
to break okay here we have a SIM card
slot battery which is of size twelve
hundred and thirty million powers okay
we're going
that back in got to put a sim card in
there but again this is a European phone
it's not going to do 3G here in the US
that doesn't mean we can't turn it on so
for the first time we're going to see
webOS in WVGA resolution instead of that
kind of boring H VGA resolution so will
that a bullet boot up will come right
back and tell you what we see well keep
shutting off so I think it needs a good
charge and we'll definitely do that
we'll come back and talk about webOS on
the pre three the fastest webOS phone
yet with the highest resolution screen
should be kind of a cool device right
now it's discounted for well relatively
speaking it's about four hundred and
fifty dollars unlocked you can get at
clove cote UK again this is the end of
the line as we know it for the HP web OS
devices and it's probably going to turn
out to be a pretty cool phone we're
looking for a great performance great
battery life and we'll have more on
those things in upcoming videos if you
like this video please give it a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now
