solution for their Android license being
revoked and yeah it gets interesting
samsung's new 5x optical zoom seems to
be ready and might be coming to a
mystery phone this year and the honor 20
was just launched and we're already
getting hands-on and obviously that
topic is interesting too I'm Jaime
Rivera and this trip to London has been
again interesting because of everything
that's going on in the States we've got
a lot to report this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for the Galaxy S
10 there's an eBay seller that has the
dual SIM unlock Berrien 4500 $20 if you
want the S 10 East $600 if you want the
Galaxy S 10 and 700 bucks if when I get
the galaxy s 10 plus do I need to save
more you could follow the link in the
description for information now let's
talk about Apple as I am upset I just
got a 15-inch MacBook Pro and now they
just updated it we were waiting for a 16
inch variant and apparently that's not
gonna happen right now we've got a new
six core an eight core 15-inch MacBook
Pro and then the other 13 inch remains
as a quad core but these are Intel's new
eighth and ninth generation processors
the most important part is that the
keyboard gets a full revamp and
apparently if you have the newer 18 the
2018 MacBook Pro which is the one I have
we get a replacement keyboard that
matches the new generation you'll learn
more about that in the description as
well obviously price tags are crazy now
suppose the spotlight over to honor
because the honored 20 honored 20 Pro
honor 20 light which was already
unveiled previously now become official
in the UK we've got price points $4.99
and $5.99 we've got a full video with
specifications details on why these
phones matter obviously I know what's
your biggest question over these phones
is I know I couldn't cover it in the
hands-on video because it was
pre-recorded before all the news broke
so we're gonna talk about it in the last
segment of this video and how about we
continue talking about Samsung when it
comes to rumors that they're gonna bring
full 5x and even 10x optical zoom
smartphone if you remember they acquired
core photonics which is the company that
made the
lossless zoom possible on oboe phones
now we've got rumors that it's coming as
of later this year but apparently it's
not coming to the Galaxy Note it seems
that it coming to another special
smartphone we wonder which one will that
beep stay tuned for that
and finally the hottest news today
probably the most important have to do
with Huawei obviously I know that there
are a ton of concerns from you over what
will happen of your current Huawei user
we're gonna tell you what we know and
obviously this is going to evolve over
time the first thing that I know is that
if you currently own a huawei phone you
should not worry these phones are not
going to be affected I do know that it
will affect new phones going forward we
do know that the Department of Commerce
of the United States is restricting a
little less when it comes to Huawei
apparently they're giving them 90 days
and we're not exactly sure what those 90
day limit eight and nine days entail so
you don't have to worry for the next 90
days as well I guess but apparently
Huawei has been working on an
alternative for the longest time since
2012 they've been working on their own
operating system that also supports
Android applications so for those of you
that wonder about the future of Huawei
there are rumors that that might be it
though obviously again this is a topic
that's continuously evolving so again if
your current Huawei user you should not
worry right now we will keep you posted
if you should in the comments down below
let us know what do you think do you
think that always should keep Android
going forward do you think that Huawei
should move on to its own thing 50% of
Huawei smartphones depend on everything
that's outside of China so I feel that
obviously Android is a big player but to
think the Huawei has enough scale to
make even Android worry about what the
future should be so I would love to know
what you think in the comments down
below is I'm still scratching my head
over what the best alternative is and
obviously the next 90 days you're gonna
tell us a lot about the future friends
