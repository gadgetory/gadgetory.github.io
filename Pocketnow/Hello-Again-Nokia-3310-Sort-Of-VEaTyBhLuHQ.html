announced by Nokia time WC was any of
the stock Android offerings but no it's
actually this I'm high nearly that was
pocket now when this is the Nokia 3310
version 2017 it's shocking to see how
much commotions around the Nokia Boots
for the last couple of days the booth is
packed and the smiles are evident what
HMV and former Nokia engineers
considered a product for having fun has
evolved into one of the most iconic
limoges that I have seen in a while the
first generation they'll get 3310 when
live nearly seventeen years ago and is
avidly remembered for being
indestructible this new model seems to
mimic most of these design elements at
first glance but the feel is quite
different this is actually a glossy
plastic body that doesn't seem ready to
take a beating like its predecessors in
the back is fully removable to reveal
the replaceable battery and the slots
for microSD expansion and SIM card and
then there are the modern design
elements like a 2 megapixel camera
microUSB charging and even a headphone
jack for media consumption
the display is of 2.4 inches in QVGA
resolution and it runs on series
thirty-plus software and yes what you
see down there is actually a numeric
keypad something very hard to find
lately and with great tactile feedback
though yeah I will admit that my writing
on p9 has gotten really bad over the
last couple of years but just cut me
some slack it's been a while so I won't
deny I really love diving into the menus
just makes me reminisce of the old Nokia
Y paradigm back in the day left them
right soft keys would adapt to whatever
menus you were using and all that
remains available here there's an option
to load applications on this phone and
you'll probably be happy to find the
Legacy Opera browser here as well but
what has really driven people crazy here
is the fact that you'd get Nokia's
famous make game I'm going to go out on
a limb and say that I actually prefer
the legacy implementation and not what
Gameloft has done here foot
at least it's great to see that note get
brought it back now it would be a
horrible mistake to try to compare this
phone to a modern smartphone it's not
trying to be and the focus and target is
totally a different ballgame and really
that's the biggest takeaway from my time
with the Nokia 3310 there is no better
way for a company to tell us that the
legacy Nokia that we love is back than
by showing us this type of fun and sure
at 49 euros this phone will sell like
hotcakes
but the bigger picture behind this
product is all about what the spoon
represents and I cannot wait to give the
Nokia 3310 challenge a try in the near
future all that happens make sure you
