parking out daily that deals with the
fact that the day was iphone7 day there
is a lot more to cover than what we can
say in just three minutes so I'm gonna
leave it up with pocket now and here are
our first impressions of everything that
Apple announced today including the
iPhone 7 you know we usually don't begin
videos with the hottest news but man
Super Mario run we've been waiting for a
Nintendo to launch any sort of Mario on
mobile devices legally because I know
you can't emulate them this is a new
approach though the whole idea of Super
Mario run is that Mario runs on his own
and then you have to tap to make him
jump how hard you tap a heart he jumps
and the whole idea is again to make this
as convenient as just going on a subway
playing your game and it becomes to a
string degree a social game depending on
how much you accumulate even cooler it
is gonna be a fixed price game meaning
no stupid subscription service that we
cannot wait to give it a try now an
interesting surprise comes at the Apple
watch series too it's pretty much the
same design of the Apple watch but you
are getting new specifications like a
dual core processor faster GPU you
finally get swim proof water resistance
in addition to GPS capabilities that
enable you to even get a new Apple watch
and Nike addition if you're interested
in that now the cool part is that if you
don't want these capabilities you can
still get the first generation Apple
watch which gets an upgrade to a dual
core processor or so if you don't want
the added perks but you still want a
less clunky Apple watch which was our
major complaint apparently this will be
the watch for you that starts at 269 the
Apple watch series 2 starts at 369 and
then if you want to get the Apple watch
Edition it seems that the gold variant
is dead now for a ceramic watch ceramic
is a great material it's great to deter
scratches the problem is $1300 no thank
you
Apple has also taken the stage to
announce new air pods
obviously when I tell you about the
iPhone 7 which I'm leaving for last this
will make sense or going through a
Bluetooth headphones here that well they
look like ear pods with new air pause
ein there's new microphones here there
are actually no buttons in these a
headphones but you can still interact
with them through taps tree to enable
Siri for example the cool part here is
that there is literally no pairing to be
done you simply pull them out of the box
or their case they will automatically
detect your iPhone and they will sync
that pairing through iCloud to the rest
of your iOS devices they will detect
whatever you take them off because
they've got an accelerometer so whenever
you take them off or you just use one of
these ear pods airpot sorry you will be
able to use it as a Bluetooth headset
whatever you want to or stereo whenever
you want to
the sad part here is that apparently
there are no ear wings and I have a
serious case of having ear pods fall off
my ear very easily so you can already
imagine what $169 will get you and how
easily you might lose them at least I
know I will now let's pull the spotlight
over to the new iPhone 7 iPhone 7 plus
the major announcements today there were
10 improvements being mentioned we're
gonna narrow them down to two segments
and actually the first segment will
focus on two of the major changes number
one being design there are some major
design changes here starting with the
color options there is this new jet
black color that is gorgeous it is
simply gorgeous but buyers beware if you
notice the fine print apparently it will
be successful to scratches we cannot
wait to review it but there are some
other major changes there is now IV 67
water and does resistance finally Apple
in addition to a new force touch home
button meaning there are apparently no
moving parts here everything works there
new tactic engine in addition to this we
are also getting a new play with the
stereo speakers it's actually the bottom
speaker with the top earpiece playing
stereo which is great and because there
is the depth of the headphone jack
apparently there's gonna be more space
for that to be done now Apple made a
major deal about performance with its
new 810 fusion chip we're going 64-bit
quad-core for the first time ever Apple
has sticked a dual-core forever until
now the idea here is that to course will
be doing the heavy lifting the other two
cores will be the ones that will be used
whenever the phone is just doing email
for example the cool part here is that
you're apparently getting two extra
battery life hours in the case of the
iPhone 7 in the case of the iPhone 7
plus which already had great battery
life well you're getting one extra hour
now Apple made a major deal about its
new display apparently it is still IPS
but you get the wider color gamut that
you currently already get on the iPad
pro nine point seven inch we assume that
it's the same technology here and yes
you do get better color reproduction but
the problem is for those of you that
have used the iPad pro nine point seven
inch you will know that blacks aren't
really well represented from the side
they kind of look red hopefully that
will not be the case with the iPhone
mainly because you still get the 750 P
and 1080p displays that you've seen
before just with these improvements we
will see in a review
now finally the hottest news today
believe it or not have to do with the
phone that I always ignore the larger
iPhone 7 plus and the past for me
optical image stabilization has never
been enough and this time even less
because you get oh is on the iPhone 7
but this iPhone 7 plus has a new trick
with this dual camera the wide-angle
lenses are the same between iPhone 7
iPhone 7 plus the difference with this
larger iPhone is that this is a
telephoto 56 millimeter lens so in
addition to being able to get the same
performance like you do with the iPhone
7 there is even F 1.8 aperture here on
both the iPhones the difference is zoom
you get 10x optical well not really
optical but should we say there's a play
between software here to provide you
with 10x zoom apparently Apple is doing
something major with software here to
pull that off Apple is even teasing a
new portrait mode for the camera that we
won't be receiving when the phone
launches apparently that's a software
update in the future the whole idea here
is to get better shallow depth of field
with the iPhone and so if you won't
already be getting it with the F 1.8
aperture there's a lot coming with these
cameras and it's a major reason why I'm
looking forward to the larger iPhone 7
plus now even though the price points
remain the same we finally start at 32
gigs of storage thank you then the other
option is 128 gigs and 256 gigs if you
want the jet black color option it only
starts at 128 gigs which is okay you're
not forced to it but it leads me to the
question of this video what do you think
about these announcements are you
enticed for any of these iPhones because
in my case again
Szymon plus and even though I'm not too
excited about the Apple watch series - I
will be reviewing it and I will keep you
