pocketnow.com and we're really excited
to announce the availability of the
pocket now about come widget now
available through the windows
marketplace for mobile we are among the
very first web sites due to do a widget
like this which allows you to take our
content with you in your pocket and a
very mobile friendly formatted format so
let's take a look at how to get it it is
free so we're going to start off by
going to the marketplace and of course
all windows mobile 6.5 devices come with
the marketplace if you're running
windows mobile 6.1 we'll put a link in
pocketnow.com in this post on how to get
the marketplace for your device so to
start off we can either search for the
app or go through categories let's
search because that's a lot faster so
we're going to type pocketnow.com and
there it is right here and so we're
going to tap on the entry and see what
we have in in the description so it
gives you a little description on what
the widget actually does talks about the
features gives you a little screen shot
at the bottom and from here of course
you can install it right to your device
now let's take a look at how the widget
actually looks and how it functions but
real quick in case you want to get to it
through categories let me show you where
that is you go into categories we're
actually in the lifestyle category kind
of a strange placement but Microsoft has
their own save where your your
application or widget should go and then
we're in recreation I know again this is
kind of strange but here we are in case
you can't find us in the search we are
in recreation under the lifestyle
category so let's get out of this and
open up the widget it's already
installed on this device so here it is
up here and so the widget is split up
into two different tabs so the first on
the left is news and we can scroll
through the news and see what we've
posted and of course you can click on
any of these stories and because the the
widget is built off of web languages and
it's built on internet explorer mobile
you get flash video which is great
because we post a lot of videos so I'm
going to post on this or click on this
particular item planning a trip with
Google Maps mobile and we're going to go
to the top and wait for the video to
load there's going to be a video right
in a moment okay there's the video so
I'm going to tap play on the center and
then I'm going to make it full screen by
tapping and holding on the video so we
get a full screen experience with this
particular video ok there's the pocket
now intro I'm going to tap and hold and
go to go to full screen here we are
video fullscreen nice viewing experience
for our videos so let's get out of this
and also you can check out the reviews
that we've recently posted by tapping on
the reviews tab over here on the right
and we have HTC pure acer neo touch
windows mobile 6.5 professional and so
on and so forth so just a really pocket
friendly visually pleasing way to look
at pocketnow.com content while you're on
the go so big thanks to web information
systems also known as web is who makes
pocket informant and sauce other great
windows mobile and iphone applications
for developing the app and also a big
thanks to adam lane from pocketnow.com
for thinking of the concept and for
working with web is to make it come to
life that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
