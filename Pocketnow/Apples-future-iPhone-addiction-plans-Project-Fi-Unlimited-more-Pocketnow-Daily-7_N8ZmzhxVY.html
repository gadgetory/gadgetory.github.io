investing more in the United States and
making iPhones less addictive Sampson
continues to sweeten the pot with the
Galaxy S Aiden Galaxy Note II in the
United States and project fight
continues to get better and better as
Google introduces unique unlimited
approaches I'm Jaime Rivera and stay
warm everybody my flight got canceled
again today so it's gonna take me a bit
to get back to the studio this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals aveer in the market for
the Samsung Galaxy s8 or Galaxy Note 8
the company is sweetening the pot it's
not necessarily offering better price
tags but it is offering the AKG
over-the-ear headphones bundled with the
phones now obviously there are certain
conditions they have to meet you can
learn more about them in the description
and speaking of deals Google just made
project Phi better for everybody the
company is approaching unlimited data a
little different the way it goes is
you're not gonna pay more than $60.00
for data unlimited unless you want to
meeting you pay the $20 for five basics
$60 for data in case you get to over 6
gigabytes of data expenses and if you do
you have a limit up until 15 gigabytes
where after 15 games you can choose to
continue unlimited data with limited
data speeds or you can pay $10 a gig
after that so pretty much your project 5
bill will never go over $80 from that
you unless you want to and that makes it
really great in case you travel abroad
and you just don't want to pay for more
now start about Sony we heard that the
company is working on some eggs ePro
flagship that we should see at MWC and
the company has just made their event
official we can expect it to happen on
February 26 which is actually the first
day of MWC I'm hoping that that's not
the case or at least that Samsung
doesn't necessarily have their event on
the same date because the rumors were
that that was going to be the date but
stay tuned it could happen and for those
of you that are wondering what the
future of Motorola will be with their
smartphones all three of you because the
company has lost a lot of mine share
today we see the Moto X 5 the g6 the z3
in leaks most of the design changes are
pretty much just the removing
from the display but then the approach
of each of these smartphones is the same
one is a premium mid-range err what is
an entry-level phone with a great price
tag and the other as the modular phone
hopefully we'll get more information by
MWC but it's really hard to tell it's
interesting they were getting this
information so early stay tuned and
finally the very interesting news today
have to do with Apple and the company's
response to the recent tax cuts in the
United States the tax cuts have been
very infamous and they've garnered a lot
of controversy but Apple is approaching
this we should say in a very positive
way starting by a 350 billion dollar
investment in the United States over the
next five years meaning a new Reno
Nevada facility we're talking 20,000
jobs and the company just injecting
money into the economy which is exactly
what Apple should have done a long time
ago the company has been sitting on a
ton of money abroad and it hasn't
brought any benefits to the United
States more than just you know good
products even more interesting obviously
you've heard about the news back in
December over the shareholders
pressuring the company into making
smartphones less addictive the company
is going to work on this and apparently
that's going to be another approach for
the company in the future the question
would be for today what will you do to
make smartphones less addictive I mean
I've been pondering this question all
day like seriously what can the company
do it's not just iPhones really
applications are designed to obviously
also become more immersive with the
purpose of consumers consuming more
content in my case what I would do is
honestly work on children first I mean
it's great for an iPad and an iPhone to
be great tools for kids to play but the
problem is I would rather kids play with
other kids then play with a tablet or a
phone and then start working from there
more like the way I grew up as a
Generation X child but that would be my
approach leave us a comment down below
let us know what you would do
