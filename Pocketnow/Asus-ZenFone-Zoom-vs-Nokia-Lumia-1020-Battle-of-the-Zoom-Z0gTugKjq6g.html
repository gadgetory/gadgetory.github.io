gotten the one feature often lacking due
to space limitations is the ability to
zoom a soos made that the crown jewel
feature of the zenfone zoom utilizing
some interesting hardware to provide for
an optical zoom lens but how does it
stack up against a very different kind
of zoom camera phone it's time for a
showdown i'm juan carlos Pagnell for
PocketNow and here's our camera zoom
battle between the asus zenfone zoom and
the nokia lumia 1020
the criteria for this battle two phone
cameras that focus on zooming but which
don't bolt on telescoping lenses
protruding from the rear casing a soos
achieves this by using periscope style
prisms that slide lens elements
internally and this is why the actual
rear-facing lenses off-center on the
camera module nokia achieved their zoom
on the 1020 by utilizing a 2/3 inch
sensor with 41 million pixels allowing
users to crop away a lot of information
before degradation wrecks the image even
though the 1020 is several years old it
still stands as a high-water mark for
what manufacturers can do with software
pixel resampling as the asus does not
have an option for raw output we're
looking at the highest quality JPEGs
each phone can produce immediately for
the nokia we see a clear difference
between high res and low res output the
high res capture looks more like what we
might imagine a raw capture to look like
lower contrast lower saturation and
almost no sharpening applied to the
image the a su saves a more saturated
image which on first glance looks a bit
juicier is more ie pleasing but this
style of processing can often run into
issues like with the transition from the
green ground to the blue sky for editing
it's a lot more difficult pulling
saturation out of the Asus image than it
is to add a little more color to the
Nokia image for stills the one-third
inch sensor and the smaller F 2.7
maximum aperture of the Asus struggles
to keep up with the depth of field the
Lumia can produce objects in the
background of Asus photos are more
identifiable and the Lumias 2/3 inch
sensor produces a softer and prettier
blur to busy background looking at macro
shots at the wide end the Asus will get
you closer to your subject with a
minimum focusing distance around 2
inches the 1020 will force you to stand
a little farther away around 5 inches
from your subject but here's where we
start looking at zooming
viejas has a 3x optical zoom while the
Lumia 1020 shooting stills falls
somewhere around a 2.7 X digital crop
zoom for stills the trouble with
hardware zoom as lens elements are
shifted to change the focal length that
also changes your minimum focusing
distance and pushes the ASIS farther
away from the subject and closer to
around a foot from what you're trying to
focus on you will end up with a closer
final image than when shooting fully
wide but it won't provide that super
macro look of getting scientifically
close up to your subject the Lumia zooms
by cropping the image down to around a 5
megapixel capture but lens focal length
doesn't change that means your minimum
focusing distance stays about the same
and you're able to get significantly
closer to your subject though this will
result in a lower resolution image we
see similar performance moving the
longer shots and landscapes when not
pushing each camera to its minimum
focusing distance we see a perfectly
reasonable 5 megapixel capture from the
Lumia which is bested in terms of reach
by the ASIS when we account for
resolution maybe the fairest comparison
might be cropping the ASIS photo down to
a 5 megapixel image after zooming in and
here we see a pretty close battle moving
the video the Nokia is able to extend
its zoom range thanks to the lower
resolution of HD video providing an
almost 6 X digital zoom as video
normalizes the output to 1920 by 1080
there really aren't any situations where
the Zen phones hardware was able to
score a clear victory in daylight the
1020 is able to reach farther and the
camera produces a clearer image with
more detail
the Lumia also wins for low-light video
performance both cameras produce some
pretty ugly noise but the Lumia is
preserving more detail while also
maintaining a faster frame rate the Asus
Falls from 30 frames per second in
daylight to 20 frames per second at
night where the 1020 maintains 30 frames
per second throughout so where's that
leave us between the asus zenfone zoom
and the Nokia Lumia 1020 it's always fun
to go back and pick up a 1020 it was an
audacious camera experiment for having
shot on the latest crop of LG's and
Samsung's it's no longer an indomitable
camera the zenfone zooms solution is
undeniably techy cool but it comes with
some of the image compromises we used to
see an inexpensive point-and-shoot
camera zoom lenses what is a bit
disappointing is seeing how da su
struggles to compete against a
two-and-a-half-year-old dual-core Lumia
they trade blows for photo performance
especially when normalizing for
resolution though the sensor size
advantage on the 1020 can often produce
the more photographic image but for
video the 1020 scores clear victories
across the board if the Intel chipset in
the Asus have been capable of UHD video
capture with this Hardware zoom the
verdict might have been different
this is neat of a niche territory not
only phones built around their
respective cameras but the zoom action
on those cameras honestly there's room
for both solutions in this market at
1020 with a current generation
Snapdragon processor could be a
compelling content creation tool ditto
is n phone zoom with slightly clearer
optics ultimately I have to give the
overall win to the 1020 but every time I
pick up this phone I realize how much
better the overall photo and video
experience has gotten on devices like
the v10 note 5 in lumia 950 now we're
sure you have thoughts so let's hear
them in the comments below is there room
in the smartphone market for proper zoom
camera phones is Microsoft missing out
by not releasing an updated version of
the Lumia 1020 now let's see if we can
get into some fun debates as always
