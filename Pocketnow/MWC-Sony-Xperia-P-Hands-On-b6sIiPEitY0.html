from parking i'll calm and we've got
Tony here who's going to give us a quick
demo of the Xperia P which just got
announced at mwc tell me about it Toni
so this is Xperia P like you said we
just announced this one so it's a four
inch screen it has this great white
magic technology first time it comes
with a smartphone okay unique technology
that's twice as bright as a typical
conventional home okay and it's also
power efficient in the same time okay
can you show me an idea of how of how
the white magic works well to really
show the difference I think you need to
compare with I think you need to
actually compare it with a different
computer phone okay let's try that yeah
how about if we get out let's see we've
got an iphone for us here yep let's see
how that looks so about that yeah that's
okay we need to prepare the same thing
though okay what can we compare here
if you noticed by the comparison the
sizes between the 4s and the Sony Xperia
P is is quite good i mean the screens
obviously the experiment is a much
larger screen but they're not thicker
than each other i mean it's actually a
very good difference because it's it's
just this thing the profile is just this
thin only a bit taller but then the
screen which is which matt would matter
to everybody has the same size now let's
try to compare with something let's see
a picture pictures this is kind of a
difficult one now there's a sorry i
picture
let's try the wallpapers I'll just here
we go
let me see about where this we are
flower let's see you have a flower there
okay yeah greens are definitely greener
whites are definitely wider very good
screen indeed now tell me more about the
phone aside from the screen what else we
got here it's a jewel core phone yeah so
that makes it obviously very fast to
interact with it has an 8-megapixel
camera okay chewing exmor r okay so the
ex mara will enable you to take great
pictures in low-light conditions love
that red very nice thank you okay this
is a metallic bag right this is a
genuine aluminium ok also it's crafted
with position oh maybe that perfect fit
in the hand okay and make you feel that
premium feeling interesting what else we
have the transparent element so they can
iconic design the web for the xperia
next series here you see okay so it
lights up those are those are capacitive
buttons right yes so you can touch down
you see we touched the homescreen sorry
interesting yeah if we go into settings
or if we just go in to camera mode and
if we press back here we'll go back home
back in home screen interesting okay do
we have which version of your sony UI is
this or is it the same version that we
already know this is this is launching
on gingerbread so it's the same version
you know okay we're in short after the
launch we will be make it upgradeable to
ice cream sandwich okay you don't have
no dates for ice cream sandwich we did a
couple of weeks Oh within a couple of
weeks that's a good number okay well
aside from that let me just hold the
phone just a little bit very light very
thin but you know it's not it's not a
cheap light it's actually a very hefty
light really
really good thinness love the curve back
also well thank you very much for the
preview can we preview the dark by any
chance or how the dark works the doc you
can preview there you have you have a
real demo okay so and and now so we do
can actually give you a great
opportunity to see our works but okay I
can just quickly tell you so the unique
with this one is we don't have any caps
on this one okay basically come home
take it out from a pocket talking into
the station okay on the screen will
appear a TV launcher okay which actually
is a UI then specifically for our
experience okay making it really
accessible for the end users you can sit
in a sofa have Experian this mod talk
okay and you can browse through the
navigation with just your remote control
okay now tell me something how about
that that token with the NFC token yeah
how does that work the NFC token there
is a specific token for everything you
want to do or there's only one token
that you program how does that work
there's four different tokens and or
different tokens for different targets
and there's four different color
something each token is preloaded to
actually do something okay that's
something that you can that you can
choose what you want it to do yourself
okay ID is you personalize the token for
you so the AFC tax is something that you
say okay I want to go out running so I
just touched the NFC tag and then okay
my application my running application of
the start it will turn off Wi-Fi it was
no cute phone on you
and it will enable the music player two
starts okay then you're ready to go when
you're wrong interesting interesting you
can program that as much as you want yes
are the tokens you have to buy the
tokens or that are included with the
phone the tokens so you have to buy okay
no interesting well Tony thank you very
much for the preview really appreciated
hime every data again from pocket now
