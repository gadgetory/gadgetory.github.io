generation pure Android device but it's
only the second time the company has
offered the Android experience on
Hardware built explicitly to be
affordable
it was predated in this effort by last
year's Nexus 4 and we've brought the two
together to answer the only logical
question what do you actually get when
you upgrade from the Nexus 4 to the
Nexus 5 and is it worth the extra
three-fitty to do it let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
and this is Google Nexus 5 versus Google
Nexus 4 sometimes it's tough to know
where to start with these comparisons
but fortunately our Nexus 4 does it for
us the cracked back panel on our review
unit is a testament not just to our
clumsiness but to this device's
fragility an all-glass smartphone is a
beautiful thing to look at but it's not
gonna hold up as well to abuse no matter
how rigid the glass is the Nexus 5 takes
advantage of that learning experience
from the for its face is still glass
with Gorilla Glass 3 this time but the
back and sides are now cast from a
material Google's VP of Android design
Matias Duarte calls hardcore plastic
it's glossy on the sides and soft touch
on the back and the change in materials
means the Nexus 5 is about 10 grams less
massive than its predecessor all that
combines to produce a device that's
definitely more modern looking but which
doesn't feature the heft or the subtle
glitz of the Nexus 4 still we have to
say that we like the new phones somewhat
faster look especially next to the more
compact Nexus 4
speaking of fast the spec sheet
comparison has more good news for
would-be upgraders the Nexus 5 packs a
Snapdragon 800 processor a 2.3 gigahertz
SOC that flattens the Nexus 4 is older
s4 pro even more important for some is
the Nexus 5's inclusion of LTE support
an omission that instantly rendered last
year's device a second-class citizen for
many living in 4G cities the 5 also
brings a 32 gig storage option useful
for those who've loaded up with media
especially video content the Nexus 5
screen is only a third of an inch larger
than its forerunners but it looks much
bigger thanks to the new transparent
home keys and notification area in
Android 4.4 side visibility isn't quite
as good and the panel is a bit warmer on
the newer phone but those small
sacrifices are worth it when you
consider the resolution bump here
elsewhere the hardware load is
comparable but the Nexus 5 also brings
something called a Hall effect sensor
basically a magnetic proximity switch
used by accessories like Smart Covers so
we'll look forward to seeing what comes
out of that the Nexus 4 will get the
latest version of Android 4.4 KitKat
soon but it won't receive the same
launcher as the Nexus 5 according to
Google at least not right away that
means that the new quick jump into
Google Voice Search and quick swipe left
into Google now are exclusive to the
Nexus 5 for now otherwise most of the
KitKat software features should make the
jump to the Nexus 4 soon see our other
comparisons and our forthcoming full
Nexus 5 review for details and follow
PocketNow on social media and here on
YouTube so you don't miss it
after a few comparison videos this week
showing how inconsistent the Nexus 5's
camera experience can be what a relief
to use it next to the Nexus 4 both are 8
megapixel shooters but every single
photo we take comes out world's better
on the Nexus 5 shots are less noisy more
crisp
more colorful you really get a sense
with the Nexus 5 that LG and Google were
consciously trying to overcome the Nexus
lines reputation for poor optical
performance the image stabilization and
the newer phone is Hardware based and it
helps a bit with low-light photos and
even the front-facing camera is worlds
ahead of the unit on the older device
and video performance is predictably
better as well know how the
stabilization is I'm kind of walking
around should be smoothing that out and
the colors should once again Michael
Fisher with pocket now full review
features and comparisons of the LG Nexus
5 coming very very shortly in other
areas improvements are more subtle or
the devices stay on even footing callers
couldn't agree on which phone made us
sound better on our end voice calls were
more enjoyable on the Nexus 5 because of
some low digital noise in the earpiece
and our Nexus 4 speakerphone performance
on each is pretty horrendous
unfortunately the Nexus 5 is bottom
mounted speaker is slightly more
convenient than the AFT firing port on
the Nexus 4 and the Nexus 5's unit is a
little bass here but they're both so
lackluster it's hard to call it an
improvement you'll want to take calls on
your ear and use headphones for your
media playback
fortunately audio sounds quite good
through the 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack on both units
sometimes a smartphone upgrade is so
iterative so minor that the wiser choice
for your wits and your wallet is just to
pass it up to stay happy with what
you've got
and wait for the next upgrade that's not
the case here folks the Nexus 5 improves
on the Nexus 4 in every important sense
and it still retains the
bargain-basement pricing that blew our
faces off back in 2012 if you're a nexus
4 owner with money to spend and you're
on the fence about taking the plunge
just stop waffling do it if you're like
us the Nexus 5 will make you happy in
all the ways the Nexus 4 couldn't and
that's pretty much all you can ask for
in a smart phone upgrade isn't it hey
hey hey hey hey wait a second you're
saying what about battery life what
about performance metrics what about all
the detail that usually goes into a
review well this is not a review this
was a comparison video our third this
week go and check out the other two here
on YouTube our full review of the Nexus
5 is coming and it'll be available at
pocketnow.com and of course here on our
youtube channel page just as soon as we
