october twenty second event HTC is
already working on giving us an
octa-core processor their own way and
believe it or not android celebrates its
fifth birthday I'm hai meri beta and I
wonder when OEMs will get the point we
need Arthur core battery is not
octa-core anything else this is
out daily listeners day off with some
official news as Samsung is now
announced their new ISO self-censor for
smartphone cameras and apparently the
reason why this is better than BSI
sensors is because it allows thirty
percent better color accuracy than what
we currently get in certain cameras in
the market which we usually call washed
out among other things Samson plans to
be deploying this technology very soon
hopefully in the next galaxy lineup
probably next year and we wonder if
other OEMs will also jump in the wagon
as you know Samsung sells everything and
this is obviously a new variation to the
current Sony sensors that are pretty
much blocking the market now let's move
over to a company that's famous for
their camera technology as nokia has now
been teasing their october twenty second
event and this is where we expect their
Lumia 1520 phablet to be announced among
other probable smartphones like the
Lumia 929 that we've seen for verizon
but in an even more interesting note
Microsoft has also begun teasing their
windows phone 8.1 software and within
that you'll notice that there is no
portion of the device that says Nokia
everything says Lumia and just Lumia and
it even has the windows logo with loopy
on the side and no Nokia anywhere to be
seen so it is interesting to see what we
will get this october twenty second
event and hopefully it does involve
nokia now a company that is not at all
famous for their camera technology as
motorola and such as the case of the
Moto X where we have confirmed in our
review the photos look washed out and
just terrible but finally the company is
working hard on fixing this up to the
point where they just launch the
software update to fix this problem man
we've got some samples that look amazing
just like every sample from every camera
out there until we actually review it
but anyway stay tuned for this update
apparently it will reach the mobile
customers first let's wonder when the
rest of the carriers will get it as well
now a company that is apparently still
doing bad right
as HTC up to the point where the company
is already predicting losses for their
next quarter results because apparently
they're dealing with more shortages when
it comes to supply is the same story
that we've heard all year with their HTC
One lineup which is really interesting
but even more interesting is the fact
that even though this company is having
supply issues it's already being rumored
to be working on an HTC one with an
octa-core processor and three gigs of
ram there are leaked screenshots of this
phone already in the wild so no supplies
new octa-core processor why don't we get
an octa-core battery while they're at it
and finally for the hot news of the day
yes android turns five years old today
it seems like if it were yesterday when
Sergei Brent came on this YouTube video
then shower didn't even comb his hair
and told us about the whole Android
project that they were working on which
eventually changed because initially it
was more like a blackberry style phone
that changed when the iphone was
launched and pretty much delayed the
whole project almost the full year
people back then were really skeptical
of Android and it eventually became the
driving force of the mobile industry up
to the point where we have a
refrigerator that runs android and gives
you the twitter feed and just about
everything so make sure you retailer
barns full editorial on the whole
evolution of android and everything that
changed over the last five years and
that leads you to a couple of questions
to you today which was the device that
you were using in 2008 what is your
current smartphone and what was your
first android smartphone if any in my
particular case back in 2008 I was
rocking a motorola q 9h from AT&amp;amp;T my
first android phone was a nexus one and
my current smartphone is an LG g2 leave
us a comment down below we really like
to see what devices you use before what
devices you have now and what you think
of android over the years friends as
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone in town world but she follow
us on PocketNow comment subscribe to our
youtube channel as well he also follow
