this is the new iPad and it's running a
beta build of iOS 6 which includes
support for Siri previously only
available on Apple's iPhone we're gonna
take it for a spin on the iPad see how
useful it is on a tablet and then we're
gonna have a little talk off between it
and the Samsung Galaxy s3 is s voice
let's jump in hi Mei is gonna do a full
review on iOS 6 in a forthcoming video
but what we want to answer here with
this video is how useful is Siri on the
iPad that is how useful is voice control
on a tablet judging from Apple's recent
ad spending on Siri it's clear that they
see it as more than just a hobby so
let's dive in and check it out now Siri
on the iPad is a lot like Siri on the
iPhone on initial launch you're given
the small dialog box containing examples
of what you can say to Siri after that
first use just a long press on the home
button will suffice to call her up she's
been optimized for iPad using only a
little pop over window here instead of
the whole screen let's try a little bit
of classic functionality wake me up
tomorrow at 7 a.m.
do I need an umbrella so there we have a
little bit of a bug that I'm gonna go
into in more detail later do I need an
umbrella what are the colors of the
visible spectrum a lot of information
there from WolframAlpha about the
visible spectrum a lot of information
what's Facebook's stock price now
despite the samuel l.jackson Apple
commercials airing every three minutes
on TV Siri doesn't know what gazpacho is
how do I make a swatch oh but she does
know how to take a break pretty well you
can take the night off
so Siri seems to do pretty well on the
iPad in iOS 6 with its classic
functionality installed but what about
some of her new features so the new Siri
has a lot built in she can tell us
sports scores make us dinner
reservations find us movies to watch
open apps and tweet for us let's give
some of that a shot
what was the score of the last Celtics
game no that's a sad update when's the
next Red Sox game I want to find a
restaurant with outdoor seating I want
to reserve a table 7:00 p.m.
tapping make reservation will jump you
right into open table obviously I don't
have that installed quite yet let's go
back to something else
where is Prometheus playing
checking for movies matching prometheus
okay here's Prometheus playing nearby I
want to see a movie with Christian Bale
that's pretty cool who directed the Dark
Knight Rises
even cooler who directed American Psycho
American Psycho alright so you have to
tap just tell her which one you're
talking about Thank You Siri that's
pretty awesome so that's pretty cool
but don't let Siri fool you she's still
pretty limited Apple's only adding one
category of new abilities at a time so
who wrote the book American Psycho see
womp womp okay that's enough of that
let's see if we can launch some apps
spoiler alert she's really good at this
open Facebook
open Twitter open Safari open binary mag
lock
open pad Belgium I haven't gotten Siri
to fail at launching an app once even
with my geeky array of weird third-party
apps let's try some social media tweet
I'm dying for some mozzarella sticks
comma period any delivery volunteers
question mark send all right let's
update Facebook update Facebook this
status update won't make any sense until
this video comes out period post
okay I posted it that brings me to
another useful feature dictation
sometimes it's easier to talk than it is
to type I've used dictation software to
write quick notes or catalog long lists
of items but what about emails as you
can see there there's not any
punctuation so you still have to call
out every specific piece of punctuation
there is as you can see comma you still
need to tell the software where to put
your punctuation period but even though
it sounds awkward to the ear the end
result is pretty excellent exclamation
point so as I mentioned this is a beta
build of iOS 6 and Siri is not
delivering perfect results just yet for
example Siri seems to try hard to link
your current request to your previous
one and the results aren't always great
here let me tell Siri I want to see some
Theatre in Boston I want to see theater
in Boston now the results right now the
results are gonna be movie theaters
which you know hurts my little actor
heart I was looking for a legitimate
theater but movies are what most people
will be searching for I get it
nobody sees theater the problem comes
when you drop a non-sequitur bomb on
Siri let's say I don't want to go to
either of these movie theaters let's say
I want to eat first watch this
I'm hungry
see so it's trying to link my current
request with the previous one and it's
actually found me a movie called I'm
hungry but not any restaurant listings
so to get there I have to leave Siri and
then relaunch it which is what you saw
me doing before I'm hungry okay so she's
not perfect but let's see how she
measures up against the new kid on the
block Samsung's s voice on the galaxy s3
now both these devices are on Wi-Fi so
let's see how they do we'll stick to
stuff available in the first version of
Siri since we know s voice won't be able
to give us sports scores or anything
like that here we go
open camera
okay s voice is a little slower there
this is difficult because the devices
will pick up on each other's beats so
it's not the easiest test environment
what is Facebook's
stock price okay so Siri had finished
giving me all the information I wanted
before s voice had even opened the
browser at least s voice did that who
was the first man on the moon
okay so we've got all the information
available on the Armstrong over here on
the iPad and there's s voice coming back
with it okay
so you can get the same information just
at a slightly different speed if you're
having a rough night at trivia let's try
this again let's try something else here
the last thing what's the weather like
today Sirius just flying now that's nice
s voice gives us a little bit more
detailed information even though it took
longer to even recognize what I asked it
then Siri did so over just about a day
of use I've found s voice to be slower
and prone to more bugs than even the
beta version of Siri Siri does have her
own bugs but the additional usefulness
she brings to the table counters that
makes me prefer her over s voice so will
you use Siri now that it's come to the
iPad as usual I can't answer that
question for you some of you will use it
every day
others will dismiss it as a novelty item
for me I tend to think the more input
methods the better sometimes I don't
want to shuffle through my recently used
apps list to launch Netflix I just want
to tell the iPad open Netflix
and often I prefer dictating my tweets
and texts rather than typing them so
will I use Siri on the iPad absolutely
and you can be sure I'll be using it a
whole lot more often than I'm using s
voice currently we've got feature
articles and videos on s voice Siri iOS
6 and pretty much anything else you can
think of at pocketnow.com visit us there
leave a comment on this post if you have
something to add to the discussion give
us a thumbs up here on youtube if you
like what you saw be sure and follow us
on twitter pocket now tweets for pocket
now official account and captain two
phones for me till then stay tuned it'll
be another video coming up soon we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
