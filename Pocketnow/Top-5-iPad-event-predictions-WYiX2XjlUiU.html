for apples October events which is
probably the last event of the year so
there are a lot of things we predicted
especially iPad so I'm hi Natalie that
up this is pocket now and these are top
five predictions of what to expect for
apples october twenty second event
number five is some minor enhancements
to iOS probably iOS 7.1 or seven point
oh something mainly the reason why is
because a lot of people are complaining
of reboots on the iphone 5s which i am
actually having that on with my unit so
it could be that Apple is going to deal
with those tweaks but other than that we
do see that iOS 7 is not really prepared
for the iPad we set it in our previous
hands-on videos it does seem like if
everything is kind of bloated even on
Apple's own applications and it just
seems that Apple did not enhance iOS
necessarily for the iPad and mainly for
the iphone so we expect iOS 7 to grow up
a little bit in this event and probably
focus more on how to take advantage of
the extra canvas of the iPad though
obviously this could just be up in the
air number four is some apple TV
enhancements and even though we don't
really cover the Apple TV here at pocket
now it is one of the best accessories
for the iPad and the iphone as well so
we are expecting Apple to bring up a new
generation Apple TV and we've even seen
some leaks of amazon already teasing
that this will happen so probably we're
not just expecting a software update we
are expecting a new device to be
announced and the question is exactly
how does the apple TV plan to compete
with the chromecast at just 35 bucks for
a unit that you currently pay a hundred
dollars for obviously a lot is in steak
and a lot of competition is instinct so
Apple really needs to raise the bar here
and let's see what we get with this new
iOS accessory number three is a new iPad
Mini but this is probably going to be
just an incremental upgrade we do expect
apple to keep the same design because
there's obviously cycle 2 now obviously
we are kind of conflicted as to what to
expect some links say we got to write a
display some leaked say we don't some
leaks say we get touch ID some lakes say
we don't and then we have the iphone 5c
which is the budget iPhone without touch
ID so we really don't know what to make
of apple's ipad mini 2 or whatever
they're going to dub it because we were
kind of disappointed with the first
generation ipad mini up to the point
where a lot of people did
really buy this product or just focus on
buying it for their kids and not really
as the high-end product that Apple
envisioned it to be so hopefully this is
not going to be the budget iPad we'll
see what happens but obviously the ipad
2 must go away right now so we'll see
how that plays out in the end number two
we're expecting a new iPad and we still
don't know we should call this the ipad
5 or a new ipad but we are expecting
Apple to set the bar with this tablet
but obviously that has to go beyond just
the design of the ipad mini on a blow to
chassis or touch ID which is another
rumor we are expecting that a 7 64 bit
processor to make it to the ipad 5 but
the question is will it really be able
to do more for the ipad 5 and just be a
gimmick as we've kind of seen on the
iphone 5s we're expecting it to probably
allow more professional applications and
hopefully more ram because in the case
of the iphone 5s you don't really get to
do lunch and applications really don't
seem different on the iphone 5 or in the
5s so hopefully the ipad 5
differentiates with this processor in
some way because obviously windows
tablets aren't really popular right now
but they will be in the future with
Windows 8.1 so iPads have a lot of stake
right now they have to grow up into
being more than just an extended version
of the smartphone and hopefully that
will be the case for this iPad 5 though
let's see what we get and our top number
one prediction for what to expect for
apple's october twenty second events is
one more thing and sadly we don't know
what that one more thing is we've got
rumors of an iWatch we've got so many
rumors of even an Apple TV you know an
actual TV that could be announced though
we still don't know exactly what we're
going to get at this event that could be
new Tim Cook has really not been famous
for a one more thing deal like Steve
Jobs was but Apple really needs to show
us something much better something
ground changing a new product because a
lot of people have been disappointed
with their 2013 lineup the so has been
shown in the stock price so that means
you do the question of this top five
what do you believe will be that one
more thing in my particular case
honestly I do believe that if we're not
getting a SmartWatch we'll probably at
least get a teaser what Apple is
planning to launch hopefully in early
2014 but sadly that's not like Apple
other people pretty
that'll be the Apple TV and that the
small set-top box will grow up but leave
