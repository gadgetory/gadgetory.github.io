really hurt ouch you want to give it a
try why do you talk so fast it's
pointless and why do you listen so slow
it's pointless to please check out my
channel it's called private geeks uh you
sure it's safe that's right it's that
time of the week I am hi I'm every bit
of this is pocket now and this is our
pocket now daily recap for last week so
on Monday ask you what do you think
Samsung would do with their new patent
they had just patented this new iris
scanning technology and obviously with
the whole touch ID thing this is kind of
popular and well we have 20 61 comments
out of which and says iris scanner from
Samsung this leaves only a blood test or
option for Sony ouch yeah that's right
up next would be toast canning probably
that bill says companies are getting
creepy and you're right but sadly if you
want more focus security that's pretty
much the only way to go then Shawn
Nicholson says the iris scanner might
work one time in 100 depending heavily
on lighting and you're right my biggest
problem with samsung is that they bring
out a ton of features and most of these
are gimmicky because they don't always
work right and I'm not going to say that
touch ID is perfect on the iPhone but it
works ninety percent of the time which
is actually good so on tuesday i asked
you if you would still be interested in
the wooden moto x's the company had
finally launched it but with a hundred
dollars extra premium and obviously only
one color option and then you would have
to wait two weeks for it and we have 744
comments most of these were birthday
wishes guys thank you very much for your
best wishes one of them says no not for
this if it comes in carbon fiber yes
sure it will there are a lot of carbon
fiber looking cases out there but no
then what King gaudiya says I'm curious
to see how water is going to affect the
wood and you're right a lot of us are
actually concerned about this but there
is a coating there is a special coating
that's being used for this phone we just
don't know exactly how it'll withstand
time obviously if we do get a review
unit of this slowly we'll get back to
you on that one then sam says
considering the fact that it's a hundred
dollars more and i have to wait
basically a month i would rather pick up
the regular moto x for the same specs
and that's really the point i would be
happy to pay a hundred extra dollars for
a stamp targeting hundred version of the
moto x or one with a better camera i
would even pay a hundred dollars for the
wood fine but if it gave me more
specifications the wood alone is not
really a good point for me i would
rather buy another phone
or the Moto X and any color option right
now then on Wednesday ask you if you
would be interested in buying a pebble
smartwatch now that the company has just
announced their new app store we have
161 comments out of which I'm fellow
says not really if anything the pebble
being in the market for so long actually
inhibits my print purchase who knows
when they'll announce the pebble too and
that's really a good point out there
actually bought the pebble kind of
skeptical because yeah the pebble to
could probably be around the corner we
don't really know so we'll keep you
posted on that one then Andrea says I'm
waiting for the vibe from vibe gear I
don't really need a watch and you know
the vine is a really interesting product
I like the pebble because I get alerts
on it and I don't have to pull the phone
out of my pocket and the vibe is
interesting because for 23 bucks you
could pretty much get the same
functionality the difference is you'll
still have to pull out the damn phone
because you won't know exactly what
you're getting so again you get what you
pay for then camshaft says I don't see
the point of the SmartWatch my normal
watch cost me fifty dollars and it works
fine and what I need to see the time I
look at my phone for the longest time I
felt this way as well and the cool thing
about the pebble is not really that you
get alerts but the fact that you don't
really need to pull your phone out of
your pocket there are times specifically
in this country where there's a lot of
theft were I don't want to be pulling my
phone out everywhere where I'm driving
for example so it's really cool I get an
alert I look at my watch and if it's
important that I'll pull out my phone
pull over or whatever and if it's not
and I'll just let it be that's really
the cool thing about a SmartWatch then
on Thursday I asked you what is your
favorite custom rom obviously on Android
because there's where that cyanogenmod
adjust rates 22 million dollars in order
to double its size we have 84 comments
which is odd google+ comments are just
crazy sometimes you see 150 then we at
least expect the EC seven hundred and I
really don't understand why but Angela
says silent did modest King and I have
to agree with you but I've honestly
never tried any other rom cyanogenmod is
really the only one that I've tried and
I really do enjoy it specifically
because of its stability and the fact
that i could just update it immediately
from the rom itself and the fact that i
do like stock android and i feel that
they do an amazing job but that's just
my opinion and i see that a lot of
people agree with you then inspire HD
which i really loved that phone says my
favorite rom is paranoid android
although i do like CM as well and
paranoid andrew
probably one of the coolest ones i
haven't really tried it again but it's
cool that you have the option of
actually using the screen real estate of
your phone for more than just one thing
so yeah that's a really good option then
John Dee says I like cyanogenmod on my
galaxy s4 but there is a problem with
the default camera application and the
biggest problem with customers roms is
really that they sometimes make your
phone better and sometimes they really
don't and that's really the problem
about the developer community a lot of
it is you know half-baked and a lot of
it is really cool and then friday i
asked you what smartphone were using
back in 2007-2008 because the news work
this android engineer that had just come
on record to state how much the launch
of the original iphone influence android
as it was they pretty much ditch the
phone that they were working on and then
that up rolling as the g1 so we have 603
comments out of which budget let says i
was using a palm treo man probably one
of the phones that i enjoyed the most
the palm treo I missed that phone so
much and I'm not gonna lie to you I did
like palm OS with my favorite one was
the 750 where they brought windows
mobile arms where I think that that was
the best implementation of Windows
Mobile of all time but Colin says I was
using a nokia 1200 I know it was
horrible and I wanted a blackberry and
you know a lot of us back then wanted a
blackberry I was going crazy over the
blackberry pearl and I honestly like the
phone a lot because I had to use two
phones and I love the fact that that
phone was really small and I did get a
really snappy blackberry experience up
to the point when they made that
software upgrade just totally trashed it
then another commoner says I was using a
nokia 3310 i bet that thing is still
alive and later upgraded to an HTC hd2
and yes the hd2 was probably one of the
best smartphones of all time hands down
not just compared to whatever is right
now or in the past I love that phone a
lot of us love that phone the only
reason why was a prominent was because
it wasn't really available in every
market here in my country didn't have 3g
and that's really the reason why i kept
away from that phone but if they ever
made a second variant or meaning the new
revamp of the hd2 i would be willing to
pay for it thats it for our daily recap
