to deny that even though today's
smartphones are very capable products
they aren't really smart about learning
more about its user next fit is a new
smartphone company that intends to
change that and we were recently invited
to learn more I'm high memory better
with pocket now here at CTIA in Las
Vegas and let's talk about the next fit
Robin
next bid has already garnered a lot of
fame for a ton of reasons over the last
couple of weeks to start its leadership
team is composed by some of the genius
and minds that made Android what it is
today
and that made HTC famous for design as
well second is the fact that the
company's next bit robin kickstarter
campaign became a raging hit in just a
few minutes but even more because the
company has come up with a smarter
approach to how android should feed on
its own the next bit Robin is one of the
boldest smartphone designs that we've
seen in years
it's polycarbonate finish on the edges
and metallic back give it a very
pleasant feel in the hand the sharp
corners are extremely elegant at first
sight this squared finish then comes in
contrast with the circular accents all
over the device giving it a very
futuristic look all around from the
round finish of the circular front
firing stereo speakers to the accent on
the side buttons it's really hard for
this film to not turn a couple of heads
at first glance when it comes to
specifications we have a 5.2 inch 1080p
IPS LCD powered by a Snapdragon 808
hexa-core processor 3 gigs of RAM and 32
gigs of storage that's matched by a
hundred gigabytes of next vid cloud
storage we have a 13 megapixel face
detection camera with dual tone flash a
5-megapixel selfie shooter and then the
usual LTE support with addition to Wi-Fi
a total of an AC a 2680 milliamp hour
battery and even a side mounted
fingerprint scanner on the power button
now with its powerful hardware and great
design and even more important story
lies in its software given the fact that
the hardware is still at a very early
stage we received the glimpse of it on a
nexus and its speed and fluidity are
just part of the story it does seem like
stock Android marshmallow at first
glance but this particular software
package is meant to be unique and that
it works together with the next fill out
storage the software was designed to
learn from its user in every way and its
first iteration will focus on storage
management whenever you run out of
storage the device will suddenly notice
which applications you use least and
then gray them out this process
uninstalls the application but leaves
the grey icon of the application
and all your data for the application
remains as well if you ever need the
application again you simply tap on the
grey button and it will simply reinstall
the application and return it to its
exact previous state just like if you've
had it on the phone all along this
feature alone is genius and probably one
of the things that everybody would like
to see on Android because while storage
is definitely a problem for those of you
that want to enhance your experience and
really don't want a hassle with the fact
that you want to manage what things you
keep on the phone and what things you
don't the same goes for your photos and
other information that you rarely access
but again this is just the beginning
next bit is also working on future ways
to make the phone smarter by learning
from your user scenarios this is
definitely one of the oldest approaches
to a smart phone that we've seen in
years and we cannot wait to have this
particular product for review we've got
a ton of coverage coming from CTIA in
Las Vegas so make sure you follow us on
social media subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well you can follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore Iveta on
instagram @ high memory beta please give
this video thumbs up if you like what
you saw
I am Jaime better thank you very much
for watching we'll see you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
