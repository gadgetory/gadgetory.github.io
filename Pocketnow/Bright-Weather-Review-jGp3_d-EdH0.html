for your Android smartphone we'll look
no further I obtained their Martin this
is PocketNow and this is our review of
bright weather suffice it to say weather
apps are a dime a dozen any old weather
app can display the current conditions
and provide you with a forecast but not
every app does so while looking great
that's where level up Studio creator of
mobile apps like plume and beautiful
widgets comes into play level up release
bright weather for Android back in May
it's a feature packed yet minimalist
weather application that's simply
gorgeous we really love that bright
weather requires no setup whatsoever
simply install it run the application
and you have your local weather at your
fingertips when you first open the
application you're met with a large
display of the current conditions in
your current location tapping the
temperature will launch the Weather
Underground website for even more
information but we don't know why you'd
want to leave the app below the current
conditions display is a chart displaying
the projected temperature over the next
24 hours or so tapping on this chart
will reveal a translucent bar with the
probability of precipitation to the
right of this main page is where you can
get a little more information like what
it actually feels like outside wind
speed and direction a precipitation
timeline sunrise and sunset and a 6 day
forecast when you tap on the
precipitation timeline it will expand to
show the temperature projections from
the previous screen and tapping any of
the days in the forecast section will
provide a short text description of the
forecast for that day one more page to
the right is even more information like
radar with overlays for different types
of precipitation cloud coverage
temperature and winds it also provides
average and record highs and lows for
each day UV index moon phase and finally
a link to the description of the being
picture of the day yes the default
background is updated daily with beings
picture of the day and it's blurred in a
mosaic manner you can however set your
own background picture from the photos
stored on your device or you can keep
bright weather synced with your existing
homescreen wallpaper and that's one
feature we really like about this app if
you choose that option and use mosaic
our homescreen live wallpaper the
background and bright weather is
constantly updated however quickly you
want with pictures from all over the web
if
you use mousse a you can double tap to
unblurred pictures to food from any of
the three main pages you can simply pull
down to force a refresh the location
drop down in the middle supports your
current location and all other locations
you've saved the camera button in the
upper left corner takes you to an
integrated viewfinder with the current
conditions and forecast overlay you can
snap a picture and share it with your
friends which is pretty cool the
settings button has been in the upper
right corner of the three main screens
there you can tweak temperature and
measurement units refresh interval
change the background image source and
toggle notifications you can have four
persistent notification in your status
bar and notification shade with your
location of choice but the unique
feature here is the ability to setup
smart notifications for various
conditions for instance you can get a
notification when the temperature hits a
freezing point or simply what the
weekend weather will be like you can
create and customize these notifications
to your heart's desire there are also
two rather pretty widgets that come
bundled with bright weather one that
includes a clock bright weather is a
very beautiful application unlike many
other weather apps it's laid out in a
manner that's simple to digest easy to
read and it's just plain easy on the
eyes the fact that we can use our
favorite live wallpaper musei with it is
a huge plus so is the fact that it's
free
but it is ad supported so to remove the
ads you'll have to COFF up to 79 frankly
we think it's a fair price for such a
beautiful weather app that has
everything most users will ever need
