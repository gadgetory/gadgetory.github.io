phones better suited for a comparison
with LG's latest curvaceous phablet
phones with truly massive footprints
like the HTC One Maxx Samsung Galaxy
mega or Nokia Lumia 1520 but that's not
what people are searching for people
want to know how the G flex stacks up
against what many see as the crown jewel
of the phablet world Samsung's Galaxy
Note 3 and who are we to argue with the
masses some might call that SEO
optimization others might call it gaming
the system we call it giving the viewers
what they want I'm Michael Fisher this
is PocketNow and this is LG G flex
versus Samsung Galaxy Note 3 they're not
Apple products but each of these big
devices is thinking different in its own
way we'll get to the obvious thing in a
minute but first let's talk materials
the note 3 breaks from samsung's
traditional glossy glazed plastic with a
soft faux leather back cover rimmed with
stitching and augmented with pretty nice
imitation metal a combination we praised
in our full galaxy note 3 review by
contrast the G flex sticks to a shiny
very slippery plastic that holds onto
dust with a mysterious static like force
this is a material choice we don't
especially like but it carries a hidden
benefit a urethane like coating capable
of healing minor scratches automatically
this is a first of its kind innovation
in mobile and for more detail check out
our G flex self-healing video here on
our channel page and then subscribe to
pocket now where we tube tweet and text
so you don't miss future videos
enough dancing around let's get to the
real hardware difference here with a
note three lies as flat on a table as
nearly any other modern smartphone the G
flex doesn't that's thanks to the 700
millimeter radius curve LG built into
the hardware a curve that sweeps from
top to bottom and makes the act of using
the phone quite distinctive from talking
to texting to pocketing combined with
the rear mounted power volume keys and
the massive curved six inch display it
makes the G flex stand out a bit more
and it also goes a little ways toward
compensating for its larger footprint
while neither of these is a small phone
the note 3 is definitely the easier
device to use one-handed thanks to its
smaller display note that that's smaller
not small the note 3 screen is a 5.7
inch Super AMOLED panel at 1080p
resolution an excellent display with an
embedded Wacom digitizer to service the
S Pen Stylus the G flexes P OLED panel
is larger at 6 inches but it steps down
to 720p to accommodate the curve and to
preserve an RGB stripe sub pixel
arrangement that's a hefty drop in
pixels per inch and the whites aren't
nearly as clean on the LG device now
will ordinary folks notice the G flex
handicap without putting these phones
side-by-side probably not it's a lovely
display standing alone and it's curved
construction makes video and gaming a
bit more immersive than the Notes flat
panel but in raw specs if you care
the flexes screen is definitely the
loser in this comparison elsewhere in
specs the devices are more evenly
matched they pack the same Snapdragon
800 chipset with the same GPU and the
same 32 gigs of storage or 64 on the
note 3 if you're a baller battery
capacity is similar as well the note 3
though edges out the G flex on the spec
sheet with those traditional Samsung
value-adds
it's battery is removable users can
augment its on-board storage with an
optional micro SD card and it packs 50%
more RAM
that makes the note 3 the more versatile
choice for the truly hardcore power user
or the person who just wants to brag
more and much as those power users might
hate to admit it leveraging the awesome
hardware of these devices out of the box
requires a third party UI stock Android
may be cleaner and more responsive than
any manufacturer skin out there but
these custom UIs allow for some pretty
neat tricks on the note 3 the more
useful of those add-ons revolve around
multitasking Samsung's Galaxy line has
always offered the best side-by-side app
experience on mobile letting you use the
big display for more than one task at
once thankfully LG isn't ignorant to the
added utility of this feature and the
company included similar functionality
in the G flex it's not quite as mature
as Samsung's offering meaning it doesn't
support as many apps but it works well
with the titles it does support and in
concert with LG's additional now be it
less useful multitasking paradigms it
allows the G flex to keep pace with the
note 3 the traditional victor in this
department for sheer versatility though
the note 3 has an ace up its sleeve or
more properly a stylus up its silo the
s-pen isn't for everyone but even if
you're not a memo maker or a doodle
drawer the stylus is handy even just as
a more comfortable input method it's not
just a throw away added for kicks but a
well-thought-out addition that makes
using the note 3 a distinct and
pleasurable experience overall if you
can get used to one of these interfaces
you can get used to the other sure there
are minor advantages in each corner
responsiveness and customizability on
the Flex and sheer feature count on the
note 3 but really Samsung and LG have
crafted very similar platforms here and
each serves its respective device well
each of these phones has been through
pocket now's full review battery so
we've been able to draw some conclusions
using each on a TN t--'s network over
the course of weeks in the case of the
Flex and months in the note 3's case
call quality is solid on both devices
though we preferred the sound quality on
the G flex and so did our callers the
Flex also boasts the louder base ear
external speaker as this clip from the
pocket now daily demonstrate show every
single weekly definitely for news but
then the weekly goes in more extensively
to the hottest news of the week we've
got great guests coming in every single
week so make sure all looks of those
scriptures to follow more of a pocket
now wait yet you won't be left wanting
for bonuses in terms of the cameras on
these phones each one is a 13 megapixel
sensor driven by feature-packed software
Samsung's results tend to be a bit more
vibrant indoors with richer colors in
medium light though in harsher lighting
the Samsung camera tends to wash out a
bit more easily it's also tough to get a
stable shot on each in a moving
situation both phones are big and
neither features optical stabilization
in very dark settings the Flex injected
more light into the scene but at the
expense of LG's characteristic purple
noise while the note 3 didn't get quite
as bright it produced more realistic
colors outdoors the similarity returns
with the Flex producing slightly warmer
tones but overall the two phones are
quite comparable in terms of stills in
video as long as you're shooting in
1080p and not the note 3's 4k recording
mode similarities persist you don't want
to use either of these while you're
walking around is the image jumps quite
a bit even at normal walking pace but
the results are pretty similar indoors
same deal in outdoor lighting while the
G flex provides a wider angle colors
sharpness white balance and even audio
capture are all comparable here
but how long will each phone last while
you're doing all this well as always
results will vary from person to person
but we're happy to report that the
answer in each case is a long time the G
flex features probably the most
impressive endurance we've ever
encountered routinely delivering six
plus hours of screen on time per charge
but the note 3 is no slouch either and
it's battery is user swappable for
replacements in the field so either way
you go you're going to get a smartphone
that you don't have to be afraid to use
often the LG G flex and the Samsung
Galaxy Note 3 are both top of their
class devices and while usually a
phablet comparison ends up with the
feature-packed note 3 walking away with
the trophy here it's a little less clear
which one works best for you depends
well on where you live
of course the G flex is only available
in Asia for now but it also depends on
what kind of person you are that means
those of you who value call quality
battery life novelty and innovation will
probably prefer the G flex while those
who appreciate expandability raw feature
count and the best stylus experience a
modern mobile device can bring you
should go for the note 3 and whichever
one you select congratulations you've
just bought a killer smartphone before
we go want to give a special thanks to
the folks at Negri electronics who
provided one of the two G flex loaner
units that made this video possible
LG provided the second thank you to them
and thank you also to AT&amp;amp;T who provided
the Galaxy Note 3 used in this video
