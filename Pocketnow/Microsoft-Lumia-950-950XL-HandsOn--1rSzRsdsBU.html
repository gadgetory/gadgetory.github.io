flagships in a very long time and we're
going hands-on with what Microsoft is
calling the most productive phones
you've ever picked up for Pocket now I'm
Michael Fisher with Adam Lane behind the
camera at Microsoft's New York City
Windows 10 event here with the first
look at the Lumia 950 and 950 XL you
might look at the aesthetic differences
here and wonder why we're covering these
in one video and that's because
aesthetics aside these are very similar
devices the cameras for example are
exactly the same modules despite looking
entirely different each is a 20
megapixel PureView camera with carl
zeiss optics optical stabilization a
triple LED natural flash and 4k video
recording while the front-facing
shooters are five megapixel wide-angle
cameras topping out at 1080p video
whichever cameras you use you've got a
dedicated camera button on the side of
the phone which we're pleased to see
make a return here up front is the IR
spotlight necessary for Windows hello
which identifies you based on looking
into your eyes as long as you hold the
phone up high enough
each phone incorporates quad HD AMOLED
displays microSD expansion a removable
battery high-speed USB type-c for a 50
percent charge in 30 minutes of charging
Wireless recharging and each of these of
course runs the mobile version of
Windows 10 meaning that you can use the
phone as a phone or as a hub for a
desktop computing experience Windows
continuum was one of the coolest demos
we saw here today and while we don't
know how well it'll translate to
real-world usefulness the fact that both
of these phones can be used as
full-fledged pcs is really cool where
the phones differ most significantly is
in size the XL is predictably larger and
it carries a proportionately larger
battery 3340 versus the smaller phones
3000 milliamp hours it's also got a
Snapdragon 810 processor instead of the
Snapdragon 808 a Gorilla Glass 4 instead
of Gorilla Glass 3
and it's 5.7 inch display is larger than
the 5.2 inch panel on the smaller phone
the big one doesn't win in all
departments though Microsoft is telling
us it only packs Qi wireless charging
while the smaller 950 it will also
support PMA if you're a geek
the biggest difference will be in
thermal dissipation the 950xl packs what
Microsoft calls a liquid cooling system
it's a heat pipe that uses a liquid
transfer medium to carry heat away from
the processor and that plus the
magnesium frame should keep the
Snapdragon 810 nice and cool in theory
the smaller phone doesn't have that
cooling system in place the software is
still non-final here and we weren't able
to play much with the new features
coming in Windows 10 mobile so will
content ourselves with impressions of
the hardware in short these are nothing
we haven't seen before that's not a dig
at the specs they're certainly
compelling phones if you're a Windows
fan then the chassis czar nice and thin
and light with comfortable polycarbonate
from some angles they even look it's
fine
but the industrial design here exudes
2013 these phones are pretty plainly
leftovers from the Nokia pipeline and at
an event where Microsoft's other
offerings are so groundbreaking it's
tough to get too excited about these
unfortunately the world doesn't really
need another excuse not to get excited
about Windows Mobile so hopefully these
blow us away when it comes time for our
full review these devices will be
available starting in November for
between 549 and $649 depending on size
this is just an early hands-on from the
Windows 10 devices event in New York
City folks stay tuned to pocket now for
further coverage and check out our
hands-on time with the new surface
products the new band and everything
else Microsoft is showing off today till
next time this has been Michael Fisher
with Adam Lane behind the camera thanks
for watching and we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
