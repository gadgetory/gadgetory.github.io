pocket now calm and this is part two of
the software review of the motorola
droid x on verizon wireless in this
video we're going to talk about built-in
applications and also we're going to
compare the internet speed with that of
the iphone 4 and the google nexus one
running on froyo it should be fun let's
get to it okay so I'm going to turn on
the device here we already talked about
the home screen interfaces so I'm not
going to cover that in this video I'll
put a link up at the end of this video
if you want to jump back and see where
we talk about all of these cool widgets
that come on the droid x so let's drill
into the applications here's the 3g
mobile hotspot application which runs
very similarly to what you'll find on
froyo the the built-in tethering
application in android it costs twenty
dollars a month if you want to use it
from verizon and that gives you two
gigabytes of data transfer speed in my
testing it works quite well it provides
speeds of about 1.5 to as much as 1.8
megabits per second down and about 800
kilobits per second and upload speed
which is really similar to what you will
get if you have a verizon my fire sprint
mifi or anything like that so right now
it's turned on and if i connect a device
it will be listed here very very easy to
use it's up to you if you want to pay
for that added cost every month let's
get out of here and jump back over here
it's got some basic things here backup
assistant is something verizon has added
i haven't really used it but it allows
you to remotely backup your names phone
numbers and email addresses to the cloud
it looks to be a free option and you
have to create a pin it works off of
verizon's network they've obviously
contracted a third party to make this
happen but it's nice that they offer
that solution going down the list we
have a built-in blockbuster application
but of course you can download this from
the android market and if we tap on get
it you have to create an account to be
able to rent movies to your device
although you could always use the
netflix application if you our netflix
subscriber will talk about browser in a
bit we have some video samples up on our
youtube channel showing the droid x
recording video and of course the droid
x has three microphones
12 + + 3 which will allow you to change
the scene to hone in on different kinds
of audio so be sure to check that out
again I'll put a link up at the end of
the video so you can jump to that let's
go back into the program list so we've
got some other things basic email with a
file explorer that comes on here we have
DLNA which I'll talk about down here
through media share now DLNA is a
standard that lets you play multimedia
across multiple devices so if your
computer supports it if your TV supports
that your game console supports it plus
your phone you can connect all of these
devices to play multimedia so right here
we can click start I don't have any
dianna DLNA connected devices so let's
say I did have a television a Sony
television or whatnot that supported DN
a-- DLNA I could press play it would
work together with the device to network
my phone with my television really cool
so I could actually play videos and put
pictures on the screen wirelessly really
cool so it's built right into the droid
x a lot of smartphone these these days
are coming with a DLNA built-in we get
need for speed shift but it's actually
the trial it's kind of silly obviously
verizon and motorola are trying to show
off the graphical prowess and a big
screen on the droid x but why would they
include a trial of this game i can show
you how it works nevertheless and it
doesn't seem to scale to the 854 x 480
screen so let's go because this feature
is not available head can do that ok
alright so you get a feel for how the
graphics are I'm gonna put the screen
back okay here we are and I'll just play
this for just a minute again I want you
to get a feel for how the graphics are
on the droid x
so pretty good pretty good this is a
really good game cross-platform game so
you can actually compare this to the
iphone to get a sense for how it
performs so that was the need for speed
game okay and diving back in here let's
continue to scroll down we have some
other things from social networking
utility built in which will allow you to
really look at multiple social networks
and update motion multiple social
networks in one shot and you can also
update your social networks from the
home screen which we've already talked
about so let's go back here text
messaging basic application media share
voicemail visual voicemail costs three
dollars a month which is crazy they
should it should absolutely include this
service with such a high-end device like
the droid x so you can subscribe to
visual voicemail from here and get it
right on your device and that's pretty
much it in terms of included
applications what i want to do now by
the way does have an FM radio which is
always nice to have you have to plug in
your headset to get that to work and one
more thing this is pretty cool it's
called the my verizon application which
allows you to access your data usage and
everything right from the device which
is a really nice touch and I'm glad
verizon connected this or your use this
so here we go it tells you this is a
demo unit tells you how many minutes
i've used having text messages i've used
and so on and so forth you can go to
balance to see what your bill balances
and you get the point so what i'm going
to do now is compare the browser on the
droid x with that of the nexus one
running froyo and the iphone 4 so let's
get to the test alright and here we go
if all three devices going to launch the
browsers and all of these do not have
any tabs open they're all going to go to
Google from the start so we're going to
go to pocketnow.com on all of them and
up here too
try to do it at the same time it's not
always completely possible to get it
right so one two three almost there
let's see which which goes fastest the
froyo or the nexus one was pressed last
so it's got a bit of a disadvantage okay
the droid x finished first very nice and
it looks like the iphone came in last
actually so the nexus one just finished
even though it had a bit of a lag let's
take a look at how it's like to flick
down the page and really experience the
website so scrolling is smooth on the
droid x very smooth it's also smooth on
the iphone and on the nexus one smooth
on all devices let's test screen
rotation speed so i take the droid x and
the iphone 4 first the iphone 4 was
faster droid x was faster let's try that
one more time about about even and droid
x i'd say droid x is faster let's take a
look at the nexus one so we're going to
go into landscape Wow almost exactly the
same joy decks was definitely faster
okay nexus one was faster inconclusive
in terms of these two android devices
let's go to another website to see how
they compare we're going to go to
engadget.com okay and we've got them
ready to go so one two three again the
nexus one is slightly behind and it
looks like we're getting the mobile
version here the full version here and
the full version here let me just swipe
to the bottom and go to the full site
you
all right in the joy it's finished let's
take a look at how they do pinch to zoom
so let's say I'm going to zoom all the
way out on all of these devices were
zoomed out let's say I want to flick
down a little bit and I want to hone in
on this picture here so pinch-to-zoom
smooth very smooth and let's see how it
is on the droid x not surprisingly it's
smooth on all three devices let's click
on a permalink to go to another page and
again test these head-to-head in terms
of speed maybe I can get them yep got
them at the same time let's see which is
fastest droid x 1 followed by the nexus
one followed by the iphone 4 incredibly
the iphone 4 with with all of the the
fanfare about the a4 processor is
actually not performing that well in
terms of rendering web pages and as you
can see down here there are no other
webpages being loaded so it's got no
reason to be slow we're going to go to
amazon.com
okay we've got all three here so one two
three and this will be the last test of
speed so it looks like the iphone 4 was
about the same speed as the droid x and
the the nexus one was slightly behind of
course because we tapped it at the last
minute I want to jump to the regular
site here and we can pan around and see
again the differences in web browsing
speed and fidelity when we do it that
way so let's jump around all these
devices are very very very capable
internet browsing machines it looks like
the droid x is actually the fastest in
this test compared to these devices the
zooming isn't as smooth as it is on the
iphone on the droid x and it's it's
likewise on the nexus one but it's it's
fast it's really fast so if we go to
looks like we're seeing different
displays across all of these all of a
very very good web experience so we can
do tap on the main headlines may take us
to different places so the iphone
finished first although it went to a
different page and then we're on the
same page here on the google nexus one
and on the droid x and i just tried to
play this video and let's see what
happens it doesn't have flash it has
flash light but it doesn't really play a
lot of flash video if I press play over
here I should get better results
although I may have flash turned off I
do so what I have to do is go to
settings and turn back on nable plugins
but you get the point so overall from a
software front the motorola droid x is a
fantastic offering verizon has added a
lot of very helpful utilities to check
our account bounce to tether to another
device and to get your visual voicemail
but unfortunately it cost three others a
month and the internet browsing speed on
the droid x is possibly the best of any
device that we've tested yet in most
cases does a really fantastic job the
flash support isn't there yet but in
terms of speed of rendering pages and
panning around and zooming around
is really really great and it's
fantastic that have such a large screen
to do this all with and plus the massive
resolution 854 x 480 really makes a
difference when you're moving around a
web page trying to see as much screen
information as possible if you like this
video please give it a thumbs up and
keep an eye on pocket now calm for the
full droid x review coming very soon
