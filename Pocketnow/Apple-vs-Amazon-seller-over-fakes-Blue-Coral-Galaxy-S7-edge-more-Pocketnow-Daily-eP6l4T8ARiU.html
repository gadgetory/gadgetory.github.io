picture for the iphone 7 the galaxy s7
edge launches in blue coral sort of it
seems that the LG G 6 will be about
anything but the friends I'm hi Marilee
vera and friends are the ones you
actually party with on Friday LG not
accessories this is parking out daily
let's start today with breaking news pun
intended as a google has just partnered
with you break i fix for those of you
that have problems with your pixel
smashing displays for whatever so this
works pretty much the same as apple you
take their you get a replacement
apparently during the same day in just a
couple of hours and the it'll cost you 1
29 for the Google pixel 150 for the
pixel XL it's too bad that this doesn't
bring HTC's type of warranty but oh well
remember the rumors of the coral Galaxy
s7 edge to be prepared for a launch with
this whole note 7 debacle well the
product has just been announced the
problem is most of us aren't really in
that market is apparently it's launching
only in Singapore at least right now
there is no word as to when that unit
will reach the United States hopefully
soon and hopefully not an exclusive to
any carrier as will the spotlight over
to LG rumors claim that sales for LG's
g5 friends was so bad that we should not
expect to see the friends arrive with
the g6 we pretty much saw what the b20
as there is no support for them in that
phone either apparently LG wants to go
back to the drawing board and a lot of
what's going to make the g6 hot and
we've already seen an LG v20 variant
being launched in japan that's water
resistant so there could be a lot of
great coming here with no friends
support sad way I'll start about the
apple iphone 7 iphone 7 plus even though
Cupertino did not provide specific
statistics over how much the company's
sole during the first weekend which is a
usual practice from Apple but which was
not followed either because of the
supply constraints with the iphone 7
plus or because we've seen a decline in
sales year over a year ever since the
iphone 6s but anyways apparently things
are good forty-eight percent of sales
to newer iPhones and we do know how bad
it's been for the plus variant but we
should learn more on the company's core
results on the twenty-fifth and finally
a very interesting news they actually
have to do with Apple versus amazon
there is a lawsuit being filed because a
Cupertino claims that at least ninety
percent of the Chargers being sold on
Amazon and wires are counterfeit now
notice by counterfeit we're not talking
about the products that are designed and
made for iphone that actually have the
licensing but apparently a lot of
products that are supposed to be Apple
genuine chargers even sold by amazon are
counterfeit and this is a rather
interesting development as i
particularly by things mostly when they
say sold by amazon because i trust the
fact that these products are not
counterfeit but it seems that there is a
problem that has to be dealt with by the
retailer so yeah it's gonna be rather
interesting to see what amazon is going
to do going forward but it does lead me
to the question of the day whenever you
buy wires and chargers do you like to
buy third-party options or do you stick
with the whatever the supplier provides
and buy genuine products because in my
case I will be honest this is one
particular case where I do not buy
products that are not either stratified
by the company or made specifically by
the company because I have seen cases
where phones either don't charge or the
Chargers don't last or now we see
exploding phones leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
