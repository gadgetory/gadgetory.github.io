Developer Preview I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow and this is Ubuntu versus
jellybean I know what you may be
thinking you can't compare Android with
Ubuntu it's just not fair Ubuntu touch
isn't a commercial build and you can't
compare the two and we're not here to do
that we're not here to say one is better
than the other
obviously Android has a huge advantage
over a brand new operating system that
doesn't have the functionality what
we're doing is seeing how these
operating systems differ in how they
operate how they look how you navigate
and how tasks are accomplished so
without further ado let's get started
the first major difference that jumped
out at me is the lockscreen Ubuntu
technically doesn't have a lock screen
it's a welcome screen and it feels just
like that a welcome screen it's warm
fuzzy and it makes you want to open the
device Android is a little different it
has a lock symbol right dead center in
the bottom of the screen and it makes
the device feel a little more closed and
off-putting not that that's a bad thing
you're not going to feel put off by your
own device but it's just the way it
looks once you get past the wall command
lock screens you will notice that the
home screens are totally different
they're built on totally different
principles Android is much more
complicated and convoluted in that
everything is in a different place your
applications are hidden in the app
drawer all of your content is hidden in
individual applications and so on and so
forth
no content is right there ready to be
consumed other than anything that you
put on the home screen manually such as
widgets or icons etc Ubuntu is a total
180 from that everything is front and
center on your home screen by default
content people everything is right there
front and center ready to be consumed
right away sure there are things hidden
in applications but there's a lot of
stuff crammed on the home screen that's
good and bad the next major difference
is how you navigate the operating
systems on Android you have dedicated
buttons to this they're either on screen
or capacitive or possibly physical
buttons all you have to do is press them
to navigate by default there is a task
switcher button there is a home button
back button and on some devices there's
still a menu button for devices without
a menu button there's an action overflow
for all of your settings to return home
simply press the home button to go back
one page press the back button it's very
simple straight for
and there's no confusion about how to
navigate on Ubuntu everything is totally
different from that everything is done
by using gestures a swipe from the right
side of the screen takes you back to
your previous application a swipe from
the left takes you back home a small
drag from the left shows your favorite
applications and a drag up from the
bottom within certain applications shows
a menu so it's a very big difference in
how things are done task switching for
instance is much faster on Ubuntu all
you do is swipe from right to left from
the edge of the display and you jump
back to the previous application on
Android you hit the task switcher button
wait for the task switcher application
to come up then tap and then the
application you want will launch the big
difference however is with Android you
have a little more options when it comes
to switching applications if you want to
switch back to the 3rd 5th or 8th
application back it's much faster on
Ubuntu you would have to go back to the
home screen and then choose from the
running applications however not
everything is totally different between
these two operating systems there's more
alike than you might think first for
instance is the notification shade
simply drag down from the top of the
display on either platform and you have
your notifications your missed calls and
everything and you also have access to
quick settings with Ubuntu simply drag
down over different icons to access
different settings from Android simply
drag down with two fingers and you have
toggles for all of your important
settings you can get the same effect
with Ubuntu by simply tapping the time a
page with all of the settings will drop
down tap and then it will take you to
the respective notification shade page
the other very similar application
within your bun 2 and Android is the
dialer they look totally different the
Ubuntu dialer looks very webOS like
while Android is the holo theme it's
dark with neon highlights but the way
that the two work is very similar you
have a dialers page swipe to the right
you have your recent activity
communication and such and swipe one
more time and you have your contacts the
way these two are designed is very
similar almost so similar that you would
think that maybe canonical got their
idea from someone even the camera
application on Ubuntu though it lacks
some features looks very similar to the
new jellybean camera there are some
notable differences but the way that the
camera application acts when you take a
picture and the animations and
everything it's very very similar to the
jellybean experience when you dig into
applica
Asians like the browser however it's
clear that Ubuntu is very primitive
there are hardly any functionalities in
the browser you can enter URL hit
forwarded back and that's pretty much it
from within the Android browser you have
tabs you can share things and all sorts
of features Ubuntu is lacking that right
now it's a Developer Preview so it's to
be expected but it also shows how much
work canonical has ahead of them to make
a very refined and well rounded product
that can take from the likes of a
popular platform all in all I have very
few negative things to say about Ubuntu
especially considering how early it is
in the development phase sure it's no
comparison for Android right now but it
is a contender so long as canonical can
bring it into the mainstream and get
some true hardware partners on board so
many times it has been proven that
awesome software is nothing without
complimentary hardware for now Android
will remain on top but there's one thing
for certain there's blood in the water
and many software makers are gunning for
a much larger piece of the pie at this
point is just too soon to tell whether
Ubuntu will be one to make a difference
this has been a comparison between
Ubuntu for phones and Android jellybean
