pre-ordered figures are kind of crazy
1+5 teen name goes official as we learn
more about why the headphone jack is not
going anywhere and we finally get a
glimpse and I mean a glimpse of the HTC
u 11 plus I'm Jaime Rivera and god I
wish I could pull off everything that my
schedule says that I have to do I'm
trying to get it done this is PocketNow
daily the official loose today beginning
with deals in the case of the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 now bear in mind one of
these deals is pretty much going to be
expired by the time you watch this video
but yeah t-mobile and Samsung are
offering two deals Samsung on one hand
200 bucks with a Visa prepaid card that
is the one that's probably going to
expire but on the other hand t-mobile is
offering up to $130 off you can learn
more about this in the link in the
description now let's talk about HTC in
its event that you 11 plus in you 11
life which we have here and we were
planning a hands-on video it's just been
really crazy and you guys know that so
if you want a video let us know in the
comments the most important part about
that you 11 life is the fact that you
get a mid Ranger that's got a lot of
things that you can only find in a
flagship but that's the reason why this
phone matters in the case of the U 11
plus the reason why we don't have it is
because it's not launching in the United
States at least for now and that's
really sad but anyways we'll keep you
posted as soon as we learn more now
yesterday we were talking about how
bitter we are over Samsung's approach to
software updates guess which company is
not going to play you around when it
comes to Oreo it's actually LG the
company has confirmed that we're getting
Oreo on the v 30 by December and there
will be an early preview late November
that some of you can already access or
you will be able to access whenever you
get notified more details in the
description thank you LG this is the way
you do things and for those of you
wondering what we should expect for the
one plus 5t number one the Oppo our 11s
has already been announced and we're
assuming then that's the design but then
again Peter Lau was recently on the
forums of oneplus and we hear two things
number one that the name is the 1 + 5 t
number 2 that the headphone jack is not
going anywhere and
are a basis of reasons from engineers in
the company that confirmed that they
will continue backing the headphone jack
Thank You oneplus I really appreciate it
I know many of us appreciate it as well
how about some water resistance on that
phone and finally the very hot news they
have to do with the iPhone 10 and the
fact that I have to go to bed soon
because I have to pick mine up tomorrow
morning and you can expect our coverage
starting early the second thing is that
we here analysts already claiming that
Apple might have sold from nine to 12
million units in three days for those of
you that were saying that this phone was
stupid expensive and I do agree believe
it or not 12 million people disagree 12
million people were willing to pay so
much money for this phone and you know
hey I feel sad about that because I feel
that when people back things up it just
gives companies reasons to continue
doing it I hope that's not the case but
anyways it leads me to the question
today number one do you order one number
two will I see you tomorrow in line I
will be tweeting as to which store I'm
at so hopefully I'll see you there leave
us a comment down below let us know what
you're gonna be doing friends again if
