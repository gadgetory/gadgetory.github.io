register for the one 260 livestream
which has now been moved to October 29th
follow up on outcome / 1 + 60 for more
information Samson just released a
teaser and we could be seeing their
foldable phone and pretty much two weeks
looks like it's gonna be a jolly holiday
season for Apple with the iPhones in our
sales and Google and Apple are fixing
their issues when it comes to their
cameras I'm Jaime meta Rivera and
apologize for the face I've come on to
hours of sleep travelling like crazy
background studio number 2 this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
official news that don't necessarily
have to do with deals but do we're
hoping that the oneplus 16 does not
disappoint with a price tag for those of
you interested in buying the phone we
were actually expecting it to sell on us
carriers but it seems that the company
is still going to have its pop up stores
there's going to be one for the whole
United States in New York and then
London Amsterdam Barcelona and other
cities you can see the full list in the
description of the US carriers I thought
that was gonna be it but cool I mean
these pop-up stores are still great now
let's talk about the HTC Exodus 1 which
just became official the whole block
Shane phone that's actually pretty much
just an HTC u12 plus with a different
backing and well specifications aren't
bad you can see them in the description
the most interesting part about this
phone is that even though I'm still
strong I'm still scratching my head over
the purpose of this device you can only
buy with Bitcoin or you know
cryptocurrency Oh point 15 Bitcoin yeah
I know that's it's funny now let's talk
about both Apple and Google these are
actually separate news stories but they
have to do with the same thing as well
Google is having issues when it comes to
the camera roll of its pixel 3 devices
where we take a photo and the photos are
not there so apparently a fix is coming
but also Apple is going to release iOS
12.1 and one of the fixes that's coming
is that well the beauty mode is no
longer gonna make me look as good as I
look in these photos because that's the
only way I'm gonna actually end up
looking well but anyways it seems that
that's gonna be a change that's coming
in addition to other enhancements in the
camera stay tuned for that I'm probably
not gonna have big
and speaking of Apple iPhone 10 our
sales are out and it seems that the
company has already exceeded
expectations up to the point where
mainsheet quo is predicting that this
phone is going to outsell the 10s and
10x max two to one literally
apparently sales are so good that the
company has already not been able to
deliver enough phones and I don't know I
wasn't expecting this reaction for the
10r but it seems that the market is
reacting well to it we'll see how long
that lasts and finally the hotness they
have to do with Samsung as the company
has just sent out invitations for
Developer Conference to happen on
November 7th and 8th and usually this
would never make the hottest news if
only the company would have not teased
the fact that it seems that we're
getting that foldable display smartphone
being announced at the event because it
makes sense if they're inviting
developers as they need developer
support for a new product they have to
announce it and if you remember the
rumors were that we were gonna get to
see this product this year at least see
it I'm not saying launch so let us know
in the comments I mean developer
conference developer support a foldable
smartphone or tablet does that make you
excited in my case I'll have to see to
believe but that's just me leave us a
comment down below we love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news earlier follow us I'm fucking
out on comments director both our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one and follow me on
Twitter I know just what a bit are on
Instagram at high metal Iveta please
give this video a thumbs up if you like
what you saw I'm hey metadata thanks so
much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
