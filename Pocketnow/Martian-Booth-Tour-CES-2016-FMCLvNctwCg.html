solid assortment of new bands it can
also change those up yourself provide
extra custom look we also took a quick
peek at Martians kindred VIP watch for
women and while these wearables dicks
the OLED panel they still offer fully
customizable vibration and multicolor
LED notifications while making the smart
choice of moving the led to a strip on
the watch's bottom edge other design
refinements here include switching from
a bulky USB charging port to a pogo pin
dock giving users a couple weeks worth
of operation on a single charge and just
like all Martian watches the analog
watch hands are powered separately from

years of time keeping on a single
battery pocket now CES 2016 coverage is
