only three manufacturers that pack fun
features into their phones LG has a
knack for the same exact thing I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and here are three fun things to do with
the LG g3 before I get started I'd like
to tell you about a cool company called
simple mobile founded on the idea that
your mobile phone is an extension of
your own personal freedom simple mobile
has a great way to do wireless joining
simple is super easy just use your own
GSM phone purchase a simple mobile SIM
card activate one of the simple mobile
unlimited plans then follow the easy
process to set up simple mobile on your
phone it's well simple want to learn
more about how to save money on your
phone bill by joining simple mobile just
click this box or the link in the
description below to learn more about
how you can start saving money and get
in on the simple way of doing Wireless
the LG g3 is a seriously impressive
smart phone and LG managed to pack some
very helpful features into the software
without making the user experience
overbearing and excessive the first of
one of those features is not code with
the power standby key around back double
tapping the display is the easiest way
to turn the screen on password of pin
locks are also very strongly recommended
if you keep sensitive information on
your phone but having to constantly
enter a password or PIN can grow very
annoying with LG's NOC code feature you
can create a combination of taps on an
invisible grid which will unlock your
phone this NOC sequence is just as easy
to remember as a pin and it's much
faster and less annoying to enter every
time you need to access your phone best
of all you don't even have to worry
about accuracy another fun thing to do
that you can't do on just any old
Android smartphone not straight out of
the box anyway is to customize the
navigation buttons first and foremost if
you don't like the default color solid
white you have three more color options
a white gradient solid black and a black
gradient you can also toggle whether the
background is transparent on the home
screen or not more importantly if you
don't like the order of the buttons you
can easily rearrange them in the button
settings navigate to the home touch
button submenu under display in settings
select button combination and long press
and drag the buttons to rearrange LG
also includes for optional buttons you
can add at least two of at a time
quickmemo+
queues
a dual window and the notification
shortcut the ladder is extremely helpful
since the 5.5 inch display is a little
large for one-handed use it's definitely
a nice touch to have complete control
over the order of the buttons and have
four additional buttons to take
advantage of the wasted space in the
navigation bar
finally guest mode it happens to
everyone a friend's phone dies or they
lose their phone or they simply don't
have one and they need to make a phone
call or look something up you don't want
them snooping around in your personal
stuff with the g3 you can activate guest
mode within guest mode settings you can
select exactly which apps the guest has
access to like calculator Chrome camera
games YouTube whatever you feel
comfortable with other people using on
your phone to use guest mode you'll need
to set some form of security lock on
your phone and the password must be
different than your standard password
for instance if you regularly use NOC
code as your form of security you must
enter a different NOC sequence to enter
guest mode so if you leave guest mode on
in the background all you have to do
from the lock screen to enter the mode
is to enter the alternative password
it's effortless and extremely handy to
have around
