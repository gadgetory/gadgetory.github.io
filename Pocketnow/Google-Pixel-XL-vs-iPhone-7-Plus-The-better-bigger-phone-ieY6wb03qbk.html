maybe being a little too similar to the
other now having spent some time with
the pixel Excel has Google carved out a
new consumer niche or is this a
situation of google flattering it's time
for a showdown between the pixel excel
and the iPhone 7 plus get it flattering
because that's the sincerest form of
never mind for you specs junkies you can
pause the video here to see what these
two Titans are packing now with that out
of the way we can completely appreciate
some of the design concerns some of our
viewers have shared down in our comments
when dealing with similar screen sizes
white front bezels largely aluminum
frames there is a concern of Google
falling for the same trap which is
doomed other manufacturers there are
several significant design departures of
machining subtle corners around these
edges keeping all of the phone controls
on the right hand side and moving the
fingerprint sensor to the rear glass
panel now on a personal note I'm a big
fan of rear mounted fingerprint sensors
but the more I use the pixel the less I
like this rear glass patch happily for
having similarly sized displays the
pixel XL manages an overall smaller
footprint there's bles wasted space
happening here and when using adaptive
brightness the pixel screen cranks
brighter than the iPhones Apple's LCD is
one of the best displays available for
color accuracy but the higher resolution
and slightly higher contrast AMOLED
panel on the pixel scores our win
comparing camera performance these two
are very evenly matched in both pros and
cons a bug focus heavily on
point-and-shoot II auto modes no manual
features here of both our HDR in
slow-motion champs both feature terrific
image stabilization and both only record
audio in mono when shooting video for
once though Apple leads with the more
innovative hardware and the dual sensor
set up on the iPhone delivers a novel
zoom feature the extra sensor and
hardware image stabilization just edging
out the pixel for our camera win the
competition isn't quite so close when
listening to the audio the pixel still
has a headphone jack but even through
this adapter the iPhone walks away with
an easy win higher quality output with a
low
noise floor and worst of all for Google
a noticeably louder amp stereo audio on
the iPhone also wins out over the single
bottom firing speaker solution on the
pixel this is definitely an area where
we wish HTC had managed more influence
over this hardware thankfully the
battery situation is a bit more
even-handed both phones are all de
champs easily lasting meet at dinner
time with room to spare under moderate
use but in sustained use the iPhone is
better at coasting in our media test
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the pixel drained 7% of
its battery the iPhone drained 3% the
seven-plus is easily the best performer
we've yet run through this bench where
the script flips is on recharging Apple
continues to pack an anemic charger on
our review unit after 30 minutes the
seven-plus only managed a 19% recharge
while the pixel almost doubled that
topping off 37% and wrap up let's have a
chat about software the pixels greatest
asset to the Android ecosystem is it's
terrifically smooth performance we've
never used an Android before which felt
this fast in daily use on its own
hardware Google has largely closed the
gap on perceived UI performance even if
Apple can still claim some victories
when looking at synthetic benchmarks
what's impressive is the balance between
simplifying the Android UI and retaining
what we like about Android is a flexible
platform the little touches which help
convey additional functionality like
this G bar the app drawer arrow or the
little carrots used in your notification
shade of course conveyance is still an
issue with features like long pressing
and force pressing but if you could take
both phones back in time to the 90s and
hand them to people who had no
experience using a smart phone
after the shock had worn off because of
the time travel the pixel might just be
the easier phone to get the hang of add
to that some nice usability and
multitasking tweaks and more organic
conversational interactions with the
Google assistant who is the President of
the United States the President of the
United States of America is Barack Obama
Barack Obama from January 20th 2009 2%
how tall is he six feet one inch we're
inclined to give the software edge to
the pixel so let's wrap this up where
does that leave us between the pixel XL
and the iPhone 7 plus iphone android
comparisons are always tough but
complicating the showdown is the feeling
that google has their sights set on one
specific competitor where we genuinely
enjoy the aspects of the pixel that make
it unique the software performance the
rest of the phone seems tunnel vision
focused on last year's iPhones the pixel
becomes more a response to the
competition than a showcase for how
Google is better than the competition
and Apple is a moving target
the iPhone 7 plus bests the pixel with
better speaker and headphone audio more
innovative camera hardware and enhanced
water resistance in a battle of
lifestyle features on devices that both
start at $769 we want more than just a
response to the market leader we got to
give this overall win to the iPhone as
