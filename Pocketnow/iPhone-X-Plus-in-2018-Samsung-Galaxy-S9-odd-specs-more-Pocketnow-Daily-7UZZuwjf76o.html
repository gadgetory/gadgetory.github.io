as part of the devices will see in 2018
and I'll exclaimed at the new trends for
Tony and Tina also of devices that are
able to fold and benchmarks on the
samsung galaxy s 9 plus have brought up
some concerns I'm Jaime Rivera and I am
really impressed with the fact that I
made a positive comment about Monday
yesterday and everybody just went happy
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today have to do with deals if
you're in the market for anything this
Black Friday and I know everybody is
Amazon's deals are obviously going to be
very compelling and the list is very
long and we're talking about Amazon
devices like the echo Kindles etc in
addition to the tablets the list again
is just not even worth me going into
details you can learn more about
everything in the description now sorry
about the Samsung Galaxy S 9 as we've
got some leaked benchmarks that have
people concerned we're expecting an
early launch as soon as January or
February to counteract the iPhone 10 but
we're noticing four gigabytes of RAM in
the benchmarks and performance doesn't
really seem to be that great obviously
stay tuned it's too early to know and
for those of you complaining about the
lack of fast wireless charging on the
iPhone eight eight plus an iPhone 10
apparently iOS 11 docked who is going to
fix that how early that software update
is going to come we don't exactly know
but we hear from manufacturers of fast
wireless chargers that this option is
coming so yeah parently that feature is
going to just happen we've got some very
interesting news coming from analysts
for those of you wondering why all the
patents of foldable displays and devices
like the ax on em according to analysts
one of the major changes coming to 2018
is foldable designs on smartphones and
this is interesting as we obviously have
seen the ax on em it brings a different
approach to foldable designs and a lot
of people are polarized between whether
they like it or not
so apparently Oppo and Samsung are going
to be the next OMS that are bringing
something whether that's going to be
compelling or not it's something we're
gonna have to prove next year whenever
the review device is arrived and finally
the hot news that they have to do with
the iPhone
10 plus that we here is going to be just
part of the lineup of 2018 6.5 inch OLED
display but we hear that there's also a
third device LCD panel 6.1 inch iPhone
10 something which we're not exactly
sure what the purpose of this phone will
be in addition to the regular sized
iPhone 10 that might bring a spec boost
but no significant changes in design
this is all fine and dandy if it does
happen but it leads me to the question
today for those of you that have been
trying the iPhone 10 let us know do you
think that it's point or if it's worth
it to have an iPhone 10 plus because in
my case well so long as they don't make
it as heavy as the iPhone 10 why not but
