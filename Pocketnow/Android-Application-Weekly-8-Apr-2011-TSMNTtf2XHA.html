now and this is another episode the
Android application we plead in which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it this application
is called cargo decoder and their two
versions available a paid-for version
which cost 99 cents and is pretty much a
donation version and a free version
which has all the same settings so this
allows you to decode the placards that
are on the back of a cargo truck so you
can see what is potentially hazardous so
let's say I wanted to find a liquid fuel
or a diesel fuel here let's try this one
I can click on there and it will show me
a little blurb about what the dangers
are of that chemical comiXology is a
free application available to Android

from your Android device so there's many
comic books that are free so I'm just
gonna go to my comments here and if they
want to view this I can click on here
and I can go read now and it's pretty
simple to navigate through all you have
to do is move your finger either left or
right and it does animate pretty well so
let's see what we can do so pleasing and
then zoom out with a statement up here
it can do that and I can also scroll
around and and find other comment fight
board it allows you to view these white
boards from practically every single
airport in the entire world so the way
that this works is it's just like the
flight board that you would have at your
airport except now you don't have to
locate one of them all you do is click
on a little your flight information and
then it will show you when it left or
when it's going to arrive and you can
also find where your gate is going to be
and where your baggage claim is going to
be and you can change the departures and
arrivals just by clicking this button
and you can also search by going up here
and searching for your airline press

android market but it is a
subscription-based service so that you
do get 7 days free and after that the
newspapers vary in price so let's say i
wanted to view the los angeles times

can click on an article if it'll work
and it'll bring me directly to that
article on the other pages
I can go back and I can also scroll over
to view the other articles and there are
hundreds of different newspapers around
the world in this application vivo is a
free application to vote on the android
market that helps eliminate these
searching through a YouTube to find
particular music videos so what you can
do is let's say why don't you play a
music video I'll have to do is click on
one of these or I can also search and
it'll get begin playing and I can also
fast forward and the quality is really
good on any Android device so just go
