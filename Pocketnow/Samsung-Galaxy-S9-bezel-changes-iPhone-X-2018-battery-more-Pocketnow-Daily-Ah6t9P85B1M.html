screen might not change but the bezels
could all 2018 iPhone 10 sequels will
reportedly bring better batteries and it
seems that the next Huawei P series
might emulate the iPhone 10 in a few
things I'm hey Matt leave it up I try to
get a tan but it just didn't work and
I'm about to get on a plane I apologize
for the late video but this is PocketNow
daily if it'll news today begin with
deals if you're in the market for the
Apple watch Series 3 and there are a ton
of reasons why you should it's very hard
to find deals for this watch but
t-mobile is currently offering it for
$50 off which I know is not significant
but if you look at the price difference
between series 3 in series 1 yeah that's
when it starts making sense
if you're looking for it go for it
that's all about Amazon as the company
has just expanded its Amazon services to
28 more countries meaning one of the
reasons why I don't use the echo or for
example Amazon's music even though I get
it for free on Prime is because well it
doesn't work in the countries that I
travel to but as of now 28 countries
have been added these countries will
also be able to acquire the Amazon echo
and have it work you can learn about the
list on the description now let's talk
about Huawei very interesting rumors
claimed that the company might continue
emulating the iPhone more and more if
you haven't noticed how the huawei p10
looks like and yeah that's the point I'm
trying to make it seems the Huawei P 11
might bring a notch and before you
scratch your heads over why it's going
to bring a notch I would rather the
knotch / bezels but apparently this
notch it'll look a lot more like the
essential phone in the iPhone 10
so yeah let's wait for that at MWC most
likely and since we started talking
about apple and notches it seems that
the iPhone 10 2018 might bring changes
that people have been waiting for we're
talking battery life some people have
great battery life on the iPhone 10 that
hasn't been my case it's just been
regular apparently each iPhone and 2018
will bring larger battery starting with
2900 milliamp hour batteries and we do
hear that there are three phones so
let's see exactly what things change
with these devices and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with the Samsung Galaxy S 9 mainly
because we've been hearing that Samsung
doesn't really plan to change the
display but a trusted
today tells us that the fun factor will
remain the same the display quality and
technology will remain the same but will
will change are the bezels around it
apparently they will get even smaller
this time of the galaxy s 9 which is
interesting news I find that great but
in today's question I'd love to know
from you guys would you like to keep the
current design of the Galaxy s8 another
year or would you prefer things to go
slim bezels even if that includes a
notch in my case I hope Samsung figures
something out I know Samsung is a little
more innovative in that department there
