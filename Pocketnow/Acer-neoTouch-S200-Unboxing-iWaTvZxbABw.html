pocket now calm and in this video we're
going to unbox the new acer neo touch
also known as the s 200 or the f1 this
is one of the very few mobile devices
ever to have the Snapdragon platform
which means it has a 1 gigahertz CPU
it's also running windows mobile 6.5 it
has a huge 3.8 inch display so let's get
to the unboxing all right the bubble
wrap here here it is it's basically a
slate device just like the touch HD acer
has added a proprietary interface on the
neo touch let's take a look around the
box should be a pretty thin device so
see if we get some specs on the back now
this has the UMTS 1900 band which means
that in some places in the US on AT&amp;amp;T
you'll be able to get 3g which is really
interesting so let's take off this
plastic wrap
alright and it looks like the Box opens
this way hopefully this will be a nice
unboxing experience alright and here it
is okay we'll put the device to the side
for a minute and see what else comes in
the box a lot of cardboard oh whoa it
opens up kind of uh wow that is really
awesome kind of a pivot box very neat
the manual sits here nicely I'll see if
they did it in color nope they didn't ok
here is the warranty synchronize your
windows phone with your windows-based PC
user manual it's like a screen protector
here very nice on the right we have wall
charger uses mini USB very nice not
proprietary and then we have a battery
here which is of size 1350 milliamp
hours about the same size as say a touch
HD and a touch pro to see what we have
in this little lift compartment we have
a sinking cable and some headphones
which uses 3.5 millimeter fortunately
this device does have the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack so let's take a look at
the device alright and here is can tell
you right now it's very thin a lot
thinner than I thought it would be it's
got that large 3.8 inch display you know
it feels actually quite good in hand I'm
actually surprised usually acer devices
have kind of low build quality hopefully
this being their top-of-the-line device
that will be a different story so take
off this screen protector here very very
thin device very surprised by that nice
big screen on the front we've got some
buttons here that probably light up
calls call start call end this is
apparently other windows flag although
not really on the back it's very
we've got another piece of plastic to
take off that's always fun to do 5
megapixel camera with a flash very nice
very shiny body very sleek looking
device let's take a look at the acer neo
touch in comparison with say the touch
HD very similar devices both devices
have a large 3.8 inch screen in terms of
thickness the neo touch actually is a
little bit thinner and that's really
good to see you had a nice chrome edge
on the neo touch let's see it next to
the touch pro 2 has a smaller screen the
touch pro 2 and of course it's going to
be a lot thicker because the touch pro 2
has a keyboard the neo touch uses an
on-screen keyboard will have to talk
about how good that is next to the
iphone a larger screen has a nice arc to
it and it is a little bit thinner well
if not not on the edge and finally next
to the HTC pure which is basically an
HTC touch diamond2 can see a much larger
screen it's definitely thinner there's a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack on the top
so a lot more to come on acer neo touch
we're really curious to how fast this
device is with an amazing one gigahertz
Snapdragon processor we're really
looking forward to this be sure to
follow us on Twitter for more coverage

pocket now tweets we'll be back with
more video coverage very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
