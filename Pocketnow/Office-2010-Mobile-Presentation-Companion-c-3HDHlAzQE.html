and there's a couple interesting new
features in mobile office 2010 for
windows mobile 6.5 one of them language
showed right now is the mobile companion
so this is a nice way to you know
control a presentation with your phone
so first i'm going to open powerpoint on
the device you can see in the background
powerpoint is also open 2010 on my
tablet and first thing you have to do is
open both the same power point
presentation on both devices so you have
to either email to yourself or copied
over or sink it over with live mesh and
then on the computer you have to go to
adin's you actually have to install this
presentation companion and once its
installed it'll show up in the add-ins
tab and you hit start ok and it's going
to tell me to that i need the same file
over there and i can email to myself but
I don't want to 11 got you here the
office 2010 on the desktop has to be
32-bit the plugin doesn't work with 64
bit systems it's now on the phone I got
it started on the desktop I go to
presentation companion and it's going to
tell me that I have to install that
program and it's going to tell me that I
have to start it in the add-ins tab just
like I did and then it's going to tell
me that I have to go to the presentation
companion menu item which I just did so
I hit next and it's going to ask me
which computer I want to connect to
and do I want to start the presentation
yes and you notice the computer just
just started the presentation and on my
phone I have the notes for slide 1 so
and I have buttons have menu I can go to
whatever slide I want Duke liquor
slideshow stop clicker closed file so
fight next see my notes change tells me
the slide to and everybody else can see
the slide next again so this is totally
wireless remote control and I can be
walking around bluetooth with my
presentation and reading my notes and
that's the end so not bad pretty good
another gotcha the windows mobile device
has to be using the Microsoft Bluetooth
stack so you know normally wouldn't
think I was problem but HTC has decided
to use some other type of Bluetooth
stack on their new devices like the
touch pro 2 and the hd2 so those will
not be compatible with office 2010
mobile unfortunately so that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
