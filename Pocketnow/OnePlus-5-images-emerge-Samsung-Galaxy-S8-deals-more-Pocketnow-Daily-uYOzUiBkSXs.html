to expect for the 1+5 apple silently
approaches Iowa's 11 with a lot of ways
to save storage and the Samsung Galaxy S
Kate has already started scoring some
really interesting peels
I'm hi Mary that I'll rushing with
today's video because I have my son's
high school graduation today
congratulations dude this is far going
out daily the official news today start
with deals if you are in the market for
a Samsung Galaxy s8 I'm sure that you've
noticed that in other cases with other
phones on Amazon open box deals are kind
of common and sometimes it's just the
fact that somebody open the box and then
do anything with the phone there are
currently a ton of options in Best Buy
for the Samsung Galaxy s8 at 638 bucks
which means you're saving pretty much
more than $100 I highly suggest you
consider and now for product pre-orders
the new surface pen from Microsoft is
supposed to bring tilt and other
features that previous surface pens did
not have which is the reason why it now
costs $200 and not 50 those of you in
the market for one remember that this
new surface pen works with legacy
service products so yeah you could
pre-order today and get it by June 15
for 100 bucks
and speaking of product launches those
of you interested in the new 10.5 enter
12 point 9 inch iPad pros t-mobile is
picking them up in a very interesting
deal where what changes is really the
down payment depending on whatever
tablet you want but then regardless of
which file you pick you're just going to
be paying $30 a month for the subsidy
for two years and then it's $20 for
unlimited data I like the deal a lot you
can learn more in the description and
speaking of Apple as we continuously
discover what iOS 11 can do one very
interesting one reminds us of the next
book Robin the fact that the company is
really working hard on helping users
save storage up to the point where if
the iPhone or iPad detects that you're
not using specific applications it'll
remind you that you could gray them out
meaning it will unload the application
uninstall it but you'll keep your data
on the device meaning whenever you want
to use it again just tap on the icon it
installs the app again and you can just
start using it from where you left off
again pretty much the functionality of
the next bit Robin but you will have to
enable the feature
can learn more about what it can do in
the description and finally the very hot
news they have to do with the one plus
five we have the first leak renders of
what the phone might look like and yeah
I know the comments say that it looks a
little iPhone II I am NOT going to
complain I love absolutely everything
what I see we have a standard sixteen by
nine display for what I'm looking we
have dual cameras at the back and these
are at a corner it's still hard to know
exactly what functionality we're getting
from those dual cameras whether it's a
monochrome center or whatever regardless
the XO mark claims that this camera is
going to be great and I cannot wait to
test those features in addition to that
color option I love that phone in black
but anyways it leads me to the question
of the day one do you believe that these
renders are real and to do you like this
design compared to the other leaked
possible renders that we saw in the past
in my case I prefer cameras in the
middle but I don't care let's give it a
try leave us a comment down below we
love to know your opinion friends you
know the way it goes you don't want to
get the news earlier before the video is
filmed but what I'm probably now about
comment hit that subscribe button down
below for more videos like this one it
also follow me on Twitter hi Maldek
shortly that I run into the ground
behind every data please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am hanging literally that I think so
much for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
