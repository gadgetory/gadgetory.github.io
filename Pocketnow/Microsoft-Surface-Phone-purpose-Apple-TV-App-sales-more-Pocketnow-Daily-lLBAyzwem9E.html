popular applications are actually no
shocker 1 plus plans to give you peace
with its new warranty program we get
details on what might be holding back
the Oppo find 9 I'm hi Mary betta and
purple is the color of mourning and
grief which is appropriate for Monday's
this is paki now daily the official news
today begin with AT&amp;amp;T and blackberry as
both companies have now announced the
android-powered trip to the United
States and if you were a little
concerned about the devices price tag
you should be because it is now official
and if you do the math when you consider
AT&amp;amp;T installment plans you're actually
paying 750 dollars after two years it is
definitely a crazy price tag for this
device where again added security should
not be a selling point and instead other
features but then again that's the case
it's actually more expensive than the
galaxy note5 other official news come
from one plus those of you that struggle
with the same problems that many of us
doing dropping your phones and
shattering them the company has now
decided to launch its new on guard
warranty program you know the ROM is it
currently only works in Europe you'll
pay 40 euros if you want one year of
extended warranty 65 euros if you want a
full two years which is significantly
cheaper than what Apple sells for its
applecare+ and what you're getting is
obviously phone replacements device
repairs in case you shattered it got it
what or something but we haven't found
any limitations to this service so we
will report back as we learn more I want
product that has left our radar for
years because it just didn't happen is
the Microsoft Surface phone and now that
we've got Lumias it doesn't really make
sense for this product to exist except
for some trusted sources planning that
Microsoft wants to test the phone
running an intel atom chip with the
purpose of this phone running win32
applications and giving users a broader
scope of apps but if this doesn't happen
with a stylus we find it really hard to
believe so there is a lot of play here
and the probable purpose for this phone
of it ever does happen let's just see
when
another highly anticipated product that
we are still waiting for is the
successor to the Oppo find 7 which we
assumed to be the opal fine 9 got
trusted sources claiming the reason why
we're waiting for this phone is because
this waiting for the Snapdragon 820 and
it makes all the sense of the world the
fine 7 was about specification we had a
Snapdragon into one showcase that it was
one of the first folks that respond to
the hey Snapdragon command when the
phone was off in addition to this quad
HD display etc so yeah seems that early
2016 will be the case and I'm sure we'll
be that popular as the fine 7 as well
and finally the very interesting news of
the day have to do with the new Apple TV
this seems to be no longer apples hobby
now with TV OS and everything and we get
some interesting statistics of the
launch particularly when it comes to
applications number one as expected the
most popular apps were games which is
cool but even more interesting is the
price tech yet rich price tag for these
games is a ten dollars whereas in the
case of iOS and phones and tablets it's
more like a buck or five dollars Max and
obviously this is a significant contrast
but it seems that people really caring
more about this Apple TV for gaming
which leads me to the question of the
day when you ever ditch a ps4 or Xbox
meeting will you choose between these
products and an apple TV or do you feel
that these are just separate categories
for now because in my case I feel that
the apple TV is slow product that has to
be proven but give it as price tag i
would rather give a try to the apple TV
first and given the fact that i can
actually match universal apps meaning
that they can play on iphones and then
on the apple TV then it does make a
compelling reason to buy the apple TV
but there is a comment down below we'd
