on the standard galaxy s6 that Samsung
didn't even bother to capitalize the
brand name but don't be fooled by the
understatement as with other bold
devices from our recent history it's
surprising what a little curve can do
it's michael fisher with pocket now here
with the video review of the Samsung
Galaxy s6 edge
if you can't immediately tell the
difference between the s6 and s6 edge
that's understandable we've even used
video of the two interchangeably in our
Samsung coverage thus far but just as
you don't fully understand the standard
s6 until you pick it up it also takes
holding the edge to really get it unlike
the asymmetric Galaxy Note edge which
preceded it I didn't find the s6 edge
awkward to hold there's enough purchase
on the side rails and the buttons are
placed intelligently enough that you
don't always feel like you're going to
drop it still the gorilla glass back
cover has been imported from the
standard s6 so if you're worried about
fingerprints or scratching but don't
want to ruin the aesthetics with a case
consider a skin like the D brand carbon
fiber on our review device it took eight
hundred degree temperatures in a process
called 3d thermal forming to give the s6
edge the curved cover glass that gives
it its name and the effect is gorgeous
even as a pretty straightforward
cosmetic play the design is delightful
giving the display an infinity pool
effect and making the phone quite
striking from almost any angle the
AMOLED panel beneath the cover glass
curves only slightly reaching not even
halfway as far as the cover glass does
so there's less danger of accidental
taps when you pick it up from a table
and the screen itself is just as
brilliant saturated and pixel packed as
its counterpart on the standard s6 with
custom display modes and saturation
settings and a brightness spectrum
capable of adapting to almost any
lighting condition you're likely to find
yourself in in use the screens curve
does have minor drawbacks light behaves
differently at the bend so both
reflected light from outside and pixel
light from inside produce distortion and
color deviance at the sides the edges of
words sometimes bleed off the side
when you're reading and so does the
board in games like words with friends
which can be a little distracting but on
the other hand scrolling webpages or
social streams is a little handier with
the Edit purchase of the side screen
your thumb doesn't get in the way of the
text as you surf which is nice
Samsung should make a bigger deal out of
this of course this being Samsung
there's custom software built in to take
more advantage of the side screen by now
you've heard of the people edge function
that lets you assign commonly called
contacts to a persistent dock it's cool
but I'm not convinced it's faster than
finding them the old-fashioned way
then there's the color-coded color ID
that flashes custom colors on the side
rails when one of those important people
is trying to reach you but in order to
work it requires you to put your
expensive new phone face down on the
table which just feels all different
kinds of wrong more useful are the
information stream and night clock
functions which display things like the
time news headlines trending Twitter
searches stock prices and notifications
when the screen is off unfortunately
it's not very well thought out rather
than showing full headlines and
continuously scrolling the news ticker
pauses every few seconds to show you a
partial headline you need to tap on it
and then unlock the phone to see what
it's actually about and if you're in a
bright room the glare on the curved
glass usually falls right across the
very words you're trying to read
I appreciate Samsung trying to make
intelligent use of the edge screen but I
think these features fit better on the
larger Note edge with bigger display
better lends itself to this kind of
information overload here on the s6 the
edge screen is more effective as an
aesthetic adornment than anything else
in standard use the edge screen also
makes hitting corner buttons a little
tougher you need to focus a little more
on hitting the touch target just right
but otherwise this software feels just
like the standard s6 on the downside
that means to frequent app crashes and
intermittent responsiveness problems if
you're running one of Samsung's new
custom themes all of which seem to carry
varying degrees of lag along with them
on the brighter side it means blazing
fast performance if you stick to the
default theme as well as new and useful
touches like simplified quick toggles a
streamlined settings menu and the
excellent fingerprint scanner built into
the HOME key double click that home key
and you'll find the same minimal camera
viewfinder as on the s6 and it's driving
the same optically stabilized Hardware
two colors are saturated but not too
overdone contrast and sharpness lend a
little more punch to most photos and HDR
jumps in when it needs to to rescue
highlights from the shadows the wide F
1.9 aperture helps get focus and
preserve detail in low-light and the
front-facing cameras wide-angle lens
makes for a group friendly shooter if
you don't want to use the rear camera
selfie mode there are no special camera
controls along the sides as there were
on the note edge but that's not too big
a disappointment as I didn't find those
very useful anyway just as on its
conventional cousin the s6 edges camera
is one of the best you can buy on a
smartphone also like the s6 the s6 edge
probably won't last you a full day if
you take a lot of pictures or really do
anything that keeps the screen on for an
extended period at this point folks I've
been through three t-mobile units gotten
feedback from a colleague on Verizon and
seen enough other reviews to say that
the s6 and s6 edge have fair - poor
battery life keeping your services
updated helps disabling Wi-Fi calling
may help and keeping an eye on what apps
are running in the background is always
a good idea but I've never been able to
get much more than three hours screen on
time between charges yes it charges
incredibly quickly with the adaptive
charger in the box and the wireless
charging built-in is very convenient and
fun if you or your favorite coffee shop
use chi or PM a chargers but this is the
company that came up with the name wall
huggers to make fun of people who
couldn't last the whole day on their
phone batteries and if you're like me
you probably won't last the whole day on
the s6 edge not without intermittent top
ups if you're a desk jockey with a
wireless charging pad next to your
computer you'll be fine
if you need a long-lasting smartphone
for the road
a hiking trail the boat or really
anywhere not right next to a power
outlet this isn't it
fortunately for Samsung the s6 edge
measures up beautifully in other
performance aspects voice calls are
comfortable and clear gaming is no
problem web surfing is slick and smooth
on the stock internet browser s health
is as capable as ever for monitoring
your fitness efforts and the phone packs
all the hardware you need for wireless
transactions anywhere magnetic card
readers exist when Samsung pay goes live
anyway and while you can use the inbox
earbuds for gaming or rocking out the
loud bottom mounted speaker does a good
job of that too as long as you don't
accidentally block it with a finger
you
so the very first day I used this device
in public a railroad employee stopped
the official business she was doing
locked eyes on my review device and
cooed oh is that the edge that's why you
buy this phone it catches the eye better
than almost any other handheld out there
without being too ostentatious about it
and it uses the same feeling of quality
construction as its non edgy brother you
probably won't get much mileage out of
its fancy screen features and it's got
room for improvement in software and
certainly battery life but it's easily
one of the most beautiful smartphones of
the year thus far with one of the best
Android cameras ever it's not cheap but
the Galaxy s6 edge is a solid Buy

looks to match and you don't mind being

time this has been michael fisher
reminding you of the immortal words of
Hunter S Thompson the only people who
truly understand the edge are those
who've gone over it see you next time
