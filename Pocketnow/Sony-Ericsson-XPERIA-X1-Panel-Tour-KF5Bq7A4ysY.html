pocketnow.com
and this is the software tour part 1 of
the sony ericsson xperia x1 now the
reason that I'm doing this in two parts
is because there's a lot to talk about
in the first part which is right now I'm
going to talk all about the panel's and
how they actually work and then in the
second part we're gonna talk about the
programs and the settings and all those
sort of things that we normally talk
about so let's start off I'm going to
turn on the turn on the device and what
you'll notice is that the screen will
actually fade on which is a very nice
touch
kind of like the HTC touch diamond2 and
the touch pro and what you see here
right now is actually a panel it's the
standard Windows Mobile today's screen
panel ok so let me try to explain this
to you in Windows Mobile you have the
today's screen obviously you probably
know that which shows you your next
appointment and your tasks and your
unread messages and all that sort of
thing then if you want to get to a
program you go to start and you go to
programs and then go from there pretty
much right well Sony Ericsson is kind of
changing the way that we think about
Windows Mobile with the panel interface
the idea is that the date the Today
screen becomes a platform for programs
to run so you can have interactive
content or other little interesting
animated bits on your today's screen
kind of like an active desktop now the
reason you would want that is because I
think the idea is that your today's
screen is what you see when you turn on
your phone and if you can do something
else with that beyond the standard you
know Windows Mobile today's screen that
could be a really compelling offering so
let me show you some of these panels
that we can use to access the panels we
just press on the panel button here and
here they are you get nine panels you
can add more panels although right now
there are very very few panels I think
they're about two extra I'll talk about
all of the panels soon and if you rotate
the device to landscape you will get a
nice little animation that seems a
little bit choppy but I don't I don't
think it is it's kind of pauses in the
middle but I think it's supposed to now
we can choose a panel either by tapping
on it with our finger or we can use the
optical joystick to move around and you
get this little sound so let's just go
down the list to the different panels
and I'll explain what each of them does
so I'm gonna start off with this one and
it takes a minute
and what happens is that you get a
picture of the panel and then it
actually becomes active and the top and
bottom windows mobile bar comes back so
this panel I've configured a little bit
I have the the weather up here 48
degrees in Philadelphia I have the
pocketnow.com
RSS feed right here and the all shadow
comm RSS feed so this is a pretty useful
panel for me during the daytime when I
want to monitor the sites and see what's
what's been posted we can change a lot
of different things about this and by
the way I also have my next calendar
appointments listed right here if we go
into options from here we can change the
color scheme we can change the clock we
can change the city if we go over to web
feeds that's where you enter in the RSS
feeds that you want to monitor on your
todays screen which is pretty cool if
you think about it and over here on the
right side is launcher which dictates
which buttons you have to launch your
various programs you can add some speed
dial entries and that sort of thing so
that is the second panel it's pretty
useful for during the day time when you
have a lot of work to do let's go back
to the panel interface and by the way I
should mention you can change the view
of the panel interface by pressing this
button here and then you get this kind
of shuffle view we can slide your finger
or or I'm using my stylus and I think I
clicked on one there let's go back in
there so can use your finger to kind of
shuffle through them as if they were a
bunch of cards so let's go to the next
one this is the this is the fish panel
and I'm gonna have to read off of a
piece of paper the instructions that
come with it
to explain what this does so if you look
at this fish right here this this black
one it's called the Demick and the
fishes color will actually turn red when
the battery goes below 10% so that's
pretty cool if you look at this fish
down here that's called a walk in and
the fish's color is silver when the
sound is turned off so let me turn the
sound off and you'll see that guy turn
silver no see there it goes turned
silver the other fish which which just
came off the screen this one right here
is an indicator when there is an unread
message and you can see at the top of
the screen I've got a little mailbox and
there's another fish that's not on the
screen that will come on the screen if I
have a missed call so this is kind of
useful and it's got you know if you
touch on the screen the fish will
actually come towards your finger or
your stylus so it's a bit of a novelty
this may be good for the weekend when
you don't really care about you know
reading RSS feeds or something like that
and you just want to see the time and
the date and see if you have a missed
call okay so let's go to the next panel
I'm going to press the panel button
there and I'm going to go back to the
other panel view because I like it a lot
better I can see them all and we're
gonna go to this one over here now this
is a second version of the panel you saw
with the RSS feed on it although you can
customize it differently so here I have
two calendars set up for October
November I also have recent programs I
have my calendar so again this may be a
good panel to have when you're traveling
and you want to be able to schedule
dates easily by looking at two calendars
at once I don't know trying to make
things up here when you may actually use
them you can change the color scheme
these are the exact same options as the
ones that we looked at before so you can
have two panels doing the same things
just set up a little bit differently
okay let's go back into the panels okay
the next panel is super cool to the
multimedia panel which basically puts an
entire multimedia program right on your
todays screen and it really reminds me
of Windows Media Center I'm going to use
my finger here so I can flick my finger
I can go music video pictures hopefully
you can see that let me zoom in a little
bit I'm gonna go to videos so video and
I'm going to scroll down to that and I'm
gonna go to this one and then where it's
going to play a video and of course the
sound is off so we could demonstrate the
fish the fish panel but if you tap on
the screen you kind of get iPod like
controls and we can go back or we can
change the volume and let me let me turn
on the sound so that we can hear and
I'll go to a different video or actually
I'll go to the same video
very very good video quality with this
800 by 480 screen it's very beautiful
okay so let me show you the other bits
of the multimedia pane
because there is more to see so we can
go back quite easily by clicking on the
left side of the screen here we can go
to let's go to pictures and we could go
to the pictures on my storage card and
this takes a little bit of time it'll
show you a thumbnail of all the pictures
but after the thumbnails loads it gets a
little bit faster and you can flick your
finger up to kind of scroll through them
and to select a picture you just tap on
it and then if we press play we get a
photo slideshow a really nice looking
photo slideshow this is beautiful
beading in and out and everything okay
let's stop that I tap on the screen and
press the back button
very very finger friendly the screen is
super-sensitive it's working quite well
so let's go back here to music and we
can go to albums and let's go to this
one we get album art and you can
continue to work on your device while
this music is playing so I can go into
programs you know that sort of thing
really neat really neat let's see if
there's anything else that I wanted to
show you in the multimedia application
we can also go to games although we're
not going to cover that and in settings
we can make a few small changes to to
this multimedia panel we can change the
background and have it be animated so if
you watch that now you can see little
little icons floating around the screen
just a cool little effect alright so
that is the multimedia panel very well
done it's a fantastic media application
let's go back into the panels and
continue okay here is the FM radio panel
it's not a program on the Xperia it's
actually a panel and in order to get
this to work I need to
get my headset so I'm going to do that
up here and I'm going to switch it on
and it works really well you can do you
can do presets you can change the volume
use the speaker or the headphones so
it's really robust
easy to use FM radio program okay let's
go back into the panels and let's go to
the Google panel this is pretty neat
what it does is it puts a Google search
right on your today's screen and it also
gives you links to things on the bottoms
like Google Maps Google Mail Calendar
photos these three icons here will take
you to pocket Internet Explorer or opera
whereas the one on the Left will open
the Google Maps mobile application I'll
do that now comes up very fast and so
from here you can search Google and I
was thinking to myself is this actually
faster than just going to start Internet
Explorer favorites Google and typing in
something well you just heard all the
steps to do that yes it is faster to
switch to a panel press the panel press
the Google and start typing that some
one or two less steps than going the
long way so it's a it's an it's a needed
pane and I think it'll it'll help a lot
of people do faster Google searches so
let's go back into the panels and over
here we have the SPB show you may have
read in the news maybe on pocket now
that SPB has made a panel for the x1
customers for free and basically what we
have here is SBB mobile shell for free a
thirty dollar program for free if you
have an x1 and I love mobile shell
because it has gesture support so you
can swipe your finger to change the
panel on the left here we have programs
we can we can quickly quickly get into
the internet favorites by by going
through this it has very awesome
animations multimedia support so you can
quickly get to that kind of thing and it
has settings so you can change all the
animations if you want to turn them off
and then if we go to the center button
here we get the current temperature plus
we get notification alert so if we have
any email new SMS new cause they'll show
up here we also get the next list of
calendar appointments that are on the
roster and below that is a nice calendar
if you want to reference the day of the
week and to the right we have favorite
people so that we can dial by just
clicking on their picture or send them a
text message easily that way so this is
a free panel and it's basically a thirty
dollar program very good let's go back
into the back into the panel menu and
finally we have this last one that I
downloaded from the panel website it's
really crappy it's basically just a
viewer for your photos it's really a
waste of a panel because you can just
use the multimedia panel to do this or
you can just go straight into or you can
just go straight into my pictures okay
to change a panel you open up the panel
interface and you click this one in the
bottom right corner and then you choose
the panel that you want to change so I'm
going to choose this one and click in
the center again and then we get a list
of all of our panels and we can scroll
down and we could choose one that we
want to replace that one or if we want
to get more panels we'd click more
panels here at the top and we are taken
to a sony ericsson website let me show
you the panels that are out there now it
may be tough to see we have a - wire
panel which would be pretty cool if you
use - wire it's a very very cool program
second up we have SBB mobile shell which
we've already used the third one is cool
hunting which is a panel that doesn't
work it I don't even know what it does
but when I try to load it nothing
happens and on the bottom here we have
slide show panel which is the same thing
that you saw earlier with a slideshow of
the pictures and that's really it
there are no other panels right now and
it would be great if there were
additional panels of course and one
thing I want to mention before I sign
off all of the panels actually work
really well in landscape they're made to
work in landscape so here we have that
blue one that I showed you earlier and
if I flip it over to landscape it'll
reorient itself so that I can see
everything and there it is
so what do I think of the panel
interface well to be honest I really
like it I think it's a great idea to get
rich content on your today screen
unfortunately right now the selection of
panels is painfully limited to just a
few but I think at the developer
community and brain
as this whole idea the x1 could have a
lot of really really cool panels that
that make interacting with the device a
really great experience next up we're
going to talk about all the programs and
settings included in the x1 in the next
video so look out for that we'll be back
with more suit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
