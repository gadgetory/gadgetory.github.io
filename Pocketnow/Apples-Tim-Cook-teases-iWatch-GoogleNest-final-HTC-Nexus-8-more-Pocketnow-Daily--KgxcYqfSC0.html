be a new categories this year HTC and
Microsoft strike a patent collaboration
deal and Google's acquisition of nest is
now final according to the FTC I'm hi
Mary Mary and since you all do not want
any more beer jokes I'm just gonna have
to spend Friday drinking alone without
you guys this is pocket out daily let's
try stay off with some official news as
HTC has finally signed a patent
agreement with Nokia they did the same
with Apple but this time Nokia was
giving them a much harder time with the
whole codec thing of the audio on the
HTC One we know that and since no kit
now belongs to Microsoft which is one of
the biggest partners for HTC ever since
the time of the original pocket pc in
the year 2000 it is clear that we do
know where I this patent deal happen but
it's great for it to happen this allows
HTC to continue their innovation the way
that they can and speaking of Nokia the
company is now teasing us a new device
that will be announced soon though the
company is not really being very
specific as to what we're getting all we
hear is the engine of a car from
probably the 70s or something and it's
just rolling and rolling and telling us
that there is something cool that's
coming we are expecting for nokia to
launch a lot of products at mwc but the
problem is we don't really have any
significant press invitations for this
to happen so it's kind of weird we don't
really know what to expect from Nokia at
mwc they probably could have a separate
event so stay tuned and speaking of
press invitations Apple is rumored to be
launching iOS 7.1 until March and the
reason why is because apparently the
company wants to do it public and an
event that they plan to have in march
though the question is exactly what else
are we expecting for this event because
iOS 7.1 is not really that big a deal as
it turns out Tim Cook was just in an
interview with The Wall Street Journal
and according to him we will be getting
new categories to see or so could it be
that we get that in march in the past we
used to get iPads in March so let's see
what that is now let's talk about google
as taiwanese manufacturing sources say
that the company is building in nexus 8
and the nexus 8 is slated to be launched
by the end of april last for other
rumors that we already had but listen to
this taiwanese sources what else can we
expect
than HTC we heard the rumors yesterday
that the company was working on building
a tablet and most possibly a nexus
tablet so could it be that we're getting
that tablet early and the vape role
would be cool and HTC does need this and
finally for the hot news of the day the
FTC has now cleared the deal between
Google and nest Google now owns nest for
3.2 billion dollars a lot of money and
for those of you wondering if this is
only for the home project that Google
has not necessarily we know that Tony
Fadell the founder of nest is the father
of the ipod and a lot of the employees
from nests were actually ex Apple
employees so we are expecting for the
nest team to be in charge of Google's
future hard when Devers but that is you
to the question of the day what exactly
would you want this nest team to build
for google what exactly would you like
them to focus on because in my
particular case I would love a less
intrusive version of Google glass but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
