pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to talk about a potentially
revolutionary mobile application that is
amazing it's called word lens it's a
it's an application for iOS and what it
will actually allow you to do is convert
Spanish signs and Spanish text to
English in real time it doesn't have to
translate within seconds it happens
instantly we're going to show you right
now oh
ok so the ideas that you position your
camera over the item in question and
obviously we're not doing this with a
real son we're doing this with a
computer monitor sorry else's porfavor
la vie de las manos antes de tocar las
mias I don't speak Spanish I think that
means please wash your hands after you
touch las mias I don't know what that
means but anyway let's see how this does
please wash your hands before of touch
the the meows or I think it says the
mist so it translates it as best that as
it can it doesn't actually put it into
perfect English but what is amazing is
that it's in real time this is so
futuristic so I'm just holding up my
camera to the screen and it's
translating it in real time it's it's
almost adapting to the font of the sign
let's go to something else here that
one's a little bit too small let's blow
it up okay so let's see if we can do
that I don't shouldn't i'm not sure what
that says danger well let's see if the
application can figure it out for me
danger this magnet something it's kind
of going back and forth that one's too
difficult obviously it's not perfect so
let's have a the Sun petty petty girl no
entra should mean danger do not enter
and let's see how the app does danger
not among okay that's sort of close it's
just amazing how it's actually
inheriting the font of the sign let's go
to a security sign here I'm not sure
what that says so let's see what the
apps think that thinks it says warning
fingering with this facility is a
offense federal okay so it basically
says you know tampering with this
facility as a federal offense but it's
just amazing because again it's
maintaining the integrity of the sign
while converting it into relatively
readable English and of course here's
something more advanced it doesn't work
too well with this more Texas
manish poem because the font is so
strange what it tries to do is convert
some of the words not doing that good of
a job so anyway with this application
there's a five dollar charge to do each
language pack English to Spanish and
Spanish to English there's a lot of
other features here that we really
haven't gotten the time to mess around
with because this translation feature is
just so interesting and amazing if
you're traveling to another country or
if you ever need to convert things in
real time this is an unbelievable
application and I can't wait for it to
get even better again it's called word
lens and it is free although if you add
the spanish to english or english to
spanish it's five bucks really awesome
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
