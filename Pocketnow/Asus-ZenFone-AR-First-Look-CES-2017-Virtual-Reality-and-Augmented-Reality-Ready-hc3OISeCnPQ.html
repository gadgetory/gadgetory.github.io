sure virtual reality is a fun escape but
only there were a way we could improve
on the world around us
hog meant our reality if you will we got
our hands on this little beauty here as
a soos is touting the world's first
Google tango and daydream compatible
device the zenfone AR it all comes down
to this module back here a combination
of camera and location sensors which
help this phone track its actual
location in real space we've spent some
time in the past detailing Google's
tango augmented reality system and even
in early testing it shows serious
promise for changing how we might
interact with apps and services in the
future what's exciting here is seeing a
soos pair this tech with a killer 23
megapixel Sony camera sensor a
top-of-the-line Qualcomm 821 a 5.7 inch
quad HD AMOLED screen and up to 8
gigabytes of RAM though the table
display units only showed six still
progress though to top it all off
zenfone AR will also beat daydream
compatible taking phone based virtual
reality up a step
supporting the daydream headset and
controller otherwise this will be
familiar territory for zenfone fans
recently reviewing the zenfone 3 deluxe
this launcher will be familiar
unfortunately we couldn't dig deeper
into tango or camera tech here as the
pre-release software was fairly well
locked down considering the screen size
were treated to a fairly slim overall
design which compares well against other
phablet I'll always be happy finding
phones that focus on camera use and
handling that arrived with a grippy back
to help you hold on to it better we know
the zenfone AR will ship sometime in q2
of this year unfortunately we don't yet
have pricing or region information for
where exactly this phone will land or
how much it's gonna cost you until then
we'll wait with bated breath as we start
pushing more into AR content and more
phones which will help spruce up how
boring our respective realities are how
I long for the day I can use Terminator
vision while shopping at the gap as
always folks thanks so much for watching
