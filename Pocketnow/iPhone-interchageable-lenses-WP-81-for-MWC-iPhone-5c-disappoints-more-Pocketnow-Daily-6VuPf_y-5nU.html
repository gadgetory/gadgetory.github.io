interchangeable lenses and even an eye
pen stylus Windows Phone 8.1 my seats
they be along with a couple of nokia
devices at mwc and even though Apple saw
the staggering amount of iphones and
ipads that did not include the iphone 5c
I'm hi Mary that and can you imagine a
world with interchangeable smartphones
for every occasion I know I do this is
pocket out daily let's just lay off with
some official news as sony has just
launched a tablet down for their qx10
and qx100 interchangeable lenses for
smartphones to make them now tablet
compatible this is really interesting
this is just the mount that only allows
you to use these lenses on a tablet
which obviously allows you to choose
different type of tablets but then again
it makes you wonder I mean if these
lenses were really uncomfortable to use
on Sony smartphones can you imagine how
uncomfortable that will be on a tablet
leave us a comment down below would you
buy this would you use these
interchangeable lenses on a tablet now
let's talk about blackberry for all 10
of you BlackBerry users in the world
that are left the company has just
announced and launched update 10 point
to point one but this is not just the
dot one update it's actually quite
significant for example you can now
pinch to zoom in the BlackBerry hub and
get more details on your messages you
can also unlock your phone with a photo
which is really cool and aside from that
you're supposed to also get better
battery life and I don't plan to pull
out my z10 to try that out but leave us
a comment down below if you see any
significant differences linked to the
description for more details on the
update as well now let's talk about
nokia as unnamed but trusted sources say
that the company is planning something
big for mwc apparently the company is
planning to revamp their whole
smartphone lineup which is actually
quite big but with Windows Phone 8.1 ask
the operating system for these phones
meaning we get new phones for everything
with Windows Phone 8.1 so we are
expecting for this debut in hey
Microsoft does a big fanfare every time
at mwc they even rent a full hotel for
this so this could be cool let's just
see if that actually is as cool as we
think it'll be now let's talk about
Apple is the company's quarter results
are in and they keep breaking records
they're up 51 million iphones sold in a
quarter compared to last border with 47
and then they're also up 26 million
iPads compared to 22 which is
great but Tim Cook was very blunt about
the fact that the iphone 5c disappointed
according to him it wasn't as popular as
expected and I wonder what exactly were
they expecting where the difference from
the 5s of the 5c was just hundred bucks
a lot of people were just like hey why
not just get the 5s and I'm sure that's
what they did so hey cool numbers but
again they're budget-minded mentality
needs to get better and finally for the
hot news of the day Apple has just been
granted three patents that are kind of
significant first of all because two of
them focus on interchangeable lenses for
smartphone cameras which is the iphone
and the way these are better is because
these are apparently magnetic compared
to what we see right now from Sony and
the rumors from HTC so this is quite
cool but even more interesting is the
fact that Apple was also granted the I
pen stylus which would be better
according to Apple because it detects
your orientation when you hold the
stylus so apparently this will be more
accurate than what we currently get with
the S Pen and on Windows 8 but anyways
that leaves you see the question of the
day do you feel that styluses on for
example windows later the Galaxy Note
lineup should get smarter in my
particular case I'm not necessarily feel
that they should be smarter just they
should feel more natural but leave us a
comment down below what do you think and
