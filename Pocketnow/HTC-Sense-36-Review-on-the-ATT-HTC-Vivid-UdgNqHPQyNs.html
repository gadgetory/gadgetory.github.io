pocketnow.com and recently the HTC Vivid
from AT&amp;amp;T was upgraded to Sense 3.6
along with Ice Cream Sandwich so in this
video we're gonna take a closer look at
that new interface and operating system
and let you know what we think so sit
back relax enjoy the show the first
thing you'll notice in the 3.6 HTC Sense
is the lack of the curved Start bar down
in the bottom instead we've got
something that looks a little more like
the Ice Cream Sandwich launch bar by
default we have the phone the email and
messaging camera down here and those can
be swapped out by tapping and dragging
them away and adding new items in if you
leave an item blank it will change that
on the main lockscreen here as you can
see this item doesn't have an actual
circle for itself anymore if I drag that
item back in then it will appear again
on the lockscreen
your messaging reappeared so then if we
go back to go over here at this side you
can see there's a litem new item here we
can actually add folders those folders
can also be added to the start bar
although when you are at the lockscreen
all you will see is the folder and if
you try to drag that to the ring then
what will happen is it will open up the
folder instead of launching or allowing
you to see what's in that folder to
launch those applications a neat
function and thankfully it's not that
same horrible curved HTC Sense bar that
it used to be a part of this really the
new sense is very quick it Scrolls
around very quickly if you tap the home
button twice you get the full view here
from which you can swap back and forth
between the individual pages but you can
also tap and ahold to edit and remove
the screens around or add the panels or
remove panels something that's a little
different than the previous version also
if you tap and hold on the home screen
now you get the
task manager you know can a ez swap card
system that ice cream sandwich presents
but going here to settings which I had
opened before and go to about iPhone
about iPhone phone as you can see we're
running Android 4.0 3 and 3.6 for HTC
since the item you just saw previously
there was a screen lock and you can set
this to use the face unlock that's part
of Ice Cream Sandwich and it turns it
into kind of a double unlock system so
you still have to run through the HTC
Ring mode and then slide to unlock that
and then the face lock will pop up just
after that works just great no problems
didn't have any issues there if you pull
down from the notification menu it's
still split into two settings what's new
and different here is this little Wi-Fi
connected to the network and you tap
that and then go and see other networks
that are available in the area to tap as
well the capacitive buttons have been
maintained down here at the bottom they
still work the app menu is pretty much
the same you still have your same
buttons at the bottom and it still
Scrolls vertically rather than
horizontally so no big surprises there
the phone is exactly the same really no
changes there the browser has a kind of
some extra functionality to show you
that here now I have a back button as
part of that default menu which is very
useful and then the view as desktop site
has a new little checkbox that you can
grab from the settings menu there is a
beatsaudio option in the settings but
unfortunately unless you have a pair of
headphones plugged in that doesn't
automatically turn on it doesn't seem to
be activated necessarily by individual
parts and you can also see that there's
a while this menu has changed
you got the usage menu here it looks a
lot like the Ice Cream Sandwich other
than their they're a little bit of
skinning than going on there you can see
a little more of the options but they've
got some of those strange names for like
power instead of which shows your
battery level in the batter
use instead of the normal ice-cream
sandwich
wording apps and apps associations or
something that's different for HTC as
well and then there's the the button
this existed in the previous OS but the
AT&amp;amp;T software update is here as well and
not something that you normally would
see an Ice Cream Sandwich in that way
again performance wise it's been very
snappy the antutu benchmark shows that
it actually got a better score than the
previous version did you can also now in
under settings you can go into apps and
actually disable the apps some apps that
have been already installed on the
device by default so you can't remove
necessarily those those apps those bloat
but you can disable it which appreciate
that they didn't take out if you want to
personalize the home screen you can see
that in the settings you can also tap
and hold now on the main home screen and
you could add widgets apps and then
you've got your display and your some of
the other functionality that most HTC
Sense users are used to seeing really in
all it's not a terrible upgrade it does
give a lot of the HT city sense users
the ability to kind of recognize their
existing system even with the widgets on
the screen it keeps everything
relatively the same other than the Start
menu bar which I appreciate being
changed very much the differences in Ice
Cream Sandwich has have really been
hidden by the Sense layout which I would
rather see a more pure Ice Cream
Sandwich or like use of the Nova
Launcher system but HTC has made it very
clear that they don't want to alienate
or confuse their existing user base or
those fanboys who really do like HTC
Sense the new version of HTC Sense
Ornato is supposed to change a lot of
those features and functionality but
that's still a forthcoming release that
wraps up our overview of the HTC Sense
3.6 for the visit on AT&amp;amp;T you have any
