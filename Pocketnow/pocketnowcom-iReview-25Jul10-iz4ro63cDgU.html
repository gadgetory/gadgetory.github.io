market just one month everybody gets a
free case and the white iPhone 4 is
delayed again all this coming up right
now hello everybody I'm playing that'll
be then and welcome to the pocket now I
review a show where we go through all
the cool and then also cool inside the
world of Apple's iDevices let's start
off with the corner contrary to what
many of us believe that seems antenna
gate has really not hindered the iPhone
4 sales as much Apple has sold already 3
million units in just one month and it's
always been out in select countries
Apple's recent water results have Steve
Jobs claiming it's Apple's most
successful product launch in history
even though he later states hey we're
not perfect so let's see how sales
begins to add up as Apple rolls out the
iPhone 4 in other countries and let's
see how everything goes as antenna gain
gets solved eventually we go on to other
news our July 22nd Apple began to give
everybody who bought an iPhone 4 bumper
a refund and on July 23rd they began to
release this application that actually
allows you to choose a different case if
you didn't buy a bumper when you had the
chance whether it's a bumper or any sort
of equivalent offered in the app you get
it for free after you sign into your
iTunes account though it does take a
couple of weeks for you to get it this
app only works on the iPhone 4 so they
make sure you're not thinking that you
all want and you don't remember this
bargain ends up in September so be sure
to download the app from the app store
as soon as you can and get your free
case instantly
another positive news skype has finally
rolled out their updates to support iOS
4 multitasking for the iPhone 4 iPhone
3GS and the last generation iPod Touch
sadly this won't allow you to have voice
over IP background calls on the iPhone
3G or the first generation iPhone it
only works for the newer devices but hey
nothing's perfect you can actually leave
the Skype application open and just
leave it on the background they'll
actually get you chats background calls
and everything and just remember you
have the opportunity to be able to have
Skype to Skype 3 3d calls from now up to
the end of the year we're hoping that
eventually we're going to get any video
support considering the FaceTime feature
is actually an open application but
we're not gonna bet on that just yet
because it actually took them over a
month to get this up they roll the app
so anyways to continue on with the cool
here goes our App Store pick of the
hello everybody I'm hi Nelly then after
today's Pocket Mail app store pic we're
gonna be looking at the whatsapp
messenger which is a really cheap
internet based messaging system that
goes way beyond your typical MMS service
at a one-time fee on the positive side
it allows you to share images you can
also share video an audio note share a
contact and even share your location the
service allows you to switch your
wallpaper and modify the way your
notifications look even though it'll
keep the iPhones threaded messaging look
and feel on the negative side all this
requires whatsapp to be working meaning
the other end user also needs to have it
installed and currently running for it
to work it's currently limited to iOS
and BlackBerry devices and it costs $1
in the App Store and $2 in the
BlackBerry App World we hope you've
enjoyed today's App Store pick and any
questions or doubts twitter.com slash
pocket mountains that's it for now now
onto the bed your under Steve Jobs
claiming on July 16th we're gonna get a
white iPhone 4 by the end of the month
well it seems today's news state that no
you're not gonna get an iPhone 4 by the
end of the month you'll probably get it
sometime within the year we still don't
have a clear idea when we're gonna get
it we still don't have even have an idea
if it's gonna bring the same in
syndicator now they're probably taking
chances fix these problems before they
roll it out but anyways no white iPhone
or for now and on to other news uh is
this a band-aid I'm not really gonna
even comment on this I just yeah some
people I consider some people don't
really have good taste to bring in new
cases but anyways if they come out with
a spongebob or something so we could
probably consider it well I guess this
wraps it up for the week thank you for
watching our first ever pocket now I
review any questions or comments let us
know with twitter.com slash pocket now
tweets for youtube.com slash pocket now
video that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
