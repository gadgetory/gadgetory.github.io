on as far as processors epic touch 4G
offers the 1.2 gig or a Texan oates
dual-core processor the photon 4g comes
with the one gig hurt nvidia tegra 2
dual core processor both of them offer
16 gigabytes of internal storage both
can increase internal storage through
the use of micro SD cards of additional
32 gigabytes both offer one gigabyte of
RAM as far as Wi-Fi the epic touch 4G of
802 11 a BGN DLNA and support for HDMI
via a micro USB port and on the photon
4G 802 11 BGN support for DLNA and it
has its own physical HDMI out bluetooth
epic touch 4g version 3.0 support for
a2dp as well as high speed data transfer
photon 4G version 2.1 with support for a
two DP both of the phones off for gps
with support for a gps both can be used
as Wi-Fi hotspots operating system on
both is android 2.3 point for
Gingerbread and the user interface on
the epic touch 4G of Samsung's TouchWiz
four point oh and on the photon 4G it's
Motorola's motoblur let's boot up our
two combatants and see what's available
as far as RAM after boot on both we'll
start with the
touch 4g there we go and let's fire up
the motor roll up photon 4g there we go
yeah both of these are available on
sprint so take a look at this and make
up your mind as to which one you want
both of them are obviously
top-of-the-line smartphones
and the epic touch 4g is just about
loaded looks pretty good we'll go into
settings handling applications and we'll
go running services should have down the
lower right hand corner you can see
we've got 640 there about megabytes of
free memory out of a one gigabyte of RAM
and we're still waiting on the photon 4g
to finish booting up and it looks like
the epic touch 4g settle down 646 42
there abouts available RAM after boot
and again we're still waiting for the
cancel there there we go it's unlock it
let's go into settings applications
running services can we go down the
corner 517 megabytes of free ram let's
give it a second 516 520 so basically it
looks like you've got an excess of about
a hundred megabytes of more RAM
available after boot on the samsung epic
touch 4g than you're doing the motorola
photon 4g what do you say we get a
couple of our tests out of the way
squadron centered benchmark test and
let's kick it off got a good clean start
on both and we have our results and it's
em a little bit surprised by the epic
touch 4g down breaking 3000 but it was
our winner at 2868 vs the photon at 22
19 next up what's on the spark bench
test on both and we're off again a good
clean start alright and we have our
results and we have a split decision in
the cpu department our winner is the
epic touch 4g with a 39 59 verses a 3412
on the photon 4g in our GPU department
the motorola photon 4g is our winter
2773 versus a 2258 on the epic touch 4g
and last up let's run our limb pack
protests over in a single thread
and we have a winner it is the epic
touch 4g mega flaps 53.8 08 versus the
motorola photon 4g mega flaps 40 3.19
one time for artificial speed test
downloaded advanced task killer on both
let's go in and kill all the background
tasks back to the home screen and we'll
kick this off with a calendar that
looked to be the epic touch 4g let's try
maps and it looked to be the epic touch
4g let's go try camera on both think
that was definitely the epic touch 4g
certainly appeared to be that let's try
the phone app on both that was the epic
touch 4g let's do the market on both
they're both running off the same Wi-Fi
network i think that was the epic touch
4g I couldn't tell to be honest let's
try contacts that looked like a dead
heat I'm for me to tell and let's try
Fandango third-party again it couldn't
tell let's go to now here we go let's
watch this trailer so you can split up
first and play it
and our winner is going to be epic text
for just a little bit quicker is same
thing we saw the quadra Center benchmark
tests Marc Benson Olympic pro didn't
blow the proton away but it was
definitely quicker all right stop for a
gaming extravaganza do a little raging
thunder to to the castle course and this
is obviously the motorola Photon we'll
start off with that again I'm doing this
either through a camera or around the
camera so
alright there's a lap on our photon
let's take a look at the epic touch 4g
now we're off
alright there's a laugh on both alright
what do you say we wrap up today's
PocketNow face-off between the samsung
epic touch 4g and a motorola photon 4g
with our browser comparison kind of both
running up the same Wi-Fi network I've
clear the cache and history on both and
they are both fully enabled for flash so
what do we kick this off let's head over
to engadget on both pretty sure that's
downloading on both of these there it is
and we're off and it looks like a looks
like the photon 4g is out in front well
it's just cutting it up looks like it's
gonna be the photon 4g unless the epic
touch 4g comes back quick nope photon 4g
epic touch right behind it you can see
there's a big difference in the quality
of the user experience on the epic touch
4g it's just smooth as silk and you can
see the photon 4g once you get it
running it's pretty smooth but it's just
not as smooth as the epic touch 4g let's
double tap to zoom in seeing it will
look at the difference in the qhd
display versus a super amoled plus and
get a good look there as far as pinch to
zoom both very sensitive one thing you
can do here is double tap to rewrap oh
and we get a dynamic rewrap on the epic
touch 4g which is very nice it's not
available on the euro version of the
samsung galaxy s2 this so that's quite
nice alright well what do you say we
head over to the mothership and we're
off so round one was definitely a big
win for the photon 4g look at it just
tearing it up and we ended up at the
wrong version let's see if the epic
touch can come back from that all right
looks like they're about neck and neck
so the EPPA texts really come back
photon 4 g's a little bit ahead again
we've got a lot of flash load over on
the right-hand side of the page here and
that's the delay Wow look at our epic
touch 4g coming back up photon says it's
done but it really isn't boy I you know
I don't know I'm going to have to say
that I think that was the epic touch 4G
and you can definitely see the
difference in the the user quality of
the user experience it's just so much
smoother on the epic touch 4g it's
double tap to zoom in on both you can
see that the photon 4g is not handling
this near is well as the epic touch 4g i
chose a little comparison browser
comparison between our two combatants
today the samsung epic touch 4g and the
motorola Photon for gene I have to say
is far as a browser comparison the
samsung epic touch 4g was our definite
winner there really appreciate you stop
by to check out the face off again this
is craig for pocketnow.com don't forget
to hang in there for our video
comparison coming up next take care
