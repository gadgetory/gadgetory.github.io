with some great features but this isn't
the crown jewel device iOS fans are
looking forward to I may already spend
some time detailing his experiences with
the smaller iPhone 8 but the 8 + quartz
a slightly different audience trickier
this year to determine just who is this
device actually for is this premium
purchase going to feel like a
consolation prize here's our iPhone 8
plus review brought to you by deep brand
using this phone for a couple weeks my
opinion regarding the design hasn't
changed from our first impressions
because my opinion hasn't really changed
over the last four years and every day
feels increasingly dated in a world of
LGV 30's and note 8 and i'm still not a
big fan of glass back phones where
apples return here is at least for
practical reasons a change to introduce
wireless charging i am happy to report
that the silver variant is probably the
least fingerprint smudgey class phone
I've ever used - the Apple logo you just
won't see your finger grease unless you
shine a light directly on it still it's
this slick rear that contributed to the
phone's sliding out of my pocket while
crouching and from a distance of about a
foot cracking the top glass and denting
the aluminum it's not the most
confidence-inspiring and blending
further evidence to why I personally now
keep all my phones in a case or a skin
with a screen guard
I wouldn't get too smug Android fans in
a world of curved glass on all sides I'm
pretty confident most modern phones will
be similarly fragile what we can't fault
is the performance the a11 Bionic chip
set nicely leapfrogs welcomes best
offering and is only powering a 1080p
display the A+ is a screamer we're well
beyond just smooth UI navigation this
phone is gross overkill for covering the
basics easily chewing through graphics
intense gaming and represents a great
platform for future services like
augmented reality we have a separate
video on that but Apple's approach to
computational world awareness is really
compelling currently offering smoother
more accurate location than our project
tango hardware
this is the best way to introduce AR to
the masses an apple has the leverage to
make something like this stick to make
it cool in one phone release Google and
Microsoft are now playing catch-up the
rest of the changes coming to iOS 11
have been pored over though I should
reiterate how much I love the new layout
for the control center an apple should
be patted on the back for including
better file management for your various
cloud accounts Apple isn't about the OS
aesthetic touch square get app get the
OS out of the way we shouldn't be
surprised that this hasn't changed much
it's a feature not a bug though
combining the notification shade and the
lockscreen
can be a bit confusing notifications are
still messy and Apple still faces
challenges introducing force press
gestures there's no conveyance for how
it works and users just randomly have to
guess when they compress so basically
I'd never use it looking at the camera
most improvements are in processing and
storage not in actual quality of output
differences between the iPhone 8 and 7
are minimal if anything just slight
shifts to color processing and white
balance the 8 plus delivering just a
touch more saturation and warmer output
I am crazy excited to see HEV C is the
default though high-quality 4k video in
about the same storage space as most
Android phones 1080p even though Huawei
shifted to this compression with the
mate 9 only Apple could convince Google
to start supporting HEV C on YouTube and
in the Photos app so well done Apple 4k
video at 60 frames per second 1080p
slo-mo at 240 the iPhone 8 plus camera
is a frame rate beast the other major
software improvement comes to the
portrait mode with portrait lighting
it's not the kind of filter effect I'm
going to use a lot but it's a fun mode
to classy up your shots surprisingly I
haven't seen as many profile photos
using this effect as I would have
thought and maybe that's because this
phone isn't selling that well even
though Apple announced it in beta
it's working well enough considering the
processing and depth information now the
audio conversation is nearly identical
to the iPhone 7 plus the speakers have a
touch more bass but it's barely
noticeable
and the headphone playback is dependent
on the tunngle so that hasn't changed
and you can see our charts in the real
audio review if you're interested in the
nitty gritty lastly for all the
similarities reducing the battery
capacity on this phone is an odd move
more powerful internals more taxing
software runtime has been reduced over
our initial reviews on the iPhone 7 plus
it's still an all-day phone but it's
running leaner past dinnertime and I
honestly have concerns over this phone
aging over two years after my
experiences on the 7 plus we're happy to
know that this phone supports quick
charging but not including a fast
charger in the price is disappointing
recharging this iPhone on the included
plug is a bit of a chore so let's wrap
this up where's that leave us with the
iPhone 8 plus I'm still somewhat
struggling with who exactly this phone
is for many diehard iOS fans are waiting
for the iPhone 10 you can have that
horse powered today just in a stale
design without face ID and - some camera
refinements the converse you can get a
remarkably similar overall experience in
an iPhone 7 plus for cheaper this
shrinks the consumer demographic who
might be interested in this phone
especially as Apple is now actively
carrying five different models of iPhone
so we're not surprised that the iPhone 8
aren't selling out there is an idea of
legacy though folks watching this video
likely won't be bothered by Apple
removing the home button or moving menus
around but we all have family members
that might be upset by that change there
is a niche consumer looking for
something new but who doesn't want to
relearn navigation the iPhone 8 plus
will be a perfect fit for them and when
those family members buy this pricey
slippery phone make sure they have some
way to hold on to it deep brand has a
wide collection of skins and different
colors and textures to match nearly any
style protect against scratches and
provide more grip
