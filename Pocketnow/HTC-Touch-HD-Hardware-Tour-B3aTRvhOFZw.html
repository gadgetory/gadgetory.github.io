pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of the HTC touch HD the most
gorgeous windows mobile device that
probably we've ever seen with an
extremely large touchscreen now this
sleeve is what comes to protect the
device you can push out the device like
so and I think it's a really good idea
because with such a large screen you
don't want to be carrying that in your
pocket and where all your keys are kept
and actually the screen protector that
comes on the touch HD says the following
to prevent damage do not apply excessive
pressure to the screen or device case
please remove the device from your pants
pocket before sitting down for more
details see the Quick Start Guide so
they're they're really insistent that
you be careful with this screen because
it's got such a large area to it so
let's take out the device in and take a
look at the hardware features so as we
mentioned before the screen is three
point eight inches diagonal and that's
point three inches larger than the
iphone which has a pretty big screen
already the resolution is 800 down and
480 across that's the maximum allowed by
windows mobile if we look towards the
top here we see a light sensor next to
the speaker and also a front-facing
video camera now if we go down to the
bottom we have four hardware buttons and
they're all capacitive meaning when you
touch on them they don't press in but
there's actually a little bit of buzz
feedback that you get when you when you
touch the buttons the the vibrating
mechanism inside the device goes off and
it feels pretty good you know that
you've hit a button so we've call start
home okay or back and then we have call
end and that's really all you get using
this device with one hand is is is
doable but probably not so much as
compared to like the touch diamond or
touch pro where you have a d-pad and
everything like that so let's go over to
the side we have a large volume rocker
here that's really easy to feel for when
you're on a call on the bottom we have
the USB port the EXT USB port which
works with mini USB charging and syncing
cables which is great and then we have a
microphone here turning to the other
side it's pretty much clean except for
the stylus which like the touch pro and
touch a diamond is magnetic so if you
take it out the screen will turn on and
we'll cover the software later
if we go towards the top of the device
we have a a standby button which is
pretty large in size next to a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack which we
always like to see so we don't have to
use proprietary headphone connectors and
all of that sort of thing over to the
back we see that the back is covered
with that nice rubberized plastic so it
feels really solid in hand when you hold
it when you get after you get over how
large it is in your hand it is quite
large although it's thin but it does
feel good with the rubbery coating we
have a 5 megapixel camera and the only
other 5 mega mega pixel camera device I
know of that runs windows Mobile's the
samsung omnia and then we have a speaker
here and we can open up the back cover
quite easily to reveal the battery and
here's the sim card slot and
unfortunately the microSD slot is placed
behind the battery cover but that's not
too big of a deal so that's it for the
hardware tour of the HTC touch HD it's
really amazing to see such a large
screen such a high resolution screen on
a windows mobile device and I'm having a
lot of fun using it so far we're going
to talk a lot about software in the next
video and be sure to follow us on
twitter at twitter.com slash your pocket
now tweets for some exclusives and you
can find out before everyone else when
we post these videos will be back soon
