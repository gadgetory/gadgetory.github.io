in this release was supporting a set of
five finger little effects we're not
supporting through the arbitrary
programmable makers in this version so
these five affects your color the
technique to render window to create
different practical effects plus right
back to class what's under acceleration
3d rendering a 3d model basic effect is
familiar from the remix next video
versions we've had this class for a
while so we've done a lot of work to
optimize it for the phone it suppose
anywhere from zero to three directional
lights implemented as Dundon blend long
training model if optionally supports a
texture what's home and it supports a
vertex coloring and there are different
performance implications to which of
these things you turn on you look at
this table you'll see that without any
lighting enabled it's really cheap final
instructions and their verdicts one
instruction per pixel running on the GPU
if you turn on dress in one place that's
a valuation third vertex the vertex
crossed over 58 the pixel fast day is
very cheap if you can on the three life
that I'm even Warcraft religiously
there's only one lights three lights
that included two lights we don't have a
special
adjust to life if you tell on Exile
lighting which in performance tax write
down so we had excellent performance go
to weigh down the pixel cost jumps up to
50 instructions I can show you that in
action in this demo unit session soon
and after this tank isn't way that's
really quite a high quality very digital
model let's imagine a little bit at the
moment that using the three vertex white
smooth if i change that to be pixel ice
the fulness hasn't really changed
because it's quite small on the screen
so it's not covering very many pixels
but now we're going then you'll see that
the primary of the way down pixels and
we fix the lights of vegas that's not
really been run too fast change it again
as too much completely off
just one life that's with three lights
so amazing effect the capital things
lightly using things that is for all
scream all scream things that you fix
the lighting and expect that to run fast
then the model with the table here i'm
showing you is turning on a texture
doesn't affect the performance too much
turning on a bowl ads for its ruggedness
for the better shader that doesn't mean
don't you smile this time committed it
could be a great thing but don't turn 5
on all the time you don't need your
texture effect this time this is really
good effect of using on the phone the
thing about the mobile otherwise it's
not an xbox 360 it's a nice GPU if it's
look our compared to what you probably
used to seeing in a pc or any console
and the way to get rid lookin graphics
other chips habits that's how tall is to
pre-compute if you use the behind you
don't through the runtime so this guy's
into two textures with two different
sets of technical elements in blended
them together using a modulator to net
multiplied to them and then doubles so
that means you can / brighten the
textures contender colors brighter than
mid-grade the end of all will end up
Roger the first texture was so this is
useful for lighthouse it's useful
potential textures mr. Mohan here rotate
around its a simple 3d scenes lost but
under life that's the base texture very
uninteresting attend the texture offline
apart and you see the light not texture
free computer an independent different
areas of color in tins and shadows using
blowing chase if i multiply them
together in perfect lighting the great
thing about very much in resume is
appreciative ability it's just seven
inscriptions of the vertex and thick
subscriptions but nixle and you can do
pass fancy legends you want a fiercely
you can preview this impacts of miami
multi package so you can do registered
lighting make thousands of lights
interesting and it is still enormous
renderman will show you the alchemist
alpha test is the rejecting pictures
based on their alpha value so we'll test
me all the pixel is coming in and
disabled with that and special rights if
the offer is less than or greater than
or equal to that's quite ugly this is
really useful to billboard a million
hospice when you can take a complex 3d
shape tourism to a render target and
then brother Brendan onto the screen as
if it was in the 3d world using on the
desk associate occasional things
around of the tests on Windows Azure
often consider the performance
optimization it's only fun just just
telling you not to bother rendering
pixels that absolutely that's not the
case of info this is where our blending
it's free can you stop attending one
more time I'll everything that you want
on securing at all actually this GPU
architecture throughout the tech actual
cost you a few extra instructions
compared to not doing it what I'm going
to this demo this is shown in technical
depositors December an awful lot attacks
can spin around them good friends what
i'm doing here is i'm only have to bring
one time the dog and the screen in real
time this is a really cheap tempting for
a lot of games and you want to be
crouching with 1000 different people
just dropped eligible to bring the
targets and scatter cops all around the
world it's also greatly games where the
cover isn't changing too much because
you can do things like butter public
buildings bunch of trees and things but
in my auntie escape i'm going to draw
the comm building at all it's learning
to read the targets and then as long as
the camera stays in the same place every
frame Agnes brother Brendan soccer to
the screen from my player characters
around and not to rerender the building
from scratch so you can get the
Elizabeth Woodville complex geometry
than your actual memory
skinny event it's very simple it has the
same lighting model that's basically it
was wonderfully right with the same
performance characteristics one- faster
than three lights pixel lines probably
operational deployments mr. this vertex
hitting on the GPU it supports up to 72
votes and it supports like a 12 or four
way to the vertex and you can see from
this data that one way to the vertex and
fastest to way to the vertex and spend
instructions with legislature and going
up to four way to the vertex s 13
emotions just polish huge difference if
you want bradenton characters will wait
so obviously good that there is a
performance benefit to using fewer
finally this is the environment affect
disposed to making things with the chain
it has a couple of different moves what
is this he has an induced texture and
then it's samples of you get environment
of the top of that you can I do remember
to visit mobile apps on the fly dynamic
reflections well you can this brief you
have an environment that much here's a
typical set of what surrounds my scene
at the game world it's going to be used
for shiny objects it also be used with a
specular lighting to simulate very many
lights so whatever they i'm going to
turn all the environment off so you can
see the system static model have a king
map that contains this background image
rafting trip to scram my object since I
just turn up the environment that
molarity is just going to turn to
turbonegro reflecting surroundings and
see if it drops in the spray reflecting
in my new fon Fabre of the first 19 if I
they're fucked total this chromium
everything's absolutely elated I can't
end up renault factor what this does is
simulated property of light in real life
where when light strikes strikes shiny
object strikes it and on like this it
doesn't really reflect you much but its
life sprites comprising angle it comes
welcome looks very shiny so if i turn
the phone on our club you can see that
when you have faces the camera it
doesn't
effective at all but if it's been there
John that if it comes more shiny all the
object I can get a very subtle
reflection attempt another Paxman turn
the end my god you looking at the new
tenant specula see the reflective
manages the clit licked by a lot of very
bright shiny life well that's doing with
this controller is taking the other
child with you man multiply this color I
specified if I draw a little bottles for
Brad shapes into the other channel of my
team up against all the clutch back to
the life of the results through the
breeding really cheap Shana that leaves
just handled pixel instructions I'm
reading something that looks like things
live by thinking about 60 specular
lights on the same objects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
