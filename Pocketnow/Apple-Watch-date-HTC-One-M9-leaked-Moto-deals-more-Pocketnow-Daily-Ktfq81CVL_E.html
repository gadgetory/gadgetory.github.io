this time its end the amount of iOS
devices leaked images show us the
possible design of the HTC One m9 and
Sony's turnaround strategy includes some
layoffs it seems I'm Hyneman Rivera and
as that cold front leaves the north of
the United States we are just praising
ourselves this is parking out daily the
official news today have to do with
Motorola mainly the company's plans for
Valentine's Day and it's deals and
they'll be giving away as much as one
hundred and forty dollars if you spend
more than five hundred dollars at the
store or they will be giving you fifty
dollars if you spend 250 linked to the
description for full dates and times
they'll have it on the first week of
februari and if you've been wanting to
get the new Moto X trust me I highly
recommend the phone we all do actually
and it'll be a great time to buy in
other news that aren't yet official we
know that Sony is struggling as a
company to maintain its mobile division
and we've been hearing a ton of plans
for the company to turn things around so
heavily these news might not be positive
as we've heard of the Xperia z4 might
not make it to mwc and new reports are
the company is planning to lay off as
many as a thousand employees on its
mobile division because things are not
going well these are really bad news
hopefully the company figures something
out before doing that now let's move the
spotlight to some positive news with the
HTC One m9 we've heard that HTC is only
shipping decoys right now what the one
m9 looks like to have the press go crazy
Thank You HTC and the second thing is
that we've been hearing that it will
look a lot like the Nexus 9 and wealthy
land the first leaked photos from out
league so these renders uh because of
its source are believable but then I'm
gonna be look at them it's like if they
were made by you know to somebody that
follow the instructions of what we heard
so we're still skeptical over what to
expect for the one of nine but if these
design renders are true this phone will
be hot I'll talk about Apple the company
has got a ton of official new starting
with iOS 8.1 point 3 it fixes a lot of
bugs including the fact that you will
now not be requested to have so much
space available for you to be able to
upload your phone if you're using a 16
gig phone or something
like that or a tablet as well but in
addition to that the company has already
made an official that it just broke
another record it sold 1 billion iOS
devices and just to give you an idea
back in 2010 when the company announced
the iphone for Steve Jobs mentioned that
they had sold their 100 millionth iphone
back when that was the only iOS product
in addition to the ipod touch so now
it's 1 billion iOS products including
iPads obviously and the winning phone
was a 64 gig space grey iphone six-plus
though no information was provided but
yeah I've was broken a lot of the record
and uh we'll see how things go looking
forward as mwc could probably bring us
some really good competition and
probably for the very interesting
official news of the day tint cook
actually gave us news of what to expect
for the Apple watch during his
conference call where he talked about
the 1 billion iOS devices in addition to
all the sales and everything and he
mentioned that the apple watch will be
ready for shipping in April not
announcement or second look or anything
shipping in April we were expecting for
this to happen in March and probably we
will see some sort of it happened before
that to talk more about what the Apple
watch can do we're sure that Apple is
going to play it that way but it leads
me to the question of the day are you
holding out for the Apple watch is this
product the the one you're getting or
have you already got another SmartWatch
or you simply don't want a SmartWatch at
all because in our case I'm going to
pass on generation one because uh we've
known that Apple is great for second
generation products the ipad 2 is much
better than the one the iphone 3g was
much better than the original iPhone etc
etc but leave us a comment down below
