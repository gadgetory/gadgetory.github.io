its Lumia device family here at the tail
end of 2012 including some highly
customized versions of its mid-range
Lumia 820 today we're going to review
one of them for Verizon Wireless I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our quick review of the Nokia
Lumia 822 as we mentioned in our earlier
hardware tour and comparison videos this
is a 142 gram 11 point 2 millimeter
thick device that combination of
relative light weight and relative
thickness gives it a toy-like feel in
the hand and that's exacerbated by these
sheer sides and sharp edges its body
reminds us of the plastic II feel of the
galaxy s3 but the added thickness
actually helps it sit better in the hand
and the added roundness compared to
t-mobile's Lumia 810 variant means it's
quite a comfortable device to hold even
if it occasionally feels and looks like
a starter phone for preteens in exchange
for that aesthetic sacrifice you get a
removable battery cover and removable
1800 milliamp hour battery as well as
expandable microSD storage to shore up
these 16 gigs of internal memory that's
in addition to a dual-core Qualcomm s4
CPU backed by a gig of ram an 8
megapixel camera and LTE support for
Verizon's 4G network the 820 2's display
is a 4.3 inch AMOLED panel that delivers
excellent deep blacks and highly
saturated colors in addition to
impressive off angle view ability its
resolution is quite low though at 800 by
480 and that's only going to look
fuzzier over time as higher resolution
panels flood the market in all the Lumia
822 packs Hardware that's perfectly
capable of running Windows Phone 8 in a
package that feels good in the hand even
if it does resemble a bar of soap and
the hardware runs Windows Phone 8 with
the now-familiar degree of silky smooth
alacrity Windows Phone 8 runs as well as
its forerunner on every device we've
tested it on and the a.22 is no
exception Verizon has loaded it with
some of the usual bloatware but the
Windows Phone data sense compression and
maintenance utility is also here which
will make those on tight
cheap data plans happy from day-to-day
homescreen scrolling with many updating
live tiles to browsing an Internet
Explorer 10 to flying planes and rise of
glory performance is top-notch if you
took the differences in displays out of
the equation you'd be hard-pressed to
tell the differences in software
responsiveness between the 822 and a
higher-end model like the HTC 8x or the
Lumia 920 Windows Phone is just that
consistent that consistent performance
continued in our test period with the
822 delivering well on the core tenets
of the mobile phone experience calling
was solid both over earpiece and
speakerphone data speeds over Verizon's
LTE network were speedy and reception
was up to par and battery life was quite
good the 822 lasted one hour and 58
minutes on the WP bench stress test
that's lower than the Lumia 920 score of
two hours and thirty minutes but the 822
was also a real champ on standby lasting
over 25 hours with light use even over
LTE as on the Lumia 810 the camera was
an unexpected high point of the
experience even though it doesn't have
pure view branding or the optical image
stabilization of the Lumia 920 the 822
shooter delivered good stills especially
when we made use of the scenes
functionality in the photo settings menu
it's not a camera that automatically
adjusts to every situation perfectly but
once you get used to using scene mode it
can deliver some really nice shots for a
smart phone especially in low-light the
Lumia 822 is the first Nokia device on
Verizon Wireless in quite some time and
it's part of a long overdue Windows
Phone resurgence for the carrier it may
not have the good looks or pizzazz of
the higher-end HTC 8x and it's screen is
definitely yesterday's news but it's the
value-adding nokia exclusive apps and
Nokia's build quality that make it a
device to consider especially for a
Verizon's current $49.99 contract price
we give the Nokia Lumia 822 a 7 out of
10
