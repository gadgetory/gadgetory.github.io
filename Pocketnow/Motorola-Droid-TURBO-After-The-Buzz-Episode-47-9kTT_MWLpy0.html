over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's take another look at the most
hight droid of the past five years I'm
Michael Fisher this is the Motorola
Droid turbo and this is episode 47 of
after the buzz the Motorola Droid turbo
can be thought of as the bigger brawny
er cousin of last year's excellent Moto
X in the States it's exclusive to
Verizon Wireless which means at least
some folks in need of a durable long
lasting smartphone probably switched
networks to get it did they make the
right call
well the specs have certainly aged well
the Snapdragon 805 was one of last
year's most powerful processors and
backed up by three gigs of ram and 32 or
64 gigs of on-board storage it holds up
well under the processing load of the
newer Android version the turbos running
today tossin a 5.2 inch quad HD display
and a 21 megapixel camera and the turbo
certainly isn't hurting in terms of raw
hardware it's durable - whether you
sprung for the metallized glass weave or
the ballistic nylon version we've got
here you've got a pretty beefy phone
that doesn't mind being tossed around
even if that includes a little
splish-splash
and motorola has recently introduced the
new color options as well adding the new
silver finish with colorful trims and
bringing the 32 gig storage tear to the
ballistic nylon version as well but just
as the high points have persisted so to
have the low ones it never made much
sense to me to toss a quad HD display
onto a device built for rough usage
short Samsung did it but its displays
get really bright if they need to
the droid turbo screen is beautiful and
crisp in the shade more indoors but
outside at high noon you're not going to
notice its resolution because the panel
just doesn't get bright enough to
overcome direct sunlight the side Keys
are mushy the speakerphone collects dust
like a moon crater and despite the new
paint job the boxy chassis has a
distinct lack of charm also Motorola's
software value adds don't tend to age
very well while it's great to be able to
address your phone without touching it
the whole experience is pretty slow
hello computer what's up hi there the
time is 1234 p.m. you have 4 Gmail
messages waiting for your review the
last message was sent at 12:28 p.m. by
the same token having your text messages
read aloud to you and then being able to
dictate a reply is awesome but again
it's sluggish and not very reliable
even in a quiet room new text from VW w
listen listen listen sorry can you
repeat that to hear it now say listen
listen listen VZW said finish this video
so we can hit the beach men to reply to
VZW say send message send a message see
your message alright give me a second
period cool your jets exclamation point
I think you said all right give me a
second cool your jets is that correct
yes yes great I'll send that now
these are features we absolutely adore
but Android doesn't seem able to keep
them snappy and consistent over time
which is a shame
fortunately Motorola's other
conveniences like gesture controls are
as useful as ever
double chopping the phone like an axe
now turns the flashlight on or off while
double twisting it launches the camera
as always speaking of the viewfinder is
still pretty bare-bones and awkward to
shoot with and the turbo isn't the
fastest to focus either which makes
low-light photography harder than with
other phones shooting side-by-side with
the galaxy s6 active the Samsung carried
the day in most circumstances but you
can still get some solid stuff from the
turbo its manual exposure targeting can
be helpful in split lighting scenes when
you don't want to use HDR it's capable
of some impressive macro and bouquet
style shots
there's burst mode if you're trying to
freeze a moment in time and high frame
rate video if you just want to slow it
down also the high resolution means you
can zoom in quite a ways before losing
definition if you find the best lighting
and the perfect moment it's actually
capable of some beautiful shots whether
you're using the main camera or the
selfie shooter you just don't expect the
kind of versatility you'd get from a
galaxy s6 iPhone 6 or a late-model Lumia
especially once the lights go down the
droid turbo still has one of the biggest
batteries on the market as big as the
one on the phone that wouldn't die the
huawei ascend mate - but where the
Huawei phone gave us 9 hours of screen
on time per charge the droid turbo
barely gives us half that even putting
it up against a phone with a similar
screen size and resolution the galaxy s6
active if the drug turbo usually doesn't
last as long despite having a larger
battery whether the culprit is
Motorola's always listening voice pick
up some unseen bit of Verizon bloatware
Android lollipop or something else we're
not the only ones to notice and we're
surprised it hasn't been ironed out in
the nine months since release because
while yes the wireless charging is nice
and the wired turbocharger is fast no
phone with a battery this big should die
this quickly especially not when it's
being sold as a 48-hour smartphone I'm
in a weird spot I can't figure out how
to end this episode because I don't
really know how I feel about the Droid
turbo that gets the closest I can get is
it's fine I mean some aspects are great
the durability the display resolution
the Moto features the front firing
speakers placement even at times the
camera but the software is still wonky
and prone to buggy behavior the speaker
isn't as loud as it could be an actual
battery life is a far cry from potential
battery life the Droid turbo is still
the best rugged smartphone in Verizon
Wireless as portfolio so if you're
married to big red and need a
rough-and-tumble stack packed companion
right now it's still the best option but
if you're willing to wait or you're
willing to jump carriers other better
options are definitely out there and
Motorola zone sequel is likely just over
the horizon keep that in mind as you
head to the phone store if you're
wondering how other smartphones and
wearables have fared over time check out
