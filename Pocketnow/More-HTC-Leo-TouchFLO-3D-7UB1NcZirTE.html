pocketnow.com and this is another look
at touchflo 3d 2.5 build 1919 the build
that we think is going to go on the HTC
leo a lot of people really liked what
they saw on our previous video that
showed the general functionality now
we're going to go a little bit deeper
into some things that we've found along
the way with some further exploration at
the end of this video we'll post a link
on the video to the previous video tour
of the HTC leo rum so let's take a look
as mentioned in the previous video we
can change the wallpaper to do a few
different things and let's go through
those more more so in depth now so we
have the weather wallpaper which as I
mentioned will actually show you the
weather condition in an animated fashion
and for some reason you have to open the
start menu to make it happen so here it
comes clouds kind of fly in if it's
raining you'll have raindrops and what's
interesting on this rom is I didn't set
my location it automatically set my
location it knows that I'm near
Philadelphia in Pennsylvania and it
automatically adjust the time and the
weather to my locations so very cool
let's take a look at the other
backgrounds that we can choose we have
several animated wallpapers to choose
from and we showed you just one in the
previous video so let's go to this first
one here it's kind of a purple
background and you have to wait a minute
to actually see the animation come
through and you can see it right here
it's a some light moving up on the
screen very subtle animations which is
good because you don't want it to be too
distracting and you can see kind of the
shapes kind of moving in the background
let's flip to the next animated
wallpaper this is my favorite we've seen
this before you get kind of little small
colored dots bouncing around on the
screen kind of like colored water
droplets there they go and of course the
clock and all of these icons are
slightly translucent so you can actually
see right through the background and
let's look at the final animated
wallpaper which probably is the most
subtle of them all and we just get sort
of splashes of color in the background
now obviously you can have just a static
background if you want or you can have
the animated wallpaper now let's go over
to the weather tab and I can jump right
there by tapping on the
other icon we have something new here
and all the other versions of touchflo
3d you can flick your finger to go to
the other cities that you have listed
here but the problem is what if you have
number 7 said it's something that you
want to be number two well now you can
actually rearrange those and let me show
you how to do that go into menu and this
is new rearranged locations so now kind
of like the Settings tab that lets you
move around the touchflo 3d tabs you can
do this with weather so you can move
Tokyo to slot number 2 and click done
and now slot number well actually its
slot number three is Tokyo now if you
notice on the first on the first weather
display there's a little icon that shows
kind of a compass this shows that this
is the location you're currently at so
presumably if you travel to another city
your device would automatically detect
that change the weather change the time
if necessary and automatically update it
pretty cool and one final thing to note
from this rom if we go into personalized
we can now change the background of the
Start menu so right now I have this this
kind of green and orange wallpaper set I
can change that so it's actually called
the lock screen wallpaper and so let's
choose just the sort of gray background
nice and solid this is also the new
waiting cursor for the HTC leo if we go
to start menu we get the we get this new
wallpaper and if you go to the lock
screen it's also going to be present
there so again that's just another quick
look at some other features of the HTC
leo rom on touchflo 3d 2.5 about 19 19
if we find more things to show you will
make another video and be sure to check
out our previous tour of build 19 19
which walked through the Twitter
functionality and a lot of other new
changes the link is on the video right
now that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
