now calm and I'm really excited I'm
excited because for the first time in my
tech media career I get to do a phone
giveaway I get to give away a phone
that's so much fun and thanks to the
awesome people at Samsung who are really
awesome I don't just say that the phone
we're giving away is awesome this is an
AT&amp;amp;T branded blue 16 gigabyte samsung
galaxy s3 and it could be yours this has
not been unboxed I've just made sure
that the phone is inside so you'll have
your own little unboxing and it's your
own little private thing this could be
your phone here are the contest rules
sorry this is a u.s. contest only this
is an ATT branded device so you would
better be willing to switch to ATT if
you're not on it already here are the
rules the contest starts on Monday the
16th today it ends on Friday the 20th so
it's five day contest and it ends on
Friday at eleven fifty-nine p.m. here's
how it works each day during the contest
period one post somewhere at
pocketnow.com will feature a hint at the
end of it it's a hint word and would
look something like this that hint is
one word so at the end of the week you
should have five words one hint per day
stitch those words together in the right
order to make the sentence we're looking
for and send that sentenced to us at
contest at pocketnow.com will drop the
link in the video description for you if
you're not seeing this on our site
remember that there's only one hint per
day and it could be on any of the posts
at pocketnow.com for that day so you
know read all the posts will take all
those submissions will shake them up and
you know randomize them we'll pick a
winner and we'll announce that winner on
Monday the 23rd at noon that winner will
receive this blue 16 gigabyte AT&amp;amp;T
samsung galaxy s3 valued at I think 5 49
99 fo free so that's pretty cool
seriously it's awesome i'm very excited
to give this phone away to you stalock

read all the posts get that code
sentence to us by eleven fifty-nine on
Friday the 20th I'm very excited thank
