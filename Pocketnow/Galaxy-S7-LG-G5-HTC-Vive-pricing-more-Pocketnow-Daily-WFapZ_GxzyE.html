the hottest phones of the years will be
hcc comes clear about the pricing and
availability of its five headset and it
seems that nokia wants a nothing to do
with smartphones at least for now I'm hi
Mary then and the problem of jet lag is
there is nothing positive with it but
reporting from Barcelona this is pocket
out daily the hottest news have pretty
much already happened you followed our
youtube channel we already have a crazy
amount of videos already uploaded of the
galaxy s7 and the LG g5 the alcatel idol
for in addition to some new devices
coming from HTC I'm not even going to
bore you with specifics there is just
too much to talk about we would love to
know in the comments so far which one is
your favorite and speaking of the galaxy
s7 for those of you interested in
getting this phone both sprint and
t-mobile have already laid the grounds
over waste to get it particularly
t-mobile is probably offering the best
deal you get 12 months of netflix in
addition to a six pack of games that
will take advantage of that free gear VR
that you're actually getting and then in
the case of Samsung if you want to get
more than one galaxy s7 you'll have the
advantage that that one will be pretty
much half off which is definitely a
great deal more details in the links in
the description now even though we are
not surprised that nokia has not really
launched the phone the company has come
clear over what we can expect from it
yes we do have the nokia and one tablet
we were expecting to see at least
something here at mwc but as it turns
out the company's CEO has disconfirmed
the company is working hard on working
on getting suppliers on getting the
right design they will be making the
design just getting a partner in China
it seems that it still could be Fox
Connor probably not but the point here
is that we might wait for a little more
than twenty sixteen that was probably
the only major news from Nokia sadly and
then on the San Bernardino case where an
iphone has to be hacked in order for the
FBI to gain more information it seems
that the agency was able to reset the
password of the iCloud account and
obtain access to certain backups the
only problem is that now they're looking
for a proprietary version of iOS
it seems that a judge already ordered
Apple to build it in order for these
backups to be able to be loaded on this
phone oh this just gets to be more like
a soap opera but paint there is some
progress it seems and finally the
hottest news today we believe had to do
with the HTC vive the company has now
come clear on price points and
availability and you know it's less
expensive than we thought it'll cost you
799 you're getting the headset you're
getting the controller's you're getting
the sensors is remember this is not you
just your typical gear VR this is really
a full-blown virtual reality area where
you actually need a room to play with it
it's really cool the problem is you know
hey 799 plus a nine hundred dollar
computer in specifications can be rather
steep so it does lead me to the question
of the day would you pay for an HTC vive
do you consider that the price tag and
everything is compelling enough for you
to get it because in my case honestly I
thought it was going to be more
expensive I thought that they were going
to go over the thousand dollar threshold
and for 799 I would pay for it I
honestly would but leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends as always you know the
way it goes if you want to get these
