going to actually be taking a look at
the software tour on the storm two from
Verizon Wireless so let's go ahead and
take a look at the software and compare
it with the original storm so let's go
ahead and begin the software comparison
between the storm two which is on the
left hand side with the subdue tungsten
light chrome edges and the original
storm on the right hand side which has
the shinier chrome border on the
software side it looks like a little bit
has changed since the storm one or the
original storm was released on the top
you see Verizon Wireless now uses a 3g
indicator on the left hand side with a
blackberry logo to show that it is
connected to the blackberry server to be
pulling or receiving push email on the
right hand side you see the capital one
xev to show that it is on the evdo
network which is a 3g network that
Verizon Wireless uses and the capital
letters actually shows that it is
connected to the blackberry server so
you will be receiving push email aside
from the aesthetic differences let's go
ahead and take a look at the software on
the new storm if you're actually on the
main screen if you tap down the icons
globe it won't stay lit on the original
storm if you tap down the icons will
stay lit however if you are in the icon
screen if you tap they will continue to
stay lit on the new storm two on the
storm to the SMS application has changed
a little bit pictou graphically and also
the media application or icon has
changed somewhat compared to the more
cluttered media application icon on the
original storm so let's go ahead and
take a look at the browser and see
health in a non-scientific test the
browser rendering I have enabled
JavaScript on both browsers and we're
going to go ahead and go into the
bookmarked page and view the pocket now
home page on both devices and see which
one finishes first were on 3g on both
devices so let's go ahead and give it a
go
looks like the original storm is getting
a head start
and it looks like both pages are popping
up at the same time
and it looks like the original storm
actually finishes first and this is
basically the same experience that I've
had playing with the device it looks
like the original storm actually renders
a page a web page a little bit quicker
more quickly than the storm two let's go
ahead and zoom in a little bit and we're
going to go ahead and take a look at the
pocket now home page to actually zoom on
the storm two you can actually zoom in
with the icons on the bottom of the
screen you can hit the + to zoom in or
the minus to zoom out or what you can do
is just tap on the screen in the text
area and it would actually zoom in
however if you tap on a link it will
actually take you to the link so be
careful if you're trying to zoom and not
tap on the link also with the storm to
you actually let's go ahead and go back
out to the menu screen you actually have
kinetic scrolling so you can actually
flick and scroll like on the iphone that
will be actually available for the
original storm via a software upgrade
package in the future but if you just
flick and scroll it would actually take
you a lot further through your list than
on the storm one which will actually
just pause let's go ahead and take a
look at the scrolling on the storm one
go ahead and go back out so if you
scroll it would actually just pause in
the middle of the list here and then you
can continue to scroll but there's not
that kinetic action which takes you
through on the storm two on the storm
two there's also another application
that comes with the device that we have
seen on the HTC imagio which is a
windows mobile 6.5 device for Verizon
Wireless that program is called city ID
which allows you to actually look up the
city and state if you know the area code
and phone number or if a caller calls in
it would actually show their city &amp;amp;
state location on your caller ID display
so that's a cool part with the city ID
application there's also now cut copy
and paste so let's go ahead and look at
this web page it was actually a link
that we clicked on earlier from the
now page but in order to activate cut
copy and paste you just place two
fingers on the screen actually that just
zooms in see just place two fingers on
the screen and it will bring up I'm
going to go ahead and zoom out actually
and it will bring up these indicators so
you can actually move the indicators the
top one and the bottom one a shame let's
go back to the pocket now homepage
but basically cut copy and paste will
give you two indicator so you can move
the top one and the bottom one to select
the amount of text that work that you
need to copy and then there are icons on
the bottom here which will show up in
the right context so that you can
actually select copy or cut so let's go
ahead and zoom in a little and tap with
two fingers okay actually not
cooperating
so you see one of the indicators here so
you can actually move that indicator
there and then there's a bottom
indicator here and then to cut copy and
paste here you see the icons on the far
left you have the cut icon the next one
over right here is the copy and then
here it would just cancel your selection
so you just tap on the screen you don't
actually have to click down because if
you click down it would actually zoom so
you just tap and then you can just move
the indicator selector icons to select
the right amount of text and then you
can actually tap again and it will bring
up the menu so here let's go ahead and
just copy and then if you don't want
that you can just cancel the selection
and it will return your screen back so
aside from kinetic scrolling we now have
cut copy and paste in a finger friendly
gesture menu on the storm two and this
is a brief look at the software tour of
the verizon wireless blackberry storm 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
