worth the upgrade from the iPhone 5 hey
guys its brand a minimun from pocket now
in this video we're gonna compare the 5s
with the 5 let's get to it
ok so we're gonna do a bunch of speed
tests and really see if there's a
difference but first let's talk about
how these guys look from the front here
on the iPhone 5s we have the fingerprint
sensor down here surrounded by black
metal now if you get the silver version
this will be silver or the gold version
this will be gold which actually looks a
lot cooler on the silver and gold models
because on the black it kind of blends
in it doesn't really pop like it does on
the silver and the gold models now if we
kind of move this in the light you can
see that the home button is now flat and
it really doesn't feel flat because it
still dips in a little bit whereas on
the iPhone 5 and every other iOS device
we get that concave home button which
feels nice because you can feel for it
very easily but similarly you can do the
same on the iPhone 5s because you've got
a little Ridge here the the metal sticks
up just a little bit besides that
looking at them from the front you
wouldn't be able to tell the difference
unless you had color variation going
over to the side they are the same
exactly the same on the back you do see
another difference back here the cameras
are a little bit different we've got a
smaller lens on the 5 slightly bigger
lens on the 5s and you can kind of see
that in the light we've also got that
dual LED flash there is an amber flash
and a white flash only a white flash on
the iPhone 5 what this will do is take
pictures that don't come out really like
bright white and we're going to do a lot
of camera tests comparing these in the
final review so you can see if that
actually makes a difference and it
really really should now we're gonna
turn on these devices at the same time
obviously we're looking for the 5s to be
significantly faster than the 5 it's got
a 64-bit chip which really should make a
difference so let's turn them on and see
which gets on first they're set up with
the same backup so they're really
running the same apps let's check it out
one two three and the iPhone 5s is
already off to a faster start and in iOS
7 the boot animation matches the
of your phone so black and white okay
and the iPhone 5s got to the lockscreen
faster significantly faster than the
iPhone 5 and there we are and right now
it actually appears as if the brightness
on the 5 is higher so let's just
equalize that for the sake of making
this a fair video and I'm just going to
turn on full screen brightness and right
away you can tell that there's no
difference between the screens we've got
a different wallpaper sure on the 5 but
if you look at like the Starbucks icon
and the calendar icon they're both the
same amount of brightness so what we
want to do now is open up some apps and
see if there's a difference with the
iPhone 5s so we were just in settings
let's do that again
absolutely no difference there go back
to the home screen let's open the
Weather Channel app a little bit faster
on the 5s definitely faster on the 5s
let's go to Safari and we're gonna bring
up pocketnow.com here at the exact same
time 5s got it done a lot faster still
going on the 5 and this is kind of funny
right because the 5 is a very very fast
aah-ha phone and let's scroll down the
page and see what it looks like see if
we get any sort of checker boards or
anything like that very smooth on both
though it looks like it's slightly
faster on the 5s let's go to another
webpage will bring up favorites here
let's go to the verge go it was actually
faster on the iPhone 5 there let's go to
another page let's go to and gadget
mobile missed that so instead we'll go
to Gizmodo and they're off and iPhone 5s
finished slightly ahead of the five now
let's launch the camera app that's
always super important that always seems
to lag a little bit so one two three go
exactly the same that's amazing but here
on the iPhone 5s we have this new slo-mo
function where else we don't have that
on the iPhone 5 because it takes a
little bit more of that processor to get
there let's do a double tap on the home
screen exactly at the same time there
are just really small differences one
place you'll definitely
definitely notice it is in gaming
especially games that have been
optimized for 64-bit asphalt 8 has not
been optimized for 64-bit but it gets a
huge bump in loading time on the 5s so
one two three go so you can see splash
screen happened first on the 5s so
that's pretty pretty a pretty big
difference there I clicked on that one
first and let's load the race and we'll
play a little bit of the game and see if
we notice the difference this is the
most graphically intense game I can
think of for iOS right now we're a
little bit ahead here on the 5s I'm
gonna try to play both at the same time
no I'll do one at the time so here's the
5s usually pretty terrible at games but
I actually should be pretty good at this
one I play it a little bit too much so
graphics look really fantastic get the
splatter effects on the screen and
really no choppiness let's check out the
the iPhone 5 here which is on mute and
similar performance perhaps it's really
tough to tell I'd say that they're
probably about the same and that's
because it's not optimized for 64-bit
but we do get faster load times on the
iPhone 5s definitely another thing you
get on the 5s that you don't get on the
5 is fingerprint ID our touch ID as
Apple causes so we can back out here and
go into general and you can find the
fingerprint passcode stuff down here we
did a separate video on that and we'll
link you to that but basically with the
iPhone 5s you can save some seconds by
not having to type in a password for
high tunes when you're downloading apps
and for when you're getting into your
phone from the lockscreen you don't have
to put in your password if you have one
it's a time saver if you use a password
otherwise it's a little bit of a novelty
let's load YouTube because you know
video takes a while to load sometimes
and let's swipe over here we'll go to
uploads and we'll play a video and see
which queues up faster so we just did
that fingerprint sensor setup video so
to have it at the same
one two three go a little bit faster on
the 5s
started first on the thighs which is
very interesting so a lot of the time
these two phones are very equal in terms
of performance apps come up a little bit
faster let's go to Spotify here so as
you can see just a beat faster it's
really not that big of video where we're
going to see improvements when
developers start rewriting their apps
for 64-bit that might be weeks it might
be months and you might not see any
performance increases if you have a 5s
unless you're playing games so the
summary of this video is that the iPhone
5 is still a very fast phone and if
you're considering upgrading to the 5s
you've got to think about the camera and
we're gonna have some camera samples in
our review you also have to think about
that fingerprint sensor because the
speed difference really isn't tremendous
and so you have to keep that in mind it
might be weight worth waiting for the
six if you have a five and you're
thinking about upgrading so that's it
for this video a little comparison of
the iPhone 5 versus the 5s let us know
if you have any questions drop a comment
