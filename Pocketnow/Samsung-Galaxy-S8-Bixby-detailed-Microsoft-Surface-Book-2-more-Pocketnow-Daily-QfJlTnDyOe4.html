the big scheme voice assistant and boys
this thing different we get details on
the feature microsoft surface book and
they aren't that good an HTC announces
its you ultra sapphire edition along
with all of its restrictions I'm high
metal data and for those of you asking
where I get all the awesome t-shirts you
can learn more on the first link in the
description to RIPT apparel this is
parking out bailey official news today
begin with deals necessary deals as we
should say so for those of you that
found that the LG watch style was
overpriced and agree with me the watch
is currently available for a crazy one
hundred dollars off on best buy in
different color variants we're talking
about one hundred and eighty-nine
dollars for a really good android wear
SmartWatch you can learn more in the
description and how about if we discuss
one of the most popular games in iOS
right now that has just made it to
android we've got some teasers on super
mario run reaching the platform very
soon but we didn't get an exact date so
set your calendars march 23rd is when it
will be available i highly suggest you
wait for it and yeah you will be paying
this in 10 bucks if you want to get the
full premium experience of all the rest
of the levels to remember that teaser of
HTC announcing something in taiwan on
March twentieth well today's March
twentieth and it turns out that what we
have is the new HTC you ultra sapphire
addition we actually heard this variant
was going to exist back in our briefing
at Las Vegas turns out that this is an
exclusive arian 128 gigabytes you get a
sapphire display all this is great the
only problem is it's obviously a limited
edition 12 will cost you around a
thousand bucks if you're in Taiwan you
can learn more in the description as
apparently it will not leave that market
other set of interesting news that I
don't know if I should consider positive
or knowledge what we hear about the
future surface book too we fell in love
with the surface book in its design and
the whole concept of being a tablet that
having performance on the base and all
that was great tamas implementation and
deployment was kind of terrible on the
first variant and then the second
variant pretty much did everything the
first one should have done but it so
didn't really meet the powerful demand
that a lot of people expect from it so
we hear from trusted sources that
apparently that form factors going away
it seems that we're getting a typical
clamshell laptop in the future that will
be focused on performance and it's kind
of sad to see the surface book go from
its current form factor because I found
it really cool to have it be a tablet
whatever you want it or a computer
whenever you want it and finally the
very hotness that they have to do with
Samsung and Bixby as the company has
pretty much just announced its new voice
assistant and there are ton of very
interesting things that are coming here
this is apparently not going to be like
the gula system for so it seems the same
thing is calling it it's a voice agent
instead of assistant and so what we get
is the typical context awareness that we
already get from the gula system in
theory we also get more tolerance on
voice commands you don't necessarily
have to memorize one thing specifically
but probably one of the coolest things
is that for all those applications that
will be bixby enabled and we don't
assume that these will be many but let's
say that those applications out there
will support it well those will actually
be able to be operated by bixby meaning
menu controls and everything you will be
able to control your app with your voice
this makes a lot of sense for when
you're driving or in particular reasons
where you just can't be holding the
phone makes a lot of sense but it leads
me to the question of the day do you
think that the market is going to go
crazy with this platform specifically
just for the samsung galaxy s 8 at start
or do you believe that fans once you
just stick to what worse which is the
google assistant in my case because of
those ways to operate applications
through voice command we would love to
see that so fine samson let's see what
your R&amp;amp;D department has brought to the
market and leave the comment down below
