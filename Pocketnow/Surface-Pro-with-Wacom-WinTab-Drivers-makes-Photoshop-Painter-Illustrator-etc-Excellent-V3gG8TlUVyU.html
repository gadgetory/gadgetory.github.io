when I first bought it was that it
didn't include wind tab drivers for
using the pressure sense of stylus with
most graphics programs you know some of
them supported the new ink API so the
surface has but most of them used the
older wind tab APs but now the surface
pro does have wing tab drivers and I
have pressure-sensitive stylus drawing
capabilities in almost all graphics
programs so this is Adam Lane from
packing.com and I'm going to show you
how it works let's check it out alright
first off let's go to the settings have
to install the new drivers from Wacom
there's new 10 tablet properties control
panel and this is where we can control
some different things about the stylus
you can turn on the click sound we can
hear it now you can customize what the
button does to feel a razor feel
double-click distance here's your
advance you can you know do a hover
click for the button or click and tap
and you can calibrate it which is really
nice makes it much more accurate and you
can add a pop-up menu which you can
choose as one of the options in your
custom button and you see it's made by
Lock them there so that's the new pen
tablet properties pretty nice to have
and let's check out photoshop so here we
are and here's the brush panel and you
can see shape dynamics I can choose 10
pressure now that's not grayed out
anymore
because we have wind tab drivers any so
you see the preview of the brush down
there and kill and pressure is light and
then it gets dark very nicely done
let's try a couple other brushes now
here's a little icon that's going to
show the tilt sensitivity but the
surface pro doesn't support tilt
recognition within the digitizer so
that's kind of useless really needing
more expensive Wacom tablet to have that
support about one of these
very nice
really smooth real quick all right let's
try a different program so this is
painter 12 I've been using this back in
the Tecla is version 4 in the 90s and
this is a very very complicated natural
media simulation program so we have all
sorts of brushes and you can see how
they work here
I go to the preferences there's a brush
tracking option and we can see supports
pressure and it changes some of our
settings according to how we attract
Russian within the screen let's choose a
couple ups
and you can see pressure very very nice
so this is going to be great with the
surface pro all right one more how about
some vector illustration you say sure
here's Illustrator cs6 I'm going to
double click brush and I'm going to make
it have some size variation how much
should I do 15 and we'll give it a
variation of 7 and right here I can
choose pressure and let's get a brush
and let's change my color that
and there you go let's choose a
different brush over here in the brushes
library we have some other brushes
multiple brush libraries let's choose
one of these
and you can see how the pressure affects
your brush brush strokes
there's some bristle brushes
you see you have a lot of control or the
thickness of the stroke as you're moving
so there's a look at a few professional
graphics programs running on the surface
pro with your nice pressure-sensitive
stylus support great feature real smooth
this could be a digital artists dream
tablet so be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
