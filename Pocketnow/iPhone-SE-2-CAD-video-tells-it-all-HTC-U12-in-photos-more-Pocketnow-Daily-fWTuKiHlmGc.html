and let's just say that we trust this
one a lot more pictures of the HTC u12
plus emerge and confirm all the previous
rumors we've heard and Samsung is
selling the higher storage variants of
the Galaxy S 9 in s9 plus I'm Hein
that'll be better
welcome May it's Labor Day and we
celebrated by working this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals the Apple MacBook continues to be
one of the favorite computers out there
even with the fact that it's extremely
expensive but if you want to change that
Best Buy has got it pretty much 300
bucks off it's less than a thousand
dollars for the base storage then almost
1200 for the 512 gig barians and if
you're looking for a very old MacBook
Pro 15 inch but you're still looking for
a powerful computer that one is $500 off
you can learn more about the deals in
the description now let's move the
spotlight over to Samsung as a these
aren't deals but for those of you
interested in more base storage on your
Galaxy S nine or s 9 plus even though
I've been fine with 64 gigs expandable
but for those of you that want that it's
currently now available for pre-order 'z
and pre-orders are going to go all the
way to May 17 on Sam 6 store we're
talking about it's starting at 770 bucks
for the 128 gigabyte variant of the s9
and then obviously it rolls down you can
learn more about the price points of the
description yeah why not now let's move
the spotlight over to Facebook as the
second co-founder of whatsapp Jan koum
has just announced that he's leaving the
company after the whole privacy issues
and all the debacle that's been
happening and obviously the fact that
what's happens has become infamous ever
since the acquisition over a lot of
privacy issues over time even though
Mark Zuckerberg will say the otherwise
most interesting you know the first
co-founder left in November and
apparently this hints to an exodus
happening yeah you would think that
Facebook was the perfect service but we
wonder perfect for who how about if we
talk about HTC the company hasn't really
wowed anybody in the last couple of
launches but apparently the U 12 is not
going to be
case we've got some leaked photos on
Facebook of the u12 plus a lot of the
things that we've seen in rumors are
pretty much being confirmed like the
dual cameras in the back that are
horizontal the fact that there's a dual
camera at the front that there's this
liquid approach to design yeah it looks
good don't get me wrong let's just see
if the company finally figures this one
else and finally the most interesting
news today have to do with the iPhone se
2 and even though I wasn't really wowed
or going crazy over this phone before
alright kind of AM now there are some
leaked renders on video and for those of
you that have seen these videos in the
past you know that once you get these
it's pretty much the final design I mean
this leaker does an amazing job and a
couple of things the first one
apparently there is no wireless charging
it seems that the back is pretty much
the same as the iPhone se currently but
then notice there's no headphone jack
the speakers at the bottom look larger
most important apparently there is a
notch on this thing yeah so that can
mean a couple of things starting with
the fact that apparently this is going
to be an all display device the touch ID
gets put it on to another phone but I
guess that's the reason why we heard
rumors that this phone was gonna get
more expensive this could be the reason
why and today's question let us know I
mean iPhone s8 to imagine a device with
a design of 4 inch display but it had a
bit Sall display I mean it's a small
phone that's all display I think that
would be a really cool product but what
do you think do you think that would be
a cool idea let's see what we get leave
