finally unveiled iOS 8 what's new what's
different I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is our hands-on
preview of iOS 8 beta 1 last year Apple
introduced a new look for iOS the 3d
elements were flattened the entire UI
was given a transparent and easily
digestible hierarchy and a handful of
new features were added to boot
Control Center a more useful
Notification Center airdrop and more
despite the dramatic visual changes iOS
still felt a bit stale leaving many
users wanting more from Apple on Monday
Apple kicked off its annual developer
conference WWDC 2014 and announced an
even newer version of its mobile
platform iOS 8 what new features will we
get once the official software hits is
this the iOS update we've been dying for
let's take a look at the surface not
much has changed there are things you
may notice that weren't there before
like a tiny little icon in the lower
left corner of the lockscreen
but for all intents and purposes iOS 8
is virtually identical to iOS 7 one of
the most prominent changes in iOS 8 is
the introduction of recent context in
the task switching menu all of your most
recent contacts appear above the app
previews for quick access tap on a face
to reveal all the communication methods
with that person right now there seems
to be no way to manually set contacts to
appear or remove unwanted contacts from
the list Notification Center also looks
a little different the third tab which
was introduced last year has been
removed now there are just two columns
today and notifications today view is
practically the same as before though
you may begin to see widgets appear as
more developers update that our apps to
be compatible with Apple's new
extensibility api's the notification
view on the other hand has been
graciously updated with an inline
response function and easier dismissal
of individual notifications instead of
having to clear all or none you can
swipe individual notifications to the
left and tap dismiss to clear one by one
spotlight has been updated with new
inline suggestions from various sources
like Wikipedia articles and IMDB entries
this sort of fills the gap for text
queries with intelligent answers but
when you don't want to speak to Siri
speaking of Siri she's got some new
tricks too
she can now identify songs using Shazam
and so long as your iOS device is
plugged in and charging you can activate
Sirius hands-free simply say hey Siri
and your iPhone or iPad will wake up
it's unfortunate that only works when
devices are plugged in but we're certain
this is in favor of longer battery life
maybe new hardware in the fall will
enable a functionality more comparable
to the Moto X's touchless control which
works all the time when typing you may
notice there is now upward suggestion
bar above the keyboard this is part of
the new predictive text in iOS 8 which
is context aware it certainly isn't the
first keyboard of its type or happy to
see it on iOS regardless like Swift key
or swipe on Android it learns the way
you type but it takes it one step
further by learning how you talk to
different people and suggesting
different words based on who you're
talking to
even more Apple flip the switch on one
of the most requested features for iOS
third-party keyboards Android has had
this function for some time allowing
users to choose which keyboard works
best for them while there are no
third-party keyboards available just yet
some of the firm's behind the most
noteworthy third-party Android keyboards
are well on the way to bringing them to
iOS above all other features Apple
introduced it harped on one in
particular continuity sadly not many of
these features are live yet but soon
you'll be able to start messages on one
device and finish them from another or
start browsing a Safari page from your
iPad and pick up from your iPhone
seamlessly 1 continuity feature that
does work however is SMS integration in
iMessages before from the iPad or Mac
you can only send an iMessage now SMS
messages are synced and you can send
them from your Mac provided you have the
Yosemite update or an iPad as well as
your iPhone the last of the big new
features we can actually show you right
now is family share family share allows
multiple users to share app store in
iTunes purchases across the entire
family buy an app once and everyone can
use it provided all their iTunes
accounts are using the same credit card
users on the family share accounts can
also request purchases from the family
organizer who can then accept or decline
the purchase this will be extremely
helpful to families and keep them from
having to buy multiples of the same app
another smaller feature can be found in
the settings application under the old
usage submenu battery usage before you
could see the uptime and the time used
but you could be exactly see which apps
were killing your battery much like the
battery usage menu on Android you can
now see exactly which apps are causing
the drain on your iPhone or iPad
unfortunately this is only a small
helping of the features Apple introduced
for iOS 8 despite having the first beta
installed not all the other functions
are working like iCloud Drive or the new
cross-platform airdrop the health app is
installed but without compatible
hardware it doesn't really do anything
the new smart edit function is missing
from the Photos app Wi-Fi calling isn't
present app store keeps crashing and the
new bundles video app previews and beta
functions aren't working yet and a lot
of other things are missing this is all
to be expected though it's only beta one
random reboots are common bugs abound
and not everything works many of our
favorite apps crash or won't load at all
but all that is worth dealing with to
see how positive this update will become
fall as minor as some of these features
may seem the behind the scenes features
like extensibility and continuity are
exciting and telling of a little more
open and lacks Apple third-party
integration is on its way and that alone
is something to be excited about for iOS
