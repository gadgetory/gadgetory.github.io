finally unveiled iOS 8 what's new what's
different I'm Taylor Martin this is
pocket now and this is our hands-on
preview of iOS 8 beta 1 last year Apple
introduced a new look for iOS the 3d
elements were flattened the entire you I
was given a transparent and easily
digestible hierarchy and a handful of
new features were added to boot control
center a more useful Notification Center
airdrop and more despite the dramatic
visual changes iOS still felt a bit
stale leaving many users wanting more
from Apple on Monday Apple kicked off
its annual developer conference WWDC
2014 and announced an even newer version
of its mobile platform iOS 8 what new
features will we get once the official
software hits is this the iOS update
we've been dying for let's take a look
at the surface not much has changed
there are things you may notice that
weren't there before like a tiny little
icon in the lower left corner of the
lock screen but for all intents and
purposes iOS 8 is virtually identical to
iOS 7 one of the most prominent changes
in iOS 8 is the introduction of recent
context in the task switching menu all
of your most recent contacts appear
above the app previews for quick access
tap on a face to reveal all the
communication methods with that person
right now there seems to be no way to
manually set contacts to appear or
remove unwanted context from the list
Notification Center also looks a little
different the third tab which was
introduced last year has been removed
now there are just two columns today and
notifications today view is practically
the same as before though you may begin
to see widgets appear as more developers
update their apps to be compatible with
apple's new extensibility api's the
notification view on the other hand has
been graciously updated with an inline
response function and easier dismissal
of individual notifications instead of
having to clear all or none you can
swipe individual notifications to the
left and tap dismissed to clear one by
one spotlight has been updated with new
inline suggestions from various sources
like Wikipedia articles and IMDb entries
this sort of fills the gap for text
queries with intelligent answers but
when you don't want to speak to Siri
speaking of Siri she's got some new
tricks too
she can now identify songs using Shazam
and so long as your iOS devices plugged
in and charging you can activate Siri
hands-free simply say hey Siri and your
iPhone or iPad will wake up it's
unfortunate that only works when devices
are plugged in but we're certain this is
in favor of longer battery life maybe
new hardware in the fall will enable a
functionality more comparable to the
Moto X's touchless control which works
all the time when typing you may notice
there is now upward suggestion bar above
the keyboard this is part of the new
predictive text in iOS 8 which is
context-aware it certainly isn't the
first keyboard of its type or happy to
see it on iOS regardless like SwiftKey
or swipe on Android it learns the way
you type but it takes it one step
further by learning how you talk to
different people and suggesting
different words based on who you're
talking to even more Apple flip the
switch on one of the most requested
features for iOS third-party keyboards
Android has had this function for some
time allowing users to choose which
keyboard works best for them while there
are no third-party keyboards available
just yet some of the firm's behind the
most noteworthy third-party Android
keyboards are well on the way to
bringing them to iOS above all other
features apple introduced it harped on
one in particular continuity sadly not
many of these features are live yet but
soon you'll be able to start messages on
one device and finish them from another
or start browsing a safari page from
your iPad and pick up from your iPhone
seamlessly 1 continuity feature that
does work however is SMS integration in
I messages before from the ipad or mac
you can only send an iMessage now SMS
messages are synced and you can send
them from your Mac provided you have the
Yosemite update or an iPad as well as
your iPhone the last of the big new
features we can actually show you right
now is family share family share allows
multiple users to share app store in
itunes purchases across the entire
family by an app once and everyone can
use it provided all their itunes
accounts are using the same credit card
users on the family share accounts can
also request purchases from the family
organizer who can then accept or decline
the purchase this will be extremely
helpful to families and keep them from
having to buy multiples of the same app
another smaller feature can be found in
the settings application under the old
usage submenu battery usage before you
can see the uptime and the time used
but you couldn't exactly see which apps
were killing your battery much like the
battery usage menu on Android you can
now see exactly which apps are causing
the drain on your iPhone or iPad
unfortunately this is only a small
helping of the features apple introduced
for iOS 8 despite having the first beta
installed not all the other functions
are working like iCloud Drive or the new
cross-platform airdrop the health app is
installed but without compatible
hardware it doesn't really do anything
the new smart edit function is missing
from the Photos app Wi-Fi calling isn't
present app store keeps crashing and the
new bundles video at previews and beta
functions aren't working yet and a lot
of other things are missing this is all
to be expected though it's only beta one
random reboots are common bugs abound
and not everything works many of our
favorite apps crash or won't load at all
but all that is worth dealing with to
see how positive this update will be
come fall as minor as some of these
features may seem the behind-the-scenes
features like extensibility and
continuity are exciting and telling of a
little more open and lacks Apple
third-party integration is on its way
and that alone is something to be
excited about for iOS thanks for
