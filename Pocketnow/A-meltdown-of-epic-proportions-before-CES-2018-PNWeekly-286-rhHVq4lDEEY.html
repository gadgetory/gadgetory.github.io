industry was rocked by security flaws
and costly fixes what might this mean
for your pcs or your smartphones Apple
takes a hit on new iPhone sales because
of cheaper battery replacements and
we'll chat out some of the rumors
heading into this year's Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas we've got
a lot to talk about so make sure you're
charged and ready for episode 2 8 6 of
the PocketNow weekly record a January
5th at noon pacific time this weekly
podcast is where we dis echt and discuss
those gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and Las Vegas was
probably a way dirtier place to go visit
than the Disneyland for grownups that
it's become I'm Juan Carlos back now
senior editor Pacquiao comm joined as
always by plucky podcast producer mr.
Jules Wong on the East Coast how's it
going sir good afternoon and it's pretty
cold it's pretty windy there was a bunch
of snow that fell apparently ice shove
is one of the terms that we should be
putting in along with balm cyclone when
coming into this because we had a like a
good stretch of very like negative
degree weather outside for the week
prior to the storm so there was a lot of
harbor I guess and then that got shoved
up at the storm surge and yeah that
apparently we're having going we're
gonna have a fun time trying to melt
this down yeah I mean it's even scary
out here I think we're predicting lows
of 55 here yeah I mean it's like of the
Polar Ghost covered in sea rose it would
like merge those I mean that's also why
you know like after you join us for this
hour of podcasting will be doing the
PocketNow weather forecast
brought to you by you brought to you by
all the OEMs of the mobile industry the
in the infinity display that we you'll
be using the maps and stuff that's going
be exciting to see so I'm we're gonna
we're gonna be we're gonna be detailing
are coming up our adventures in Las
Vegas over the next couple days but I do
not envy you flying out of the East
Coast right now so I'm hoping you know
you have safe conditions to make it out
my plane starts up that's just start
what starts up and you'll be travelling
around the same time as Jaime and he's
all about you know his in his previous
life he was all about airplanes and
stuff used to work for an airport or
something I think ups I'm sure I'm sure
he is well versed in like airplane
de-icing protocols and stuff so he'll be
going out you know all the way up to
Boston to but this is not what our
show's gonna be about this
I'm sure there's all kinds of tasty news
about 747s and stuff that we could delve
into but that's not what we're going to
talk about I just before we jump into
the actual conversation the top news
stories from pocketnow.com Jules how
might someone get in contact with us for
the show if they would like to join the
conversation so contact at Bombardier
comm sorry dot see a contact at Embraer
comm know I'm Kennedy uh way to contact
us is to talk to us via our Twitter with
the p-n weekly hash tag that's P and
weekly and you'll be able to enjoy in on
the conversation whenever we get to our
live broadcasts as we usually do on a
Friday and if you can't make it well we
certainly have those emails that we want
to stack up for our mail bag episode
that happens at the end of the month and
you can submit those to nano calm soapy
and weekly hashtag on Twitter or podcast
at pocketnow.com just tell us what you
want to talk about we'll talk about it
yeah we already have a couple tweets in
from from people watching the show live
we'll be getting to those cuz they're
actually on topics that we're gonna be
discussing so some some really cool
stuff that we're expecting to see over
over the next week and I guess Jules we
should probably just kick it off man
what what was the news like this week
leading into one of the world's largest
consumer electronic trade shows bring
for the week of January 1st 2018 this is
all the news that's with the podcast
we're talking about two new
industry-wide bugs that people should be
worried about on top of Wi-Fi is crack
attack but we have to talk about
there's also meltdown and specter and
basically these vulnerability is just
just milk well meltdown the holes the
the the partitions between apps and the
data that it's getting sent along and
Security's at risk and this affects that
runs on Intel arm so pretty much any
smart device computer that you have
right now so definitely a concern
companies are working to patch that as
we speak although the specter one is
going to be a little bit tougher to deal
with Spotify is planning on getting into
the market through direct listing
listing with an exchange
Axios first reported that the music
streaming company from Sweden has filed
documents with the SEC in the u.s. to
make that deal possible now this could
allow capital investors to cash out and
also avoids a lot of the fees that
Spotify would have to incur from
entering through a traditional IPO
sequence going in there is no LD g7
apparently these games with numbers that
were playing you might have heard that
the Huawei P level might have not
happened in favor of the quali P 20 well
same thing might be going on over here
with the LG G 7
giving way to the LG G 10 or LG G X
Roman numeral 410
could still be called g10 because iPhone
games iPhone 10 iPhone X yeah who knows
at this point what would do now is that
LG Display did not make any displays for
the iPhone 10 iPhone 10 obviously what
there's a OLED display so I'm Samsung
but it is ready to go with future iPhone
10 orders or iPhone 10 esque orders 15
million panels the deal is going through
almost finalized as is reported this
week so it'll be interesting to see how
we roll into more of the OLED
competition more of those legacy LCD
factories gone into it as we go on see
you iPhone tens in general or in fact
any iPhone actually because we're
talking about the battery replacements
discounts that are happening as a result
of Apple's big apology that it slowed
down older iPhones well at least one
bank Barclays we're talking about is
saying that this could have a meaningful
impact on the bottom line from iPhones
they're estimating a four percent drop
in revenues for this calendar year
because of that discounted replacements
strategy they out of warranty battery
placements are $79 usually now they're
$29 and because this this could go out
to potential upgraders who have would
otherwise upgrade to a newer iPhone
instead they're probably just gonna get
a battery replacement so that could have
impacts on the bottom line right there
and finally CES 2018 is just days away
and we're now learning that FCC Chairman
a GTI has decided not to show up the
consumer Technology Association said in
the statement that's the chairman who
helped lead the votes on the repeal of
net neutrality rules for ISPs so this is
just unable to attend at two panels he
was scheduled to appear on a1 then was
his fellow FCC chair excuse me
commissioners and also after the Federal
Trade Commission as well another on the
Federal Trade Commission just as a panel
by itself so definitely a lot of
interesting news going on here I want to
start off with Spotify we've been
talking about Spotify as this
money-losing
entity streaming music still the growing
in terms of popularity of in terms of
take a subscription numbers just this
week
Spotify recorded its seventy million
subscriber paying that $9.99
I know $15.99 for that family excuse me
$14.99 for that family subscription so
and there's also this lawsuit that's
going on to with Wixon music publishing
it represents Tom Petty
where was Cuomo from Weezer a lot of big
names and they're trying to eat get 1.6
billion dollars or some sort of at least
better negotiation terms because it's a
results of negotiations of for licensing
back when Spotify made its debut in the
US that these licenses completes that
they were not well done and they're
trying to against the leverage on that
so well it is sting in media and
entertainment where we watch both film
TV and music all kind of repeat the same
mistakes that their other counterparts
keep making like moving from home video
to streaming services mmm like the the
movie industry signed away rights in a
way that I was was very not good for her
how people usually like monetize those
kinds of services especially like when
you look at how the actors unions
negotiated for residuals on things like
feature films new technologies came out
and they completely underestimated the
impact that these new technologies would
have and I feel like the music industry
is still reeling from the double whammy
of illegal and legal online music sales
so I mean this was
that oh that's been decades in the
growth but that's it is you know a lot
of these things these contracts that
company sign are years long contracts
not decades long contracts but years
long contracts and those renegotiations
over time you you sort of then start to
see what the zeitgeist is going to do I
mean think about three years ago how
competitive Apple was in the streaming
music sector as compared to how
competitive they are today and how
services like Pandora only had a certain
chunk of the overall music market
Spotify represents a much bigger
conglomerate of all of the media that
you can stream and listen to and they're
breaking out into other avenues - like
getting into podcasting and stuff well I
mean I see it as you know roll on effect
from the Napster kazar days where you
know pirating was the rule of the day
when you just didn't want to buy you
know whole albums for $9.99 anymore and
that led to downloads being in single
track downloads that led to just these
very devalued was like they're counting
like 1,500 streams for a dollar or
something like that oh it's way less
than that probably because we lost the
power of terrestrial radio I mean
there's them because rainy radio I mean
you know the shift of audience to more
spoken word and you know more live
coverage dude there's the radios always
been a touchy
I think indie radio has found a
resurgence in popularity in this new
internet driven era like like I'm a huge
fan of Warren only KCRW to the point and
an amazing news show which was just
recently taken off the air and has been
moved into digital broadcast only it's
only a downloadable podcast now but it's
still of the KCRW radio station lineup
still produced by KCRW but what I mean
is in in light of the insane amount of
media conglomeration and media
acquisition
you don't have radio as the primary
resource for music discovery anymore you
use radio is sort of this terrestrial
way to reinforce stuff that's already
popular and so at the same time as we
saw people now having the economic
freedom to only buy one song and not
have to buy a whole a CD a whole album
for twenty dollars back in the late 90s
oh and $20 yum used to be worth a lot
more um
now you also solve the weakening power
of radio as a music discovery service
and that just goes hand in hand with the
rise of services like Pandora and
Spotify but I'll be curious to see and I
don't know Jules what do you think about
some of these these talking points that
they're not going to be filing for for
capital there's the direct listing as
opposed to a typical announcement we're
gonna be sort of underwriting this IPO
is this is this evidence that Spotify is
trying to go into this with reasonable
expectations and not trying to blow up
their market value do you think they're
already levered up as much as it is
right now and they're as far as we as
they've told the media they're just on
the verge of of turning profit and they
don't want to be saddled up with more
little wasted sweater they have a good
strategy going on and alright you know
to them at least and I think they want
to be able to keep on that eventually
should just be able to exponentially
wrap that up and it's just sort of it
feels odd like or maybe even refreshing
I don't know it leaves me feeling a
little strange because like we're still
kind of climbing out of this social
media investor boom you know like snap
you wanted those big numbers the huge
valuation all of the people getting
excited this is how we're gonna make
money and here's a company that actually
does have a product that's not just
selling people's data you know personal
information and they're trying to walk
into this with I feel slightly more
reasonable expectations on to what the
valuation of their company is yeah
I mean they have for them it's always
been about surviving the climb for scale
and they're in 61 markets now again as I
just mentioned 70 million subscribers on
them most of them in the u.s. to be
frank but you know it's it's just I mean
when you get more expertise and you grow
and you're able to negotiate better
terms with more parties foreign parties
because of course you have to license
per country and it's just but that's
always fun but um yeah I mean they're
learning I'm not sure Eve this wits and
Lawson will be but wicks ins apparently
very much willing to just get them back
on the table
well Spotify has been really under
balling the the settlements proposal
it's been to get it again it's all about
money and putting a number on these
things so speaking of one company that
seems to be learning moving to another
cup of putting a number of these things
learning about what to put a number on
their products do you think that the
LG's problems are are in a name that
name is gonna fix the problem we already
have a tweet from Andrew Wallace friend
of the show he guested a while back to
help us talk about some news and he
doesn't he doesn't think that let me
just read the tweet pea and weekly
honestly I don't believe the changing
the name of the phone series will solve
their problems better and more intensive
advertising as well as working on
quality assurance the consistency of
their product it's probably the bigger
deal then if it's a G and a number well
they've always had a tougher time trying
to advertise these series as we've you
know discussed before and we'll get into
the whole campaigns again but I don't
know where the brand comes into this
because it's you know again optimist it
was a great brand name Optimus Prime it
was it was transferred but we had right
okay okay right there but yeah and with
this I mean I'm not sure how much
they're trying to mirror with its iPhone
10x kind of deal or if they're going to
do the numerals anyways and just say I
think it's just it's stupid well but
don't you feel like this is a room
decision that like there's some guy in a
suit saying well there's the iPhone 10
and Samsung's gonna come out with a
galaxy s 9 so if our product is the G 10
it'll sound like it's one better than
Samsung's like that can't possibly have
any effect any significant effect on
consumer behavior right no one's gonna
walk into an 18 t store and go oh I was
gonna get the s9 but that G 10 oh that's
gotta be one better I think I start
calling it G phone 10 G phone 10 that's
that's just what the R in an H phone 10
just to be that much closer to the I Wow
well and then also to confuse it against
what what the Google phone could have
been called that the the poem no III I'm
really curious to see what LG does to
follow up the g6 I'm still using the V
30 as my primary daily driver phone all
signs are pointing to them finally kind
of getting there there they're
manufacturing and gear I like the
direction of the design language I don't
love things like glass backs and ceramic
could be interesting if they start
moving in that direction but it's only
been it was last month the beginning of
last month beginning of December where I
saw my first V 30 commercial on YouTube
TV I that's that's not a great look and
also knowing that it proud
wasn't actually broadcast you know like
it was on an on-demand video and they
had some sponsorship there so I mean
cool is the thing like not a roll cutter
that's not it that's not really
advertising your phone
well Motorola I mean if we're talking
about court cutters I might as well talk
about broadcast primetime television
Motorola I mean if that's still getting
millions of millions a worse Motorola
has been plastering it just adds every
break and I've been able to watch you
know I did bit of it's when there's a TV
around and you know every time I turn
around its a it's a moto phone with
those colourful lips and people jumping
around and even approaching the the
entry in mid mid range way smarter I
really got to give it up to Motorola
like you'll walk into a Costco and
you'll see a kiosk for Moto G fives and
so you know that that kind of
positioning deal costs the company money
when they're doing business with an
entity like Costco and I can't for the
life of me think of any time where I've
seen an LG product outside of a TV LG
TVs definitely get some phone some floor
space but I can't think of a single time
where I've walked into a Best Buy I
walked into a mall I walked into a
Costco or some other you know retail
brick-and-mortar store and seen any kind
of positioning for an LG product like
that um the end the commercial that I
did see for the V 30 was ultimately very
forgettable it was one of those attempts
of being anthemic like this is how I'm
gonna capture in my life this is gonna
how I'm gonna capture danger this is how
I'm gonna cap I mean like it was about
the camera but it didn't really feature
the phone much at all and it still had
the same problem of we're gonna do
things that look cool or sound cool or
we think are funny and then only loosely
tie that to an image of the phone at the
very end of the commercial after people
have already stopped paying attention to
the 20 seconds of media that we ask them
to watch and it just seemed like such a
letdown after using this phone for a
while which should have been a stronger
contender this year yeah I don't know
how the
actual advertising dynamics of that
would benefit them because we do have a
tweet from Renato Laporte at riina-chan
on Twitter P and weekly whatever the
name of the phone is make some ads for
it
put some pop-up stores up get on social
media I mean that's just basic stuff
they actually have to like place those
ads and I don't know if they have the
money or will to do that so that's I I
will be very curious to see I I really
think that there's a huge opportunity
for a company to come in right now and
I'm thinking we'll probably see more
from say POIs way in terms of making the
big advertising push at the desirable
consumer demographics I mean they're
gonna be doing something at CES it could
be the start of something new in the
meantime lots of new stuff in the next
year because this is 2018 and with that
iPhones
we could see the iPhone 9 or whatever
the heck they're calling it but who
cares it no one's gonna upgrade to it or
excuse me
200 million people are gonna upgrade to
it well yeah this this one I thought was
kind of interesting is the who was it
that did the Barclays oculus yep this to
me sounded kinda like that Apple market
correction which we've talked about for
a while you know how long we're holding
onto our phones what kind of sales can
you expect it you know it's like when I
took that really basic econ class and
the professor was talking about what a
failure Campbell's soup was because they
couldn't be like 70% of the canned soup
market and you're like well but that's a
lot so they're still winning but because
they couldn't keep growing in a
saturated market were they dominated
then they were now considered a failure
so it didn't matter that they were the
most successful canned soup company in
the world
they couldn't I mean again it well it's
about but the generic term of
shareholder value and let go
they want to set for the company be in
short-term or long-term so I mean like
I'll take those students from
marketplaces Kyra's though I think
I don't know if it's my connection of
yours but I think I just lost your audio
yeah I can't hear you sorry Jules you
started off so strong with Kairos doll
I'm a fan Jules wait I'm hearing
something there's I don't know battery
great so now I have to figure out which
of these all these batteries I have to
replace with and I might be like I threw
these batteries away in the trash and
someone decided to pick up put them you
know put them into this bin and I know
that there are some new batteries in
here that uh you know what while you're
taking care of that we have gotten some
tweets about Spector and meltdown so why
don't I just tackle that story good
we'll do it live live and we can at
least talk about that this is a this is
probably I think the biggest news story
of the week is it has far-reaching
implications and ramifications for the
entire computing industry this is from
from clay dough at Chatty boy on Twitter
PN weekly has Intel detailed the
specific performance it will be dealing
with per processor generation by
meltdown and Specter and from at msg
pudding
I would eat pudding with MSG in it
that's probably delicious PN weekly
wouldn't it be worse to say something
about Specter because more people now
know about it which means more people
will try to abuse it so let's get into
the to the particulars I shot a pair of
videos on my own personal channel
talking about the initial breaking news
the register put out the story initially
this is sort of beating all of the
official press releases by a couple
weeks or at least by one week and then
all of the companies scramble to
actually disclose what the information
was because the initial reporting did
get a few things wrong so we have two
specific security threats that we were
faced with and they're named meltdown
and Spectre meltdown is the big
scary immediate threat and this is a
hole in Intel's
processor security where information
that your kernel your computer's kernel
your operating system kernel relies on
is going through these secure memory
elements which can be accessed by user
level programs so essentially like any
random script kiddie a piece of Java you
know an infected website could actually
use this hole to call information from
what should be a secure part of the
processor Intel's solution and this is
already being patched I think there's
already a patch for Linux operating
systems OS the the current build of OS
10 for Mac's
already has part of this patched up we
should be seeing the rest of it fixed in
a very in an update soon if it's not
even out by the time this show is
broadcast and windows I believe there
are if you're on a windows insider then
you've already been patched against this
and we should be seeing those fixes
coming out soon too so what happens with
meltdown is we need to redirect some of
that secure information for the kernel
in a way that ties up processor cycles
so it does create lag and that's where
we're seeing these estimates where we
could see performance deficits from 5 to
30 percent depending on the processor
older processors are gonna be hit harder
and depending on the application now the
important thing is that depending on the
application is where I think a lot of
people are actually gonna be ok the
types of performance degradation that
we're gonna see is really gonna affect
more networking and database driven
things that call information that have
to pass through the kernel a lot that's
really where we're gonna see the most
significant slowdowns so this is a huge
problem for backbone service companies
and for cloud service companies because
they're they're actually having to chew
through this information organize this
information and keep all of this
information protected and often
utilizing virtual machines to help with
user accounts so that's huge that's a
real
bad thing as so much of this industry is
built on Intel servers but for general
consumers once you load the program
hopefully that program is coated
properly so that you don't see it
calling information through the kernel
regularly so loading a game we might see
a scientific impact on how fast the game
loads but once it's up and running it
shouldn't be making a lot of calls like
that to have to go through the kernel so
we shouldn't see too much of a
performance hit if any for most modern
video game titles I'm still afraid that
we're gonna see some hit for video
editing and rendering because of the way
that file systems are built that most
video editing software sort of creates
its own mini file system within the
program and then that has to access the
actual computer file system we could
still maybe see some problems there now
that all the work six texts well yeah
but again what we're hoping to see is if
a program is efficiently coded hopefully
it won't be the full upper limit of
performance hit or performance loss that
people are worried about microphone our
just the inserts on there no worries
okay so that's the first one that's
meltdown that one's actually really
freaky scary Spectre we're only just
beginning to unravel what the problem
with Spectre might be so when when we
when this information was disclosed
I found Intel's response to this to be
slightly disingenuous because they kind
of did this press release saying well
all computers have problems sort of
trying to downplay the fact that
meltdown was a huge problem specifically
for Intel processors and Spectre is a
design flaw in CPU architecture that is
that has been around since I want to say
for at least the last 20 years and so we
have been making certain assumptions
about security while trying to improve
performance and it would turn out that
some of those assumptions have not been
completely accurate and so there is a
potential hole we don't know of any real
world exploits utilizing this hole but
it affects every processor that's been
made over the last 10 to 20 years and
there's no real way to fix it outside of
menu
during new processors there are a few
things that we can do to make it harder
to exploit this hole there are a few
things we can do to try and move
information around in a way that's more
secure but ultimately there's a hole in
the bucket and the only way to fix it is
to make a new bucket specter is going to
affect or it has the potential to affect
desktops laptops Mac PC Linux and
processors developed by Qualcomm high
silicon everybody everybody is going to
be affected by spectre so to get to the
question from from Colton from MSG
pudding there there's there are two sort
of ideas about security you can try and
have security through obligation by
trying to hide this information from the
public or you can have security by
broadcasting this information to the
public I am a fan of the latter idea I
think the more you try and keep these
things under wraps the more likely the
stuff will be exploited by bad actors
around the world and we just won't know
about it now that we know about it and
people will have it on in their mind
like when I upgrade my computer I want
to get a CPU that's immune to the
specter bug you have I think ultimately
better security in the long run and yeah
there's gonna be a lot of information
that's gonna be coming out I think over
the next couple weeks and when it comes
to security because like I said we're
only just starting to see the
ramifications and that's not to say that
someone might not find a way to exploit
specter before we can get new hardware
to fix the problem now there's always a
question of who's disclosing what
information with each of these
vulnerabilities and I was wondering if
how do you think the register handle did
as opposed to perhaps learning the
company's point thing at the time that
they did dictate I I kind of feel that
the register wanted the scoop I'm not
entirely thrilled with how they went
about disclosing this because they
didn't have the complete picture on what
all of the problems were i buy it also
sort of shine
alight on manufacturer behavior I don't
think it's directly related to the
discovery of meltdown but it's a bad
look when the end of November Intel CEO
is dumping millions of dollars worth of
Intel stock six weeks before the the
plan had kind of been created to
disclose meltdown to industry insiders
so we have a time frame where Intel was
probably sitting on this information for
over a month and meltdown was a scary
enough problem that a month of it sort
of being vaguely aware I meant that we
probably could have seen some actual
malware created by this maybe not
weaponized like that North Korean hack
like wanna cry but again people could
have started to try and exploit that and
we know how many computers would have
been vulnerable who weren't currently
getting updates that's also going to be
a major problem for the computer
industry or all the computers that are
sort of end of life and not getting the
same quality of security patches and so
I'm torn on it sorry Jules long rambling
way to say I'm torn on what the register
did I'm glad that the register kicked
off a conversation and forced companies
to actually get on the ball in
disclosing to consumers what was going
on but a week later probably would have
arrived just the same this information
would have happened you know at the end
of CES when we were all talking about
tech and news and politics and stuff and
I'm not sure how much of a benefit it
was but good on them they got the scoop
so I guess that's that's what's
important and in terms of the arm impact
because obviously going to have to bring
it back to mobile here how much of this
is really going to be I mean already we
had the crack exploit and Google I feel
fell down on its face with the decision
to put it on as an extra level patch as
a November 6 patch where
and even take the fifth patch and
they're all just stuck on the first date
patch and it wasn't until a month later
that they got that patch so where do we
lie in terms of that kind of attitude
that kind of a you know approach to
fixing these and I share your sentiment
I think I think it's disappointing for a
lot of a lot of Android users out there
knowing what the relationship is between
Google manufacturer and carrier it's
something that we've been we've been
griping about for a long time is it's
great that Google can fix holes in
Android and it's great that we're
getting these sort of monthly security
updates but how many manufacturers are
really on the ball and getting them to
our devices and so we can continue to be
frustrated with the manufacturers but
after a point it's also just like what
is Google doing to actually put pressure
on these companies to provide the
service that they really should be in an
era where so much of your personal data
is referenced by your phone I mean
that's a primary computing device for
many people maybe even most people now
I'm so much more likely to check my
phone for a lot of my daily life
information than I am to wait until I
can sit in front of a desktop so it's I
think it's another data point that
Google needs to not only lead this
discussion but but make it more painful
for companies not to play ball
especially is we're in an era of
thousand dollar smartphones it's really
not okay that a smartphone which costs
more than a laptop and is used more
readily than a laptop will have these
kinds of holes in priorities priorities
where do they lie well after a downer of
a story I think I really think because
you know I'm all against death threats
here because a GPA I know that you know
he's been talking about that he's been
facing them and even on a topic
that has been so this really been just
just been against this guy against you
know do you know the repeal of net
neutrality rules he shouldn't have to
face death threats I mean that's that's
the and OBO yeah I mean that's really
the only thing I have to say about it we
all know that we wouldn't have gotten
any good information from him in these
panels at CES that's not what we're
upset about it's not that we would have
been able to confront him a story just
came out I just read it on reddit this
morning that literally zero public
comments were referenced in their repeal
of net neutrality so we know that
they're not acting in good faith as a
public regulatory agency we know that
this is regulatory capture and we know
that they're just going to continue
parroting the same industry talking
points that they've been voicing since
Egypt PI's been on the FCC Council if
there's any shred of it you know just
appearing as if you know you're a public
serving the public then you would want
at least you know face the fire of a
spray of journalists I think that it's
just it's simply you know you could you
know manipulate the conversation with
what I wanted to be is beforehand which
PI did do you know with traditional
media outlets and if this this topic
itself has finished my point we we could
all have been certain about this type of
conversation from the FCC currently and
their role joining a public forum at an
event like CES and that still doesn't
change my opinion that death threats are
unacceptable it still doesn't change my
opinion that it makes it makes us look
bad
and I don't want to throw on the tinfoil
hat like oh maybe this was like a false
flag death threat that they did to
themselves so that he would have an
excuse and could call us bad actors and
it kind of
matter I feel there are enough people
even in the comments of my own videos
there are enough people who are trying
to docs him and are trying to join the
conversation with a visceral tone that
I'm sure makes people feel good when
their keyboard warriors you know hiding
behind YouTube comments but that doesn't
actually improve the situation and it
can only be pointed to as evidence that
were unhinged and were whiny and we're
cranky and we're not really thinking
rational it's a great tactic that I
think they've been borrowing from
internet commentators for a while now
you can you can drive outrage this way
and then use it as evidence for
continuing a pattern of behavior which
is only just going to drive more outrage
another hand that outrage isn't going to
go anywhere because this is the Internet
we're talking about this in and I'm not
saying that as like underbelly comments
thing I'm saying that this is the
central point of which our lives revolve
around these days so you know his his
his home address is public as a public
official and it's not like he's gonna
get any break you know just by staying
home or he even you know circling around
his Washington building it's you know
what difference would it make if he you
know had attended that's all I'm saying
oh and and I'm I'm very confident that
it would have made zero difference not
to be and to nihilistic about it we when
it comes to things like net neutrality
if you are for net neutrality then the
fight has already moved into other
avenues there's literally no point in
spending energy on edgy pie I posted
another video in editorial talking about
how he's basically just a distraction he
is great for you to waste your energy on
but he doesn't actually join the
conversation in good faith and the
people who do need to hear from you are
being ignored because we're all too busy
being angry about edgy pie so he's he's
fulfilling his role
phenomenally well from the people in the
administration that are trying to
dismantle these types of consumer
protections so if you and the people who
already agree with this administration
are contacting their elected officials
so we're losing that fight on two fronts
if you really want to join the
conversation posting a dank meme about
edgy pie on Facebook does literally
nothing and also improve the situation
and it's a waste of your own effort and
energy in time I know it's a little odd
you know effect journalists
you know that will attend the event
anyways but if you're a passerby or
someone who's vaguely interested you
should still go to these panels because
I mean there were two Republican
commissioners that voted for the the
repeal printing car michael o'reilly
they'll still be there as well as when
you buy Bern and Jessica Rosen I can't
pronounce her name but especially mignon
Clyburn I'm gonna try because I just
like to shake her hand the way that she
has joined this conversation and her
write-ups her dissenting opinions are
phenomenally well thought out and I
think she has become an excellent voice
in this in this debate for delivering
rational information and in a way that
really does seem to focus on consumer
benefit which should be the priority at
the FCC we did get a tweet in from at
Panzers e retweeting at tech ninja
speaks death threats are never okay
though he is up there with Ted Cruz for
the most punchable face award and I
would agree which means he is exactly
occupying the role like he should were
angry at him he's got the punchable face
we're gonna spend time photoshopping him
into all kinds of of meme images and
literally nothing will happen from that
effort or energy other than us feeling
better about him being annoying I mean
that with anything on this one what do
you expect so well there are certainly
more things they're important and then a
jeep I or even
ccr FTC that are going to be at the CES
Lisa V CES not a CES vez yes
which is which apparently stands for
nothing as they have taken away the
meaning of CES I think I last year or
yeah I thought the Consumer Electronics
Show I know I'm not supposed to but ever
heard of this Consumer Electronics Show
CES so we're gonna be going to assess
2018 and we have boy I'm particularly
over our calendar here and yeah this is
a fun so lots of pre briefs lined up
between I think the main events are
publicized so I can just go ahead and
say ZTE TCL LG has a thing going on
Samsung Samsung Sony is also going going
to be later on the Monday evening but a
LG Samsung mostly our main mid-range
smartphones in term and also
foldables
tuned ones so those that might have be
might be in our interest to cover maybe
but maybe if we feel like it
sony sony sony sony sony sony yeah you
you see more hyped up about Cydonia then
then well I guess my colleague is man I
have really enjoyed my time with the
Xperia compact mini that this year's xz1
see as opposed to the ex mini the XD 1c
fixed a lot of the problems that I had
with Sony phones from last year where
the X line was just a mess it was not a
fun time to like Sony products so if
Sony can in earnest join the sort of
entry-level or mid range conversation
again with this sort of refreshed
approach
from some of the rumors that we've seen
walking away from classic Sony chunky
bezels giving us something a little bit
more current with maybe a two by one
aspect ratio or something just a little
more svelte III would be very interested
in seeing what they have to offer that
would be I think that would go a long
way towards improving their their status
in North America maybe getting them back
on the right track for a carrier deal
again they sort of got burned during the
original Xperia Z era with 18 T and with
Verizon so that to me would speak to a
Sony that's showcasing some potential
again I would really like to see that
happen to see a Japanese company join
this conversation in earnest against you
know South Korea and China do you think
we're not being fair to them given the
you know glib comments about oh it's the
same thing oh look at the XA - it's it's
the same ol same ol it's tough to say
because in being fair to them I had a
lot of problems with them in 2016
they were probably consistently my
lowest reviewed ranked phones of the
year especially coming from such a
premier manufacturer named that Sony
name should mean something whereas this
year I had a hard time putting the
compact down I really know what that
phone even for some of the obnoxious
decisions on things like the camera app
you know like the actual performance
Android Oreo on an 835 on a low
resolution screen that thing is a
screamer that I think the only phone
that really competes is the smaller
pixel yeah so that to me it one year
year-over-year progress has been
astounding I will forgive them the
recycling of their Ultra boxy form
factor in design so if we can see Sony
executing like that and improving on
that line of phones with that kind of
attention to detail I could be very
excited about a Sony phone again
I mean for the upgrades and improvements
they've done in terms of optimizing the
software as well as you know just
contributing to Android features in
general through a AOSP like they should
be getting more credit but I mean I mean
I don't know how many of us are just all
in it for the looks yeah well and the
thing is I do actually kind of like the
boxy design I don't I don't hate it
I don't hate bezels I like having
something chunky that you can hold on to
i like the dedicated camera button i
like the flat sides it's why i like the
form factor of the LGG 6 better than the
form factor of the V 30 even though the
FIH 30 is overall a better phone it's
it's all of those little touches and
nuances so if you could just extend the
screen on a Sony and leave the other
dimensions pretty much the same I think
that would go way towards addressing
some of these issues that people have
with the form factor but I don't know I
think we're gonna see in 2018 most
manufacturers going to skinnier slimmer
infinity display style knockoffs smaller
bezels and the whatnot so well we'll
have to see how Sony addresses it but I
don't know I'm tentatively very anxious
and very curious to see what they might
have to show because if they can join
the conversation like I said really join
the conversation in the mid range that
might be the best place to do it where
you don't have to take a risk on a Sony
product at $900 I that would mean that
they are way more competitive against
all of these other phone manufacturers
even a oneplus in the middle of the pack
with a brand name that still resonates
with consumers I'm just checking my
flight schedule and I thought it was I
thought for some reason I've been
thinking that I was supposed to leave on
Wednesday at 10:00 when we still had
like a whole bunch of other stuff to get
through in fact I'm leaving on the 11th
which is a good thing oh yeah whatever
yeah yeah well we could record a podcast
or something that sounds nice
let's see we can put it together that
would be um but some other things things
that I think we'll see I I think we can
pretty much nip the rumors in the bud
that we'll be seeing significant phone
announcements from LG or Samsung I think
those are more likely to fall around MWC
timeline not CES timeline at all for the
Alcatel we had story on it earlier in
the day on pocket now I wasn't able to
add on but apparently they're I think
they're dropping the idol name and just
going for like five or something the
page is freezing up on me so I'm just uh
I'm just gonna say that well again this
this is what's such a bummer is um the
problem isn't the name the idol name is
fine it's just they had something of a
correction year where they tried to take
their phone line up scale from
entry-level to mid range from Idol three
to Idol for they just got hit with one
of the worst years of processor
manufacturing of all time they just had
the wrong chipset in that phone by the
time they actually launched it against
phones that were using better components
and they made a bet early on VR that
didn't pan out for them so now Idol 5
especially the Idol 5s that is a great
little phone I really like that phone
and it totally deserves to be in the
conversation against devices like Moto
G's and Huawei honor or even totally um
so again they might be just trying to
help erase some of the memory of the
idol for in the Idol 5 underperforming
and so they're gonna call it something
else but I really hope they continue to
keep fighting in this space because
stereo speakers on $200 phones with
decent headphone jacks and good
performance and nice battery life I mean
these are all things that people care
about these are all things that actually
satisfy market demand
when you ask people what they care about
in a phone and Alcatel has been able to
do this with some very attractive
devices to man I mean you gotta have the
idol 4s with the with the front and back
speakers that go on I'm actually I'm
actually a bigger fan of especially the
chipset what is it the Qualcomm 625 in
the the idol 5s is way better than the
652 in the Idol 4s but again it's it's
this is a company that executes this
really well and they still haven't found
I feel the credit that they deserve at
the same time we know that TCL is
focusing a lot of their expertise and
acumen on blackberry so I hope that
Alcatel doesn't get lost in that shuffle
because what they do they do really well
and I think again like I said if you
were to say based on aesthetics the
honor 6 X or the idol 5s I take the idol
5s in a heartbeat that to me is is worth
is is worth them trying one more good
push over next year to see if they can
they can demonstrate some kind of growth
yeah yeah maybe if we just take it a bit
notch further and just go a
stock-in-trade like like what ZTE is
doing I mean we could have a pretty good
race but I don't until we have only
phones of last year to talk about
because that's all that's I mean we
don't have the future phones in our
hands we can't just put them into you
know from thin air so let's talk about
those we had a poll go up just before
the end of the year talking about what
you would like to rate is your top phone
of 2017 and I think it's time that we
talk about the results
they've been public for a little bit but
I I think it should be of no surprise
that the Galaxy Note 8 was the top
finisher with 23% of the vote and
there's that there's a tight pack in a
four second third fourth place
iPhone 10 was in at 11.7 where as what
the 1 plus 5t was at 11 and then the
Google pixel 2 was a to Excel excuse me
from LG that was at 10% so I'm just a
lot of big phones big hefty phones with
you know the big display is the big
flagships I mean that's why we were
gauging the big flagships but in terms
of just you know the bazaars of it well
I think this is definitely so what I
love I started that sentence 5 times let
me try this one more time we posted our
editor pics where we voted on the top 5
phones of 2017 we put a video together
and of course all of the comments are
like well my phone wasn't picked so you
guys are biased or you guys are just
Samsung fanboys like all the time and
you're like it's a vote this is how
votes work what I think is hilarious is
the vote for the public is very close to
what our internal vote was where the
note took the top spot by a wide margin
in terms of the actual percentage of the
vote then the iPhone was second play
it's just like we did in our video and
then we had a couple other follow-ups
the Google pixel to excel was sort of a
surprise because that actually split our
vote between the pixel and the pixel
Excel 1 + 5 t is right in there - just
like where it was with our video and I
think the thing that that we we voted up
higher than everybody else did were the
specialist phones like the V 30 and the
BlackBerry t1 t1 is not there they won't
that bit was the key one is not getting
the love it deserves it absolutely is
not and for anyone who's talking trash
about a blackberry and a keyboard phone
in 2017 you fundamentally do not
understand what that thing can do
because it is an amazing communicator
experience so if if you're trying to
trash-talking not saying you have to
like it but if you're just trying to
trash-talk it as a phone that exists for
people who like to get work done and
like to communicate with other people
then you don't understand smart
is basically well I was I was about to
say apparently no one has ever heard of
the HTC you ultra I think that's a good
thing yeah you you will Evan had had a
decently strong showing considering
HTC's actual market position what is it
they did about 4% of the you know that
sounds about right to me
one major exclusion I forgot this is my
dad totally was the Moto Z to force but
by the looks of it at least we could
have got at least maybe you know five or
six votes from the comments at least so
III think moto Z Z to fours and he had
it actually been on the list and so
shame on you Jules for not including it
I think it probably would have been
probably somewhere maybe just above LG
g6 territory you know in that two to
three percent of the vote I think it
might have picked up there there's still
something really interesting about what
moto what moto is doing with their
high-end flagship parts and I know that
the echo chamber was really angry about
the force having a smaller battery but
if you look at the z2 force as just an
upgrade to the Z then this is a great
upgrade going to the chatter shield
display if you if you're so hung up on
names like you're that person who's
angry that the iPhone 8 is called the
eight and not the 7s um then yeah you're
gonna be pissed off about a phone like
the z2 force having a smaller battery
but if you're rational to any great
degree
if you're a human being that can
understand nuance then I think the z2
for is probably would have definitely
did it would have done middling well in
this lineup of phones so I guess that's
that's my oopsie that I'll take away
from this you'll you'll run your laps
later and you've got you owe me some
push-ups on that one definitely IR do I
made a cardigan sweater so yeah
a long week oh the cardigan why does
that make such perfect sense in my head
see I'm a walking around in like Cosby
sweater or something well it's hilarious
it's a story for when we get off the air
and we'll talk about that so I think we
should start getting off the air how
about that oh you want to wrap this up
we should probably wrap this up but um
just before we completely walk away I
know there are gonna be a lot of
consumer consumer electronics and when
we talk about CES it's not really a
phone heavy show but I'm sure we're
gonna be seeing a ton of stuff about VR
I think we'll probably be seeing some of
the first day dream headsets that are
standalone headsets not just phone
cradle style solutions I'll be super
surprised if we don't see a ton of AR
where VR is sort of there well maybe
we'll see something from HTC a follow-up
to the vibe and that'll be really
exciting from a gaming perspective but
AR is gonna be I think the buzzword like
VR was last year in 3d TVs were the year
before and then after that I'll be
shocked if we don't see an outright
assaulting explosion of smart home
speakers and cameras in your dishwasher
and IOT style products that connect to
your Google home and Amazon Alexa and
stuff so I think that'll be a good chunk
of coverage there too we'll be seeing
like how can we start tying these
services together and will we see Alexis
start making into things like headphones
that to me will be a huge boon for
Amazon if you can start having smart
conversations with assistants over your
normal bluetooth earpiece yeah yeah I
mean that's what we've been seeing with
Google assistant with the pixel buds and
I mean more of them are gonna be popping
up from third parties it's a major
fest for the third party so I mean just
imagine having that that Google
assistant conversation baked directly
into a nice pair of bluetooth headphones
III would mean
be be a bit more swayed by that I would
prefer it if like we had just one
universal solution where people from all
different cultures could actually wear
it and then we would actually have
efficient instant translation and we
could live in the happy world that
Google wants us to live in when it
debuted and I think to myself what a
wonderful another episode of the pocket
now in gone this show is over but the
conversation on Twitter were Jules I'm
humbly at some gadget guy and be
coverage you'll find all over the place
pocket now is around the web Twitter
Instagram Facebook Google+ YouTube and
our home sites now calm yes now shows
like this cannot continue without your
support sharing the weekly with your
friends who love technology and by
dropping reviews anywhere you can review
a podcast and definitely helps us find
new audience members because ultimately
there wouldn't be a show if it weren't
for those listeners and subscribers
we've kept us on the air since 2012 the
pocket now weekly we'll be back next
week with all kinds of delicious
knowledge goodness from Las Vegas to
make sure you tune back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
