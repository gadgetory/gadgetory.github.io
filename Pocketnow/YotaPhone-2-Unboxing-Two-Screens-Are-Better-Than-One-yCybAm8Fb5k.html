didn't end with our hands-on video
the company also bequeathed us a review
device we won't have time to properly
review it until after the show but we
thought we'd use a bit of downtime to at
least free it from its packaging I'm
Michael Fisher with PocketNow and this
is our yotaphone 2 unboxing the first
thing you notice about the yotaphone 2
packaging is how high-end it is it's
clear from the moment you pop open the
magnetic flap and unfurl the bundled
blocks inside that yotaphone took the
unboxing experience seriously when it
designed the phone the packaging deploys
into a kind of equipment palette lined
with foam packaged accessories nearly
all of which are branded with the
company's logo the bundled earbuds come
with lots of gels for various ear sizes
and even the charger and USB cable are
snugly encased in the foam but watch the
pull tabs though they'll break right off
if you pull hard enough the phone itself
is presented with the rear panel facing
up the epd said to display the brand
just like it was painted on the plastic
itself but it's not it's just the e-ink
in its resting state plucking the phone
from the box reminds me of the hands-on
experience from the day before a smooth
rounded pebble of a phone that hi Otto
says reminds him of the Nexus S at least
from the front power it on and you'll
get a Yoda phone splash screen on the
front and the back followed by an array
of panel options to help you start
getting the most of your new two-faced
smartphone we'll be setting up our demo
device over the next few days so let us
know what questions you want answered
and we'll be back with more Yoda phone 2
coverage next week in the meantime
there's a lot more to come from CES 2015
so stay locked to pocketnow.com
and this YouTube channel and follow the
guys on the ground at the links in the
description below for hi Otto hi mate
and all of us at pocket now I'm Michael
Fisher thanks for watching we'll see you
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
