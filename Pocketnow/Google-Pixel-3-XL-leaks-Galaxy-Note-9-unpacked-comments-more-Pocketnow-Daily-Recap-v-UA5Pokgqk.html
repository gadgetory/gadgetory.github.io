you're making fun of me aren't you
I feel like vehicle is becoming the new
jack from unbox therapy what do you
think they go your t-shirt is two sizes
too small dude I wish I could say that
exact same thing about my belly that's
right it's that time of the week I am
I'm that we got it with pocket now let's
go through your comments the pocket now
daily recap for last week so on that
Monday Android PI one official I was
just testing it out and I asked you the
questions what do you think you like it
or not we had 413 comments it's slightly
weird now that apple pie is my favorite
pie oh definitely I I don't like the
name the Google chose for it but anyways
I think I would jump ship to the iPhone
that way I will be on the same OS as
everybody else twelve percent of
androids on Oreo and I'm not one of them
if the note nine launches with pie I'll
consider it otherwise that's iPhone here
I come that is one of the saddest parts
about Android yes we saw the stats
terrible 12% adoption of Oreo now we had
pie and sadly the Galaxy Note 9 didn't
launch a pie
I can't wait to buy the new note 9 so
that I can get Android pie in 2020 you
know what I'm gonna have to defend
Samsung on this one ever so slightly
the company has gotten better I noticed
that the node eight got the update a lot
earlier than previous devices did CC
then on Tuesday I asked you about the
red hydrogen one pre-orders have begun
the phone was not cheap definitely and
we didn't have any word on accessories I
asked you what you thought 272 comments
I'm sorry but the red hydrogen one is
dead on arrival especially with those
last year specifications with the crazy
price tag I hope the camera makes it
worth it you know I wouldn't say dead on
arrival
I do understand this will be animation
product the thing about it is the clock
of snapdragon 845 does bring significant
better photography than the 835 just
from the chipset itself so I do agree
with you on the spec side the hydrogen
one costs way too much it looks like a
very interesting phone but I honestly
wouldn't pay over a thousand dollars for
any phone dude I seriously don't blame
you I feel 1,000 dollars is too much for
any device I do
stand again this device has a purpose
yeah but it's a lot of money without
accessories on its own launching so it's
an expensive product with last year
specifications they should take page
four out of essential I mean the pH one
already has android pi it does have
android Pi but we don't even know how
long that phone will be supported
particularly with how things develop so
I do get your point but on Wednesday we
talked about the Google pixel three we
had some leaks we saw accessories in the
box I asked you what you thought about
the phone we have three hundred and
twenty comments seriously Google that
not is deeper than the Pacific Ocean all
right I can't laugh right now because
I'm really sick with allergies oh my god
that was a good one pray for these
photos being a prank
most definitely I'm hoping that they are
because well we heard that it's a
possibility that Google is just you know
pulling our hair with this one that
apparently there is really another phone
we'll see
screw pixel three excel let's get the
regular pixel three you know I bought
the regular pixel in the first
generation because both phones were just
as ugly it could be that I end up doing
the same thing this year we'll see then
on Thursday it was Samsung Galaxy Note 9
day we covered unpacked we had a lot of
videos all right now daily went live
really late but I asked you what you
thought about everything that was
announced we had 609 comments very nice
phone good to see the headphone jack and
no knotch
would be great to do a comparison with a
new iPhone and the new Google pixel
phone definitely that coverage is coming
so far will tell you I am really liking
that note 9 so I feel the comparisons
will fare very interestingly I think
interestingly is a word right
even though this phone is a beast I'm
still going to wait for the s10 plus
beyond - you know there are significant
rumors that the s10 will be something
completely different to what we
currently see I just this is actually
probably the first time that I really
love a Galaxy Note so quickly we'll see
it's definitely a node made to
perfection but the perfection cost you
more than $1000 you buy an LED TV or a
MacBook or a surface book in that price
come on Sammy you know I would totally
agree with you if you didn't have
companies like Apple pushing a phone
with a lot less features for the same
price I feel that companies are just
they're going for prosperous with the
price tag we see oneplus just completely
challenging that and winning so we'll
see and then finally Friday the hottest
news were about the Google pixel three
excelled there were rumors that there
were three cameras on that phone I asked
you what do you think there were three
cameras and we had 492 comments three
front cameras so recognition duh all
right guys don't make me laugh I can't
laugh right now but yes that was that
was hilarious
those three cameras are there to have a
better view of what manufacturers are
doing right and Google is missing tell
them to use binoculars - all right guys
so David told me that the script was
hilarious this week because of those
comments I yeah I get it all right but
notch deserves its own zip codes sheesh
all right yes I again there are rumors
that the not just fake that this whole
design is not gonna happen that Google
is just pushing this out to hide
whatever it is that it's really working
on I really hope so there is nothing
symmetrical about this film but oh my
god Google has proven me wrong in the
past so we definitely will see that's it
