with what Samsung is brain with the
galaxy s 8 so just claim that we should
expect new Apple hardware next week it
seems that google just decided to make
it others have a wearable like really
wearable i'm high metal iveta and i
would highly suggest you stay warm
tomorrow with the snowstorm that's being
predicted for the east coast the liquor
store was packed this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
he had another streaming service that
goes premium pandora is probably one of
the first companies to bring us
streaming services but its way to get
rid of ads and just their whole way to
continue with radio didn't seem to be
too popular now the company things that
that's not enough to charge five dollars
why not just go to 10 and let's go
premium just like Spotify and Apple
music you're doing so that is a new
option that you should be getting weird
not sure if it's going to help the
company take off any more than it
already has a little spotlight over to
Google and Levi's we don't usually talk
about clothing here but it sees a google
is taking wearables seriously now again
the company is working with Levi's on
project jacquard and the whole concept
here is to build a smart jacket I assume
that the way this is going to work is
just connecting through bluetooth to
your phone and provide you different
ways to interact with it the question
I'm asking myself is how is this any
different than a SmartWatch mainly when
the jacket is going to cost you hundred
fifty dollars sleeve as a comment what
do you think those of you wondering
exactly when are we getting the next
generation iPads I am one that's waiting
for them we hear two very interesting
things number one is it apparently there
are four new iPad variants coming to the
market and for those of you wondering
when apparently it is going to happen
silently next week it seems that Apple
is not launching anything hot up to the
point where these could just be
incremental upgrades to cream hardware
which is the Apple way of doing things
so stay tuned it could happen as early
as late next week now it's part about
the samsung galaxy s 8 there are some
leaked images of the phone in its gold
color option which looks exactly like
the gold color options that we've seen
from
in the past all this is great and we
love the fact that the company is
staying true to that gloss that we
really liked on previous years but the
problem is I don't know look at the top
of the Hat phone is it just me or is
that a very busy top of a phone with
cameras and sensors and just about all
the crazy things that we wonder why
Samsung cannot just figure out a way to
cover them up a little more we'll see
and finally the very hot news today have
to do again with the samsung galaxy s 8
this time because KGI securities has
just shined them over what the company
is predicting for the phone AGI is very
famous for predicting things and doing
it well and it seems that a company is
predicting that sampling is not going to
sell as crazy as its sold galaxies in
the past the company is not saying that
it has everything to do with the note 7
or with the company being tarnished in
its reputation according to KGI the
samsung galaxy SI is not going to be hot
enough to warrant people to go crazy for
it sort of like the way the company
predicted that the iphone 6s and the
iphone 7 weren't going to be hot cells
as well so it leads me to the question
of the day from all the leaks and from
everything that we've seen do you think
that the samsung galaxy s 8 will bring
hot enough changes for you to go crazy
for them in my case after using devices
like the LG G 6 and the whole new
paradigm shift to larger displays on
smaller chasity's who I do think it's
going to bring a lot of hot stuff but
leave us a comment down below we looked
in on your opinion friends you know the
legos we want to get the news earlier
