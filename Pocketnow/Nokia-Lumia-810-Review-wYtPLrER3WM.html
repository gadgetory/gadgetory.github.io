exclusive take on the mid-range Lumia
820 does it bring enough heat to stand
on the same footing as its stock 820
companion more importantly is it worth
the price that t-mobile is asking I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our full review of the Nokia
Lumia 810 the Nokia Lumia 810 doesn't
really differ much from its 820
progenitor in its internals we're
looking at the same dual-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 running at 1.5 gigahertz
backed up by a gig of ram and 8 gigs of
storage with expansion possible up to an
additional 64 gigs via microSD the
battery is an 1800 milliamp hour unit
offering 360 hours of 3G standby time
according to Nokia this being a t-mobile
device there's no LTE onboard as there
is on Verizon's variant the 822 but the
a10 does include support for HSPA+ up to
42 megabits down if t-mobile's network
offers it in your area the primary
shooter is an 8 megapixel unit with carl
zeiss optics and a dual LED flash
capable of recording 1080p video the
display is an 800 by 480 AMOLED panel
that will be familiar to anyone who's
used the lumia 900 it's got Nokia's
clear black technology to keep the
blacks deep and the color saturation is
very high as is typical of OLED
technology nokia has brought the user
controllable super sensitive touch
technology to the 810 allowing you to
use the device with thin gloves on the
displays low resolution might bother
folks who demand the sharpest text or
the cleanest video and it's going to
look very dated after a two-year
contract expires but today it's a fair
panel and it's high saturation makes
Windows Phone 8 really really pop in the
hand the Lumia 810 is a strange device
it's comfortable to hold and it's
neither too heavy nor too light at 145
grams but it's the Box iasts smartphone
we've laid our hands on it nearly 11 mm
thick it's not felt at all and that
feeling is amplified by the strange
plums sides and awkward chine around the
backside of the battery cover that
actually makes it comfortable to use as
a camera especially with this super
clicky shutter button but it's bulky in
a pocket it's soft touch back feels good
on the skin but there's nothing aside
from the camera lens to spruce up the
back it's even got a pretty bland face
looking a lot like the early Windows
Phone 7 generic hardware renders the
available cyan battery cover might do
something to spruce it up but unless
you're a fan of minimalism taken to an
extreme there's not a lot to praise
about the 8 tends aesthetics on the plus
side that means it's not a phone you're
going to worry about damaging the 810
feels like a tank and between the soft
touch paint job on the back and the
Gorilla Glass to display protection it
can probably hold up to a fair bit of
abuse
the Lumia 810 runs Windows Phone 8 which
our own Adam Lane covered in an
extensive review a few weeks ago so
we'll just touch on the essentials here
a Windows Phone has never required
blockbuster hardware to run smoothly and
that holds true for version 8 honey I 10
responsiveness is smooth as silk
smoother than almost anything else on
the market in most instances now we've
said it before and it holds true today
this is not a power users OS or a
platform for customization fanatics you
can change Windows Phones accent color
and now you can of course resize your
live tiles but that's about it the
social media integration is better than
on other platforms you just jump into
the people hub to see what your friends
on Facebook and Twitter are doing and
you can view all your interactions with
one person by looking at their contact
info which is tremendously useful but
know even a little outside the parameter
of what Windows Phone thinks you should
be doing there's no support there is no
way to like a comment someone leaves on
your facebook status
there's no autocomplete for usernames or
hashtags and no multiple user support
and Twitter that may seem trivial but
for a platform that prides itself on its
social integration it's not it's a big
oversight one of the things you pay
extra for when you buy a Nokia Lumia
device over say an HTC Windows Phone is
the special apps that Nokia includes as
value adds on top of the stock Windows
Phone experience while Nokia's efforts
to improve on Bing Maps only met with
limited success it's still far inferior
to Google Maps in features and
functionality its efforts on other apps
shine Nokia transit doesn't have many
options but it's a beautiful app that
will tell you what buses or trains are
nearby and it'll even let you plan a
trip
based on those arrival times Nokia Drive
gave us voice-guided turn-by-turn
directions on an 80-mile day trip and
stuck with us even through a few wrong
turns since it hosts the maps locally on
the device it's not affected by local
network conditions which is good
Nokia music served well as our
replacement for Spotify and Pandora as
we wait for those apps to make the leap
over to Windows Phone 8
and it did a pretty good job you can't
stream specific songs but there are a
multitude of stations available to
choose from and you can buy specific
tracks if you want the Nokia software
suite does a good job of patching up
some holes left open by Windows Phone 8
and it's still-growing third-party
ecosystem
Nokia's offerings still have some
growing up to do but they're much better
than nothing and people who want that
added functionality probably won't have
a problem paying extra for a Nokia phone
over a competitor's offering
we tested the Lumia 810 in and around
the Greater Boston area New York City
and the Northeast Corridor joining the
to our experience wasn't great t-mobile
USA was the carrier that kicked off the
trend of branding HSPA coverage as 4G
which is ironic considering we never
broke eight megabit download speeds in
our time with the 810 on t-mobile's
network most of the time we averaged
around half that speed and that's when
we could get a signal at all t-mobile's
coverage was substantially inferior to
its competitors in our area and indoor
coverage was subpar almost everywhere we
went your mileage will of course vary
based on where you live and work when we
could make them voice calls were clear
for what that's worth both on the
earpiece and via the speakerphone as for
optics despite not being blessed with
the PureView branding of the 920 the
Lumia 810 s 8 megapixel camera delivers
good performance images come out a
little warmer than the 920 s PureView
shots and they lose some of their
sharpness in maximum zoom video quality
is quite good with quick white balance
correction and good clear audio though
continuous autofocus is slow and
inconsistent time overall the Lumia 810
pax one of the better mid-range
smartphone cameras we've seen the a-10
handled gaming and other processor
intensive activities well and if you
haven't played Microsoft's rise of glory
yet you should it's awesome when not
engaged in these battery draining
diversions the device features very
respectable endurance we are routinely
able to get a full day's use out of the
device with moderate to heavy use
at the end of the day the Nokia Lumia
810 delivers on its promise of being a
solid mid-range Windows Phone 8 device
from a manufacturer with a good
reputation its hardware is capable and
even goes the extra mile in some
respects like the camera and battery
life but it's low resolution display and
ho-hum construction aren't going to turn
many heads Windows Phone 8 has inherited
its predecessors beautiful design unique
features and buttery smooth UI but also
it's sometimes Spartan lack of features
the nokia software suite goes a long way
toward filling this gap but the one
$49.99 contract price or $99.99 on a
value plan seems a little steep to us
especially considering that the far
superior Lumia 920 can be had over at
AT&amp;amp;T for the same price we give the
Nokia Lumia 810 a 7 out of 10
