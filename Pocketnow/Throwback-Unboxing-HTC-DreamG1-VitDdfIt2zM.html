Android smartphone in the world a device
with a legacy like that deserves more
than just a throwback review it deserves
a throwback unboxing as well I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and I never
owned an HTC dream or g1 so join me as I
find out what's in the box so the full
throwback review is coming later in the
day and stay tuned all the way to the
end of this video so you learn how to
get your voice included in the throwback
review for now we're just going to be
using our trusty well-used and in need
of sharpening unboxing knife to get
inside this packaging now a close
inspection of this packaging reveals
that this is not a carrier branded box
this is kind of a generic HTC boxes
nothing on it this has dream we have
just some very very generic iconography
here very very very obviously this has
been reboxed we're thinking by the
retailer that supplied this device to us
but you know we're gonna find out
exactly how close to original this
packaging can be it's part of the
mystery it's part of the fun this has
this is obviously a true unboxing you
are seeing it for the first time as mi
and here we got some kind of
non-standard bubble wrap but the device
is front and center looks like maybe the
black edition of the g1 slash dream
let's see what else is in the box an HTC
smart mobility Y that is just stark
isn't it and this this screams reprint
to me but oh it's not okay so this is
the t-mobile branded user guide all
kinds of fun stuff in here from an era
in 2008 when the user manuals were still
printed instead of PDFs very very
interesting indeed looks like some HTC
branded earphones here that feel to the
touch exceedingly uncomfortable but
always nice to see your buds in the box
a USB cable that is a mini USB not micro
USB as was
standard for the time and the battery
not packaged inside the unit so you
forget a milli ampair already Wow
doesn't really look like a manufacturer
original battery therefore hte g1
alright it might be wrong on that but
it's looking like an aftermarket battery
at this point 3.7 volts at 1400 milliamp
hours let's clear all this stuff away
and get back to the phone itself hop on
the phone that of its packaging here we
can take a first look at this hardware
and it looks like we've got a like-new
protector on the camera lens there
here's that soft touch back to call out
with Google right there turn it around
to the front and it doesn't look like we
have a screen protector on there looks
like just a standard just a naked screen
but the device looking in very very very
nice shape certainly doing better than
the first g1 we ordered from eBay which
arrived shattered so we're already ahead
of the game let's pop out the keyboard
and there's that physical keyboard there
looks like a protector on the keyboard
itself that's something we can pull off
let's see if we can cut the music and do
that
now that's a keyboard just begging to be
typed upon before we bring the unboxing
to a halt so we can go into the full
review we will just go ahead and pop off
the back door here take out the label
with the serial numbers and we'll pop in
the battery slide on in here pop the
cover back on very deep cover for a
quite a thick phone and we'll see if we
can get some juice here on a first boot
Vieira's our buzz there's our carrier
splash screen confirming in addition to
the branding up top that this is the
t-mobile branded g1 for America's first
Android phone released more than four
years ago almost five years ago powering
on in our studio today some of you might
remember the animated splash screen for
the first version of Android or the
first commercially available version of
Android and there we are we might have
to adjust that date a little bit folks
we have a full throwback review coming
later in the day as I say and if you're
seeing this before 6 p.m. Eastern on
June 24th you have a chance to weigh in
tweet at Captain to phones with the
hashtag g1 throw back with your memories
your good times your bad times your
thoughts on the HTC g1 slash HTC dream
and you might find your tweet included
in our throwback review until then
follow us on social media subscribe here
on YouTube drop us a like if you enjoyed
the unboxing and leave a comment if you
have something else to say once again
