galaxy note 7 over reason explosion
issues and well I phones have begun
exploding as well because copying is the
natural thing mhcc seems to be ready to
launch Android we're products but with a
different kick I'm hi Mary Vera on
pretty much two gallons of coffee
because I only slept around two hours
but hey it's Monday that's the main
reason why this is house daily
the official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for a very
good android wear SmartWatch that's good
for running notice did not say Fitness
good for running the boto 360 sport is
currently available again with deals one
hundred and forty dollars on amazon for
a limited time is the watch worth it i
have it there i like it again for
running but that's just about all it can
do well and speaking of wearables that
our fitness oriented we know about HTC's
partnership with under armour i still
continue using their health band and it
seems the company's not done there we
heard rumors that HTC was working on an
android wear SmartWatch but apparently
it's not going to be an HTC product it's
going to be the under armour SmartWatch
it makes a lot of sense polar just came
out with their m600 that m600 is a very
very good Fitness SmartWatch so it makes
all the sense in the world for this to
happen stay tuned let's see when and for
those of you that have seven hundred and
ninety-nine dollars to spare and you
want to try something daring and you
probably want to give windows 10 mobile
a last try the HP elite x3 is currently
available in the microsoft store for
that crazy price tag you have to notice
HP and Microsoft are trying to sell this
product as the premium no holds bar
windows 10 mobile smartphone at it is
it's got all the latest specifications
and it can become a great computer
through you know the dock and everything
it's just windows 10 mobile sadly that's
the problem now let's move the spotlight
over two explosions because that's the
new thing for smartphones this year last
year was bending and well before that it
was in 10 of problems now smartphones
exploded because the iphone 6 plus has
exploded to two different customers
over the last weekend and this is very
interesting to one customer Apple is not
responding to another Apple offered a
replacement which is the common thing
but still if Apple has not pronounced
that they have any sort of issues and
obviously it'll take some time to figure
out what's going on but yeah iphone
six-plus 'as notice so we're talking
about two year old smartphone and
finally the very explosive news today
have to do with the Samsung Galaxy Note
seven two separate things number one
well there was another explosion up to
the point where Samsung has halted
production of the smartphone until they
can figure out what's going on one and
two US carriers have confirmed that
they're no longer selling the phone so
if you want at a galaxy note 7 you're
pretty much left out in the cold but I
think that that's kind of a safe cold
with everything that's happening lately
and it's this is rather sad I even
mentioned it on twitter lately I really
really want to use this phone i have my
replacement unit right there in the
drawer it's turned off and i'm just so
sad this is probably the best galaxy
note ever and it makes me feel that this
is happening but it leads me to the
question of the day do you think that
samsung should completely kill the
galaxy note 7 and just move on or do you
feel that the company should launch a
Galaxy Note 7s with a changes that
figure out battery life and everything
because in my case I think that that's
what's supposed to happen the company
should just rebrand right now and say
this is a brand new smartphone that
we're selling yeah with pretty much the
same internals but would specifications
that would meet the problems that are
happening right now leave us a comment
