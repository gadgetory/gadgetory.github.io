Danny I hate everything wing it thank
you so much for never including me in
you are so welcome and can we delete
that Haim is the type of guy who will
introduce himself to his wife every time
he returns from a trip now I just need
to get married that's right it's that
time of the week I'm Jaime Rivera and
what are you for the rest of the time of
the week dude just let me introduce my
video that's right it's that time of the
week I'm Haim every bit of this is
PocketNow and this is the PocketNow
daily recap your comments for this week
so before we begin Monday segment yes I
have read your comments yes apparently
the huawei ban has been lifted obviously
we need a parking out daily to cover
that but the problem is that these were
just president Trump's statements we
just checked then huawei still on the
blacklist so obviously we need for that
to get fixed first and then surely we
will cover it but let's begin Monday
with the topic of the iPhone 11 we had
some case leaks and these show that
apparently the stove is going to be
flushed to the chassis which is
interesting I asked you what you thought
about the design we had 492 comments a
stove that can burn your wallet dude you
got 87 likes man wow I'm impressed but
yeah right I mean you could just grab
your current wallet throw it in the
stove and you'll get the same thing
Apple still top camera is like ginger
hair it may be growing on you but that
doesn't mean it's right what is ginger
hair I'll have to google that single
piece of glass that way when you break
the back of your phone it will most
likely affect the camera lens as well
fantastic design Apple making money yes
now that I think of it that is a good
point true that could happen and the
biggest problem is that because that
back is soldered to what holds the logic
board that's a very expensive
replacement it's currently 500 bucks for
the tennis max oh yeah that's that's bad
Tim Apple no camera huh it's
revolutionary yes I can't wait to see
the keynote of this is real and have
Apple claimed that nobody's done this
flash and the LG G 8 and that's yeah
that's exactly the industry right now
with Apple then on Tuesday the topic was
Samsung the rumours that we possibly
will get a foldable that's a clamshell
smartphone I asked you if you would be
interested in something like that
because well Samsung does have their
clamshell phones and the whole idea of
making them foldable is interesting we
had 400 won comments
just gonna fold my money and keep them
in my pocket now dude two puns in one
statement wow I am impressed yeah if I
could fold my Galaxy S 10 plus then that
would be cool this is why I would get
more excited over a galaxy fold yes I
would totally love to have a clamshell
smartphone that's a phone and that is
just smaller in my pocket that for me
would be fantastic I feel if that's
better than having a foldable tablet
that becomes a phone so it will be and a
fold the bowl
I will walk myself out yes please
somebody escort this guy okay pun number
what three in this video all right fine
damn right about the Motorola RAZR and
have been waiting for a long time to see
the phone in actual launch it could have
been a great phone and amazing design
would just love to have one I would love
to have one too I feel it that's the way
the market should go then on Wednesday
the topic was the Samsung Galaxy Note
tenth of rumors with case makers that
apparently only one of these Galaxy Note
tents will bring 5g and well it was a
lot like for example it was that the pro
is going to bring 5g and the others
weren't which is completely opposite to
the previous rumors I asked you what you
thought about this possibility we had
493 comments this is a mess that no
shouldn't have a pro the note is the pro
don't make a lesser version yes you're
totally right then Galaxy Note has
always been the pro smartphone the
standard I totally get your point I just
I do want a smaller galaxy note that's
the thing I feel that I would love the
features and I don't necessarily want to
put up with the heft that's me I'm only
going to buy the note 10 with the
headphone jack so you're not going to
buy the note 10 according to the rumors
if I were getting the note 10 I would
get the smaller model but I'm not
getting the note 10 I got a pixel 3a and
I love it um dude yeah these are
completely different markets mid-range
err flagship you know without expandable
storage and a headphone jack I don't
care if it's one or two devices it could
bring six gee I'll never buy any of them
and I think you won't be buying smart
for a better year stick with mid Rangers
or whatever brings the headphone jack
dude I agree with you
I love the headphone jack I you know I
don't really care much about expandable
storage lately I have to admit with the
amount of gigabytes of storage that we
get now but you have a headphone jack
alone for me as a big deal to then on
Thursday the topic was Apple Johnny I've
stepping down as chief design officer
he's launching his own company obviously
this leaves a lot of speculation over
the future of Apple design queuing the
cheese grater and jokes and everything
but anyways 409 comments I asked you
what you thought I just hope we don't
get another Andy Rubin in the making
essentially speaking my god pun number
four I believe but I'm trying to
understand why you mention Andy Rubin as
the case that's a completely different
story in the case of Android I'm
concerned in a way for the departure of
Johnny I've but at the same time I'm
curious as to what's coming after his
departure I'm hoping it's not more
cheese grater designs or well it depends
um I do if you notice the recent news
that we've covered on Friday where his
responsibilities were being scaled back
anyway since 2015 I think that what we
see now is the tenure of a Johnny I've
that's a little more absent anyways so I
don't think that things are going to
change from what we currently already
see well I don't know I hear his first
job is designing Walmart's noon line of
cheese graters I was waiting for the
jokes man yeah well something tells me
Morgan Freeman will get the job of
introducing new Apple products oh man
that would definitely be cool but if you
notice in the case of the Mac Pro he
didn't introduce it in the video so
that's something that's already working
I just yeah Morgan Freeman on the video
would have been better and then finally
on Friday the topic was the Samsung
Galaxy Note 10
in addition to the pro in addition to
the normal one we currently have three
Galaxy S 10 so I'm like well that's a
possibility I asked you what you thought
we had 377 comments I think they simply
renamed the 10 Pro to 10 plus says the
note line is already a proline I
that could be a possibility I mean the
rumors of the pro variant are so early
that you know I believe that there's a
chance that they could have just changed
things down the line I mean things
change all the time you have a good
point which variant has the headphone
jack I don't care about 5g for now a lot
of people won't I just will see man I
hope that they bring it at least in the
larger variant I mean you have the space
three variants is only good if there's a
sub 5.9 inch flat screen note 10 V with
no cutbacks on specs oh man that would
be so cool I would totally want that
phone as well three notes is absolutely
ridiculous hey do you want this
oversized phone this is even more over
this even more oversized phone and this
alright
or this dinner tray with 5g all right
man I needed that laughs it's been a
crazy time baby
oh man can you imagine obviously one of
these devices gonna bring 5g it's going
to be a large film because they need the
RF antenna space anyways so yeah we'll
see what happens in the end man thank
you for that that's it for the parking
