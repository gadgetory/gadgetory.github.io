least looking forward to reviewing when
I took delivery on our iPad pro review
device I thought it was a big overpriced
and cumbersome product and while most of
those things are true it's also a
product that unlocks a whole new side of
Apple's monstrous new tablet and it's
pretty fun to play with I'm Michael
Fisher and this is your guided tour of
the Apple pencil unboxing the Apple
pencil is much like unboxing any Apple
product the packaging is beautiful and
smart and when you get to the device its
presented very nicely in the hand the
pencil itself is both bigger and heavier
than it first appears and it's finish is
glossy which will come as a surprise if
you're expecting a matte painted
Ticonderoga that makes the pencil look
odd from some angles and when you get to
charging the thing odd doesn't even
begin to cover it
look I get it there were limited options
here and plugging the pencil directly
into the iPad pro makes practical sense
plus apples included an adapter in the
box so you can charge it via a lightning
cable if you have one handy out in the
field though you're unlikely to bring
that adapter with you and so you're
stuck looking dumb and it also it makes
the iPad impossible to use while you
wait for it to charge fortunately that
doesn't take long the pencil charges
very quickly and it comes with a full
battery out of the box you can pair it
right away
that's done via bluetooth and it's very
straightforward once connected the
pencil stands in as a surrogate finger
to let you navigate the software much as
you would with an S Pen on a Galaxy Note
Apple will offer more pencil tips in the
future with different textures and
materials the two that come in the box
feel a little harsher on the glass than
I'd expected a little too firm but that
crispness pays off when you get to the
real business of the pencil taking notes
drawing and annotating note-taking is
very straightforward and I chose to do
it in Evernote which already has a
built-in sketch mode from emmos Apple
has done a good job of keeping the
latency low here and it's nice to be
able to vary the pencils angle to change
the way the virtual ankle
the tip my penmanship is pretty terrible
to begin with though and the reduced
friction of plastic on glass plus my
mounting impatience met my text soon got
less than legible also I started getting
writer's cramp driving gotten since
college so I switched over to something
more worthy of a pencil tour mediocre
artwork for this I used Adobe sketch
which is one of a number of pencil
enabled apps already available in the
store it's surprisingly easy to learn
with a lot of available brushes to let
you channel your inner Bob Ross and
tools to help you keep your perspective
consistent something we all struggle
with anyway after about 40 minutes of
doodling I had myself a fairly fridge
worthy Titanic and I'd only lost a
handful of percentage points on the
battery power also it was a way more
comfortable experience than I'd expected
that holds true for pretty much anything
you can do with the Apple pencil whether
you're using it to play games browse the
web annotate some contracts highlight a
document just dawdle around an iOS it's
a powerful comfortable little peripheral
and it helps make the case that the iPad
pro is more than just a gigantic screen
I hate that there's nowhere to store it
in or on the iPad and I hate that it's a
hundred bucks when similar style I are
half the price but this is an Apple
product so I won't even feign surprise
in all seriousness those who need a tool
like this artists designers and so on
will spend the money one way or the
other and I think most of them will be
plenty pleased with what the Apple
pencil brings to the table even if
they're too embarrassed to charge it in
public we'll have more thoughts on the
Apple pencil and its keyboard companion
in our extended iPad pro review coming
in the weeks ahead folks until then let
us know about your experiences with the
