yeah Barry colab right there are third
big big trip oh come one was for a very
sad experience but we're here at a CES
and that's a lot happier than the last
duo video that we did exactly that
anyways I'm hi I'm every better with
pocket now I'm one Carlos bag now let's
talk about our impressions of CES 2017
alright starting off with the things
that most impressed us on the show floor
there are a couple really big surprises
I know you've got one for me that but
but can we make it not focused on mobile
like okay yeah yeah cuz I've got 12 kg
yeah yeah here's the thing CES is mostly
not about mobile oh I really like that
shit prev sunflower that you guys did
that hands-on I mean it's I it's genius
I mean I've always it's always that
problem you're in the backyard you're
trying to crack grab some Sun or have
the kids and you're always having to
move everything around your umbrella
because it's not cover night well
totally who came up with an idea of a
product that actually does it for you
know it's really impressive because this
thing's like a fully articulated robot
it's artificially intelligent to track
the Sun to get the optimal charging I
was really impressed with this this
outlay the robotics in this the geek in
me that used to read like old science
fiction stories I thought was super
impressive I love that I love that but
what about you okay so I got to take it
old-school you know we know like vinyl
is starting to outsell like digital
music downloads and stuff like that and
for me it's seeing the return of film
code oh yeah the spring yeah the super
eight Kodak is bringing back ektachrome
ektachrome film to power their new super
8 camera it looks like one of those
little Bolex cameras and it's got its
own LCD just like you know a modern-day
camera but it's still shooting to film
they'll take the film ok question are
you willing to buy it so the initial
it's super cool the only the only thing
we don't know yet is how much it's gonna
cost so the limited edition run is gonna
be way too expensive for me to pick one
up ok but once the consumer version
comes out I might be throwing some cash
down to grab one of those ok cool but
all right let's focus on mobile and
their wording there were some phones to
talk about you a few are you for you
very few but how about you
oh I'll go first I so for me it's
expanding the scope of the phone so
zenfone AR was a very happy surprise it
was really cool yeah not only project
tango finally another more phone sighs
to device not a mini tablet device with
project tango for augmented reality and
that it was also going to be daydream
compatible that to me is a very positive
step for you know VRA our content and I
know you were wanting to kind of take it
old story we're still old school all
right forgot it's not the keyboard oh I
really like what mcel has done with all
cattell uh the design of the idol for
the idol 4s and I'm not going to lie I
love that they've taken charge of the
new blackberry yeah uh it's our hottest
video so far oh it improves that people
want the blackberry brand to come back
this is going to be a totally different
approach but I feel that it's so way to
keep a brand alive I mean I feel that
it's a smarter way where blackberry
focuses on their expert team which is
software and TCL will focus on their
expert see which is hardware yeah I
think a lot of us were really concerned
about the news that blackberry was going
to be ending their own in-house hardware
production I'm not on anymore anymore if
you were to pick a company I think
they're in really good hands with TCO
yeah of course no show is perfect and
are a few things about ces there's
always a few things about ces where you
have expectations built up and they
don't fully kind of meet your
expectations what what was maybe one
thing that you felt didn't quite land
right here it where are the phones man I
mean CES is slowly becoming a show of
TV's smart vehicle concepts that will
probably never reach the market and a
ton of vaporware we're here at CES
because it's the largest consumer
electronics show but we cannot forget
that the gadget that we're always
carrying is a phone I mean why not more
mobile devices I there was a time where
Sony use this show to announce the
product really Samson use the show to
announce their phones and sadly we are
not getting the flagships and I
understand the companies want their own
events and stuff like that that's cool
but believe it or not see as this place
is packed and there is no better
audience than to do it here in Las Vegas
that's me how about you men so I have
some concerns I mean yeah I just plugs n
phone as one of my favorite finds on the
on the floor this year but we saw a lot
of like VR promotion but not a lot of
substance no no like for VR we're really
waiting for good content we want those
great VR experiences and a lot of people
had these like VR buzzword you know
changing the paradigm of interacting and
Millennials and stuff and the millennial
that a lot of mr. millennial you owe me
my spectacles thank you come here
millennial yeah come here come here
milady look at this guy look at the rear
three i bought them for him and then buy
them from that how dare you but anyways
let's leave it for the question of this
