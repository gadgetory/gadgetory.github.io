the Apple watch or at least so they say
we get additional leaks of the samsung
galaxy s6 plus and the SU seem serious
about expanding its zenfone 2 i'm high
net iveta and i'm willing to bet ten
dollars that my lighting is off one more
time this is pocket now daily we've got
the usual confusing news from a company
like HTC that same company they decided
not to launch so many phones last year
or a couple of years ago is doing the
complete opposite now we've got the HTC
One m8 being announced today it looks a
lot like the one of nine plus only it's
polycarbonate it brings a 5.2 inch quad
HD display in editions and three gigs of
ram and media text new Helio x10
processor but the problem is it's for
the Asian market you know the way this
rolls and a su seems to not be done with
launching more azuz and phone two
variants today we get two more a 5-inch
720p model that includes sort of a
Snapdragon 410 processor not confirmed
and another 6 inch 1080p display model
which offers sort of a Snapdragon 615
these are non confirmations yet but you
get more options with this phone and the
first ones were already extremely
affordable which is great and when it
comes to leaks let's talk about the Moto
X 2015 we're not sure exactly when we're
getting this film but we get the first
leaks of what to expect with its design
it looks different completely different
to the previous dimple type design even
though the dimple is still there reminds
us of an old HTC phone from back in the
day but we're apparently getting a 3 gig
ram option here with 32 gigs of storage
in addition to a quad HD display in the
front hopefully AMOLED still again we're
not really sure when to expect this
product but yes you can bet we're
looking out for it as long as they fix
the camera other leagues from a very
trusted source also mention the galaxy
s6 plus we've been covering the
specifications but we haven't seen the
design and we see it today and if that
looks just like a galaxy s6 edge only
bloated we don't blame you because
that's pretty much the case it could be
that they're playing with the operating
system
just making icons smaller it could be so
many things with the sleek but yeah it
seems this product could be a reality
and it could look pretty much like
everything else that's already out there
for the galaxy s6 only bigger which is
the same thing the iphone 6 plus this
would make sense and finally for the
very interesting news of the day it
seems that Apple is finally able to meet
the man with the Apple watch first of
all by releasing a statement confirming
that those orders that were made in May
will be completed in two weeks and you
can also get select Apple watches in
retail stores within the next two weeks
in addition to other partners across
Europe because apple also confirms that
it is expanding its reach of the Apple
watch outside the united states as of
jun 26 and all these announcements are
extremely interesting because we're just
the corner way from WWDC we don't
understand why they didn't just announce
it at the event this is the first time
Apple does things this way but hey it
leads me to the question of the day
after all the hype do you still feel the
needed or compelled to go have a look at
an Apple watch and buy one because in my
case I've been using it for two weeks
pretty much three weeks already and I
like it I just don't love it mainly
because of its design but leave us a
comment down below what is your case
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video was filming sure you follow us on
