shown on video the latest leaks of the
Moto X plus one show a significant
design changes again somebody please
fire Microsoft's marketing agency I'm
high netting that I and what kind of
reaction do you get from a geek like me
on a Friday answers in the comments this
is pocket out daily let's begin today
with what's official if we could call it
that way it's more like unofficial there
is this iphone 6 clone that you can buy
today and no this is not a dummy this is
actually a clone it's a fully working
phone that is made to look like the
iPhone 6 only that it's not really the
iphone 6 1 and number 2 it's not really
running iOS it's actually running a
version of Android that is so well skin
that it looks exactly like iOS 7 links
in the description watch the full video
tell us what you think and would you
even buy something like this I would now
let's talk about the Moto X plus one for
the longest time we've wanted to see the
successor of the Moto X and yea even
though it hasn't been the most popular
phone in the world it is one of our most
beloved phones here at pocket now ever
since our review and it turns out first
of all it looks a lot like the Moto X if
you look at it but then again it doesn't
so there's a metal trim for the same
chassis that we saw previously there is
this wooden back that doesn't look like
a bit match as well it seems that
they're still working on it but you do
see microsd support which is great but
even cooler is the fact that that ring
around the camera aside from being
bigger also has it to LED flashes on the
ring which is an interesting design
aspect hopefully we'll be seeing the
Moto X plus one soon at least for the
fallen hopefully Motorola does see a
break with this phone now a pair of
leaks that have just become a reality
you have to do with the Samsung gear VR
we've heard about their virtual reality
attempts for the longest time but really
didn't know what to make of it until
today we finally get leaked software
from Samsung on how to get the gear VR
to work and interesting this is actually
it's sort of like an oculus rift but it
isn't because you actually need to
attach the phone to the headset and
we've actually seen something like this
previously i don't remember from which
company but it does seem that it will
just another way to interact with your
phone it's not really something as cool
as we would assume we thought that it
would be this accessory that it would
work on its own and probably stream
through bluetooth or something but not
require your phone to be on your head
the imagine getting a phone call let's
see what we get now after LG's a
reported success yesterday let's talk
about the LG d 635 apparently the
company is working on returning to
Windows Phone after so many years
company was one of the pioneers and then
they never came back and it seemed to
the company is working on this 5-inch
720p display for Windows Phone device
and hopefully it does look a lot like
the g3 we only know aspects of the
product like for example the fact that
it has a Snapdragon 800 we haven't
really seen design aspects yet but
hopefully of LG can pull it off meaning
make it look like the g3 it could be a
hit even at 720p let's see what they
come up with and finally for the
ridiculous news of the day please
everybody licks the description watch
Microsoft's new ad campaign for OneNote
and the surface pro 3 it's called click
it and I note it can somebody please
talk to Microsoft's ad agency I mean
this is probably the poorest ripoff I've
ever seen of LMFAO in history aside from
the fact of the group doesn't even exist
anymore and it doesn't even seem that
these are performers these are geeks
it's like probably the most hilarious
and probably dumbest I don't know show
that I've ever seen ever I don't think
I've ever seen a more ridiculous ad but
you know that's me that's my opinion
those are my thoughts I don't feel that
it makes me want to buy the surface pro
3 any more than it already has I don't
feel that it makes me consider what
notes something more important on the
contrary I think that it's just mocking
people but that leads me to the question
of the day what do you think about this
ad do you think that Microsoft is
actually driving you to buy a surface
pro 3 in my particular case again like I
explained the company is sadly doesn't
get it when it comes to impactful
marketing or if it does the ads are
great but they don't really Drive what
they want from people so leave us a
comment down below what do you think
friends yes you know the drill if you
want to get them as earlier before this
video is film if you follow us on
pocketnow.com is described tentative
channel as well you'll also follow me on
twitter
underscore Rivera please get this video
