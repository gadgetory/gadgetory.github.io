now calm you know it's really nice to
assign pictures to your contacts so what
they call or text message you can see a
picture of them trouble is that's often
a little bit of a pain because you have
to load the pictures on your phone then
assign them to the contacts we may have
a better way with Android if I which is
a new free app from Google which allows
you to create an avatar for someone
based on the Android robot let's get to
it so this is really awesome and it
really has a great interface so what we
can do here is change a wide variety of
things about the Android robot if we
press the button on the left we get this
awesome interface that lets a swipe
between the different things you can
change we can change the skin color of
the Android person so maybe someone more
tan here we can change the hairstyle to
a wide variety of different things you
can even change the color of the hair
let's give them a sort of dark hair okay
that looks good change of clothes this
is a guy it looks like so we need
something that's not a dress okay that's
looking awesome add some pencil well you
get the point so you can go through try
to make the avatar look like the person
that you want to add the picture to and
when you're done you get the Android
robot you press the button in the bottom
right corner it will render it and then
you go to contact icon and from there
you can add it to your favorite context
really cool again it's called an Android
if I and it's free available in the
market it just came out please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked it and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
