now calm and in this video we're going
to talk about how Windows Phone 7 syncs
with zune desktop software for your
computer let's take a look okey before
getting started we have to mention it
this is not final windows phone 7
hardware or software and this is also
not a final version of the zoom
interface for windows phone
synchronization just keep that in mind
so let's go through this and see what
happens so it says it's detected that a
windows phone has been connected says
please take a few moments to settle up
and personalize your phone if your phone
needs an update this could take a while
so let's see what we can do from here so
click Next and give the phone a name
says the LG GW nine 10s the LG Panther
and we're going to go to next checking
for updates and there should be an
update for this particular device we're
running on build 64 14 right now and
maybe not maybe there isn't a update
after all so it says click collection
above to see the media on your computer
to sync drag and drop things to your
phone so what we have now this is
actually zoom version 4.7 what you get
right now if you have zune is 4.2 so
we've got a new item up here that says
phone and from here we also have sub
taps music videos pictures and podcasts
so what you can do is sign in to your
zune account and you can synchronize
various pieces of multimedia with your
device so right now there's just some
standard stuff on here i want to right
click and sync this to the LG G w910 and
over here it should be synchronizing
right now but perhaps not let's see go
to music yep it's there so presumably if
we take out the LG Panther here and turn
it on and go into the zune application
we should have this new music let's take
a look connected ok so we can't do
anything right now if we so sink
complete kind of get the zune dots
flying around if we unplug and go into
zune again here it is works like magic
there's the music we just synchronized
perfect synchronization here with this
version of the zune software let's plug
it back in and see if there's any other
features to explore and the music is
playing here and of course in Windows 17
you can access play controls by hitting
volume and then they pop in from the top
we never actually talked about that in
previous Windows Phone 7 videos so want
to plug this in connected and let's go
back to the phone here summary here's
something interesting it says you can
sync wirelessly keep your phone up to
date without having to plug into your
computer sync it over your home wireless
network wow that's going to be awesome
with Windows Phone 7 wireless sync keep
your phone up to date their latest
multimedia multimedia without having to
plug into a computer get started you'll
need to make some make sure your phone
is turned on and connected to the home
wireless network use your phone to
connect the network you wish and then
refresh below Wow let's see if that
works so I'm gonna unplug I'm going to
synchronize this or get it connected to
my Wi-Fi network and see if I can do
wireless sync on Windows Phone of course
the zune products that have Wi-Fi can do
wireless sync but they're bringing that
to Windows Phone which is great let's
see okay I'm connected via Wi-Fi with
the Panther here it doesn't look like
the phone is showing up here in the
settings but while we're in the settings
look look at these other options so
we've sync options this is the phone
settings we can choose what is synced
music videos pictures or podcast we have
sync groups so you can determine which
folders are synchronizing you can name
your phone you can link from your device
is incompatible with this feature I'm
curious to see what linking is update
this is where you go to see if there is
an update and of course you need to plug
in the phone to get an update so I'm
going to do that real quick okay just
detected the phone it's checking for
updates can't check for updates right
now okay that's fine wireless sync this
is where you set it up set up wireless
sync we'll go back to that a second see
what else we have pictures and video you
can change these settings for the image
quality conversion settings for audio
reserved space and error reporting let's
try this wireless sync one more time so
set up
are the sync your phone is connected to
that's the name might network perfect
next okay Wow wireless sync setup is
complete really so I'm going to unplug
the phone and see if this wireless sync
actually work so i'm going to go back
here try to synchronize another piece of
multimedia with the phone so i'm going
to just try to right click on this and
sync with LG and hmm well perhaps that
features not working this particular
build or at least i'm not doing it right
so that was just a quick look at the zoo
and integration with Windows Phone there
will be a new version of zune when
Windows Phone is released from there you
can synchronize your multimedia you can
manage your phone all from that familiar
to an interface you can also do wireless
sync which is really fantastic and the
device works just like a zune kind of
like a zune HD to be exact and playback
is fantastic you get the beautiful zune
interface and you can manage multimedia
right from your device so please give
this video a thumbs up if you enjoyed it
and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
