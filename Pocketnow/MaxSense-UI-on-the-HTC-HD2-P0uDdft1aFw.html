pocket now calm windows mobile
development from Microsoft may have
stopped for the most part until the
windows phone 7 comes out but that
doesn't mean that the development of
xda-developers hasn't decreased in
activity in fact there's still a lot
going on in the windows mobile world
over at XDA developers new interface is
coming out a lot of new awesome roms in
this video we're going to show you the
max sense UI built into an energy rom
from XDA developers let's get to it
now we've already covered the max sense
UI in a previous video back in May but
there have been a lot of changes since
then so we wanted to film another video
and show you what has changed so let's
start off you're going to unlock the
device and this is the unlock screen
taken from the HTC HD Mini so if we had
extra notifications we would see them
down here but we can slide to a mock so
what we're dealing with here is a lot of
changes all of which really tap into
sense 2.5 of the weather widget and the
calendar widget and things like that for
example this first screen which has
widgets on it that you can customize if
you tap on the clock there for five
appointments it will take you into the
standard HTC interface that's the sense
interface so this may look familiar to
you if you're running stock HTC sense
let's jump back home the same applies to
the calendar widget and let's say the
weather if you tap on the weather you're
taken into the beautiful sense tab the
weather interface here with the weather
animations very nice-looking and all of
this is customizable we can also swipe
to the left to see some widgets that are
over here and this is a really cool
widget it ties into the HTC favorite
people modules so that you can flip
through and see your your favorite
people and from here you can choose to
call them text message them send them an
email right from this little cool widget
up here we have an internet search tab
kind of like you would get on Android
and down here is a multimedia player so
you can control music right from your
home screen now if we go to the other
direction we have a variety of toggle
switches turn on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
again all of these are customizable I'll
talk about that in a second but first I
want to talk about what's going on up
here in the taskbar we have the start
menu button which sometimes is difficult
open there it goes you can also of
course use the start menu button on your
HTC hd2 but all of these other icons are
very easy to use so we can very very
quickly turn on and off Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth of course you can do it from
this screen as well too so if we tap on
the Wi-Fi icon we should get a pop-up
that says Wi-Fi all for Wi-Fi settings
and let's tap that again we can tap on
the Bluetooth icon to turn on Bluetooth
and you get the idea all of these icons
do something different and over here on
the right we have a task manager which
will quickly let you turn on and off of
variety programs
have anything open right now so it's not
showing me anything there so let's talk
about customizing some of these widgets
will go to a kind of empty screen over
here and we'll press this button in the
bottom right corner and click edit
widgets again very much like Android so
we can press the plus button let's say
we want to add a clock and analog clock
so here's the clock you can move it
around or you can throw it in the trash
bin again it's very much like Android
but on your windows mobile phone
extremely smooth and fluid and it taps
into the HTC Sense interface which is
just great and when you're done you can
press the check mark and you are all set
now another piece of functionality as we
wrap up this video is here on the bottom
if you flick this to the left you access
your quick launch I guess application
and you can swipe to the right and put a
bunch of program icons here programs
that you use on a regular basis so quite
simply you tap on one of the shortcuts
and this is the quick link so you can
add people that you call on a regular
basis you can add websites this may look
familiar from the Home tab of HTC sense
2.5 so we can go to bookmarks and it
will save a little thumbnail of the
website if you've been to it let's go
back to that and if you haven't been to
it it'll just show you the standard
stock little bookmark icon there so max
sense UI is an awesome way to experience
HTC sense in a different way and it's
now being cooked into a lot of roms over
on XDA Developers I'll post a link in
the description to this particular rom
that is an energy rom and it's very easy
to install and it looks great please
