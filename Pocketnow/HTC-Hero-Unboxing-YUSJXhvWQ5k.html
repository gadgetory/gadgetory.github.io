pocket now calm and this is the unboxing
of the HTC hero this is androids latest
and greatest we're going to be taking a
look at the latest rendition of Android
and the Sense UI from the perspective of
a Windows Mobile user we're also going
to be looking at the Sense UI because
it's coming to Windows Mobile in various
forms so really going to take a look at
where HTC is going with their user
interfaces so without further ado let's
get to the unboxing came in a little bag
here HTC bag that's interesting small
box what wow this box looks to be super
small I guess this is the the next wave
of HTC boxes they're gonna be about the
size of an iPhone box although this is
much bigger than the iPhone box Wow look
at this never seen them HTC packaging
like this this basically has the same
internals as a lot of the HTC Windows
Mobile devices as the Qualcomm 528
megahertz processor it's got 288
megabytes of RAM this sounds just like
the touch pro2 actually this is a
European phone so you're not going to
get us 3G with this so Wow let's see how
this slides out wow this is great and
then it presents the device nicely in
this in this way wow that's beautiful
let's take out the device and we'll look
at that in a minute see what we get in
the box looks like we have a micro SD
card two gigabyte microSD card that's
great
wall charger welcome to HTC HTC care
warranty okay very nice everything's
white so we have the white wall charger
which is actually quite different than
the wall chargers the
HTC devices usually ship with and we
have a USB cable with HTC's proprietary
is that what it is yeah their
proprietary ext USB which also also work
with your mini USB accessories and then
we have some headphones here while to
take a look at that in more detail later
so let's push this all aside and take a
look at the hero all right so go out
this tab Wow
this device feels awesome it's got the
chin wow that is amazing it's got a
Teflon coating it feels very non
slippery in the hand actually it doesn't
feel like I'm going to drop it it's got
almost a it's smoothing yet it's got a
very fine texture to it
Wow it's pretty thin although it's gonna
be thicker than the other devices that
we're gonna compare this against feels
like it would make for a very nice phone
with the chin holding it up to your ear
obviously let's take a look at the hero
compared to other devices so we'll take
a look at the iPhone first the hero has
a much smaller screen than the iPhone in
terms of thickness it's kind of hard to
judge thickness because of the chin but
it's definitely thicker than the iPhone
let's take a look at the new Samsung
omnia 2 also has a smaller screen than
the omnia 2 and is about the same
thickness a little bit thicker possibly
the hero doesn't feel as thick as say
the omnia 2 because it's got this
tapered edge sort of like the iPhone
does let's take a look at how it
compares to the HTC Touch HD and there
are some similarities between these HTC
devices like the speaker girl at the top
with the LED indicator light on either
side and in terms of thickness it is
thicker and finally next to the HTC
touch diamond2 it's a more wide than the
touch diamond2 if we stack them on one
another but in terms of thickness turn
it the other way they're actually about
the same thickness
so that's it for the unboxing of the HTC
hero really impressed with the new style
of HTC boxes how the device slides down
like so it's really important when you
spend a lot of money on a cell phone
that the unboxing experience is one that
you actually enjoy so coming up soon
we're going to talk about the Sense UI
we're going to talk about how the latest
Android experience compares to that of
Windows Mobile so we'll be back soon
with more if you want an HTC Hero of
your own there now shipping at Clover co
uk we'll be back soon with more that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
