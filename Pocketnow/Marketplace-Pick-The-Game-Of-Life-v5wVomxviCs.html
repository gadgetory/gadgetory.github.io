packing.com and today i'm going to
demonstrate the game of life on a
windows mobile device and you can find
this on marketplace and the full version
costs around six dollars and ninety-nine
cents so i'm going to enable sound for
just a couple seconds and it's by EA
sports and hasbro we'll just let it load
it takes a couple seconds ok so here we
are and as you can hear the sound that's
just for demonstrational purposes we're
going to turn that off right now and
there we go you can also set vibration
on or off click on the X and this game
has a few options you can actually play
by yourself if I click new game it'll
launch a new game and I can just play
that by myself or I can pass and play so
it's almost like a travel version of the
game of life so I'm just going to click
new game right here ok and I can select
which color I like yellow so let's try
that and we'll pick Bob and a number of
players so i can pick how many opponents
i want so i'm just going to click to
will just select her that's fine and now
we can click on a couple of cards click
on this one now we need to roll so let's
click the center and I gotta to so I
didn't do too well and now it's rachel's
turn and it looks like she gets to go
first and she wants to be a police
officer so if you've ever played the
game of life it's really simple and you
can either pick between going on your
career or starting college and on each
one of these little life tiles here you
actually get more money at the end when
you retire so I'm going to start college
because I think that's the appropriate
way to go and I got a 5 let's see and
semester in London so I got a life tyle
as you can see and I get more money at
the end of the game so if at any time I
want to see what my opponents money is
or what my current cash value is I can
look here of course it says ten thousand
dollars but I can also click on here and
it shows that she has eighty thousand
dollars she's the green car she is a
female as you can see a little pink dot
right there and let's see if want to
click on her
can also look and see what other kind of
things she has on see she's a police
officer as we already saw which has no
house yet no long-term investment so
we'll just go back and if I want to
select down here I have the little green
rectangle down here and I can return to
gangor the options invest so I've wanted
to invest in one of these numbers I can
choose a number let's say I wanted to
pick number two and i purchased a
long-term investment in number two so
that means any time someone roles in on
our spins on the two i actually get
money for that so we'll just go back so
anytime I get stuck on this game I can
just go to help information and I can
look at the game controls spinning and
moving life token share the wealth
retirement and game tips so if i click
on game tips it gives me a long blurb of
what I should and shouldn't do so we'll
just click back and go back to our game
so this is the game of life and this is
another marketplace pick where we pick
some fun and interesting games on
windows mobile marketplace thanks for
