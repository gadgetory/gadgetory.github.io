devices Instagram video is now
officially taking a stab at vine and
reports have Microsoft and Nokia
canceling negotiations for a buyout I'm
hi Mary vetta and you know what the only
thing we need now is a samsung galaxy
air conditioner this is pocket out daily
let's start stay off with an interesting
product announcement for all five of you
out there that use vine actively well
instagram has now released their new
instagram video which as opposed to vine
instead of getting seven seconds you get
15 and instead of having to move to the
vine application to get your videos you
can get everything within the same
instagram video web and it's kind of
interesting that they're taking a stab
at a project that hasn't really taken
off that's the reality of mine but let's
see if Instagram can figure it out now
let's move the spotlight over to the
Nvidia shield you know that Android
based game console that's coming in the
next seven days is actually dropping in
price from 350 bucks to three hundred
dollars and for those of you the pre
ordered don't worry you're actually
getting a discount of 50 bucks somehow I
just don't know how just yet but it's
kind of interesting to see this product
hasn't been launched yet and it's
already getting a price drop that
doesn't sound it now let's talk about
Apple and Samsung you know digit times
is reporting that both companies are
actively working on bringing liquid
cooling systems for their future
generation iphones and a probable future
generation galaxy smartphone and even
more interesting is that apparently the
progress on this project is so advanced
that we could be seeing a product by the
end of this year and the only product by
the end of this year is actually the
iphone 5s because galaxies get launched
you know by the next year or it could be
the galaxy note 3 so stay tuned and
let's see what we get I mean whatever's
out there that will allow processing
power to be faster or for your phone out
to heat up I'm all-in now let's talk
about some expected news you know after
the crazy reports that Huawei wants to
buy Nokia a lot of us panicked and as it
turns out the Wall Street Journal has
some internal sources confirming that
Microsoft have been flirting to buy
Nokia in the last couple of weeks and
you know
matter of fact Microsoft actually pulled
back from the negotiations because
according to them nokia was asking for
too much money and they don't feel that
nokia has made the dent that they were
expecting in the smartphone market with
the Lumia devices and yes that's what
Microsoft said according to the internal
sources you know it's kind of
interesting I just don't know why they
didn't accept to buy the company I mean
Nokia's really having a hard time right
now and given what happened to Paul
Motorola and just about everybody else I
guess that's the future for nokia if
whatever happens on their July eleventh
event doesn't seem to wow anyone and
finally for the hot news of the day
Samsung has just announced a bevy of a
team windows-based products and galaxy
products we already heard the
announcements of the galaxy s4 active in
galaxy s4 mini we have some hands-on
videos links in the description down
below but we did get the galaxy s4 zoom
which was the leaked photos that we saw
recently a galaxy s4 will the big galaxy
camera at the back which looks like an
adapter but it's actually the phone
that's it we also got the samsung galaxy
and x which is a mirrorless camera which
is pretty much everything that we wanted
the galaxy camera to be from the first
minute that it was launched then we've
got other awesome the teeth products
we've got in the teeth q which is a 13
inch tablet that's very interesting
we've also got a new teeth tab 3 which
is obviously even better with the
Haswell processor it's got 9 hours of
battery it's very interesting I mean
there are so many products that I can't
even begin to tell you links in the
description for every single progress
without hands on for everything but
anyways that leads me to the question of
the day out of all the products that
were announced today which one is the
one you're interested in most in my
particular case honestly that's samsung
galaxy and X I mean a mirrorless camera
with the option to have Android as long
as they're not using the you know the
processor from Android for processing
images meaning that they're using a
better sensor then when we got on the
Galaxy camera the original Galaxy camera
I'm all in for that NX I mean that's the
way that the Galaxy camera should have
always been but leave us a comment down
below which is your favorite product of
course it's always for an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet OB she follow us
