pocketnow.com and this is a video review
of the joby gorillapod
a pod is a flexible
that has very firm joints that you can
wrap around anything so like a tree or
even a rock or something like that the
reason that it could be better than a
traditional tripod is because one it's
smaller so you can fit this in a bag if
you're going camping too you can put it
up in a tree or hang it from the ceiling
it's really versatile so let me give you
an idea of what it's comprised of here
it's comprised of these arms that have
these very bendable and stiff joints
that can kind of be placed in any
direction or in any configuration that
you want towards the top there is a
standard holder for a camera so I'm
going to take my old canon powershot
here and just kind of twist it on and of
course it keeps it very secure and we're
going to go outside and actually wrap
this around a tree and give you an idea
of how this may work now Joe B is coming
out with a gorillapod for mobile devices
so that means that you can kind of find
a place in your car that may be a pillar
where the shifter is and wrap one of
these around the pillar and have your
device held in a position that's perfect
for you so I'm looking forward to that
it's not out yet so let's take a look at
how this works in another environment
alright and we're outside now sorry
about the background noise if you hear
some children in the background so here
i have the gorillapod wrapped around a
tree and it's very secure and you can
move this along the branch or even put
it on a smaller branch probably not one
of these because it's too flimsy but
it's very versatile is very sturdy and
certainly from here you can you can tilt
the end of the camera because there are
joints towards the base of the camera
tube hey and what if you want to take a
picture from a low perspective here i
have had got the joby gorillapod
attached to a spigot which is just a
about a foot off the ground that may
make for an interesting kind of shot and
again it's pretty pretty secure you know
you can use all of the arms to wrap
around the spicket or whatever it takes
to keep it secure and of course if you
have the need to hang your camera upside
down for some reason you can certainly
do that here we have it hanging from a
bet
banister and it's perfectly secure by
now you probably have a good idea if
this is a product for you if you go
camping or hiking and you you want to
take a picture from the perspective of a
tree you don't have a tripod on you you
want to take a picture with your family
or whoever you're camping with this may
be a good idea you could probably get
pretty creative in the applications of
using this but for me I'm traditional I
like to have a tripod a standard
old-fashioned tripod to take videos and
pictures with and so this product comes
in three flavors and many different
colors the first one which you're
looking at is the original this costs
about 2495 the gorillapod SLR which is a
little bit beefier to handle the weight
of an SLR camera is 4495 and then the
gorillapod srl SLR zoom which is made
for SLR cameras with big zoom lenses
again adding to the weight it costs 5495
a good tripod can be had for about
thirty or forty dollars so you are
paying a bit especially on the SLR
models for the novelty of having the
flexible arms and that sort of thing and
something else you may find interesting
is you can actually pull hard enough you
can detach these joints and so if you
want to lengthen one leg in particular
you could do that so I don't think this
is intended by the company but you know
let's get creative right so if you want
to lengthen one leg for some reason and
kind of have this short leg over here
you can do that now something that
concerns me is the longevity of these
legs I actually had another gorilla pod
that I was sent and I was playing with
it and after a while some joints
actually broke after bending it back and
forth back and forth a lot of times now
that may above be above and beyond what
the average person may inflict on their
gorilla pod but it's something to
consider I'm not sure how long this
would last so like I said by now you
probably know if this is a product that
would be useful to you if you go camping
if you're if you're out in the wild a
lot you don't have the space to carry a
full fledged tripod then this could be a
good addition to your arsenal though for
me a traditional person that takes most
of my pictures indoors and my videos
indoors
in this kind of situation a standard
tripod does me just fine but I i like
the innovation that joe b has brought
forth here this is unique product and it
does what it says it does that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
