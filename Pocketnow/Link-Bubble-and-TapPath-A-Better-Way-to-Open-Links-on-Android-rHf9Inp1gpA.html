you're not alone I'm Taylor Martin with
PocketNow and this is link bubble and
tap path Chris lacy is a developer who
likes to think outside the box to point
out the tiny idiosyncrasies of the
Android experience you didn't realize
we're driving you mad and fixed them
that's exactly what he's done with two
of his newest apps tap path and link
bubble so what are they exactly
I covered link bubble back in April
shortly after its release it's a
lightweight floating bubble browser that
loads web pages in the background to
provide an uninterrupted browsing
experience for instance without link
bubble tapping any old link will shoot
you out of the app you're currently in
and load the default browser you will
then have to sit and wait for the page
to fully load a few seconds here and
there is no big deal and the rocky
handoff between the application and
browser is something most users can deal
with but those precious seconds add up
over time sometimes you just want to
continue looking at your Twitter or
Google+ feeds while loading pages in the
background that was Lacey's reason for
creating link bubble to save time and
load pages discreetly without
interrupting whatever it was you were
doing when you click the link with link
bubble installed and set as the default
browser tapping a link in almost any
application will pop out a tiny bubble
inside that bubble the web page will
load while you continue doing what you
were doing or tapping more links to load
at your own convenience you can browse
all the links you opened loading
multiple links from a Google now search
is a perfect example of how this is
useful it's simple and very effective
and has saved me an average of 1.2
minutes per link but that's not all link
bubble does it parses the information in
a web page and provides shortcuts to
media embedded in a page like YouTube
videos and if a link is associated with
a third-party app like YouTube Instagram
or Twitter link bubble will take care of
the handoff in the background seamlessly
and take you straight to the app it also
comes with quick user definable
shortcuts for sharing drag a link bubble
to the upper right or left corner to
share to your preferred methods and
inflate bubble isn't the best way to
view a web page you can easily jump to
your secondary browser using the
selected fallback browser in the
settings and that brings us to tap path
a much more specific app
but make no mistake it's just as helpful
because loading a link into the wrong
type of browser can just as easily waste
your time the tap path only does one
thing it's a link handler what that
means is it allows you to choose how to
open a link using a combination of taps
single double or triple taps in this
case a single tap launches a link in
link bubble a double tap will load a
link in cm browser and a triple tap will
send the link to buffer through the tap
path app you can easily customize how
each tap combination
we'll handle links this is very helpful
if you know link bubble isn't the best
option like for instance if you need to
copy text in that case a double tap to
load a link in cm browser would be more
effective and efficient link bubble and
tap path are available in Google Play
for free and 99 cents respectively but
if you want the full link bubble
experience you'll need to purchase the
2.99 cent Pro unlock folks if you like
to absolutely talked about in this video
you can find links to their Google Play
pages in the description below and if

now I'm Taylor Martin cast protect on
Twitter and I will see you next time
