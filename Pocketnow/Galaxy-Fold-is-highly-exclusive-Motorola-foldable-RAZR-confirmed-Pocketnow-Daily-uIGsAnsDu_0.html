you're gonna have a hard time to get the
device when oral SVP came on record to
basically tell us that we should expect
the foldable very soon
and what was rarely and won't be
adopting wireless charging anytime soon
but because of the problems of wireless
charging I'm high metal Iveta
this is the last day of MWC it's been
great and we've still got more videos to
go this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with
interesting developments when it comes
to particularly Huawei it seems that
there will also be a p30 light it just
got certified and Tina meaning we're
actually getting very close to a launch
and bear in mind in previous years the
librarian has always launched earlier
obviously watered-down specifications
but we do hear that it will have a
triple camera you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about the
Google pixel 3 light as apparently that
one just passed through certification
through the FCC both devices actually
and probably the most interesting thing
here is I thought that the processor was
going to be watered down but the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 is actually not
and according to the source it seems
that this is what we're getting here so
wow this is interesting that was talked
about oneplus as well the company made a
big splash here at MWC and pete lau in a
recent interview was asked about things
like for example what are wireless
charging and according to him the reason
why the company has not adopted it is
because it's slow and everything about
oneplus is speed we've got speed
charging a speedy phone he's right
actually but show me he just came up
with a proprietary technology we'll see
now let's move the spotlight over to
motorola we know that the company has
made a huge splash if not the company
somebody who created the concept of that
possible motive razor smartphone and
according to one of the companies we
tease the company is actually working on
a project like this think about it is
they're not doing it for the reasons
that other companies are doing it
actually they're looking for a solution
to scratch screens because we know the
technology the sort of polycarbonate
technology that they use on this place
will see if we actually end up getting
something at some point and finally the
hotness they have to do with the samsung
galaxy fold for those of you
when we're getting the product it seems
the same thing pretty much just
confirmed that there should be an event
in April will we'll be able to actually
see it because here at MWC everything
was 5g we're in allow to touch the
foldable apparently there will be
something separate for that I guess
another unpacked and during that process
apparently the company is planning to
make the launch immediately but it's
going to launch in very limited
quantities and only for specific people
and specific retail and that makes a lot
of sense the product is really expensive
but in today's question that is now I
mean what do you think do you think that
this should be like a limited edition
galaxy but the company should push it to
the mainstream because in my case it
makes a lot of sense for them not to
make such a crazy launch initially they
want to see the reaction but the
reaction would change with the price tag
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know your opinion friends again if
you want to get the news earlier follow
us I'm talking about comments scratch to
both of our channels english and spanish
