necessarily found success with Android
the unique software that the company has
provided to the privies very compelling
and one of the coolest tricks has just
extended to other Android devices I'm
hiding a tie with pocket down here with
a quick look at the BlackBerry hub for
Android
I've been a big fan of the BlackBerry
hub since the early days the whole idea
of consolidating all communications just
one application is actually cool and
this was one of the signature features
of the BlackBerry Prive for the hop to
work you need an Android device running
version 6 marshmallow or above the
installation is actually two
applications in one being the hub one of
these and then the BlackBerry hub plus
services the other now having it work is
a little tricky email synchronization
actually requires you to setup your
email separately within the hub and
email is actually viewed differently
within this application than you would
with other clients for services like
Twitter you have to authorize access
through the hub sort of like what you do
with Instagram as well now for other
social applications to work you require
a little digging blackberry provides an
alert at the beginning for you to enable
these services but if you didn't act on
it
you have to actually go into settings
lock screen and security other security
settings and then with a notification
access for you to enable the BlackBerry
hub plus services sort of like what you
do with Android wear yes this process
varies dramatically depending on your
launcher so your mileage may vary this
also means that you aren't really
duplicating social interaction each time
you receive a social notification the
hub will actually launch the application
and allow you to interact with it but
that also means that there is really no
true synchronization here the hub merely
notifies you but then you act within the
app as I mentioned earlier and then once
everything is fully setup the hub is
very convenient messaging is stacked by
dates and you can filter the hub however
you want for example I have it set to
give me email social and messaging
separately so that I don't get
sidetracked through social feeds during
my working hours about the only thing
that I'm not liking so far that I might
have not found a way to figure out yet
is how to filter certain notifications
that are social for example I have
Twitter set to only send me
notifications of people that I follow
within Twitter but the hub doesn't
really differentiate that and gives me
all notifications from Twitter
regardless I also wish that there was a
better Gmail integration as the hub
doesn't real
give me options to archive anything all
I can do is move email to other folders
and then moving to other folders is
rather cumbersome another important
thing is that you have to disable
notifications from your separate email
clients to avoid dupes though that's
just with email everything else just the
faults of the hub and then you can
launch the third-party application later
for those of you that are looking into a
different approach to communication this
is one of the best things that I
personally consider blackberry has
brought to the market some people prefer
things to be separate and that's the
reason why you have different filters
but again it's really cool to not have
to be jumping within applications to
communicate with people and obviously
we'd love to know your impressions about
the BlackBerry hub in the comments down
