ever wondered why it's so difficult to
transfer a file or really any
information from one phone to another
using NFC well I've got the answer to
that question along with some history of
another transport mechanism you may or
may not remember let's go take a look
let's spend a few minutes talking about
the history of transfer stuff shall we
back in the days before Bluetooth and
Bluetooth really isn't well a halfway
decent transport mechanism but way back
when we had something called irda that
was infrared something something
basically it was like a remote control
see that little guy right there you had
a little sensor and a little transmitter
that shot infrared light and while you
could control your TV with it which was
fun not really but you know hey we we
could and and that was cool and made us
speaks but you could also transfer stuff
from one device to another device by
beaming it beaming that's what they
called it just line up your device with
that other device hit the beam and you
know after five minutes your JPEG that
was really low quality already was
transferred over to the other device
woohoo ok so for transfers of pictures
and music files it was painful literally
painful halfway through most of the time
the transport would fail you'd have to
start all over again after three or four
times you just give up but that's okay
because only like eight of us have any
mp3s on our devices back then anyway so
no biggie and you know there were no
cameras on the devices back then anyway
so no biggie we could always email them
to each other and then wait until we got
back home so we could dock our phones
and send them through our desktop email
clients because that's what we did back
then yes kids back when I wow did I just
do that I'm old but infrared was kind of
a standard
it was really good for transporting say
business cards I love doing that I could
beam you my business cards by pointing
my phone at you and hitting beam and it
was relatively small so it took 10-15
seconds but I could transport all of my
contact information into your device
immediately and it was so cool as long
as you were using a device running the
same operating system that I was since I
was running windows ce e that meant
almost nobody because everyone else was
running palm there were some apps that
helped bridge the gap but most of the
time the other person also had to have
the poem equivalent of that app luckily
there was one I don't even remember the
name if you do put that down in the
comments that well it let you translate
everything with apologies to Gene
Roddenberry it was the universal
translator I could send it to a Newton I
could send it to a palm device all from
my windows siiii PDA because the app was
smart enough to say aha I know what
format to send that in wasn't quite
smart enough to figure out what kind of
device it was sending it to and do it
all automatically for you but hey at
least you could do it right and I could
and I did at least four times I did that
in real life in retrospect that was
probably an awful lot of effort wasted
but but passwords today today we have
NFC and it lives right back here in the
back of our phones in the back of our
tablets and it's making the world a
better place for everyone all over the
ok it's not and why isn't it well NFC is
near field communication so there's arts
first limitation it's near you've got to
literally have something like that close
if not touching to be able to get it to
work you've seen my neat little videos
where we showed off cool things you
could do with NFC and for everybody who
sent in their little tips and tricks of
what they're doing with NFC thank you so
much those are so cool but it's all
device to something if I don't want to
buy tags what can I do well I did buy a
whole bunch of tags and honestly after I
did those video
is you know how many tags I've burnt
none sorry it's just not that cool once
you get past it as soon as it becomes
more ubiquitous and less of a I'm a geek
and I can do this because I can it'll be
great but we're NFC really can shine is
here's one device and there's another
device around here somewhere here's one
device they both have em in the NFC in
them and I can tap them together and do
stuff well what can I do this is an
Android device this is an Android device
they both have that have NSC and they're
both running a the same version of the
operating system you know jelly bean so
it's great everything works fine I can
take a YouTube clip and say here send it
over there but i'm not sending the
youtube clip what I'm doing is I'm
opening the opening the YouTube app and
I'm sending that link or that reference
over to this other device this other
device says oh okay I know what you're
talking about and it opens and plays it
great if I want to send a a business
card and I have a special app that I've
built that in I can do that I can i can
send that over but unlimited very very
limited on how much data i can send in
fact like we just talked about I'm not
sending the data from my phone in my
youtube data to my tablet what I'm doing
is I'm sending a reference okay so what
does that have to do with anything let's
say I want to send a picture all I can
do the same thing this too this pink
great works except it's not going over
NFC it's going over Bluetooth or it
could be going over Wi-Fi direct or it
could be going over some other transport
medium all the NFC is doing is it's
starting the process it's saying hey
this guy wants to transfer something to
you and it's this type of thing and
here's how I want to do it this says
okay I know how to do that go ahead tada
it works and it's magic and it's
wonderful as long as you're the same
less what if you've
something that's not the same OS even
let's go back from jelly bean to ice
cream sandwich does it work not all of
it because there's new stuff that was
introduced in jelly bean that makes NFC
transfers better faster quicker more
helpful so if you're going back to ice
cream sandwich you're not going to be
able to do that or not going to be able
to do it as easily as you would with
jelly bean but that's still android to
android what about android to newton
little geek humor there because newton
doesn't exist anymore homeland silence
for newton but anyway nokia still exists
for a while anyway so what if i want to
send something from my android running
jelly bean to my nokia running Windows
Phone can I do that nope not good and
work why because they don't understand
each other it's NFC they should and this
is saying hey I've got this stuff I want
to send to you and this says I hear your
words but I have no idea what you're
saying dude no idea at all and it
doesn't let that work because the
transport layer isn't initialized it's
not started and it's not going to work
until we get everybody to work together
now what's gonna happen what's it going
to take to make this happen
unfortunately the big player out there
Apple they don't have NFC yet maybe soon
hopefully well then everything's going
to break because they're going to do it
their own way and that means it's
different than every other way out there
but that does mean that they are going
to push because there's like 18
gazillion Apple devices out there none
of which have NFC but the ones that will
everybody's going to try and be
interoperable with those and that's kind
of I predict going to push an
interoperability standard it's not
really a standard it's more of just an
ad-hoc little let's get everything to
work if we can and we probably will and
it'll be great it's not the way we
should go about doing things but it's
the way we're probably
going to have to once we do that however
transferring files no transferring cool
stuff back and forth it's going to be a
lot easier and isn't technology all
about making things easier so let me
know what stories you have about using
NFC in good ways or in bad ways success
stories or failures let us know down in
the comments we all want to know what
did you do to overcome those did you
revert back to the old i'll just email
you an attachment or did you do
something more creative let us know down
in the comments NFC still has a future
and not just as a credit card but as
something that can really open it up
we'll see more of that with the the
Nexus Q when it comes out and the NFC
stuff that you can do with it that'll be
fun for pocket now musing about NFC
interoperability and infrared of old I'm
