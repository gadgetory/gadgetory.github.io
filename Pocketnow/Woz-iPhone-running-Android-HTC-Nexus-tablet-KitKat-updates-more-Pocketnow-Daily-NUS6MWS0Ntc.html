consider building an iPhone running
Android HTC is now rumored to enter the
Nexus tablet and wearable market and if
you want a free Lumia 1020 there's
actually a cool way to get that I'm
hanging literally that I and Steve
Wozniak be careful what you wish for cuz
it might just happen this is PocketNow
daily let's just say off with some
official news as Microsoft has a very
very interesting deal if you're
interested in getting a Lumia 1020 or a
1520 I'm not talking about the cheap
Lumias I'm talking about the really good
ones
Microsoft is actually allowing trade-ins
listen to this for an iPhone 4 and
iPhone 4s or a galaxy s2 in good
conditions and it's hard to tell why
exactly those and not the newer ones but
still if you have an old iPhone 4 there
is obviously it catch this is on AT&amp;amp;T
you would have to upgrade from these
phones into other phones but that is
actually a very very cool deal and again
you get the phone completely free as
long as what you're trading in is in
good condition so move quick now let's
talk about Android 4.4 KitKat as
according to analysts this is probably
one of the slowest deployments of
Android but this is obviously not
Google's fault but it turns out that HTC
is down doing things right at least for
US customers which is great Verizon
customers can already get the update for
the HTC One which is awesome and if you
want the list for the rest of the
carriers into the description as that is
not happening yet but if you're also
holding on to a galaxy s4 and you have
an LTE advanced Snapdragon 800 processor
galaxy s4 then you should be a look as
you should be getting it as well but we
have no news for the United States as
that was apparently gonna happen March
somewhere around there now let's talk
about Amazon as the company's tactics
into getting new customers is getting
better and better each time initially we
had a barcode scanner for whenever you
wanted to see something on a retail
store and compared to their prices but
now the company is including an image
scanner on its iOS application Android
should get it soon and the idea is that
you not only scan anything that you see
at a store but you probably see
something that your friend has you take
a photo of it and scan it and it'll give
you information on how to buy it on
Amazon which is awesome just remember
that you can also use that Amazon
pricing at retail stores like Best Buy
for example to get a better price
so this is a good competition now let's
talk about HCC as the company is rumored
to be returning to the tablet market but
not just any market apparently the
company is working on the future Nexus
tablet and we're still on trip that
would be the Nexus 10 or the Nexus 7 but
it's being rumored for q3 2014 so it'll
most probably be the Nexus 7 or
something new but even more interesting
is that the company's chairwoman chair
when just came on record and confirmed
that the company is working on a
SmartWatch and the reason why this
SmartWatch will be so late which she's
ruining her the holiday season of this
year is because apparently this will be
something out of the ordinary something
great something awesome and worth
waiting for
it's just too bad we don't have a teaser
though and finally for the very odd but
expected news of the day is Steve
Wozniak is not only famous for being the
father of the personal computer as a
co-founder of Apple but also for his
very famous quotes and this time he just
said on an interview that Apple should
consider building an Android smartphone
an Android iPhone actually meaning that
we would keep the same design from Apple
which is legendary and beautiful and add
Android as an operating system which is
a great ecosystem and it's actually not
something new if you didn't know it you
can run Windows on a Mac legally meaning
there is an application within a Mac
called boot camp that you used to load
windows and you can just do it with
Windows which is awesome but that leads
me to the question of the day would you
be interested in an iPhone running
Android because in my particular case I
would I would love to do a boot to
Android for me it would be awesome but
