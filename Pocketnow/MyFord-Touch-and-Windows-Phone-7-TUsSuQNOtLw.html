examples of things that I can do this
just tell me what what car this is and
what the systems this is a 2011 ford
edge and the system we're looking at
here is called myford touch and it's the
newest system from ford based on sync
technology which is a forged platform
that's built on microsoft's embedded
technology some of this some of the
things that we have done with sink in
the past we can do with the system as
well friend of mine giving me a text
message I read them automatically I
could read it I don't know what it says
did Ken man sent us invite by the way we
have brunch at pranna Sean 20th so this
was my girlfriend actually just asking
me a friend of mine send it invite up
for dinner when the Dean came in you
press the ok button them so let me give
you just a quick introduction so the
MyFord Touch system includes the
information in the center stack here
including this touch screen but also
there are two displays in the instrument
cluster which two displays in the
instrument cluster which are also
coordinated with the center system and
so when I got that message i basically
selected a menu item that was already up
in the instrument cluster with this okay
i see and it in a read the message so
that's that's why i press that ok button
one of the interesting things about but
beyond obviously the coordination of the
displays here one of the interesting
things about it is the sync services
which this connects to so i can actually
with voice commands connect to a tell me
based set of services and actually
program the navigation system which is
what I'll do
for you right now please say a command
services connecting so it's connecting
to the internet so right now it's
connecting over my phone which is a
sancha so Samsung go focus what do you
want what a styling the phone number
directions to home the lectures to hug
if that's not right that's the voice
button and say go Bannock that's exactly
right so in the US a relatively small
percentage it's about a quarter of
phones actually have data tethering
enabled and so because we're not doing a
lot of data we actually just make a
voice call and we use old dial-up modem
kind of technology to actually send data
back and forth to the car and that works
with every every phone with bluetooth
anything yeah anything with bluetooth so
it downloaded download complete you may
now use your phone the download of the
destination to to the car i can i can
speak set his destination but i can also
hit that button and the navigation
systems program so i don't have to enter
addresses and things on the screen here
so you could have done that from the
steering wheel too i could have done
that from well i do basically did it
with with voice i could also program the
navigation system through the the
display here as well and i can also
speak an address if i wanted to speak
the address to to enter as the
destination but that's kind of that's
one of the new things that this does
some of the other stuff if you've seen
sink before making phone calls or
controlling media controlling my zune
that's in the
must you can you control media on your
Samsung Focus no well so I can pause and
play Bluetooth media through a 2d
exactly through a2dp ah but i can't
select so like I can say please say a
command USB USB say a command play
artist no doubt playing artists no doubt
so I can do that over a wired of over a
wire media devices plugged a to the
story to you but I can't do that over
the a tooth that's on the zune HD
exactly I can also control serious so
this has this has sirius XM in it so i
can tune too serious stations please say
a command sirius XM chill sorry please
say a command Oh serious serious say a
station name or number Sirius XM chill
chillin to Sirius XM chill
so i can i can i can say the names of
the stations i don't have to necessarily
know the number of the station and two
into it i can do the same i can tuned to
radio stations with voice using the same
speaking the frequency as well is this
your number of text messages that phone
the seven is the number of text messages
that I've received since I've been in
the car basically yeah and that's your
battery level battery level signal
strength the little symbol here means
that 911 assist is enabled so if I get
in accident over my bluetooth phone
emergency call will be made and the
position of the vehicle is automatically
sent to the emergency services I can
control you know the so the full kind of
heating and air conditioning system is
controlled through the system as well I
can please say a command climate
temperature 68 degrees did you say 68
degrees yes setting temperature to 68
degrees so I can kind of control
everything through the system and almost
everything through voice commands to
kind of help people focus on I'm driving
what else can do with the phone side
phone sites i can call please say a
command call Manuela Papa Doble on
mobile calling Manuela papadopoulou on
cell
saw one actually complete the call but I
can dial digits so it but it's reading
your essay a command yeah so it's
basically OOP cancel canceling its
downloaded my contacts from my phone
built a voice grammar out of all of all
of the names so that then I can kind of
just speak the name and which phone
number I want to call them on I can also
just speak the name and it'll say do you
want to call them on home work hour or
so and and I can can you send a text
message to them from voice without
taking hands off the wheel I can please
say a command fun phone say a command
send message 3 over 25 I don't have the
text message commands off the top of my
head because I never do it if you got a
text message could you reply to it using
voice yeah so this did penman sent us
invite by the way we have brunch at
pranna shown 20th that's the message we
heard earlier right here please say a
command Oh reply message replying to 14
2564 do you want to send message 15 to
14 cancel can sling I don't know the
commands to do it actually this is an
element system but your year so you
should be able to reply using using
voice I but can you only choose these
options when you're rip when you're
replying by voice you can only choose
one of the pre-configured options but
these are customizable so you can so
there's 15 here that are sort of
yeah come to fault in the system but I
can actually customize them on a website
and bring a USB key in the car or i can
edit them here yeah i can actually edit
them here when the car is not moving so
this is all disabled when the car is
moving and i can i can put in the text
that's what ever is mine yeah text that
I want to be selecting critical a custom
set basically okay one of the things
that for did with this system is they've
started a concept of four corners of the
screen and actually because it's easy to
feel it's easy to feel and they're
actually color-coded both with so media
are you know the media stuff here and
here are the same color okay climate
navigation are the same color and so
kind of part of it is to associate
colors with specific functions but also
as you say it's it's a little bit easier
to kind of when you're using a
touchscreen in the car to kind of go for
a corner of the screen and then a more
precise button and so you don't have to
look at the screen you can just feel
this corner exactly right off route
exactly you hit the repeat that repeat
navigation instruction but yes exactly
yeah that's good yeah so it helps that
helps with that a little bit obviously
one of the issues with touchscreens is
there's no kind of real tactile feedback
of the input and and so that's one of
the ways we're trying to address the
direction alright sounds good that's our
what do we call this again myford touch
is there a version or something no just
the latest myford touch on built on
scene thousand eleven yet built on sync
all right thank you very much yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
