now and we are here in london at the
samsung event and this is the samsung at
if Q which is either a windows tablet or
an Android tablet depending on your
choice it is right now running Windows
the flipping to Android is just one such
a weight and it's that fast let's take a
close look in his hands off so we are
right now in windows mode and it doesn't
really matter because we are going to
talk about specifications and I'm going
to start with the weight this is a
pretty hefty tablet ways one point 29
people Rams and that's probably because
the materials use this these are all
premium materials including the back
part and the front part we have a 13.3
inch display and according to Samsung
this is the highest resolution on a
tablet it's got 3,200 pixels by 1800
pixels for a told PPI rating of 275
samsung also specifically called out the
exceptional outdoor visibility of this
tablet it works perfectly in direct
sunlight now switching between the two
operating systems is this easy the sweet
bashing and it is possible with the help
of Intel's brand new
chips some other specifications include
4 gigabytes of ddr3 up to 256 internal
storage on SSD of course and we have a
720p camera up top and a Gigabit
Ethernet but let's go around the device
and I'll show you where exactly these
are right now we'll see that there is
the power plug the micro HDMI the volume
rockers for volume up and volume down
and this button right here is the auto
rotation on a fucking on the front
there's the Samsung branding and the
720p webcam and of course the obligatory
windows button which brings you back to
the home screen or brings you back to
your previous application in which case
right now it just switches between the
two OSS and Samsung specifically called
out the fact that you can pin Android
applications on this home screen of
Windows 8 let's continue with the tour
on this part right here we have the
power standby button we have the 3.5
liter headphone jack but once you
convert this because this is a
convertible other ports are being
revealed so we're lifting this up right
here and it reveals a full-size qwerty
keyboard
with the mouse buttons and of course the
trackpad or for your mouse the screen
can be propped up like this samsung also
said that we can use it as a floating
screen in case you want to show us
something to somebody else and let's try
to rotate it a little bit you can also
wrap it up like this so many many ways
to use this tablet of course the
accelerometer automatically adjusts the
orientation some other ports as I told
you are being revealed once the devil is
in this mode and right here you can see
the microSD expansion there we can
extend the internal storage further and
on the opposite side you can see the USB
ports it has a USB 3.0 as well as a USB
2.0 or but the specs don't stop here
because as you can probably spot in this
video we have the S Pen which is bundled
and the S Pen works
seamlessly on their windows and once you
press the button it acts as a right
click and it also works in Android as as
usual and since we are here in Android
let's take a look at the version of
Android running here we have hundred
that fortitude at you and as you can see
there is no skin on top of it
samsung didn't eat anything this is as
stock as it gets even more there are no
not even samsung applications and we're
guessing that since it's going to ship
with the S Pen Samsung will at one point
probably before launch before
availability bundled all its s
applications from the Galaxy Note 2 and
the Galaxy Note 10.1 so to wrap it up
this is a convertible it is gold atif q
it switches seamlessly between Android
and Windows 8 he can prop it up like
this or use it as a tablet with the
add-on S Pen 13.3 inch screen with a
qhd+ resolution of 3200 518 this was a
quick look at this awesome tablet will
probably have this in our labs for
review habitant are still in London
still let's let's lots of videos to
shoot thank you very much for watching
stay tuned
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
