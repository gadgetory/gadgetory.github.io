strong Sony Xperia tablet Z rumors
emerge and Android 4.2 point2 rumors
also become a reality I'm hi meri behna
well the Clark knows I'm losing my voice
but yes I'm here for another parking out
daily
now the Sony Xperia Z made a lot of
headlines at CES 2013 and I'll admit it
will probably be my next daily driver
rumors have it that Sony's already
working on Sony Xperia tablet Z and even
though I'm not really a big fan of
Android tablets it does have some
compelling specs up until when you
compare it to the Nexus 10 which has a
Retina display where is within right in
the territory and this sony xperia
tablet z and i'm already tongue twisted
with a clogged nose and everything has
barely a 1080p display and wc will be
the show for to see this tablet most
likely so we'll keep you posted and have
you been having bluetooth streaming
issues on android 4.2 point one with a
nexus 4 if you're one of the few lucky
people that actually have a nexus 4 well
apparently there are rumors that android
4.2 point2 is around the corner but
sadly it apparently will only deal with
the bluetooth streaming issues that
nexus for customers have there are no
dates no specific time tables and of
course there really is no specific date
for the nexus more as well so go figure
now samson was another company that
wowed everybody at CES 2013 with their
new octa-core that's right eight core
processor for mobile devices that almost
probably reach the galaxy lineup on 2013
which we're already on now if you're
wondering why would you ever want a
course on a smartphone or tablet well
listen to our pocket our weekly podcast
last week and we'll tell you why when it
comes to efficiency and obviously in raw
power why it's so important for this
processor to reach the market if you
want specific details as to why this
processor is so great there are specific
technological details that I will not go
through and the links down below aside
from links to the pocket our weekly
podcast make sure you follow us there
now last week was full of rumors of a
cheaper iPhone that I did not believe
but it seems that these rumors keep
coming up strong apparently this device
will be made of polycarbonate they'll be
manufactured in the United States so I
don't really know how that device is
actually going to be cheaper but
apparently even though Apple internally
is kind of dismissing it according to
some sources apparently this device will
make it to the market and with new
leadership you expect enough to have a
smaller iPad and you already have it so
who knows cheaper iPhone it is and
finally for the amazing news of
they we have now reached 200,000
subscribers in our YouTube channel that
is amazing thank you guys so much for
watching our videos thank you guys so
much for subscribing I mean it really
means a lot to us for all the effort
that we put into this me just think
about it we started the YouTube channel
in 2007 my video was the second video to
the uploaded of SPD Pocket plus four
point oh windows mobile that was a long
time ago and now just think about it we
have changed our focus and videos and
say year and a half ago we had 55
thousand subscribers back then ever
since 2007 and from a year and a half
ago to this date we have now 200,000
subscribers that means you guys liked
what you saw even though well some of
our bloopers may be funny and some of
our bloopers may be crazy we really
appreciate your loyalty again thank you
so much for watching that leads me to
the question of the day which is your
favorite show for pocket now would it be
after the buzz would it be worse gadgets
ever our pocket our weekly podcast you
can even say that the pocket out daily
could probably be one of your favorite
shows in my particular case I do love
after the buzz and I do love our podcast
leave us a comment down below which is
your favorite and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet world make
sure you follow us on talking now calm
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I'm high memory
