choice whether that's a custom launcher
custom icons or a custom theme and for
hardware you can choose big screen small
screen stylus input glass back metal
glass the choice is yours
over the years I've used a lot of
Android phones and sometimes I go back
to an iPhone and there are some things
about iOS that I absolutely love in this
video I'm going to tell you what they
are but first this video is sponsored by
the geniuses at Wix the gesture
navigation on the iPhone feels
half-baked it's not very intuitive and
the animations could be better but there
is one function that is extremely useful
that's the side swipe that lets you move
quickly between apps it reminds me of
using the alt tab keyboard shortcut on a
PC on Android the pixel phones allow you
to do this with a swipe right of the
navigation pill but you can only flip
between two apps you could also use X
J's navigation gestures app to add a
pill and navigation gestures to any
Android but neither solution is as good
as what you get on the iPhone Apple
first came out with the
pressure-sensitive displays on the Apple
watch it was called force touch then and
it was really cool because it reduced
the need for hardware and software
buttons because you could have a new
interaction with the display by pressing
firmly on the screen and it wasn't until
forced touch came to the iPhone as 3d
touch that it really started to make a
difference and help the user experience
if you adjust your usage to do a hard
press on icons and to be able to access
these shortcuts you can benefit from
deep linking within apps so that for
example on Twitter you can immediately
jump into the compose window in the
phone app you can very quickly make a
call by just pressing hard and sliding
your finger up to land on the person you
want to dial it's super fast Android
does have apps shortcuts which can do
pretty much the same thing with a tap
and hold of an icon but if you don't
time it just right you might move the
icon a little bit which causes the app
shortcut to dismiss on iPhone you never
have that problem because the phone
knows your intention when you press
firmly another really good use of this
pressure sensitivity is cursor placement
it's so natural to press firmly on a
keyboard and to be able to reposition
the cursor precisely Android lets you do
this in G board by sliding your finger
on the spacebar but
not very precise another thing I love
about the iPhone and iOS especially the
newer iPhones is that while the screen
refreshes at 60 Hertz like most other
phones the screen can detect touch input
at 120 Hertz which is twice as fast as
most other displays that means it
registers touch input every 8.3
milliseconds instead of sixteen point
six milliseconds
while this difference seems small it
leads to increased sensitivity when
moving through lists or selecting items
on the screen overall it just makes the
phone more smooth than I love it the
last thing I love about the iPhone is
video recording it's just so good and
even with pixels and galaxy notes out
there the iPhone records video better
than any other phone the camera on the
iPhone has super fast and accurate
autofocus really great exposure
compensation to avoid bright spots and
bring out shadow detail and super smooth
stabilization Android phones usually
struggle with things like dynamic range
/ sharpening and stabilization can kind
of be warp II as lighting conditions get
difficult iPhones are so good at this
you'd be shocked to know how many of our
videos have relied on an iPhone as a
secondary camera and trust me we've
tried using other phones the iPhone is
just better before we conclude this
video let me tell you more about our
sponsor Wix if you want to make an
online store blog or other website with
no coding knowledge Wix offers an
amazing portfolio of tools that let you
design something that is right for you
and it's all drag-and-drop or pick from
one of their many templates you can
learn more in the description below so
while I love my Android phones there are
definitely things about iOS that keep me
coming back such as the amazing video
recording the gesture navigation and the
force touch sensitivity on the screen
let us know in the comments if there are
things about iOS and iPhones that you
particularly love especially if you're
an Android user and don't worry we won't
judge be sure to give this video a
thumbs up if you like what you saw and
