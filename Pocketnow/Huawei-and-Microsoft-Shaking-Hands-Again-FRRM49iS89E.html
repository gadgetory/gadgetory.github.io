Microsoft Store at least until they run
out of stock Samsung just trademarked
something called a digital bezel which
could be the future of punch holes and
newly showed the differences in the
Galaxy Note and marian's through
protective film I'm Jaime Rivera and
still a beautiful what the My Luck I
love being here and I love meeting some
of you guys on the street that's been
great this is far going out daily the
official news today begin with deals to
a certain degree I mean yesterday we
reported that the Google pixel 3a was
the most popular unlocked phone on
Amazon the company just sent out emails
to pixel 3a owners me being one of them
end up telling us that we get a $50 code
that we can pretty much share and the
way this works is if we referenced
somebody you get the $50 code and that
is not that you're getting a $50
discount it's just that you're getting
that for the Google Play Store which is
a really good deal on its own for a
phone that's already so inexpensive you
can learn more about all the conditions
in the description now let's talk about
Nintendo as the company has a just
announced another game for iOS and
Android it's not a unique game actually
it's more dr. Mario world which if you
don't know what this is you're too young
I think this was a gameboy game from
back in 1991 and it reminds me more of
Tetris where you had to get colors and
match them and that would make them
disappear pretty much like a Tetris when
you match shapes to what's available I
can't say that I love the game but it's
great to see that Nintendo continues to
invest in iOS and Android
obviously we'll keep you posted if it's
worth it puzzle games are always great
on your phone now let's move the
spotlight over to iPhones in 2020 as
Mexico continues to provide more insight
as to what we should be expecting from
all the premium line up according to
quote the regular iPhone 11s will have a
5 point 4 inch display while the iPhone
11s max will have a 6 point 7 inch
display and then the iPhone 11 our
successor will have a 6.1 inch display
all of them bringing all EDS they will
all be 5g capable and all these changes
come at a time when a lot of people are
asking themselves when are we getting a
successor to the iPhone as
so it is a breath of fresh air for
people that are looking for a phone
that's smaller obviously we're still
more than a year away now let's talk
about the Samsung Galaxy Note throw and
the Galaxy Note as we've got some more
leaks from ice universe as to what to
expect from the display definitely the
fact that the bezels look almost
insignificant that we've already seen
before this time with protectors and
well it seems that the curves are rather
interesting but for those of you
wondering that's six point three inch
variants is actually gonna be smaller
than the Galaxy S ten plus and then the
other one is gonna be six point seven
five inches I am really looking forward
to both these phones I can't wait to
hear what the difference is is the what
the difference is between the pro and
the regular cuz I'm more inclined to
want the regular but that's just me let
us know in the comments what do you
think and since we're talking about
samsung we've got a very interesting
patent of the company just trademarked
for a name the digital bezel and we are
all scratching our heads over exactly
what Samsung is planning with this name
there are currently two theories as to
what this is the first one according to
the galaxy note tender the jeweled bezel
would determine which areas of the
screen are being squeezed and trigger
but that has been debunked by certain
sources now we hear that this would cut
off the portion of the screen with the
punch coal to create an artificial bezel
for content to be uninterrupted I hear
that LG and other manufacturers are also
using this technology not that I could
have a reference to give you but it
could also be a patent we will see
exactly what the whole concept will be
as oh we have his name again what I just
told you is all speculation and finally
the hottest news do they have to do with
Huawei and laptops one more time and
we've discussed this in the Parana
weekly repeatedly some of us really
depend on Huawei laptops they have
really raised the bar and the quality of
the products and everything you're
getting in specifications for the price
and as it turns out these have now
returned to the Microsoft Store they
disappeared magically a month ago no
explanations
we obviously assume that it has to do
with the ban now according to Microsoft
in a statement they are back and they
will sell supplies that are existing
right now
because these all comply with the US
regulations etc now when being asked if
they would restock more huawei computers
in the Microsoft Store they provided the
same answer which doesn't really confirm
if we're gonna get more computers or not
so if you're in the market for a laptop
I still do recommend these and I don't
think you'd have to worry because they
run Windows it's not the same concept of
as Android you're paying for a license
for this operating system it's
completely different ballgame but
obviously in today's question let me ask
you I mean let's just say that you had
the option to buy one of these laptops
would you or do you feel that the Huawei
brand has been tarnished with everything
that's happened and it makes you wonder
if you would spend so much money on a
laptop if you're not sure of its future
because in my case I believe and in my
understanding given the end user License
Agreement with Windows I don't think you
should be worried but that's just me
