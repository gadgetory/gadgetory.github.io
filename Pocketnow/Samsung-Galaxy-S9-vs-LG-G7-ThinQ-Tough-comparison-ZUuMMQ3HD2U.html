as the smarter phone this is the Galaxy
S nine what Samsung calls as the camera
reimagined I can't deny how much of a
heart comparison this is by specs and
dimensions alone the g7 would be most
fit to be compared against the Galaxy S
nine but because of its two cameras and
there being no g7 plus it also fits a
middle ground to be compared against the
galaxy as nine plus I guess the best
solution here is to compare the g7
against a little of each I'm he might
leave it out with pocket now and this is
LG G 7 vs samsung galaxy s3
if this were a beauty contest I'd have a
really hard time declaring the winner
both devices are made of beautiful glass
and aluminum with the s9 being curvier
in its design the g7 is actually five
millimeters taller three millimeters
wider and less than a millimeter thicker
but the galaxy turns out to be one gram
heavier overall both phones are smudge
magnets no matter how hard you try to
keep them clean with the coral blue
Galaxy S nine doing a better job at
hiding it still I will admit I do love
the tentative blue of the Aurora black
on this g7 as you see it from an angle
internally their specs are nearly the
same we have a brand-new kwaka
snapdragon 845 on each four gigs of ram
64 gigs of storage expandable ip68 water
and dust resistance a 3000 milliamp hour
battery and about the only difference is
that Samsung is the only one that we
know of that supports faster wireless
charging while the g7 is one of the few
that supports milspec a 10 G out of the
box for drop resistance in the battle
between displays the Galaxy has nine
wins but by a very short margin at five
point eight inches diagonal I admire
Samson for not adopting the knotch and
for providing one of the most beautiful
displays of 2018 thing is if you haven't
seen the 6.1 inch LCD on the g7 I
suggest you do the deal RGB W pixel
configuration makes this display crazy
vibrant and beautiful really where the
s9 wins is that this whole tall display
approach makes sense more on OLED
technology the black bar is around
sixteen by nine video aren't really
visible on the galaxy s 9 the g7 does an
amazing job at offering very deep blacks
but sadly not black enough
constant consumption is an interesting
comparison where LG wins the galaxy s 9
has dual stereo speakers a headphone
jack tuned by AKG and even brings some
great headphones in the box
the g7 doesn't bring dual firing
speakers but the boombox speaker is not
just loud see it uses the body of the
phone to create a resonance chamber so
if you place it on a table it is
significantly louder
I mean miles louder to tell them apart
at least for the couple of hours that we
had to test them even if you block the
single firing speaker the remaining
audio generated by the body sounds
better than if you cover the s9s bottom
speaker it is also one of the few phones
with a quad tach on the headphone jack
the only problem is you will need a good
pair of headphones to power that and
they weren't supplied in the box at
least from a hardware perspective I
seriously have to call this one a tie
now in the software Department if I
could flaunt both phones I would I mean
seriously it's not that I have a problem
with their proprietary services but I do
with their sluggish adoption of software
updates both devices launched with
Android 8 at a time when version 8.1 is
already in the market for even Huawei
phones but ok
I find the galaxy visual aesthetic more
pleasing with a denser grid of icons and
more useful features with things like
edge shortcuts the things I like about
the g7 are little things like being able
to add more navigation buttons at the
bottom
and speaking of buttons I praised LG for
bringing an AI button that doesn't
reinvent the wheel it launches the
Google assistant in that sit and sure
I've praised Bixby it is a really good
assistant
but the Google assistant is still a more
complete offering and I praised LG for
embracing it the topic of the notch is
interesting because I wouldn't mind that
of LG did a good job with the
implementation as it stands third-party
apps like Spotify leave a huge gap at
the bottom of the app
and this is even if you hide the notch
with a secondary screen which are things
you just don't deal with on the galaxy
I've been using the smaller galaxy as an
ion for about a few weeks prior to the
g7 both on the t-mobile network phone
calls are loud and crisp on each device
and using the speaker on calls is just
as reliable now even with the four gigs
of RAM on each and very little ram to
spare I can't really say that I complain
about how either phone performs their
launchers are fluid and you can play
graphics intensive games just fine on
either phone in the battery life
Department here's the thing I mean the
galaxy s 9 is no slouch but the g7 wins
this one I did a small little experiment
where I left both phones untouched on
the table but they're always on displays
active both with some apps and services
running on the background and the g7
remained at 100% for about an hour while
the galaxy s 9 was already scratching 95
percent yeah that's a big difference now
let's be honest the most important topic
of all of these comparisons is the
cameras and this is where I'll bring the
Galaxy S 9 plus for the comparison spec
wise the s 9 plus has less megapixels on
the primary sensor but larger microns
and variable aperture though the g7 dis
cutted very close on the aperture fight
the results made picking only one of
these devices very tough and here's why
for color accuracy in detail my pick
would be the galaxy s 9 or s 9 plus some
even complain about Samsung being
oversaturated but LG takes the take in
that department I'm not saying that
photos are bad on the g7 on the contrary
but it'll be harder to filter LG photos
on Instagram without having color
clipping because of the over saturation
and sure LG brings a ton of AI options
and I love that this is a toggle you can
either switch on or off but I would say
that the galaxy's camera adapts better
to most situations
now as for the secondary lens this is
where LG wins in a city like New York
the wide-angle camera is far more useful
it allows you to capture more of the
city in one shot without having to move
back and forth I will admit that I
rarely use samsung's telephoto and I
find LG's portrait shots to be more
accurate in the calculation of
background blur and s4 video this is an
easy win for Samsung sure you can
capture more with the wide angle on the
g7 but the Galaxy can record 4k at 60
frames per second and also brings super
slo-mo video things that the g7 can't
really do overall declaring a winner in
this comparison is tough I'm a huge fan
of things like the wide-angle camera on
the g7 aquatic the boombox speaker I'd
even say that I love the display even if
it's LCD and has a notch and I also do
have to praise the better battery life
on the g7 thing is if I had to pick only
one phone as my final option ooh I would
go for the galaxy s 9 C it feels like a
more refined product and I think that's
the result of four generations of
iteration and improvement the g7 by
contrast even if a refinement from
previous generations feels like more of
an experiment I mean for all the talk of
AI I can't really say that I saw
anything that truly expresses it still
both of these devices are great phones
and I'd recommend either one is a good
buy let us know in the comments which
one would you pick overall folks just
like this we've gotten more comparisons
