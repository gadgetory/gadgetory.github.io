pocketnow.com we are testing the noise
cancellation on the motorola droid x
this is I think the third phone up to
support noise cancellation with multiple
microphones the first of the google
nexus one then the iphone 4 came along
and now the droid x so i'm going to
present a couple different scenarios
where there's a really noisy thing
happening in the background and you can
tell how well the droid x doesn't
canceling the noise so i'm going right
now in a quiet room and i'm going to
walk in front of an air conditioning
unit and right now i'm in front of an
air conditioning unit it's relatively
loud kind of like a low humming sound
curious to hear how well the droid x is
doing at reducing the noise from this
air conditioning okay so i'm going to
walk away now and i am going to stand in
front of a fan to kind of represent
being outdoors on a very windy day which
is always difficult for a phone
difficult for the other party to hear
you you're probably going to lose me for
a second and then I should come back in
so here we go okay right now my in the
Bronco been pretty loud although that
was in front of a fan extremely noisy
conditions not sure if you heard me at
all and now what I'm going to do is
blast really loud music kind of
represent being at a concert for Pat's
being at a bar or something to that
effect so there it goes I'm turning up
the music and really loud and right now
the music is very very loud and you
shouldn't be able to hear me because I
can't even hear myself talk right now
but hopefully the noise cancellation on
the droid incredible or droid x i should
say he's doing its job and then the
music is off so curious to see what you
think about the droid x noise
cancellation leave a comment below and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
