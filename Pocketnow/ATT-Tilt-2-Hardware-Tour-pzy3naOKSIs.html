pocket now calm and this is a look at
the hardware on the AT&amp;amp;T tilt to the
successor to the very much popular AT&amp;amp;T
tilt so let's take a look at the
hardware on this device starting at the
top and let's zoom in a little bit up
here we have the speaker grill and to
the left of that is the LED LED
indicator light which is very convenient
because you have the phone across the
room and you want to know if you have a
new message you just glanced at your
phone and see if you have a blinking
light to the right of that is the light
sensor what you can't see up here is a
proximity sensor so if you're on the
phone with someone and you put it up to
your face the screen will shut off to
conserve battery life very handy indeed
and it works quite well surrounding the
entire device is this chrome strip which
looks quite nice and it feels and looks
high quality the screen is 3.6 inches
diagonal and that is quite a bit larger
than the HTC fuze or the 18 tito which
only had 2.4 inch displays the
resolutions 800 down and 480 across
that's the greatest that Windows Mobile
can support going down we have the zoom
slider which will work when you're
browsing the internet are looking at a
photo you can rub your finger to the
right to zoom in and to the left to zoom
out below that our buttons Skol start
call end the Windows Start key to open
up the start menu and the back ok button
let's take a look outside on the side we
have the volume rocker although what's
new over here is to push to talk button
I still don't know anyone that's using
push-to-talk on AT&amp;amp;T but actually it's
good that they put the button here
because this is programmable so you can
have this quickly launch messaging or a
widget or any program that you use on a
regular basis you've got a built-in
button here to launch it which is a
really great addition so I'm quite glad
they put it in on the bottom what we see
down here is no 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack this version unfortunately doesn't
have that capability and what you have
to use is the converter jack that comes
with all the devices and the only way to
get 3.5 millimeter audios to use this
kind of cumbersome can murder Jack that
comes with a device so you plug it into
the bottom
and then you get conversions for 3.5
millimeter 2.5 millimeter and a USB
passthrough so you can still charge your
device while you listen to audio so a
little bit of an annoyance going on the
other side of the device we have nothing
except the secondary microphone this
device has two microphones for use with
the Straight Talk speakerphone which
actually brings a noise cancellation and
sort of almost conference room grade
speakerphone to your mobile device not
quite as good but it is very high
quality and on the top we have the
standby button and also turns on and off
the device over on the back we have a
nice brushed metal gray dark gray strip
here surrounded by a gray metallic
background with a nice texture in the
center very beautiful backing we also
have the 3.5 mm megapixel camera with
the mute button so that when you turn
the phone on its face for a speakerphone
and you want to mute the call to talk
you can press the mute button it will
turn red and then you press it again it
will turn green let's take a look at the
keyboard if you remember when we first
heard about the tilt two on et MTU it
was called the HTC fortress and then
actually had a weird split keyboard
design there was a number pad off to the
right and the standard qwerty pad on the
left is a great thing that they didn't
go with that because that would have
been super awkward to have to position
your fingers on the kind of left side of
the device to type and probably not many
people would have used the number pad
although it would have been an
interesting design nonetheless so the
keyboard is fantastic all the keys are
offset and if you look closely in terms
of design it's got a nice brushed metal
background to it it's hard to see it's
actually the same brushed metal design
that you get on the back here in terms
of the key layout we have the buttons
for the numbers kind of dispersed within
the numbers so in order to dial a number
you have to press the function button
and go over here you get a dedicated row
of characters at the top which can be
quite handy you know the at sign
underscore ! parentheses and so on and
so forth so depending on your usage you
may find it more convenient to have the
sort of characters up here then to have
the numbers up here and of course we
have this awesome tilting screen which
doesn't tilt as much as the last
generation till we're gonna actually do
a comparison in a moment and the tilting
screen is great for watching move
movies for changing the viewing angle
when your text messaging getting just
the right you know viewing angle and
it's also great for gps navigation
putting the device up on your dashboard
while you're navigating around so let's
take a look at this device in comparison
to the european version and you know i
bet you're not going to be able to tell
the difference they're very very similar
they're very very similar except of
course that the ett version has the ATT
branding right there that's a big
giveaway same size screen same buttons
down here they're not different in any
way what is different is that the
european version is the front facing
video camera and also if we turn them
over to the back we see some other
differences the european version is
silver with silver brushed metal and the
AT&amp;amp;T version is the darker color with a
darker brush metal I think it looks a
lot nicer actually having the darker
color it looks more sleek in my opinion
also you get some different writing here
it says 3.2 megapixel camera right here
whereas over here it doesn't quite say
that and it also says touch pro2 and it
doesn't say it there and it's a straight
talk although they make no mention of
straight talk on the AT&amp;amp;T tilt two let's
look at the keyboards briefly these
devices do have different keyboard
designs and also you'll notice that the
tilt two has the kind of black
background while the touch pro 2 has the
silver background and the really main
difference here is that the numbers are
at the top whereas the characters are at
the top and some other button placement
is different such as the function key
and where the control key is and things
like that so overall very very similar
devices indeed compared to the old tilt
the tilt two actually doesn't tilt back
as much in terms of the screen angle so
we can get to about 45 degrees here
maybe a little bit less maybe closer to
40 or so whereas with the original tilts
and you have to remember that this
device has been used a lot so this hinge
is worn in it could go almost 90 degrees
I'd say that's probably about 80 degrees
which really isn't necessary but perhaps
if you are looking at the device from
very far away in the room
you may want to have that ability to
turn it up and make it sort of
perpendicular to the ground so you have
a better viewing angle the reason that
the tilt two can't tell back as much as
quite simply because of the way that
this edge is designed it can't quite go
past a certain level and also you know
they've made the cable short to kind of
resist the movement of the screen also
notice you get this AT&amp;amp;T branding so
that when you're typing out a text
message you've got the screen so that
everyone knows that you're running with
an 80 device and finally let's take off
the back battery cover to see what's
behind here it's a quick action to
remove the back battery cover just move
it up a little bit back here we have the
1,500 milliamp hour battery which
provides fantastic battery life in our
tests you can go about two days under
moderate usage which is quite unusual
for a smartphone we can see the two
speakers back here for the speakerphone
has a very loud speakerphone and we also
get to see the microSD slot which
unfortunately is behind the battery
cover if you remember on the tilts the
original tilt you had it in this kind of
nice little external slot that could be
easily accessible without taking off the
back battery cover also back here is the
stylus which is not magnetic but it does
take this device out of standby has a
little switch inside so if you pull out
the stylus the device comes on saves you
a step so over all the hardware on the
AT&amp;amp;T tilt two is quite fantastic the
build quality is amazing it looks
stunning it feels slim in the pocket
even though it has a full slide out
keyboard the tilting screen is great the
large 3.6 inch screen looks massive in
comparison to the 2.4 inch screen found
on the tilt and the HTC fuze so if
you're upgrading it will be like a world
of difference and you'll probably be
pretty happy with it so that's it for
the tilt to be sure to follow us on
