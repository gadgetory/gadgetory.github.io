the Nokia Lumia 928 gets leaked in
photos and Google might actually buy
whatsapp I'm hi Marietta and I know I
know I hate mondays too but this is
 out daily that's right Facebook
home could not keep their launch for
April twelfth under wraps as modaco
figured out how to pull the apk and then
distribute it on its website we actually
even gave it a try em bottom line it is
quite beautiful not sure if it's useful
but it is quite beautiful so far we'll
keep you posted on that we wanted to
give you a full video coverage on how it
is but sadly it's now being blocked by
the server so we'll keep you posted
April 12 is coming soon now let's talk
about the Nokia Lumia 928 for verizon
that was recently leaking photos in both
black and white and yes if I'm giving
you colors that's because this is not
the Lumia catwalk that's been rumored to
be made out of metal this is actually a
black and a white polycarbonate phone
that keeps the specs of the Lumia 920
looks a lot like the Lumia 720 but it
does include a xenon flash which is
actually awesome so we'll keep you
posted with this phone reaches the
market sadly we still don't have any
specifics your dates now let's talk
about Samsung and they're rumored S or
camera software if you were wondering
what was that leak recently well it's
just a new way to take a 360 panoramic
photo which you can actually already do
with some applications for free you can
actually even do it on Android 4.2
point2 because it is included out of the
box so it makes us wonder what Sam
synced planning to improve with this new
service or why would they want to invent
the wheel here of Android already does
it in four point two point two but still
we'll keep you posted because apparently
this will come out on the Galaxy Note 3
as an exclusive feature the question is
why now let's move over to Google as
some recent leaked photo show is the new
google play store which is version 4.0
and which brings a new immersive and
simplistic you I to their Google Play
Store hopefully that's something we can
also see in the next version of android
if it can get any more simplistic than
it already is but the hot news here is
that we've got some leaked photos of
Babel or a bottle or
bhavin as we say in Spanish and the
point being is that apparently this is
the code name for their new messaging
service which is unified to supersede
google talk which was kind of overdue
for change and i really wonder where
they came up with the name whatever
Babel above it whatever you want to call
it I call it google talk if they could
but still it did require revamp we'll
keep you posted Google i/o is happening
in May and most probably this is one
will see these changes and finally for
the terrifying news of the day we've got
recent rumors that Google might be
acquiring the whatsapp messaging service
and for those of you that don't know
what it is well you most probably don't
own a smartphone but I'd call this one
of the best if not the best
cross-platform messaging service that
allows you to connect with pretty much
everybody Windows Phone iOS blackberry
even the old blackberries an Android and
even some other smartphones out there
which is actually awesome but well
Facebook wanted to buy the service in
December and then Ghul is now apparently
trying to buy the service but apparently
whatsapp wants a billion bucks i do
understand them i mean it's a very
successful service and well that leads
me to the question of the day which is
your favorite messaging service right
now which is the one that you most use
in my particular case i'd say what's
happened i'm just worried about the fact
that Google might buy it since I can't
imagine what's up with ads all over it
we're actually have to pay for the
application which just doesn't make any
sense but leave us a comment down below
which is your favorite service and of
course if you want an earlier school
with everything that's happening in the
smartphone in sap a little mushy follow
us on pocketnow.com it subscribe to our
youtube channel as well please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am happy that I thank you very
much for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
