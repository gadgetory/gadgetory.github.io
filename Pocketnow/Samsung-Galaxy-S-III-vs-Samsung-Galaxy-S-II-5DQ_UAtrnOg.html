now we had the samsung galaxy s2 and we
had the samsung galaxy s3
now the samsung galaxy s2 here was
launched in 2011 so many of you might
still be on a contract and wondering
whether it's worth upgrading to the
three from the two or maybe you're just
asking yourself whether Samsung did a
great job
with the s3 whether it was worth the
anticipation and the buzz in our today's
video we're gonna compare them
side-by-side make some performance test
comparisons benchmarks gaming internet
browsing and hopefully we'll manage to
answer that question so it's Anton
it's pocketnow.com don't go anywhere
it's faceoff time so we have the samsung
galaxy s2 on the left and the samsung
galaxy s3 on the right and we're gonna
start this one off with a simple boot up
test let's see which one boots up faster
so we're gonna try to start them at the
same time three two one go and the
Samsung Galaxy s3 has already displayed
the Samsung animation the s2 is catching
up it should only take 15 to 20 seconds
and still going and the s3 is first the
s2 is not far behind let's see if we
have a usable home screen almost so it's
fair to say that the Samsung Galaxy s3
wins by 2 or 3 seconds in the boot up
test now before we proceed we need to
mention that both devices have been
reset to their factory defaults and then
installation is mirrored on both so
whatever you see on the s2 is on the s3
both email accounts wise application
wise and they are both connected to the
same five gigahertz and router in this
room which is three or four feet away
now let's talk specification the Samsung
Galaxy s2 here was launched in 2000 and
and it's running at the moment Android
4.0 ICS but not out of the box but as
the official update way it's powered by
a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core Samsung Exynos
processor it has 1 gigabyte of RAM 16
gigs of storage and it has a wvg 480 by
800 resolution 4.3 inch Super AMOLED
plus display the camera at the back is 8
megapixels and the front-facing webcam
is 2 megapixels on Android there's
TouchWiz 4.0 on the Samsung Galaxy S 2
the Samsung Galaxy s3 has been launched
last month and it's powered by a one
point 4 gigahertz quad core Exynos
processor made by Samsung but this one
is running Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich out of the box with TouchWiz
5.0 the RAM and the storage is the same
one gigabyte and 16 gigabytes but the
display is an HD display of 720 by 1280
resolution on a 4.8 inch HD Super AMOLED
screen the camera is 8 megapixels just
like on the s2 but the front-facing
webcam is one of 1.9 megapixels so that
specifications let's see how they
compare in real life usage so just to be
on the fair side here's the task manager
on the s2 and the one on the s3 there
are no applications running in the
background so the memory is clear let's
get to the home screen and probably the
first thing you want to do after you
unbox your phone is set it up so let's
see how Google Play Store is launching a
little bit faster on the s3 a little bit
slower on the s2 let's check email a
little bit faster again on the s3 but
it's it's very thin let's see messaging
again as you can see the s3 is faster by
a hairline let's go to maps
let's go to our location there we go
let's see the camera pretty much the
same let's see a third-party application
like Spotify pretty much the same let's
launch the internet browser pretty much
the same again
now we're gonna input some URLs into
both and get back to you once we're
ready to start the test okay so we're
gonna go to pocketnow.com and try to see
which one goes there faster
surprisingly the yellow cs2 looks to be
a little bit ahead and they both seem to
have finished no not just yet yes they
finished at the same time so it's
difficult to tell which one is faster
let's go to scrolling scrolling is okay
on the s3 let's see scrolling on the s2
a little bit of white space until it
fills up the buffer but then everything
should be fine let's double tap to zoom
in double tap to zoom in pinch to zoom
zoom out completely and let's try to do
this at the same time the galaxy s2
takes a little bit more time in
rendering that zoomed in text but then
again the difference is very very thin
between the two let's go into an article
and see exactly again which one goes
faster let's go to the unboxing article
zoom in a little bit more and tap in
stop there and three two one go the s3
is on its way to its first win in the
browser test
and definitely the s3 won this round but
the s2 wasn't that far behind we're
going to go to another website so we're
gonna pause the video and put the
address and get back to you Engadget
comm is another image heavy web site
it's complex so let's try to see that
one and three two one go
and we have the mobile website they
finished both at the same time let's
scroll to the bottom and go to the
desktop version I'll try to hit this one
at the same time three two one go
there we go side by side and it's really
hard to tell the difference the s2 is
quite right there so there was a
difference of maybe up to one second on
such a complex website like the
engadget.com
and as you can see on the s3 it's fully
loaded let's take a look on the s2 you
see a little bit of white space but it's
nothing out of the ordinary until it
buffers in the content of the page so
let's get back to the home screen and
see some benchmarks first benchmark
we're going to run is quadrant so let's
see that one we hit ok and we're gonna
start the benchmark cut out from the
video and then get back to you once we
have the final results so we're back the
test is about to finish the Samsung
Galaxy s3 is a little bit ahead a couple
of seconds let's see what the results
will be
yes let's proceed and it's 55 65 so
that's 5565 points for the Samsung
Galaxy s3 as you can see it's better
than the HTC One X and let's see the
Galaxy s2 the Galaxy s2 is 4030 so it's
approximately 1500 the
friends in points let's get back and now
let's go to you and to to if I'm
pronouncing that right let's try to
launch it there we go close this one and
we're gonna start the test again and cut
back to you
once the test is finished there we go
and it's finished on the Samsung Galaxy
s3 the s2 should catch up just a couple
of seconds after that as you can see
1,200 o 41 points for the galaxy s3 and
the galaxy s2 is still testing but it
should finish in a couple of seconds and
there it goes six thousand and sixty
points so it's half of the score the
galaxy s3 managed to achieve and the
biggest difference is in CPU 2950 2965
compared to 7151 GPU is around the same
I'm not sure the readings are right
because this is a fairly new processor
and the application might have not been
updated gram is faster on the s3 and i/o
operation is also faster now for the
last test benchmark let's go to smart
bench 2012 and launch it at the same
time
and we're gonna run smart bench right
now and the s3 has finished let's see
the scores I will need to zoom in on
this there we go
it's 3990 with 16 15 as you can see
right here and the s2 finished - and
this one 2605 1893 let's see both of
them close up come on focus that's right
those are your scores so this was the
benchmark test let's go and see some
gaming now for gaming we have selected
GTA 3 so let's try to run that at the
same time on both of them there they go
these are actually intro videos ok let's
try to skip both of these videos at the
same time and this time the s2 was a
little bit faster let's tap to continue
tap again to continue and again and
let's try to start the game at the same
time of course it's gonna be a new game
the s3 looks faster but they're the same
really the same it's a difference very
small difference
now let's see the let's turn the volume
down on this one and let's see how the
s2 is doing skip the video you have to
excuse me for bad playing because
another gamer they're saying but let's
see if I managed to get into this car
and drive it around a little bit not
backwards but forwards
I can assure you that my real-life
driving skills are better you'll have to
take my word for that it's looking to be
fluid so there's no hiccups right here
everything is buttery smooth as you
would expect from even a dual core from
like the Samsung Galaxy s2 okay a little
bit of off-road driving and them I just
crashed the car okay so this was the s2
let's take a look at the s3 let's get
this video right here and let's try to
do the same hopefully with better
driving skills let's turn the volume
back on okay let's get inside the car
so it's fluid also we can't really see
the friends but there's nothing really
to talk about right here they are
performing well both of them what we
might try to see it is let's try to get
back into a new game and see if we can
find some differences in textures new
game yes and yes and they're loading
let's keep the video here skip the video
here let's try to zoom in a little bit
more on the screens and we're interested
in textures I'll try to bring this one
up for a better contrast but textures
are looking smooth right here if you see
the shoulder of the guy and the car and
let's see the textures and if there's
anything to anti Elias
but textures are looking the same so
gameplay wise at least on this game
they are both performing at the same
level so there's no clear winner here
let's get back to the home screen and
let's see what else we can do to compare
these two devices video streaming and
especially from YouTube because you'll
be probably doing lots of YouTube video
viewing on your phone let's see which
one of these performs better we're not
interested in load times we're
interested in the amount of time it
takes these two devices to
buffer and play a video let's go into
landscape because this way they will go
into full-screen mode once the video is
buffered and we'll try to take a look at
the same video at the same time so in
three two one go yes that's me and so
much of me might hurt as you could see
they are performing head to head with no
clear winner at all one more thing we
can do is to test out the speeds on
these devices but we are using a Wi-Fi
router which is a five gigahertz and
router and we're gonna launch the test
not at the same time because we don't
want to take the bandwidth from the
other phone so let's go with ds2 first
this should only take a couple of
seconds 36 634 and you'll see those
there and yes three it's faster so
probably the networking Wi-Fi networking
solution used in the s3 is somewhat
better than the one on the s2 does this
count probably not but since we are all
geeks we want to see the differences so
this was a short look at the Samsung
Galaxy s2 versus the samsung galaxy s3
is the s3 a better phone yes does it
smoke the s2 well in terms of raw
horsepower and on paper yes
in terms of day to day use it no so if
you're using your phone to send emails
catch up with your friends and social
networks listen to some songs over
Spotify or Pandora watch youtube videos
or have occasional games played on your
phone then you should be very well fine
with the Samsung Galaxy s2 the Samsung
Galaxy s3 really shines in those games
which take advantage of the HD screen so
this is 720 by 1280 and probably that's
where the new SOC as in CPU plus GPU
kick in if you liked this video please
give us a thumbs up this was on time
front pocket now and stay glued to
pocketnow.com we will have more
regarding the Samsung Galaxy s3 thank
you very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
