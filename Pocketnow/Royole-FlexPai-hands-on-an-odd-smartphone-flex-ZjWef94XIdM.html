actual flexible display smartphone this
is PocketNow and I'm Joshua Vergara
what's going on everybody and let's take
a look at a device that you may or may
not want to use on the daily because
this version of a foldable display is in
the Royal flex pay okay so this
particular device isn't necessarily new
but at CES 2019 it still made a bit of a
splash now this is a foldable smartphone
tablet hybrid and the flex PI uses a non
glass display in order to achieve that
everything about this phone is made of
plastic and this particular plastic
allows for it to project the screen that
has a lot of different elements the 7.8
inch display can fold onto itself and
transform from a tablet into a phone but
once you fold it down it looks a little
bit odd doesn't it now take this form
factor for what you will there are a lot
of possibilities for this I personally
think that it works best as a tablet
because it's really thin and I think
that a lot more tablets should have this
kind of thin profile that camera you can
see already is in the corner and when
you fold the device onto itself
it allows for that to either be the rear
camera or if you turn it around then the
screen of the camera app will actually
appear on the same side as the camera
making into a selfie mode you can put
the device down in a tent mode if you
have it open just a little bit or even
lie on itself that way you can have a
better viewing angle for one portion of
the display and even if Android doesn't
fully support this kind of foldable
display with all of the different quarks
that it might have things were rendering
fairly well a lot of applications were
rotating properly even if some of them
were still trying to go into the
portrait mode when we clearly had it in
landscape and that one portion at the
top if you have it in tent mode is going
to be the notification area it'll come
up like a bar even though I don't have
any examples to show you here on camera
Royal claim that their flex pay screen
is virtually unbreakable after all it is
not glass and it is extremely durable
and when you have the device folded onto
itself there are some pretty strong
magnets on the back the gentleman that
was helping me with my demo told me that
one of the few people who actually use
this phone on the daily out in China
because they have seeded these out to
only their most VIP customers that
person is actually using this as a
smart display of sorts on the
refrigerator because the magnets make it
stick onto the refrigerator door that's
pretty interesting royal will outfit the
Flex pie with the Snapdragon 855
platform high specifications and you can
expect that this phone might be a really
fun one to use when it comes to gaming
especially in that tablet format and on
top of that I just want to pass off a
question to you if this was the future
of flexible displays that you had a
tablet that then folded onto itself not
even in a perfect crease but instead was
a flexible let's say asymmetrical piece
of technology that sat in your pocket in
a kind of weird way which is what I
imagine this would be like would that be
a device that you want to have on the
daily let us know what you think of the
Royal flex PI and let us know what you
think in the comments down below let's
have that conversation about this
particular device that's really unique
one that came out of CES 2019 definitely
one of the more unique devices that
we've got a look at near the tail end of
the show and so we have this one of our
final pieces of CES 2019 coverage thank
you so much for watching everything and
also make sure you subscribe to pocket
now because there's so much coming down
the pipeline we're really excited for
everything that's to come in 2019 and
you can let us know what you're excited
about as well get into the comment
sections down below subscribe to pocket
now drop us some likes and we will see
you in our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
