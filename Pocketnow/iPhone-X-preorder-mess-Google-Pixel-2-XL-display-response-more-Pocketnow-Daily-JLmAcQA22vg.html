that a crazy mess in the morning google
downplays the issues that are currently
plaguing the pixel to excel or get a
possible date of when to expect the 1 +
5 t i'm hi I'm Ella Rivera and if I look
like crap that's because I feel like
crap we have 3 a.m. for phone is it's
crazy Apple this is PocketNow azalea the
official news today begin with deals
Boost Mobile is famous for its recent
four line $400 deal but the company is
actually making that even more
compelling as of now you can get five
lines for hundred bucks and you can even
add some Android phones to the list
which is crazy you can learn more in the
description now it's not about the 1 + 5
t a lot of people are asking themselves
exactly if this phone is going to happen
and when and well yesterday we saw the
opal our 11s leaks and announcements re
and that pretty much confirms a design
now it's date which apparently will
happen on November 16 stay tuned we will
let you know about Google and Android
8.1 for those of you wondering exactly
what changes are we getting we hope that
a lot of it has to do with fixing the
pixel to excel display but we also
notice from the developer builds that
there are enhancements in the battery
indicator for accessories this was the
major thing that Oreo brought the fact
that now you can get that information
just like you can on iOS the problem is
it was not necessarily a great design so
that's apparently going to change in
addition to other things you can learn
more in the description and speaking of
Google and the pixel 2 XL the company
has just chimed in over the issues and
has mentioned two things number one
apparently we're getting more warranty
up to two years though I'm not exactly
sure there are certain conditions or not
I do believe that it's not for every
country you can find the list in the
description but the second thing is that
there will be an extra vivid display
option to be pushed out soon with a
software update how soon I don't know
but I am hoping that it is very soon as
yes that screen looks very dull and
finally the very hot news today have to
do with the iPhone 10 pre-orders look at
my face I'm running on three hours well
four hours of sleep mainly because of
this pre-order I was lucky enough to
find an iPhone 10
for pickup on November 3rd bear in mind
that 3 a.m. when the pre-orders began
there were literally no phones available
to be shipped to arrive on November 3rd
everybody was getting information from
November 17 that was just crazy Apple
didn't even start the launch at you know
12:01 a.m. Pacific it started more like
12:05 and then it just went snowballing
down from there
point is we've got a unit review that's
great well we actually had to order two
units which is an interesting story but
anyways it leads me to the question
today were you able to pre-order your
phone which model that you get in my
case I got both colors but the first one
that I'm getting is apparently the Space
Gray we would love to know in your case
what happened leave us a comment down
