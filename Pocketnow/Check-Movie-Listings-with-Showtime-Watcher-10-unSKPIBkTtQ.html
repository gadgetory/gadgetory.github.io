Paco now calm and in this video we're
looking at a new app called Showtime
watcher so there seems to be a shortage
of reliable movie listings applications
for Windows Mobile which is rather
disappointing because I'd expect them to
be an abundance of these types of apps
we covered a great app called cinema a
while ago but that seems to have been
discontinued and no longer works we also
looked at one called flicks and although
it has a ton of features it feels like
it takes an eternity to update and
download information well thankfully
Showtime watcher is fast and it appears
to get the job done so let's see how it
works after opening the app we're
greeted with this main menu where we can
select the location by tapping here and
if we tap this update button it'll
refresh the list of theaters okay we
have 11 theaters at this location let's
go ahead and click this one and we have
19 movies showing at this particular
theater as you can see you can scroll up
and down the grid like view and we'll go
ahead and select shutter island alright
we have some general movie info here we
have the director the cast members genre
movie length movie poster and the rating
if we click description we get a nice
concise summary of the movie let's go
back and say you already know the movie
you want to see you can click show times
and you get a list of all the movies and
their times at the theater if you want
to check times for tomorrow you can
click that button and the day after that
and so on if you wanted to check the
address you can tap here and you can
also get the theaters number so this was
a look at Showtime watch at one point oh
it's fast easy to use and can come in
handy for anyone who goes to the movies
unfortunately it seems to only support
the United States Ukraine and Russia at
the moment
this is the first release available so
we'll likely see some new features and
locations implemented soon Showtime
watcher costs two dollars and
ninety-nine cents but there's a demo so
you can try before you buy i'll post a
link on pacquiao com that's it for now
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
