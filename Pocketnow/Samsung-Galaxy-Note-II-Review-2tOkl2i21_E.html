guided video tour we've put it
head-to-head against its predecessor and
we've even measured its worth compared
to its close cousin the galaxy s3 now
it's time to go big or go home and with
the device this big I don't think that's
gonna be too much of a problem I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow dot-com
and this is our full review of the
samsung galaxy note 2 the galaxy note 2
is actually a lot less like its
predecessor and a lot more like its
cross category sibling the galaxy s3
than you might expect Samsung may have
created the phablet category 1/2 phone
half tablet with the Galaxy Note but it
seems to be honing it into something
more accessible to the mainstream with
the galaxy note 2 where its forerunner
was unapologetic and it's sort of brutal
beastliness the 2012 model is softer
with more curves and a bit more subtlety
in its design it's still mind-bendingly
massive but considering the instant
popularity of the galaxy s3 and the
growing significance of the Galaxy Note
brand overall the public will probably
find this gargantuan offshoot more
intriguing than intimidating or at least
that's what Samsung hopes so how big is
this thing
well as I mentioned in another galaxy
note 2 video earlier this week it is big
but still manageable enough that I think
it's gonna attempt a lot of folks into
trading up to the phablet form factor
let's take a little hardware tour I keep
mentioning the note 2 size because it
doesn't translate well to video even
with other devices nearby for size
comparisons like Google's Nexus 7 and
Motorola's Droid Razr m the device just
doesn't look as big as it feels in my
time with this review unit I've been
stopped constantly in public by people
asking me what it is is that an iPad
Mini what's going on it's definitely a
head turner up front here dead center of
the note 2's elongated body sits a Super
AMOLED capacitive touchscreen under a
layer
Gorilla Glass 2 it measures 5.5 inches
across and packs a pixel density of 267
PPI along with the resolution of 1280 by
720 as we've come to expect from Super
AMOLED blacks are deep and color
saturation is excellent and even
variable through the settings menu on
this international version samsung has
retained its traditional button
arrangement all over the note 2 down
below here is the now standard menu
button right in the center flanked by
capacitive menu and back keys over to
the right where righties rest their
thumbs is the power standby key across
the device over here is the volume
toggle and four physical buttons that's
all you get
above the screen is a 1.9 megapixel
camera rumor has it that's the exact
same module as well as the 8 megapixel
shooter around back as found on the
galaxy s3 take a trip across the
proximity sensors in the earpiece here
there is a hidden notification light
under the casing which we are always
happy to see around back is that 1080p
capable 8 megapixel shooter with LED
flash some Samsung branding and the same
speakerphone location is on the original
note down here in the corner just below
that is the dock for the unit's S Pen
Stylus the silo hosting it quite snugly
and around the edges we're looking at
the usual microphone and USB port along
the bottom and the headphone jack and
noise cancelling microphone up top
finally prying off the back cover and we
can do that because this device has a
removable battery Thank You Samsung
reveals a micro SD card slot capable of
expansion of up to 64 additional gigs
atop the 16 32 or 64 already included
onboard a SIM card slot and a huge 3100
milliamp hour battery invisible under
all that as the device is Exynos 4412
quad quad core processor running at 1.6
gigahertz notable for being one of the
first processors to pack both LTE
support and quad core construction into
the same package holding the device in
the hand is a good experience with the
note 2 is 183 grams give
a solid feel that's augmented by a bezel
that's much less plasticky than on other
devices and the whole thing feels a bit
more robust than say a Galaxy s3 we wish
Samsung would give users an option on
the hyper glaze coating though it sure
would be nice to handle a modern Samsung
device that wasn't also an oil and
fingerprint magnet in the meantime the
hardware of the Galaxy Note 2 bears no
creaks or pops and definitely feels like
it would last the duration of a two-year
contract with little trouble it's a
little ho-hum but it's a fine-looking
device neither ostentatious nor entirely
forgettable we find the marble white
version here especially nice but the
size and scale of the Galaxy Note 2 is
only half the story
the other half of what makes a phablet
is in its software the new note runs the
latest version of TouchWiz nature UX
atop Android 4.1.1 jelly bean that makes
it one of the few Samsung devices
currently available to offer Google's
latest software and it's all here from
enhanced notification support to Google
now support to the UX smoothness of
project butter Samsung hasn't had much
trouble getting smoothness out of its
nature UX but it's good to know the
underpinnings of the note 2's OS are
slathered in the new smoothness
responsiveness is a dream with fun
little animations when opening and
closing folders and slick quick
reactions in the app and notifications
drawers the new TouchWiz also means
Samsung's bevy of widgets and tutorials
are here some useful and some not a lot
of these features like smart stay the
expanded toggle row and brightness
control in the notification shade and
motion-activated inputs are reported
wholesale from the galaxy s3 but there
are also new additions small things like
smart rotation which checks to see your
head orientation before flipping the
screen useful when reading lying down
but also big usability enhancements as
well
the really impressive stuff though is
truly awesome stuff like multi window
and the pop-up browser which leveraged
the added screen size to make this
device truly unique
with multi-window you long press the
back key to call up a list of supported
apps along here on the left hand side
it's not all the apps on the phone but
it's a lot more than we expected this
list serves as a doc if you're just
treating it normally you can launch him
to say the gallery there but long
pressing an app such as the browser
allows you to drag it into one of two
available panes on the display and you
can run two apps fully functional at
once pop-up browser offers similar
time-saving functionality say you're
surfing the feed in your Twitter app and
you want to call up a link well doing so
while collecting while selecting pop-up
browser I have it set as my default
selection because it is so useful will
allow you to continue browsing on
Twitter while the page loads in the
background you can see the focus shift
when we jump between apps here the only
downside is expanding the pop-up window
to full size prompts a reload of the
page
still it's a very handy feature for get
in get out browsing we need to touch on
one other thing the thing that makes a
Galaxy Note a Galaxy Note the s-pen
Samsung was talking at IFA about how it
had redesigned the note twos new s-pen
and that's pretty obvious here the new
one is larger and more substantial it
also includes a new tip to offer a
little more friction in the writing
experience that does make it feel a
little less awkward than writing on the
note ones display did but I don't think
it ever really gets close to that
ballpoint pen on paper experience I
heard talked about on the bright side
though the experience is faster than it
was on the original with the onscreen
responsiveness only trailing behind the
Pens actual position by a small amount
how much that small amount of inaccuracy
bothers you is going to depend on what
you're using the note 2 for casual
sketch artists and infrequent photo
editors will probably just enjoy the
added functionality of a stylus
especially with the huge amount of
useful software Samsung bundles for that
purpose but people who are really
planning to use an
- to replace a moleskin or another
pocket notebook are going to come away
unhappy
that's because though it's good for
sketching and photo editing something
still makes writing legibly extremely
difficult on this display even if you're
doing it very slowly
still the s-pen does change how you
perceive the device from a usability
standpoint when you've got the note 2 in
one hand and a stylus in the other you
feel like you're working your focus is
honed and you're there to get things
done now of course there are stumbling
blocks the back and menu keys are not
pressure-sensitive forcing you to use
clumsy gestures by pressing the button
drawing a back arrow to go back drawing
an up arrow to access the menu they're
time consuming then that's kind of a
good way to sum up the s-pen in general
it's helpful in certain applications and
it definitely expands the utility of
using a smartphone but there's a price
for that added precision and that price
is time still the s-pen was definitely
nice to have and I found myself using it
a little more often than I initially
expected so the Galaxy Note 2 is a
feature-packed smartphone tablet hybrid
but how does all this gadgetry hold up
in real-world use in short quite well we
tested the Galaxy Note 2 in rural and
urban areas of Boston and New York and
it held on to a signal as well as the
Samsung Galaxy s3 in most areas phone
callers reported no problems hearing us
either via speakerphone earpiece or
headphones except in areas of New York
City where 18 T's 3G network led us down
at times there was no active LTE
connection on the unit we tested callers
came through sounding fine though the
feeling of holding a Galaxy Note 2 to
your ear is as absurd as you might
expect battery life isn't quite as
impressive as you might think with that
huge 3100 milliamp hour battery pack
probably because it's powering this
massive 5.5 inch display battery life
isn't bad by any means we managed to eke
out over
days worth of moderate to heavy use but
it's really not that much better than
what we were seeing on our Galaxy s3
during the same period and that's
without LTE turned on you might not need
to keep a charger with you at all times
but you'll want to keep one handy just
in case performance elsewhere throughout
the device as we demoed in some earlier
videos was excellent the Exynos quad
processor seems perfectly capable of
handling the increased load all these
features throw at it and the camera
includes
some handy new features which we
detailed in our head-to-head video
between this device in the galaxy s3
such as no more dedicated burst mode all
you need to do is press and hold the
shutter and also some increased features
over here like best photo best faces
which we talked about at Aoife overall
it's very easy to believe that this is
the same camera module as found on the
galaxy s3 and that is to say it's an
excellent smartphone camera one of the
best on the market right now that is as
true on the galaxy note 2 as it was on
the galaxy s3 the galaxy note 2 does
many things well but to are most
important from a product standpoint it
pushes the Galaxy Note lineup forward
improving on its predecessor and it also
brings it closer to the Galaxy S family
both in terms of style and maybe in
mainstream acceptance it's not going to
replace more traditional smartphones any
time soon but it will definitely make
some users pondering a 4.6 or a 4.8 inch
phone wonder why they shouldn't just
take the leap into phablet territory
based on what we've seen from the galaxy
note 2 if you're one of those people
there's not much here that's gonna
disappoint you about Samsung's newest
phablet we rate the Samsung Galaxy Note
2 a 9 out of 10 that's gonna do it for
