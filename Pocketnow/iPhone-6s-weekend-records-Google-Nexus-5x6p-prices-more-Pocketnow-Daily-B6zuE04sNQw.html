statement on the iphone success sales we
get some solid leaks on all the spec
sheet for the google nexus 6p we also
get news on android 60 and when it goes
official for nexus devices that it is
i'm home it'll be better i'm doing the
best of whatever it is that i can do on
a monday and i know you're struggling as
well this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with fossil
sort of official that is the company has
just come clean on its plant for
wearables or at least smart wearable
since the company's been will building
watches for years and it turns out the
company confirms that they will be
building a fitness tracker because
that's one thing they're interested on
and another thing is obviously a round
premium smart wash it'll run android
where we already talked about this in
the past but we're just not exactly sure
when to get these products and the price
points as well which is another
oscillating factor even though tomorrow
is a supposedly nexus day one of the
biggest questions is when your current
Nexus device can get android 6th auto
marshmallow we had talked about this a
couple of days ago we expected it to
happen close to when these devices are
announced but it turns out it seems that
we will have to wait until October fifth
which is still a good date but hear me
out here they'll reach AOSP so it's not
like if you're really going to get the
over-the-air update immediately stay
tuned as we should learn more in the
next coming days or hopefully tomorrow
and yes we're going to continue talking
about nexus we have the possible spec
sheet for the Nexus 6p from Huawei and
well I'm a premium phone metal enclosure
as we saw the fingerprint scanner as
we've seen but apparently in the
internals we've got a Snapdragon 810
version 2.1 processor this is very
interesting in addition to a quad HD
display in addition to all the bells and
whistles of the Nexus flagship USB
type-c etc etc and let's just see what
the price tag is going to amount to and
we've got more news on that actually
thing yeah let's make a separate segment
for the pricing because apparently we
have the price points for both the Nexus
5x in the Nexus 6p and this is not
necessarily a good thing hear me out
here apparently the Nexus 5x which is
the entry level model will cost three
hundred eighty dollars which makes you
wonder if it's not better to
at yourself a new Moto X but if you're
looking for the huawei Nexus apparently
it'll be starting at five hundred
dollars and then obviously depending on
the storage points that you choose
you'll be able to get whichever model
you want stay tuned tomorrow is
definitely going to be a big day for at
least we hope so and finally for the
very hot news of the day if you thought
that Apple was going to find itself
disappointed with iphone 6s and 6s plus
sales it turns out to be the other way
around the company exceeded expectations
one more time up to the point where they
publish the full statement on it the
company has just announced that it sold
13 million units on the weekend compared
to last year which it's sold 10 million
units that's another record that the
company breaks and they've already
announced other countries that the
smartphone will be expanding to which is
a great news but it does lead me to the
question of the day ever since Apple has
announced its iPhones it's been growing
in pre-orders and sales numbers every
single year do you think that the
company will ever find the plateau you
know do you think that competitors
should launch another product to Pluto
tha's do you think that there's simply
just not enough momentum for this to
continue in my case I believe that's
going to be the case it happens with the
iPad but then again it seems that the
smartphone market is different leave us
