to review and part of that coverage will
involve some pretty tough treatment I'm
Juan Carlos bag now for pocket now and
it's as good a time as any to talk about
rugged phones and to find some of the
terms we use in describing how much
abuse they should be able to take all
mobile devices are a series of
compromises we have to balance size and
portability against power and daily
lifestyle abuse technology is mainstream
so we see a significant focus on design
and aesthetics then sleek attractive may
be utilizing exotic or shiny materials
smartphones are very emotional purchases
for a lot of people and we all can get
caught up in unconsciously favoring
style over some of the more practical
issues facing our mobile gadgets
durability is clawing its way into the
general discussion however as the
technology improvements from year to
year are becoming finer with each phone
release companies are examining other
opportunities to add value most notably
Samsung and Sony both making water
resistance a visible feature of their
flagship offerings so what can consumers
expect from manufacturers touting
lifeproof durability and how are these
claims measured well let's start with
water as that's been a really popular
topic lately to describe water
resistance we mostly refer to the IP
scale you'll see the letters I and P
followed by two numbers the IP stands
for ingress protection and the first
number represents protection against
dust and particles entering the device
while the second number describes water
resistance the highest rating you can
achieve is ip69k but most consumer
manufacturers will stick to IP 68 this
describes a phone which is very well
sealed against dust and particles and
the device which can stay submerged
under more than three feet of water for
longer periods of time for phones
manufacturers often claim a device under
a meter of water should survive for
around 30 minutes
sliding back from IP 68 means less
protection the HTC 10 is rated IP 53
it's fairly well sealed against dust but
is only designed to handle light
splashes of water it's not designed to
survive being completely submerged the
IP scale is an easy way to quickly
define performance but as we all know
situations where your phone ends up
underwater often come from drops and
other accidents a bad fall could result
in a dent or a
crack which will probably compromise the
seals on your phone reducing that water
resistance to measure impact protection
we have to move to a different
classification system for rating
durability most manufacturers now refer
to a milspec rating you'll often see
milspec 810g
or mil-std 810g listed as a feature on
rugged phones this is a military
classification system designed to test
the limits of equipment longevity
now not all milspec 810g devices are
created equal this is a very broad
standard that for military equipment
examines drop-in shock resistance high
and low temperature survivability
whether a device might ignite flammable
gases and about a dozen other metrics
there is no consumer standard or
organization for rating phones so
manufacturers are allowed to take some
liberties with this classification for
example a phone like the LG v10 is rated
as milspec 810g specifically for drop-in
shock resistance but it likely doesn't
carry the protective ceilings against
fungus acid or explosive atmospheric
conditions when trying to predict how a
device might handle specific kinds of
abuse it's critical to examine exactly
how the manufacturer has worded the
protective features a phone might be
ip68 water-resistant but only if used in
freshwater saltwater might still be able
to defeat the protection supplied by the
manufacturer similarly a phone might
have a milspec 810g label on the side of
the box but not be properly protected
against damage from freezing happily
however these protections and safeguards
are migrating into regular consumer
devices not just ultra tough phones for
tough guy dude bros on construction
sites the idea that a mother with small
kids or a frequent business traveler
might buy a rugged phone is an
increasingly more acceptable option and
we're now all expecting a higher degree
of general lifestyle durability in our
non rugged devices and of course we want
to hear from you how do you balance
durability against style do rugged
phones do it for you or do you prefer
shopping a solid case for a regular
fragile phone drop us a comment below to
