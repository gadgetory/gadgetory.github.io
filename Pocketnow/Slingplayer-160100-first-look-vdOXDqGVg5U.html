now and today we're going to take a look
at slingplayer mobile its latest version
the previous version was 1.1 0.97 in on
an samsung i760 there were a few issues
which i will show you so start the
player off and it's we're using a an
evdo network for rising z video network
we're connecting to my slingbox pro
which is connected to an HD DVR from
directv the biggest issues was going to
landscape mode and you can see the
pictures garbled the only workaround at
the time was to touch the bottom corner
and get this bar at the bottom and you
were stuck at the bar to go to full
screen mode if you got rid of the bar
the picture would go bad again coming
back to portrait mode everything worked
quite well so next we're going to take a
look at the updated slingplayer mobile
now I've loaded up the new version which
is one point six point zero one hundred
and let's see how that works press play
it's locating my slingbox pro as i said
before we're using the verizon e video
network connecting and starting playback
so now if we go to a full screen mode or
i should say really landscapes you can
see no issues the quality is quite good
and over easy do this is a really
watchable I've had no issues with it the
input to my slingbox pro is the x
component cables from the CBR and it
just works very well I'm very impressed
with this version and now that's about
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
