you're watching the software tour of a
new t-mobile HTC Radar 4G next up we're
going to take a look at the software and
what kind of programs were bundled with
this HTC Radar 4G for t-mobile as you
know both HTC and t-mobile are able to
add some programs with this before they
sell it so here's this is actually the
default home screen and we see t-mobile
has designed pin t-mobile TV and Slacker
Radio to the start screen and this is a
similar to what you've seen before
pretty much just a rebranded version of
mobi TV so you can scroll and play
certain TV programs you get the idea and
Slacker Radio we've seen before just
streaming music and as we go down we
have more default lifestyles and we're
here we have some more that t-mobile has
added Netflix and TeleNav GPS this
hasn't changed much for the mango
version of Windows Phone and we have
HTC's hub that is included as well as
HTC watch both of those are included by
default but HTC has some nice new
programs that in download specifically
for this type of device or rather their
new mango devices the my account app is
also included from t-mobile
this is good for checking balance seeing
how many minutes you have left that kind
of thing I have notes from HTC it's also
included
so we've seen that before we can add
some notes they don't really think with
anything so it's not terribly useful now
there's a few things that I've
downloaded from the HTC hub dock mode is
pretty cool this is a something that
would show up when you slide into a dock
and you know kind of a cool access to
music big clock all at the same time
here's a brightness automatically change
the brightness down pretty cool and we
got pictures slideshow I was set to do
random transitions so you can have some
slideshow pictures going on while it's
in the dock pretty neat feature
flashlights of course I have to download
that this is going to turn on the back
the flash on the back connecting media
this is a DLNA app so if you can see
music video on media servers and
pictures so there's a media server and
there's my media center and it's gonna
load the folders sometimes it takes a
while to get they see the dots there we
go
there's my music now of course you can
only play things that the device
supports so so the record TV shows may
not play properly over the network
now settings HTC has done cool things
with the settings you got some custom
ringtones you got a custom HTC theme
which is just a different shade of green
and here's infamous sharing so this
device does support internet sharing if
you have it on your account and there's
my information and now all I have to do
is connect something else
so here's the Zune and it's going to
connect to the HTC Radar
and that works just fine you gotta wait
for it though anyway let's go back we
also have some customizations down here
you got attentive phone these are some
HTC's cool features for turning the
phone over to mute it flip it over to
turn the speaker on when you're in a
call that kind of thing is really nice
to have it in the settings oops oh we
have camera modes which doesn't have any
settings but it's thinner the real
settings are in the camera sound
enhancers in the settings so that's good
you can change some of those options and
you also have some applications I don't
have any on the sim but that's good
thing to have there and that's about it
for the custom add-on apps and settings
and whatnot let's show gauge this one is
angle compatible so we've seen this
before
can pin the stocks to your Start screen
there's that
in different cities to your Start screen
and as well as newsfeeds so this is all
a Windows Phone 7.5 compatible pretty
nice update and the rest is basically
Windows Phone 7.5 that we've seen before
now for the camera let's press the
camera button now this supports touch I
touch that corner and it focuses on that
corner and then takes picture so we have
multiple focus points we also have
front-facing camera so we can see me
there and we have a video switching and
we have options for some good options
here panoramic shot and burst shots
those are new we got some extra controls
face detection it's a pretty nice
features there and when you're in the
video we also have some effects
continuous focus is on I'm going to
choose the resolution 720p so that's as
much as you can get and you can choose
some effects
and some of the controls there so there
you have the software tour for the HTC
Radar 4G or t-mobile and if you enjoyed
this video give us a thumbs up and
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
