upgrade to the latest version of iOS or
at least don't say we didn't warn you
some knew I've had many cases have
leaked and it seems that there are
similarities to the iPad pro and if
you're wondering how big is the Galaxy S
10 plus it seems that the screen will
remind us of something like the Galaxy
Note 7
I'm Jaime Rivera and yes I know it's not
common for me to take a couple of days
off but it's the holidays and isn't it
bad that today feels like Monday this is
firing out daily if I should lose today
begin with deals once again the huawei
mate 10 pro has just emerged and Newegg
for three hundred and fifty dollars in
discount pretty much four hundred fifty
bucks
I don't 28th gig variant with six weeks
of RAM it's definitely a steal and
there's even us warranty you can learn
more in the description and speaking of
Huawei the company has come through with
its word that it would have a way to
commemorate its 200 million units being
shipped and so we've got a special
variant of the Huawei no before and the
May 20 pro and different color options
and a gold seal at the back
commemorating the you know 200 million
units the colors are interesting I'd say
I don't have a price tag yet to tell you
but the thing about it is expect them on
January 1st and for those of you
wondering exactly how large this new
batch of galaxies are going to be we've
got some leaks from ice universe that
show us that the galaxy s 10 plus is
pretty much going to have the same exact
footprint of the galaxy note 7 and bear
in mind I have nothing against the
Galaxy Note 8 or Galaxy Note 9 but these
are large phones the note 7 had this
like sweet spot we actually made a
separate video just because of the fan
addition and so apparently that is going
to be the size obviously it's going to
have less vessels so we're gonna have
larger screen can't wait to see that the
spotlight over to the iPad Mini which
has really made a lot of us curious over
what Apple wants to do with the lineup I
mean I've had many as have been
neglected for years pretty much like the
Mac Mini now the rumors are that we're
getting them somewhere early next year
and we've got some case leaks that show
us that the cutout for the camera
seems to pretty much make this tablet
look a lot like the iPad pro the new
generation so that's all great but we do
hear that there will be some corners cut
to keep the price down like for example
no face ID and other things you can
learn more about that in the description
as well and finally the most interesting
dishes they have to do with iOS 12 point
at one point - believe it or not I'd
never leave this for the hottest news
but don't say we didn't warn you last
week we've pretty much covered the fact
that Apple was launching the software
update and they were disabling the
things that weren't fringing on Qualcomm
patents so guess what the problem is I
told you that I'd report back over what
would happen people are complaining
about losing LTE losing Wi-Fi there are
people that are even complaining about
devices being pricked so you can expect
that none of our units have been updated
just yet Apple has not pronounced
themselves but let us know in the
comments down below have you had any
issues with iOS twelve point one point
two cuz I honestly I don't know any
specific cases but there are a ton of
complaints on Apple support right now
let us know what your problem is in the
comments down below
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on find out
comment subscribe to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one you can follow me
on twitter I'm never scoring it on
Instagram at home it'll be better please
