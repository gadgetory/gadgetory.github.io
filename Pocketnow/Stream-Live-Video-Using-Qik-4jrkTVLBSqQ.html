Daniel Webster here at packing.com and
today I'm going to show you a cool
application and service that will allow
you to Jeff windows mobile device as a
webcam and the program is called quick
Qi K and we'll go into that right now
Ben's pretty small application and your
windows mobile device will of course do
the camera and it just takes a second
cuz s initialize the camera and of
course it's just on the table so not
gonna see too much but I'm going to show
you this in just a second okay so from
here you can see that the camera is
initialized and it will give me a 320 by
240 display which is a QVGA resolution
so if I just hit stream here and as you
can see the program from the back I'm
just recording something simple so as
you can see if I hit stream here it will
start sending to the computer and I'll
show you that so as you can see it is
live and it does say live here and this
is a quick website and I'll post a link
on pocketnow.com as to how to get this
is a free service and it works on most
windows mobile devices with camera and
you can also send recorded videos so if
you're not streaming live you just hit
you can just them record and it will
also upload all the videos up here and
it'll show you when they were taken and
how long they are and how many people
have viewed them so that's pretty neat
and we'll just go into the options okay
so we're still setting a live feed so
we'll just hit stop here and it'll stop
sending it off if you want you can still
record video and send it uploaded to
that website quick so go to options and
you can get stream info and you can set
the title or the description and close
that privacy you can make it private or
you can make it public so whichever you
prefer you can upload files like I was
saying you can also upload videos you
can set a profile so if you want to see
your profile on the quick website you
can do that as well you chair your quick
by going here to share quick and you can
send it to an SMS message to your
contacts list you go into settings so
you can see some of the settings on this
program and it will give you
optimization for max quality or maximum
or minimum delay so you'd pick one of
either
if you're on the edge network sometimes
the delay is a little bit longer than if
you're on HSDPA or a Wi-Fi network and
the only resolution that it will allow
you to have is 240 by 320 I don't know
why it gives you other options but it
for some reason it does maybe later
releases of this program will give you
different video options and you can also
share your location to a GPS so you can
have it city level street level or
precisely your GPS coordinates which is
kind of neat so if you want to eg o'cash
some of these videos you could and you
can also select where your media is
stored in case you want to upload future
videos so i'm i chose my storage card of
course because it has much more in for
me much more storage than the just the
on-board storage of the phone okay i'll
go into the other options and you can
also sign out and get help and about
information and this is the first time
i've ever seen this program and of
course it's version 0.0225
and also give you a user inter right
here so that's pretty neat and it was ok
and this program is free and I will post
a link in parking out our comm as to how
to get this the service does require
registration which is also free and it's
pretty easy to set up and you can do
that actually it's all from your phone
which is pretty nice thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
