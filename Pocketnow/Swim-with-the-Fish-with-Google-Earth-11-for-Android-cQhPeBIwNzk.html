google just updated google earth for
android and added some really cool stuff
at now this isn't google maps this is
google earth which really lets you fly
all around Earth and now you can fly
under the ocean let's go take a look
like I said this is version 1.1 and you
can see the about screen here one other
thing on this settings page is this use
Hardware sensors you can actually use
your device the compass the
accelerometer and what not to tilt
around and navigate this view so it's
kind of like an augmented reality and
you're not even there I would love to
show you that but it's too hard for me
to hold the phone and the camera at the
same time so you're just gonna have to
have some homework to go and try that
for yourself but you're still going to
be really impressed with this so let's
get right to that now in the google
mobile blog they were telling us about
this really cool canyon in the ocean
which they said was the Monterey Canyon
it's a typo it's Monterey mln ter ey so
once you launch Google Earth you're
going to look at the planet from there
go to your search and type in Monterey
bacon and you can see here I've got the
typo just like the the Google Blog
showed it luckily I was able to get in
there and find it and it's just right
here off of the coast of the Salinas in
san jose and they say that this is
bigger than the Grand Canyon and looking
at it from the air you know I've got to
agree that's that's pretty big so let's
go ahead and zoom in I'm going to double
tap to zoom we're going to come back
over here towards the canyon now you'll
notice I don't know what's going to come
through on the the video or not but
you've got kind of these little greenish
waves for lack of a better word and
that's just what they are that is the
surface of the ocean so once you dive in
deeper than that
now we're underneath the ocean surface
we could hit the look-around button and
we can look up and sure enough there is
the top of the ocean right there so now
we are swimming with the fishes if
you'll pardon the pun and we can come
through here and look at all of the
really really cool stuff under the ocean
now there's not this much detail all
over the place in the ocean but right
here off the coast there is and it's
really really cool so I urge you to go
and take a look again this is the
Monterey Canyon you can search for that
and Google Earth it gives you all the
other stuff that you would expect from
google earth letting you fly around and
view a terrain and just parts of the
world it's like a virtual vacation in
your pocket all kinds of cool go out to
the market and download it it is free
for android 2.1 devices and up again
google earth 1.1 for android and i'm joe
for pocketnow.com if you like this kind
of stuff give this video a thumbs up if
you haven't already subscribed to our
video channel you're gonna miss out on
all the cool stuff that we put on here
so now's your chance to do that and head
on over to pocketnow.com to see stuff
that we haven't put in videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
