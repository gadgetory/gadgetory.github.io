expecting is to be surprised by a FedEx
package at my doorstep and as it turns
out this is the phone I was actually
waiting for I'm hangin a VAT with pocket
now and let's unbox the Samsung Galaxy
s8 active I think I've spent the last
three years complaining about the cheap
boxes that AT&amp;amp;T ships its phones with
and it seems that somebody finally got
the memo unboxing expensive phones
should never start with a cheap first
impression as we unwrap the FedEx
package we see a black box with the AT&amp;amp;T
logo in the middle and this is actually
thick cardboard being used here no more
of the flimsy boxes that you'd have to
throw away after day one because of how
terrible they looked surrounding the box
you have just blue accents and the
galaxy s 8 active logo be able to seal
on the sides lift the top and we have
the new Galaxy s8 active front and
center under the blue accents we have
the usual literature and below it were
created by black accessories there's a
sim ejector tool at the bottom and then
your standard USB C cable the USB to OTG
connector one of the old adapters from
micro USB and an adaptive fast charger
and notice something missing well even
if Samson claimed that its Galaxy phones
would ship with AKG headphones be active
does not include any four phone this
expensive you think this wouldn't be a
problem now focusing on the reason why
we're here this is the Samsung Galaxy s8
active front and center wrapped in
plastic the device arrives in this new
active gray color that's more like a
black mix with tensive blue on the sides
there's no curved infinity display since
this is a rugged phone but the screen
continues to be of eighteen point five
by nine aspect ratio and we do have
curves in the borders I am also hoping
that the display is a glass compared to
the polycarbonate layer that we had with
its predecessor though this is something
that we'll only be able to tell over
time
overall my first impression is that this
is a very heavy phone actually heavier
than I expected
but that's not necessarily a bad thing I
actually prefer more heft but hey our
coverage has just begun
