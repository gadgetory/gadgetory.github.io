one of them is a smartphone and one of
them is a smart camera we get that but
they've each been touted as delivering
an excellent photo shooting experience
and that's what we're here to test I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Samsung Galaxy camera versus
Nokia Lumia 920 now while we show you
these two very different but very white
devices I'll take the opportunity to
remind you to follow a pocket now at the
usual spots with the links in the
description down below now that we got
that out of the way let's go ahead and
compare these device cameras quickly
from hardware and software perspective
and then we'll get into real-world shots
and a footage face off let's go
first let's talk about some lens
differences here the Lumia 920's camera
is a smartphone shooter but it's one of
a different breed it's eight point seven
megapixel resolution isn't too special
but the optical image stabilization
built around it is in fact you won't
find it on any other smartphone the
optics are Carl Zeiss it's f-number is
2.0 and it's got a 26 millimeter focal
length video recording is supported at
1080p resolution and the flash is a
short pulse high-powered dual LED on the
software side there's very little here
to set this apart from any other Windows
Phone hopping into the photo settings
reveals the stark Windows Phone
interface with scenes is own justement
exposure control white balance control
and a few other settings we also have
access to Windows Phones lens
functionality here which on a Nokia
device especially means a whole lot of
added functionality via third-party apps
one of the things we don't particularly
like about Windows Phone is that when
you do select a scene the viewfinder
doesn't give you any indication that a
scene has in fact been selected so for
example you can save night portraiture
you see there's no icon at all in the
viewfinder so you can go through an
entire week taking shots with the camera
in you know macro mode and you would
never know it that and the lack of HDR
something of a standard on smartphones
these days ruffles are feathers a bit
switch into the Galaxy camera we've got
a whole nother ball game here the sensor
on this sucker is sixteen point three
megapixels with this huge extendable
lens providing 21x optical
zooom ability the lenses wide angle at
23 millimeters with a focal length
equivalent of 23 to 483 millimeters it
also shoots video in 1080p the
extendable flash is a proper xenon
module Samsung has optimized Android
jellybean for the Galaxy camera and the
modifications are exceedingly apparent
in the viewfinder where 15 smart modes
are available anything from macro to
backlight to long exposure and more and
yes HDR is available here masquerading
as something called rich tone in
addition to the smart mode Samsung
offers something called expert mode
which calls up a nice approximation of
manually turnable lens elements this is
basically a much fancier looking way of
adjusting ISO and exposure which we can
still do in the Lumia but the settings
here are broader because of the more
advanced camera and advanced users can
also change their aperture settings it's
the kind of granular control you expect
from a camera designed for what I'll
call the expert amateur if that makes
sense
unfortunately I'm only an intermediate
amateur and so I did most of my shooting
with the Galaxy camera and Lumia 920 in
automatic modes the first thing you'll
notice in the photo comparison is the
Galaxy cameras substantially wider field
of view capturing more along the sides
than the Lumias smaller lens can also
while you're not always going to make
use of the galaxy cameras super
extending zoom lens the 21 X zoom
capability does come in handy sometimes
and of course it beats the pants off the
Lumias digital zoom which is basically
just cropping the Lumia wins though on
night shots beating the Galaxy camera as
handily as it beats any other device in
low-light conditions even in night mode
the Galaxy camera couldn't pull much
detail out of this dark basement with
the Lumia 920 in the same mode almost
made it look like I'd turned a light on
nokia continues to excel in this
department in better lit conditions the
results are harder to quantify the Lumia
sometimes delivers warmer colors and
sometimes it doesn't both cameras shine
in the daylight colors are well
saturated without being too blown out
contrast is good and so is white balance
indoor conditions produce more
inconsistent results if you keep the
Lumia still it can actually produce
sharper shots the key is being able to
keep it still which isn't always easy
manual shutter speed control would
really help experts in this situation
but the long exposure times are what
gives the Lumia it's excellent night
capture ability so it's a toss up as for
video we had to compress and prop these
to get them in this comparison so you'll
want to see the unprocessed sample
footage on our youtube channel but a
quick comparison shows the galaxy camera
delivers warmer tones indoors the
biggest surprise came from audio though
which is much more robust on the Galaxy
camera then on the Lumia 920 now maybe
this is a side effect of those concert
filming modifications nokia was recently
talking about who knows in some each of
these devices delivers a good bordering
on very good camera experience for its
respective category each has its sweet
spots and particular preferences and a
more experienced photographer could do
much more than I could do in this quick
comparison and each has room for
improvement you'll probably never be in
a situation where you're choosing one of
these over the other but if you're
planning on buying either we hope you
found this quick comparison useful but
where's the real pure view vs. galaxy
camera comparison you ask well we know
this is not necessarily the pure view
versus galaxy camera comparison you were
looking for but stay tuned for more
because in the coming weeks we
absolutely will be putting the Galaxy
camera up against the real beast from
Nokia the 808 PureView stay tuned for
that to avoid missing it follow us at
the links down in the description if you
liked this video give us a thumbs up and
once again I'm Michael with pocket now
stay tuned for a lot more thanks for
watching
you
