numbers Apple will take forever to ship
enough of them while we made 10
information keeps coming as we hear the
build of Android etc and we finally get
another variant of the essential phone
being launched I'm Jaime Rivera and
today I was told that I complained too
much about my crazy days so why don't
you give me another idea of what to
complain about this is pocket out daily
the official news today begin with the
winners of the LG invite to the New York
Film Festival the information is in the
link in description those of you that
are winning have the opportunity to
participate in the Film Festival to be
able to see the LGB 30 in action and yes
our final unit is here our review is
coming soon and I will also be there so
if you want to make fun of my name in
person I would love that that'd be
awesome
see you there official news come from
Samsung those of you in the market for a
great SmartWatch for fitness or great
earbuds for fitness both the gear sport
and the icon X 2018 have been finally
officially given a price $2.99 for the
gear sport and then $1.99 for the icon
next 2018 they will be available for
pre-order on the 13th and you can pick
them up on the 27th we can't wait for
our review units to arrive and let's
talk about the essential phone I do
understand that a review is still
pending it is because I'm waiting for
more software updates for the camera
I've been getting better results lately
a lot better but I feel that there is
still more work to be done still if
you're in the market for one and you
want the white variant that is now
available on Sprint Amazon and Best Buy
I haven't really seen it in person so I
can't tell you what I think what I do
know is the black one is gorgeous so
yeah that's available too now let's talk
about the huawei mate 10 and mate 10 pro
the leaks continue there is one that I
considered bogus where it claims that
there is a stylus being also considered
I don't think that's going to happen
right now only Wacom is doing that
technology for smartphones and it's
pretty much owned by Samsung but then
again we also hear that these devices
are going to ship with Android or EO and
this is awesome I mean I think Huawei
has been doing an amazing job when it
comes to software over the past two
years by the way so I'm hoping that
trend continues
and finally the hot new sad a have to do
with the iPhone 10 again and updates on
its production apparently it's getting
better
but by better it doesn't mean that it's
going to be able to meet demand
apparently kg I was predicting 10,000
units a day now we're hearing 400,000
units a week which is still not going to
meet the demand that these companies are
expecting for the iPhones and I know a
lot of people are waiting for it
it just makes me wonder I mean with all
the rumors with all the 3d facial
recognition problem and everything you
know Apple has been famous for one thing
and I'm leaving that for the question
today do you think that this is just the
scam for the company to create that scar
city marketing where people just go
crazy and and that's the reason why the
phone is so popular you know it's just
the problem Apple has done it so many
times it just feels like if this is the
case but leave us a comment down below
do you really believe that it's a
technology problem or that Apple is just
using this in its favor friends again if
