pocketnow.com and this is part two of
the software tour of the verizon VX 6900
in this video we're going to take a look
at all the touch enhancements made to
the device and there are many HTC and
Verizon have done a lot to make this
device very touch friendly although
there are some spots where it's still
not that great so let's take a look at a
few of these examples I'm going to go
into context here and show you the flick
scrolling the iphone started the whole
flick scrolling thing and now we have it
in this device although it's not it's
not that good it's got a little bit of
physics so if i flick faster it'll go
faster and then it comes to a stop
gradually but it's not very precise and
it doesn't move very fast i mean this is
as fast as i can get it to go
fortunately in the context list we have
this letter chooser on the side which
makes it easy to get to say and quickly
and then move it up a little bit to find
the particular number you're looking for
this can be turned it on and off in the
control panel we also have this
functionality in pocket Internet
Explorer so if I go into that we have
pocketnow.com loaded here and I can
flick and it went pretty fast there I
can kind of drag my finger across the
screen slowly sometimes it selects the
text if I don't do it at the right speed
it takes a little bit of practice to get
used to this and also notice this I'm in
pocket Internet Explorer full screen and
because i have no hardware buttons here
how do i get to the menus well it took
me a long time to figure this out you
have to continually press the up button
till you get to the top of the screen
and then all the buttons show up i wish
there was an easier way to get out of
this but there's not so that's a good
tip to know i'm going to get out of
pocket internet explorer now let's talk
about the touchflo enhancements because
they're pretty neat the way you bring up
the touchflo cube is to start at the
bottom of the screen and drag your
finger upwards and you can do this while
you're in any program so if we're in
file explorer and i flick my finger up i
get the same cube that i would get from
the today screen so let me go through
this cube you flip your finger up to get
it to appear and you flick your finger
down to get it to go away you can also
flip right or left and there are only
three sides to this q
which of course doesn't make sense but I
guess it doesn't have to the first
screen here is basically a shortcut menu
selector so you can go to Internet
Explorer from here and let me get out of
that and then we can of course go to SMS
notes voice recorder communication
manager I really don't use this this
part of the cube because you can access
all these functions from your from your
today screen but the other sides of the
cubes are pretty useful this one will
allow you to quickly dial a favorite
persons number and you can have a
picture associated with their little
icon here if you have a picture listed
in their contact from here you can also
enter your contacts by pressing this
button and let me go back in there and
we can delete people we can go to the
phone application and go back in there
and recent calls so that's a good place
to come if you want to make a phone call
and you don't want to scroll through all
your contacts to find someone's number
this next pain well it's actually the
other way this next pain deals a lot
with multimedia and a lot is done to
enhance the multimedia experience on the
XV 6900 nothing nothing really is
different in music we go right to
windows media player which does an okay
job at playing music but there are some
better alternatives out there and let me
and here we're back photos they've done
a lot with actually so check this out
here's the updated touchflo photo
gallery and we can go to some of the
stock pictures and that's not oriented
right so I'm going to rotate it I'll
show you how I did that in a second and
just like the iphone we can flick to the
right or actually slide our finger to
the right to get to the next picture and
there are whole host of commands that
you can use to to manipulate the
pictures so if I click I tap on the
picture and I click the eye this shows
you all the gestures you can do so let's
see zoom in and zoom out is a circle
okay so I want to zoom in on this man's
face up it's not always it takes a lot
of practice to get this right so let me
try again then work then mmm still
didn't work I guess I need to make
better circles let me yeah let me try it
on another picture takes a lot of
practice get used to this there we go
and then we can zoom out further and
rotated the picture again and once you
get the hang of the whole gesture thing
if you ever do there are some other
options that come up when you tap on a
picture so you can email the picture to
someone you can do a slideshow which is
pretty neat and right now we're in
slideshow mode so it's kind of fading to
and from the various photos on the
device I'm going to pause that and go
back into the gallery I'm going to go
back to this picture tap on the picture
again we can throw it away we can assign
a picture to a contact with that button
and we can just return to the gallery
like so and we can do the flick scroll
to move around the gallery okay now I
want to take you through the camera
application because i think it's
especially well done to launch the
camera application you press the shutter
button here on the side of the device
and here we are let me move in a little
bit closer I've got a mug in focus now
to change the mode of the shooting we
tap on the screen and we press the right
button in the upper left corner so this
looks like emailing a video there's a
picture of an email and a camera and
then we click again and we are in
contact so if you want to take a picture
of a contact to assign to the touchflo
queue but you can do it here and there's
some novelty effects and that sort of
thing you also get a zoom setting this
has 2x digital zoom and we can go in
increments of point2 and so now right
now we are in maximum zoom too and with
every mode you've got a few options here
at the bottom of the screen so if i
press that arrow upwards we can change
the white balance specify where the the
picture or video is stored change the
brightness and also adjust the
resolution between small medium and
while we're on a we're on video right
now so we can only go between small and
medium
you get some more advanced settings if
you press this button in the
bottom-right corner such as metering
mode and we can we can specify whether
there should be a shutter sound if the
backlight should be kept on how long the
photo appears on the screen and whether
there is audio that gets recorded with
the video and to exit the camera
application we press the X button here
in the upper right corner before I
conclude I want to mention one thing
about the scroll bars if you are using
the device with a stylus and not using
the you know the flick scrolling which
is okay it's not it's not great because
the screen is flush there is no divot on
the right side to rest your stylus
against when you're trying to drag a
scroll bar so if you're driving a scroll
bar without looking which I often do
with other windows mobile pro devices
you may go off the screen here you see
that you got to actually look at the
scroll bar and make sure you're
following it along because there is
nothing to rest your stylus against with
the flush screen something to get used
to it's not really that big of a deal
but it may bother people that use
windows mobile touchscreen devices and
are very used to operating scroll bars
without looking at them so that's it for
the touch enhancements on the verizon VX
