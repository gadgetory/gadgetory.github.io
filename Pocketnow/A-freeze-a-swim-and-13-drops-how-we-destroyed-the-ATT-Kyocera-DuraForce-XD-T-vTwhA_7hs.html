many rugged phablets before this Kyocera
how do you protect a larger sheet of
glass and how should we test a device to
see if that protection works i'm juan
carlos bag now for pocket now and those
are some of the questions we'll try to
answer in this video while we torture
test the dura force XD on 18 t now full
disclosure I am NOT a fan of gadget
destruction porn videos and I feel it's
important to preface this test by saying
there is no such thing as a truly
ruggedized or indestructible phone if
you're trying to break one if you're
going out of your way to stress test a
device eventually you will succeed after
our first impressions video I had some
serious questions about how to proceed
testing the dura force XD I've never
handled an armor-plated phablet before
the rugged casing certainly looks the
part but the screen size introduces an
interesting challenge this is a lot of
surface area to protect and we don't
have the benefit of a fancier material
like the sapphire crystal display on the
Kyocera Brigadier ultimately we decided
on a small number of tests meant to try
and simulate what a device might live
through over the course of the year or
so getting the easy stuff out of the way
first we just wanted to test some of the
basic claims from Kyocera cold for
example the phone easily survived a half
hour in my freezer with a responsive
touchscreen and performance and say you
dropped your phone in a snowbank and it
took you a little while to find it the
Kyocera would still be responsive when
you found it next up ip68 water
resistance means you should be able to
leave the phone underwater for a half
hour and again the dura force handled
this easily
escalating the abuse to test the milspec
810g drop-in track resistance we planned
a series of 15 drops three different
scenarios with five drops per setup
first test the car drop I've had a
number of friends tell me this is a
combination getting a phone is in their
lap fumbling the phone out of a cup
holder so we dropped the XD five times
on the concrete and the phone survived
with flying colors next up a drop from
waist height onto concrete the idea here
being you missed a belt clip or fumbled
a back pocket grab another five drops
and again the dur force handles the
abuse without issue I think it's
important to note here that keyless air
is designed for a locking backplate
works really well there's an older
article on pocketnow.com
about the issues facing the galaxy s5
Actives rugged shell that phone was
water resistant but a minor drop could
easily pop open the back plate which
defeats the water resistant design I
have a galaxy s4 active and a rugby
which suffers similar back plate
fragility the Brigadier and galaxy s6
active are sealed up with non user
replaceable batteries which greatly
reduces the likelihood of water damage
after a drop the XD made me nervous to
go back to a removable back plate but
after 10 drops not a single tab had
popped out of place this is an
impressive implementation for a locking
rear casing now our last test was the
one that made me the most nervous 5
drops onto hard packed dirt you wouldn't
think that this would be the tough test
but having been a boy scout and later
working on location film sets many
gadgets are claimed by rugged hiking
conditions my last desert shoot was for
a film called the ABCs of death in that
location claimed the screens on two
iPhones here the dura force wouldn't
survive is gracefully drop one was clean
drop two was fine drop three landed with
a sickening smack screen first it caught
a couple rocks and that smashed the
front glass again gotta give the phone
credit here that everything still works
the screen is still responsive camera
still works the back plate is still
locked and secured the phone charges and
takes calls just fine we just have a
cracked screen which now also
compromises water resistance and that's
where I'm a bit torn on the XD if you
keep lobbying abuse at a device
eventually you will
kill it but I'm torn on the idea of
phablets for really rugged conditions
the Brigadier handled similar abuse with
a little more grace but I'm not sure
that a more exotic material like
Sapphire is the answer here covering
this much surface area in Crystal I
think we still would have ended up with
a similar result focusing the force of a
drop on one or two rocks one or two
impact points would probably concentrate
the energy of that drop enough to
shatter a sapphire display - and I don't
think the gorilla glass on the s6 active
would have handled these drops any
better either the idea of this dura
force makes total sense if you have a
bunch of big tough construction workers
with big rough hands wearing big thick
gloves I can see the appeal of
outfitting them with phablets however
the conditions they'd be working in are
exactly the conditions where I would
worry most about protecting that extra
screen real estate a frieze a swim and
13 drops and the result is a nearly
fully functional phone with a cracked
front face it's never fun seeing a
shattered screen but overall I'm
satisfied with how this device handled
the abuse we threw at it we have all
kinds of ways that we can test foam
performance for battery life in
benchmarking and gaming performance but
what kinds of tests would you like to
see for lifestyle abuse and
manufacturers durability claims drop us

maybe someday I'll get to run over one
of these with my car fingers crossed
it could happen as always folks thanks
