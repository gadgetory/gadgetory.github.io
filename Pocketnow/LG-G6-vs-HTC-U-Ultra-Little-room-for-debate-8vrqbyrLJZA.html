beauty a two in one panel versus dual
displays if you're in the market for a
2017 flagship your current list is
narrowed to two very different
approaches to building a phablet
I'm hi I'm going to bet I was pocket now
and this is LG g6 vs. HTC u ultra off
the bat the first thing to note is that
this comparison almost seems unfair I
mean by simple looks you'd think that
we're comparing a regular sized
smartphone with a phablet but that's
actually not the case
both the LG G 6 and the HTC u ultra
offer a 5.7 inch display but with a very
different approach to design ergonomics
about the only thing similar about these
devices is that they are gorgeous slabs
of metal and glass that are striking
from a distance and feel great in the
hand and that's just about it the
differences begin with the fact that the
U ultra is a whopping 14 millimeters
taller eight millimeters wider and seven
grams heavier than the G 6
we're the only speck that they share is
really thickness and so if one device is
significantly larger than the other but
both are just as thick you'd wonder why
only the smaller one includes a
headphone jack and why only the smaller
one has a camera that's flush the
chassis or worse why the smaller phone
has 10% more battery than the larger one
LG engineers have clearly taken
miniaturization more seriously than HTC
in 2017 and the rest of the specs we are
looking at similar phones the same
snapdragon 801 the same four gigs of ram
the same options for expandable storage
even if the new ultra sports double the
base storage than the g6 at 64 gigs both
devices have quick charge 3.0 through
USB C but only the g6 includes wireless
charging even if both devices are made
of glass and another spot where the g6
wins is in the inclusion of ip68 water
and does resistance where the U ultras
rating is still not really mentioned
anywhere
a partial hardware win for the new ultra
is that it follows on HTC's legacy of
providing a great audio experience for
the headphone jack using the company's u
sonic approach by tailoring headphone
audio to your surroundings and also the
usual duel firing speakers with a
tweeter at the top and a woofer at the
bottom now in the case of the g6 once
real audio review has already proven
that the device can go really close to
the HTC audio quality when it comes with
the headphone jack performance about the
only thing you're not going to like is
being able to muffle the single firing
speaker at the bottom even though it can
get really loud and then when it comes
to the partial hardware wins for HTC we
have this gorgeous Super LCD 5 sure the
IPS panel on the g6 is very beautiful
and accurate and color reproduction
HTC's panel wins in brightness
visibility in direct sunlight and how
well it inhibits blacks and punches
Red's to AMOLED territory for the g6
wins when it comes to the display is
really ergonomics we have a crazy 79
percent screen to body ratio with a
smaller 2x1 display that's also narrower
than your standard smartphone this leads
to a phablet that doesn't really feel
like a phablet in one hand where the u
ultra is just large for the sake of
being large with just the crazy 67%
streak to body ratio really inefficient
overall what's portrayed on these
displays is also a clear sign of more
efficiency from LG LG's launcher seems
to be more fit to saturate with icons
where HTC seems to need to update the U
ultra with a launcher that allows for a
more denser grid liking either of these
launchers as a matter of taste I mean
don't get me wrong
coolest fan of HTC Sense LG also offers
and always-on display that I find very
helpful but I'm going to give this one
to the secondary display of the U ultra
which this provide added functionality
at the moment of this comparison HTC
have actually figured out how to get us
the HTC Sense companion application to
make this display even smarter
but since AI needs to actually learn
from your behavior over time we'll leave
our comments on
that for the final review I've been
using both the g6 in the u ultra as my
two devices for the last week phone
calls feel about the same on both the
minor punch and clarity on the g6
but both devices handle phone calls and
data admirably over AT&amp;amp;T battery life is
where things get mixed as neither of
these devices is what I'd call great
even if the g6 sports a larger battery I
find that the battery drain is pretty
much the same on both devices
which means you'll probably get through
a day of moderate use notice probably on
a high note both devices handle graphics
in terms of games great given the
similarities of their respective spec
sheets but if you want to talk
differences let's go through these
cameras we have a 12 ultra pixel shooter
versus two 13 megapixel cameras on the
g6 a standard and a wide this means
we're comparing 1.5 5 microns on a u
ultra versus 1.1 2 on the g6 on both
sensors even if we have F 1.8 aperture
on both standard cameras and I'm talking
the you ultra versus the g6 not both
cameras on the g6 they actually have
different apertures this has led to some
of the most beautiful photos I seen from
an HTC device with amazing bouquet
saturation and detail but we also know
the g6 is no slouch in these departments
and all the while winning with the added
value of the wide-angle camera for those
shots that you simply cannot get with a
standard camera on a smartphone I mean I
can't deny just how much I love the
functionality of LG provides here but
really don't waste your time in trying
to judge either of these when it comes
to photo quality or which one does a
better job and day or night both devices
do just great and I also feel the same
about video and stability but then
question is which phone does more of
what you want and in my personal
preference I just cannot live without
this wide-angle camera on the g6 it's
been my favorite hands-down and really I
think that's the best segue to end this
comparison I almost filled that for the
ultra because this would have been a
great phone for 2016 it still is one of
the most beautiful devices that I've
seen
but I just cannot see this device
winning a competition at a time when
design efficiency has overtaken 2017
with devices like the LG G six for
almost the same hefty price tag the LG G
six seems to be the most versatile and
smarter by up to two and definitely the
device that I would recommend from these
two folks just like this we've got more
coverage on the g6 and the you ultra
