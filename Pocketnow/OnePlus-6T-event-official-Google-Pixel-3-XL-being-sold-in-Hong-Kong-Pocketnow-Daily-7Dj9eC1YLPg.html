official invite for the oneplus 60 some
users of the Apple watch series for
having problems with daylight saving
time ending and the Google pixel 3 Excel
is on sale currently in Hong Kong and
it's the lesson been released yet I'm
Jaime Mehta Iveta definitely happy
Monday and don't worry if you hear a lot
of rumors it's because we've got a ton
of events coming up so it's gonna get
official very soon this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
HP and Chromebooks and not educational
focused Chromebooks the company has just
launched a new x360 model it's a 14 inch
computer full-blown computer that runs
Chrome OS but think about it as it costs
nearly 700 bucks of the whole plan
here's for it to be more of your
full-blown computer and not an
educational based Chromebook I've been
using the Google pixel book for the past
weeks and I don't know if that's even
possible now let's talk about Facebook
as well the company is getting more and
more into the hardware business with
things that are considered bizarre at
least from me as they've just launched a
new portal lineup of smart displays that
will help you communicate with other
people sort of like what the Amazon echo
show is up to the point where these
smart displays actually work with Alexa
there are two different tiers two
different specifications I don't know
how this is any better than just using a
tablet that can also serve for more
things and also video calls but then
again it's Facebook man they're doing
weird things regardless now let's talk
about the Apple watch series for as
daylight saving time is ending in
certain countries not the United States
just yet and users in those countries
like for example Australia are
complaining about their watch remaining
in a boot loop because apparently the
watch face is not able to handle more
hours than are supposed to be handled oh
and this is just a fun thing with Apple
as they get these like small little
things wrong like the alarms being able
to work after a certain period of time
or for example in my case this phone
just not notifying me even if I've told
it that I am available and not not gone
to sleep yet and stuff like that so yeah
this is Apple
let's see when we get a fix for that now
for those of you in the market for a
Google pixel 3 Excel I have no idea why
you would choose to buy it from scalpers
now but if you're in the market it's
available in Hong Kong for $2,000 and
well there are certain publications that
actually got their hands on one
publications from the United States by
the way and well tweak your
specifications like the four gigs of RAM
that have me scratching my head and
stuff like that of pixel Aventis
tomorrow we're gonna be covering it live
so stay tuned for the official stuff
let's hope this design is fake and
finally the hot news today have to do
with oneplus as the company has just
sent out press invitations for an event
happening in New York City on October
30th it's gonna be a very Halloween
event very interesting that they chose
those dates we're definitely gonna be
there covering all the event and what
we've seen all the rumors we need of the
oneplus 60 we've seen the design
everything is nice and actually for
those of you that are interested in
participating in the event we're
actually gonna be there you can hang out
with all of us just follow the first
link in the description there's an
option there where you could buy tickets
and actually the tickets are not
expensive and in previous years they
actually give you something back for
that so that's all great you can learn
more in the description again and let us
know in the comments I mean what do you
