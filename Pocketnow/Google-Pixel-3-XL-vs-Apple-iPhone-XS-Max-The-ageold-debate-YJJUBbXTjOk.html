a look at a couple of the best releases
and pit them against one another and
what better comparison could there be
than the age-old battle between iOS and
Android in this case we're looking at
the pure releases of both in either case
there may have been changes to keep
portions of the formula but whether they
were for the better
depends on what part of the experience
you prioritize the most this is
PocketNow and I'm Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody and this is the
Google pixel 3xl versus the iPhone 10s
Mac's brought to you by the geniuses
over a Twix we're dealing with the
larger of both devices in their
respective lines meaning that the
viewing experience is arguably better
due to the increased real estate however
this also means that the handling
experience can take a hit for those who
prefer less and gymnastics that said
both the pixel on the iPhone bring the
best of their design languages from the
now established like of a home button in
one to the new notch world in the other
alright let's talk about the notches I'm
sure many of you out there might have
thought the iPhone brought the worst
version of it to smartphones but then
Google decided to bring it to the excel
say what you will about how they look at
least there's a bit going on in either
one the iPhone brings its face idtech
and the pixel added a wide-angle
front-facing camera where I draw the
line however is at how the pixel uses
the added space on either side of the
knotch there's very little added to that
functionality if at all whereas the
iPhone makes the left side drop down the
notification shade and the right side
bring down the control panel it might be
a pain to use in practice sometimes
especially on the 10s Macs
but at least they're trying to add a
reason for the cutouts in general the
AMOLED screen in either device brings of
gray viewing experience it is a lower
resolution coming from the iPhone but
that has always been the case anyway
despite a comparative lack of pixel
density from Apple it doesn't mean that
the display is lacking in sharpness or
detail on the contrary the Retina
display does plenty on the other hand
the pixel 3xl has a quad HD AMOLED
display that brings the high-end
specification Android flagship users are
accustomed to it does bring a feature
iPhone still lack in an always-on
display one that seamlessly transitions
into the lockscreen while waiting for a
fingerprint read meanwhile the iPhone
waits for your face before revealing the
notifications in its lockscreen
and speaking of navigation plenty of
changes have been made on both fronts
Apple has spent a little more time in
the
and a full-screen gesture so admittedly
they are not only more fleshed-out
they're also more intuitive swipe up
from the bottom bar to go back home
swipe up and hold to bring up the reason
apps carousel and then go left and right
on the bar to switch between apps
quickly Android has made its move
towards the same with let's say mixed
results the nav bar does remain with a
home button that can be held down for
Google assistant but swipes up for home
and recent apps have been added along
with swipes to the left and right for
swapping between apps the problem is
that the movements just feel kind of
janky especially when trying to go
further back in the app list when you
swipe from left to right and then a back
button still appears where applicable so
it makes one wonder why they would
change some things but not others
changes have been part for the course
though as both phones have done away
with sought-after features like the
expandable storage or the headphone
jacks where the changes have actually
negatively hit the experiences in the
iPhone though whose unboxing experience
reveals even more omissions there's
neither a headphone adapter nor a
fast-charging break included both of
which are available in the competitor
the rest of the bits and pieces are
exactly what you would expect from these
latest iterations Apple has brought its
7 nanometer process the a12 bionic that
helps an already optimized and smooth
iOS experience while the pixel 3 rocks
the Snapdragon 845 the tried and true
powerhouse processor we've seen a ton
already this year there is a little mist
in the day-to-day experience of either
phone depending on your preferences of
course the lower ram capacity of the
pixel compared to other Android phones
does leave a little to be desired though
some applications straight-up die in the
background when you do just a little bit
too much while more RAM could help this
out it is also possible that Android is
just tuned to do this thankfully these
situations are far and few between and
definitely not experience breaking
choosing between Android and iOS is a
pastime of any smartphone enthusiast by
now but both have been around for so
long that many users are pretty much
locked into either ecosystem and it is a
bit tough to convert from one to the
other
iOS 4 examples have users that cite
things like iMessage or seamless
integration with other Apple products
like their laptops or all the
third-party accessories meanwhile
Googlers are all about the ubiquitous
services that include Google Photos
which also allow for full quality
uploads into their cloud so you can save
some space on the pics
three and those pictures and videos are
what really make the experience an
either device especially in the case of
the pixel google has made incredible
strides in the field of photo processing
utilizing their near limitless amount of
data from photos in their cloud to
create the best possible results for you
and all what the single lens on the rear
despite the growing trend of let's say
stoves appearing on the back of the
phone because there's so many cameras
being added on to smart phones not to
say any of the multicam setups are
inferior it's just an illustration of
the power of Google's data-driven
processing now this is true for about
the rear end the front cameras where the
processing makes something usable from
less than ideal scenes it is the phone
that I have to admit I personally always
have in reach because I can rely on it
to bring good results in mainly pictures
that goes doubly for the avid selfie
taker who can use the wide front facing
camera to fit more in the frame whether
it be more people or more of the
surroundings portrait mode works in that
wide-angle view as well with Google's
data on doing mostly a good job at
cutting out the subject properly now the
pixel has also brought some new modes to
its camera since its announcement ones
that actually elevate the experience
we'll talk mainly about nitesite which
mostly proves to be a great asset for
even selfies so you don't have to lean
on a harsh flash a long exposure gets a
bunch of photos at once and then use a
software stabilization to make something
out of basically nothing lighting wise
on a different part of the
post-processing spectrum is the iPhone
10s max which brings smart HDR to both
its pictures and videos it does a good
job on its own filling in shadows and
providing detailed but ultimately evened
out photos there are a few different
options for filters modes and live photo
capture all of which are also available
in the pixel what the iPhone does add in
is an optical zoom lens which helps get
closer to the subject when triggered and
during portrait mode shooting which also
does a generally good job of finding the
cutout and in the post-processing
portrait bokeh can be adjusted the
front-facing shooter does benefit from
the face detection tech adding in the
portrait mode lighting when shooting
selfies it can benefit from a few more
functions and extras perhaps but the
iPhone 10 S is still reliable in its own
right and can be leaned on during daily
usage
now here's where the disparity appears
however video recording the rear cameras
are high in quality on either device
providing great detail and colors with
stabilization the iPhone slightly edges
the pixel because of its smart HDR but
again it's up to you if you prefer the
more evened out look as opposed to
footage with a bit more contrast or the
pixel just utterly fails is an audio
which is a big bummer for a vlogger like
myself that wide front-facing camera
looks great even if it suffers from the
typical lower quality that front
shooters provide but the thin audio just
breaks the experience the iPhone simply
sounds better so there are definite
trade-offs for creatives in this
department so before we conclude this
video let me tell you more about our
sponsor Wix if you want to make a store
a blog or other website with no coding
knowledge Wix offers an amazing
portfolio of tools that lets you design
something that is right for you and it's
all drag-and-drop or pick from one of
the many templates you can learn more
about the geniuses over at Wix in the
description down below and finally we
have the price depending on which size
of either phone you prefer the pixel
three starting out at $799 undercuts the
iPhone by $200 as with all of these
things personal preference will dictate
your priorities google has made the
pixel arguably one of the most reliable
stills cameras in smartphones today
while the iPhone does edged it out a bit
in video Android and iOS users can be
pretty logged into their respective
ecosystems so if you are one of those
people the bias is probably pretty
obvious which one did you pick let us
know in the comments down below and
let's continue the age-old debate of iOS
vs. Android end of 2018 edition stay
tuned for even more and check out our
reviews on both of these phones here on
PocketNow for now I'm going to call it
on this one and we'll see you in our
