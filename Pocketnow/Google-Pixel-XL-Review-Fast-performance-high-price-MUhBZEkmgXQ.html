first party phone platform from
developers to more of a consumer focus
the pixel XL has become a fairly
polarizing device in our comments
there's a lot of the Google DNA we still
enjoy but it's packaged up in a softer
aesthetic and arrives with a more
premium price tag for you specs junkies
you can pause the video here to get a
quick rundown on the hardware this pixel
is packing with that out of the way
Google's design here gets a lot right
look at some of the things folks are apt
to complain about on other phones pixel
features a subtle wedge shape thicker at
the top than at the bottom which helps
provide enough room to sync the camera
housing flush with the rear plate while
keeping a thinner feel in the hand using
it for a couple weeks I never could
shake the vibe from our first
impressions I still don't like this
glass panel on the back for how nice the
satin finishes on the rest of the phone
the glass just feels out of place
it's incongruous though we are happy to
see a company playing with bold color
options pixel joins the honor 8 as the
only other phone people have asked me
about personally while using it out in
public the most derided part of this
look though has to be these front white
borders white edges certainly call more
attention to the use of space here the
phone still features a respectable
screen to bezel ratio but with no
Hardware on the front we can totally
appreciate why some feel this is wasted
space now speaking of that screen this
is a very good AMOLED display but
overall it feels a bit basic there
doesn't seem to be the high brightness
or high contrast burst mode found on
some competitors and what we can measure
for brightness pixel fell behind the
galaxy s7 and just edged out the iPhone
7 plus but ultimately it's up in the
tier of easy-to-read screens when out in
daylight as this is a consumer focused
phone accuracy seems to have taken a
backseat to popping the color for a more
dramatic look there aren't any colour
profile adjustments to be found in the
normal settings but the developer
settings includes an sRGB mode which
adjusts color temperature and saturation
for a more accurate display it doesn't
reach the accuracy of the galaxy s7 or
iPhone 7 but it helps take the edge off
the aggressive saturation
now the big draw for prospective pixel
purchasers is of course this software
Android 7.1 with Google's customizations
running on top we've covered the nougat
basics and numerous other videos and
we're still really enjoying the
multitasking and notification shade
improvements Google adds a new gesture
for pulling up the app drawer which is
pretty keen but the biggest update is
the new Google assistant I'm not one to
often rely on voice search but Google's
assistant is another important step
towards more organic and conversational
voice search we're hoping this forms the
backbone of Google's future connected
device strategy like Android auto and
Google home the software discussion
wouldn't mean much though if it weren't
for this insane UI performance we've
never used in Android which felt this
consistently snappy and responsive pixel
benchmarks well enough but there's
obviously been a focus on optimization
reading through complaints regarding RAM
management from more aggressive use our
more anecdotal testing has shown
consistent performance for daily tasks
social media and light to moderate
gaming playing four games at a time will
cause apps to be ejected from memory but
that just isn't something we're apt to
do very often and we're happy to see
some terrific radios onboard Wi-Fi
performance was neck-and-neck with the
galaxy s7 just edging out the LGV 24 a
strong connection with my lame Wi-Fi
router we should also take a moment here
to talk about carriers sure TV
commercials will tell you that the pixel
is only on Verizon but we picked up this
phone with project Phi in mind
especially for some recent international
traveling juggling between t-mobile and
Sprint networks I was happy to find
stronger signal in my neighborhood then
on Verizon and with the exception of one
drop out in Munich the pixel XL proved
to be a better travel companion than the
5x I was using for keifa earlier this
year now moving to the camera we have
the most complete examination of pixel
photo and video performance in our
separate real camera review linked below
this video but to recap Google delivers
one of the best HDR modes we've ever
seen we're treated to stellar slow
motion video and genuinely excellent
stabilization in most shooting scenarios
unfortunately our unit was subject to
some terrible lens flaring sometimes
visible during daylight conditions the
software stabilization
and get twitchy during panning and we're
disappointed to see or hear rather only
mono audio recording while shooting
video this is ultimately a very good
camera especially for those folks who
only shoot full auto but it completely
ignores people who would prefer more
control over their composition and lens
defects knock it out of google's
assertion that this is the best camera
ever in chatting about the camera many
have pointed to the perk that you get
unlimited full quality google photo
storage from this phone this is nice but
for photos Google already allows
unlimited storage for up to 16 megapixel
images in 1080p video I already use it
to back up all of my iPhone photos as
iCloud is stupid expensive the main perk
here might be for folks who shoot a lot
of UHD video which I do but this isn't a
feature we would necessarily point to as
a purchasing motivator now the audio
situation is something of a
disappointment the bottom firing speaker
is about par for the course when
compared to other bottom firing
solutions but the headphone playback
falls far behind most of the competition
we also have a more in-depth look at
audio performance in our real audio
review but it would seem Google opted
not to incorporate more HTC DNA here
which is a shame
and lastly looking at battery life the
pixel is a solid all-day performer under
moderate use we were consistently able
to make it to dinnertime with some room
to spare looking at our media test
streaming 30 minutes of HD video over
Wi-Fi at 190 Lux the phone drained
approximately 5% of its battery which is
right in line with similarly Specht
flagship phones and recharge times our
upper mid pack 30 minutes on the
included charger resulted in topping off
the battery 37 percent while the phone
remained cool to the touch so let's wrap
this up where does that leave us with
Google's pixel XL there's a lot to like
here Google is making a second attempt
at a first impression and for folks most
concerned about software performance we
think they'll be very pleased with what
they get does that punch your
performance warrant the newly premium
price however that's a tougher question
to answer
we're similarly expensive phones are
arriving with better lifestyle features
like enhanced durability better audio or
larger batteries with faster charging
other competitors this year can often
match
or best many of the pixels benefits for
a lot less cash we're very excited by
the idea of a platform where Google
controls the hardware and the software
we certainly see the benefits of proper
optimization but at this price we were
hoping to see more risks anything which
might help Google differentiate from the
competition or justify a premium label
as the Nexus is now properly retired
whether the performance and promise of
timely updates are worth it is a
question only you and your wallet can
answer as always thanks so much for
