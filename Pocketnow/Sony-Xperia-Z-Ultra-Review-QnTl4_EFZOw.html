between small tablets and large
smartphones and the latest manufactured
of push that boundary is Sony its latest
smartphone has stretched our hands and
pockets for more than a week now I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is our full review of the Sony
Xperia Z ultra but before we get to that
we'd like to give a shout out to our
friends at Negri electronics for lending
us a Z ultra for this review check out
their site for a Z ultra of your own
other mobile devices or mobile
accessories externally the Xperia Z
ultra takes many design cues from its
nearest relatives the Xperia Z and
Xperia tablet Z it features practically
the same design an all-glass front and
back with high quality matte finished
trim along the edges and like those two
siblings Z ultra comes with ip55 and
ip57 z' meaning it can withstand up to
one liter of water submersion for up to
30 minutes but there are two aspects of
the Z ultra which are impossible to miss
how extremely thin the device is and its
massive footprint measures a hundred and
seventy nine point four millimeters tall
and ninety two point two millimeters
wide more like a tablet than a
smartphone it also hits the scales at
212 grams yet it only measures six point
five millimeters thick it's large
stature is most obviously due to its
enormous display diagonally the Xperia Z
ultra display is six point four inches
at a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels
it offers a respectable density of 344
pixels per inch and like the Xperia Z
devices before the Z ultra display
appears slightly washed out beside
displays like the HTC One S s LCD three
display or AMOLED panels it doesn't
offer very deep blacks and while its
viewing angles are wider than we
remember with the smaller Xperia Z we're
not blown away by the Xperia Z ultra
display however the Mobile BRAVIA Engine
2 certainly helps in video playback
involve ughing pictures one unique
feature worth mentioning is the ability
to use any old pen or pencil with the
seal for as a makeshift stylus for us
and all the times we've tried it it's
been hit or miss and it lacks the level
of integration Samsung's S Pen offers
it's unfortunately no more useful than a
standard capacitive stylus other than
that the Z ultra puts up something
oppressive specifications it ships with
the Snapdragon 800 chipset which is
composed of a 2.2 gigahertz quad-core
Krait 400 CPU and Adreno 330 GPU it has
2 gigabytes of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
fixed storage but the storage is
expandable by way of microSD card the
camera sensor around back is rated at 8
megapixels while the front camera is 2
megapixels and the battery is rated at
3050 million powers if you've seen our
videos on any of the recent experiences
you know exactly what to expect with the
Z ultra software quite literally nothing
has changed this is Android version
4.2.2 beneath Sony's customized skin
comes with a set of eight themes to
choose from a set of Sony's widgets and
its own custom icons it also has a
handful of pre installed applications
the most noteworthy customization is the
set of quick setting toggles at the top
of notification shade which are user
definable of course the small apps are
still accessible by pressing the recent
apps button more are available in the
Play Store and there is a usual power
management software in the settings
application stamina mode which can
easily double or triple your standby
time depending on your usage finally
under the Xperia connectivity submenu in
settings
sony has included some throw settings
for playing wireless content on
connected displays as well as support
for DualShock 3 wireless controllers
perfect for gamers performance is
unquestionably the highest point of the
Xperia Z ultra Snapdragon 800 chip is
easily one of the most powerful chipsets
we've ever put our hands on second only
to the Tegra 4 it's used synthetic
benchmarks up and spits them out without
even thinking about breaking a sweat the
Z ultra makes light work of intense
gaming and multitasking and it has no
problems putting up the numbers where it
counts it performs extremely smoothly
for the diehards and performance junkies
this device is a dream come true but we
must note that after several hard resets
were still experiencing issues with a
touchscreen it's insensitive at times
not even picking up taps and swipes
other times it's entirely too sensitive
or poorly calibrated accepting swipes as
taps and vice-versa we can neither
confirm that this is a common issue nor
that we've received a defective unit it
doesn't seem to be a common problem but
we have found more than one other user
with a similar problem the speaker on
this device is plainly put we
it's quiet tinny and entirely too easy
to cover up we suggest sticking with
headphones when possible and it's also
worth noting that stamina especially in
heavy usage is nothing worth writing
home about we were able to manage a full
day of charge on the device but only by
leaving it at our pockets most of the
day and use the battery jobs rather
quickly on the Z ultra the upshot
stamina mode does its job exceptionally
well and the Z ultra charges extra quick
also thanks to the Snapdragon 800 the
call quality on the Z ultra is par for
the course the earpiece speaker is nice
and the collars on the other end noted
that we sounded crisp and very clear
speakerphone quality was as expected not
that great the volume was simply too low
and color sounded robotic at times and
data speeds test channel both t-mobile
and AT&amp;amp;T HSPA+ networks in the Charlotte
metro and winston-salem areas of North
Carolina were moderate but nothing
terribly impressive about 5 megabits per
second down and 1 to 2 megabits per
second up and the camera quality at 8
megapixels with no LED flash is once
again modest it takes fairly crisp
photos with bright colors but it often
erred on the side of way to cool giving
many photos a dead field without some
post-processing or manual white balance
adjustment it does however come with a
lot of settings and shooting modes to
toggle and choose between and we must
note it calms set to 5 megapixels out of
the box for a 16:9 aspect ratio images
are on par with other 8 megapixel
cameras but they're nothing mind-blowing
so what do we make of all this it's
quite simple actually the Xperia Z ultra
is not a phone for everyone in fact it's
only practical for a very small subset
of people who fill a smartphone is
simply not enough it's for the user who
feels a small tablet is more usable and
geared towards the performance they need
out of a pocket-sized device our problem
with the Z ultra is that for the best
majority of people who might consider a
6 point 4 inch device it's simply too
big there's an unusual amount of bezel
at the top at bottom of the display
which we imagine is due to it being so
thin instead if you approach this device
as a small tablet like a Nexus 7 with an
earpiece instead of a giant Xperia Z you
will see this device in a much more
favorable light and if it weren't for
the inconsistent touchscreen we probably
would have enjoyed the smartphone a
whole heck of a lot more
it's basically unadulterated power and
it feels untamed unfinished we give the
Xperia Z ultra
seven point five out of ten and for one
final time we would like to thank our
friends at Negri electronics for lending
