adam doubt will remember for the rest of
their lives ass believe it or not webos
has returned to mobile i'm high net
event of a pocket down from mwc 2015 in
barcelona here with the LG watch urbane
LTE based on webos so a neat little
surprise for the show in barcelona is
that all the rumors of LG working on a
web of a SmartWatch were actually true
even if the company is oddly hesitant to
admit it they're calling this their new
LG wearable platform which even though
based on webos is far from the webOS we
remember and according to them is far
superior this new watch urbane LTE was
designed as a sibling to the watch
urbane we also had a chance to demo but
their differences are actually
substantial in addition to the OS
differences since watch urbane runs
Android wear the LG counterpart houses
more buttons to help its unique user
interface the button in the middle
serves as a home button and also an app
tray and if you've seen webOS TVs from
LG you'll feel right at home with the
flying icons the button at the top
served as a quick settings menu and if
you long press it you're taken to LG's
hue voice which doesn't rely on your
phone to work since this is an LTE
capable smart watch the button at the
bottom serves as a back key when short
press but if you decide to connect the
watch urbane LTE to an Android
smartphone the Android companion
application will allow you to choose
whatever happens with this button when
you long press it in this demo unit it
was used for activating an emergency
call which is really cool other hardware
differences include a non-removable
rubber strap that's necessarily the most
elegant you've ever seen and especially
not as elegant as its non-lte
counterpart but it's really necessary to
enable both LTE capabilities and also
LG's proprietary NFC payment solution
since all the antennas are laying on the
strap the watch sports a microphone at
the bottom and an ample speaker at the
top that not only serves for phone calls
but also for playing music if that's
your thing there's also one gigabyte of
RAM 4 gigabytes of emmc ronster
orage and a 700 million power battery to
give users as much as a full day of
charge according to LG there's also a
hard-wearing sensor at the bottom and a
magnetic charging port and there are
also built-in sensors which LG will
confirm when the product becomes final
and official but we heard barometer in
addition to other things then there are
the applications LG is not only making
significant investments in launching
watch urbane LTE with a full suite of
basic apps like motion tracking fitness
training phone calls and messaging but a
company is also building its own
marketplace for third-party applications
to work as well and everything based on
Android so far probably what's most
impressing is how snappy the watch
behaves even when this watches at least
two months away from its official launch
according to LG we don't know which
carriers might pick it up across the
globe but we do know that there is
already one carrier committed in Korea
we should have more impressions on this
and much more from LG in days to come so

subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
you can follow me on Twitter I'm na
underscore iveta please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am high memory but we've gotten more
from mwc 2015 in Barcelona</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
