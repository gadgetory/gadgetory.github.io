period with the iphone we get a very
clear explanation of samsung's iso silk
camera technology on the galaxy s5 and
if you want to Sony Xperia z2 you better
act fast I'm hi Mary that I and if I'm
starting to look tan don't worry it
should go away by the winter time this
is fucking out daily let started a
offensive official news as I know a lot
of you remember the one plus one which
is the oddest name for smartphone but it
is the next cyanogenmod phone to be
launched now what we get some more
reports on what to expect from this
phone apparently the vice will include
and always listening feature so I'm like
what we found on the Moto X end the
funniest thing about these news is that
this is based on the Snapdragon 800 leak
and heck that was figured out by a
developer yesterday so yeah and Qualcomm
needs to learn its own thing from other
people I guess now let's talk about
Samsung as I know some of you were
disappointed about the fact of the
galaxy s5 did not include a 20 megapixel
camera or something crazy when it was
announced but it does include the iso
self camera that apparently is a big
deal licks in the description for a full
video on exactly why this camera matters
as apparently even though it's still
focused on the backside illuminated
sensor technology it does a better job
in low light we just want to test it and
if you want the all new HTC One hey
don't wait for you can get it now on
ebay for five hundred dollars and no I'm
not kidding there's actually a listing
and the links down below of an HTC One
from verizon where we get the full
retail box the phone everything all the
specification set the back and it's just
really interesting five hundred dollars
on ebay it has a buy it now' button so
we're not exactly sure how long this is
going to last it's probably going to be
taken down by the time this video goes
live but hey get more details on the
phone let's hope it's ready for launch
on the twenty-fifth now one of the
devices that we like the most from mwc
2014 was the Sony Xperia z2 and call it
whatever you want some people were like
hey this is just another z1 and it kind
of this but it has all the improvements
of the things that we did not like about
the z1 and as it turns out we're
expecting for this phone to be launched
the public on the second week of April
according to quo but it seems that
there is going to be a shortage of units
so if you're interested in the z2 as we
are you better make sure you keep an eye
on this launch and finally through the
interesting news of the day those of you
that we're disappointed about the fact
that car play was announced with no
cards that are compatible with it well
pioneer is apparently going to be
building an aftermarket device that will
allow you to bring all the features of
car plate on your non Ferrari car which
is great since a lot of us are not able
to buy a car like right now and
specifically not for car play we just
don't know if this is something that's
going to be approved by apple but though
slightly after the whole made for ipod
branding but even more interesting news
Apple silently killed their 30-day
return policy for the iphone even though
the company hasn't really told anybody
why they're just going back to 14 days
and that leads you to the question of
the day how do you feel about apple
making their whole return policy smaller
I mean I remember the whole steve jobs
biography this was a big topic about why
he fought for this to remain 30 days
leave us a comment down below is to be
honest with you 30 days was great 14
days is also good but for some people
it's not enough and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is filmer tree
follow was unpacking out comment
subscribe to youtube channel as well you
can also follow me on twitter
Highlanders called a nevada visit this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi Mary better thank you very
much for watching we will see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
