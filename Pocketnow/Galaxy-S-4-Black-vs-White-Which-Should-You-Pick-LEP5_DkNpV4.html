asked to get some time to some other
people with the devices but before we go
we want to show you the differences on
camera between the white galaxy s floor
and the black vs florida hobbies is the
same exact device we don't have to tell
you that but just so you can see on
camera this the black one you can see
the hints of the design language from
the note 2 and the s3 you can see the
kind of a horizontal rushing almost
almost looks like that airline aluminum
finish but obviously a much more
texturized version and the wipes either
both during the same exact thing but
considering the colors are inverted by a
380 degrees it has a very very different
effect when you look at it and of course
that hyper glaze coating up top picking
up the fingerprints quite nicely so this
is going to be a tough decision there's
no longer pebble blue and white it is
black and white and i forgot the special
colors but that is just a quick look
there and it's gonna be a tough decision
on retail shelves michael visual pocket
now with brandon minimum stay tuned for
more thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
