review for this phone while we pushed
out a fairly significant update
addressing camera performance the more
we compared shots the more it became
clear we needed to reshoot this review
the mate 9 is an impressive package of
big screen and big specs I'm taking a
look at this second generation dual
camera shooter you can pause the video
here to see what hardware we'll be
checking out now buckle up folks we've
got a lot of ground to cover and I'm
gonna move pretty quick starting with
exposure and saturation like a second
partnership with Huawei impresses the
may 9 plays with light unlike any other
phone we've reviewed aside from the
Huawei p9 of course color information is
captured by one sensor and then exposure
and light info is painted in from the
monochrome sensor it produces JPEGs
which appear to have a wider dynamic
range with less detail lost in brighter
sections of an exposure like as image
processing is more aggressive this
go-around however there's a soft touch
to color processing but numerous modes
settings and options to filter your
output for a more photographic look
blues and greens are fantastically
captured Browns and earth tones look
rich in afternoon light yellows look
delicious just bordering on clipping
information but saved by that monochrome
sensor and Red's were tricky often we
found this phone slightly exaggerating
the exposure or pushing our saturation
into magenta territory Red's are always
tricky for digital sensors but for most
setups in daylight walking back the
brightness a half stop seems to land
better accuracy and a white flower in
direct sunlight just to touch clipped on
these pedals but perfectly exposed for
the tiny structures in the center of the
flower while color processing is often
rich on the hole we found the white
balance on this phone usually slid a
little too cool for our tastes capturing
a subject and shade output can feel icy
which really isn't appropriate for
Southern California even during our
quote winter season as mentioned before
JPEGs capture incredible detail even in
slightly overexposed sections of your
photos looking at the raw files we've
got a ton of data to play with for
editing purposely over exposing the
scene it's really no issue walking back
two and a half stops to recover almost
all of the info lost in highlights this
phone is a monster
former offering settings and modes which
rival standalone cameras but this
strength is also the mates biggest
weakness this app is complicated sliding
gestures settings which live in some
modes but not others I've been shooting
with this phone for months and I still
find myself occasionally missing an
option or mode the consumers who opt for
this phone should give themselves a
little time to work out all the
memorizing for where their favorite
features are located we also faced a
mean little gremlin with the manual
focus not remembering the focus from
shot to shot trying to take a long
exposure after adjusting the ISO we'd
routinely have to refocus the shot which
was really annoying moving on post
software update while we focused on zoom
performance in the new hybrid 6 X zoom
is something of a mixed bag sliding into
a 2 X zoom the phone software processing
easily competes with the iPhone 7 + is
hardware zoom of pushing beyond that
territory we are running into the limits
of what this lens and sensor can resolve
and output starts to look like the same
crops we might get from other devices in
good light with a steady hand you can
use this to get some impressive macro
shots though and as this is a software
scan from a larger camera sensor
nighttime shots come out a lot better
than on Apple's smaller sensor zoom
solution speaking of macro performance
the mates minimum focusing distance is
on par with other high-end phones the
slightly smaller f 2.2 aperture delivers
competitive background blur naturally
and it's easy to create some vocÃª balls
using the manual focus of course two
camera sensors using the same focal
length lenses deliver excellent depth
information the mate 9 is the undisputed
champ of software blur far more flexible
than Apple's portrait mode better in the
light better in close-up and allowing
users to adjust blur after the shots
been taken it's a fantastically fun
feature to play with and only seems to
get confused when pushing small details
to their limits it won't unseat a DSLR
with a fast prime but it gets you pretty
darn close focusing action is smooth and
reliable but the mate won't go down is a
speed champion it was rare we'd find a
photo miss focused but we do wish this
phone would roll onto your subject just
a little bit faster now Huawei and like
I have spruce
up HDR output now more noticeably
different from standard auto photos we
get a bit more of the processed look now
pulling down highlights juicing up
colors capture is a little on the slow
side though this flower in wind was
blowing around too much to achieve a
clear capture in addition to HDR we also
get quick toggles for color filters
aggressively boosting saturation and
contrast while also doing a little
vignette except menu options from these
other filters where we have to slide a
menu over to get HDR but if you want
that hyped up picture look say from a
Samsung circa Galaxy s3 you can get your
hyper color action on unfortunately the
mate doesn't seem to have quite the same
panorama prowess as the p9 did in this
busy scene we see lots of stitching
breaks and I hate taking selfies but the
mate packs and upper pack performer I've
solid output in bright light and shade
we get a solid if a bit shaky 1080p
video another area improved post update
is low-light performance the algorithms
for cleaning noise out of nighttime
shots are well improved dual sensors
plus Hardware image stabilization
deliver easy handheld shots and street
scenes a creepy tunnel shows off
terrific lens quality some flaring and a
little optical distortion but a top-tier
performer our creepy gate almost
perfectly nails the yellow light and the
exposure spot-on for how dim the scene
really is it's the last time we'll see
this walkway the phone easily delineates
between these two bulbs though the hot
spots under each bulb are a touch larger
than I'd like and this weird plant thing
and almost no light wonderfully captured
considering the phone was handheld the
cool thing about the layout for these
sensors a blind rear camera selfie is
really easy you just make eye contact
with the camera and you're pretty well
lined up and lastly if you give me
manual controls I'll never get tired of
shooting some long exposure streaking
taillights the phone has a light
painting mode which builds light streaks
like a video but honestly the exposure
just looks more natural from using a
longer shutter speed moving over to
video it's significantly improved over
previous Huawei's now capable of
capturing you HD resolution with
Hardware stabilization the
uses h.265 compression to deliver
significantly smaller file sizes than
most other phones while maintaining a
crisp colorful contrast II output color
processing feels similar to photos
though we don't seem to benefit from
both sensors in the same way it's likely
too difficult to balance the sensors and
process high resolution video so it's a
bit easier to blow out highlights and
bright conditions nice shots look
wonderful the mate is not afraid of
noise and these shots have quite a bit
of texture but output is detailed and
we're preserving info over using too
heavy a hand in noise reduction in in
video we can get a better look at image
stabilization but it feels a bit
first-generation still this is shaky
your output than what you'll find on
many other competitors even when trying
to hold still this video still feels
pretty lively while walking the lens is
able to help rein in footfalls but it's
not capable of delivering that Steadicam
feel when shooting 1080p you can use a
hybrid software + Hardware stabilization
but this is a perfect example of why I
usually don't like mixing stabilizations
the lens is moving creating subtle
warping and distortion then the software
tries to crop the scene around those
movements and the final output is
disjoint it some pieces of the scene
seemingly moving independently of others
I think you're better off just shooting
UHD or disabling software stabilization
the audio game is on point though
high-quality capture with even-handed
noise reduction over this freeway we
were in the middle of a windstorm that
was physically moving me around
get the phone manage to reduce wind
noise and still preserve some audio from
the scene
in our night time Street shot after the
winds had calmed down we hear a
delicious difference between a bus and a
throaty muscle car
it's not as robust as in LGV 20 but
hallways audio solution is very well
done indeed
checking out an exposure test moving
from dark to bright and back the phone
blooms nicely in making adjustments
moving to brighter conditions feels a
bit more aggressive as the shutter speed
changes but this is one of the better
performers of the year and adjusting to
changing light conditions
lastly slow motion video is difficult to
pin down the phone shoots a 120 frames
per second 1080p but when you save the
file to watch on another device it kind
of wrecks the quality if we take the raw
120 frame per second video and stretch
it in a video editor it looks a lot
better hopefully something Huawei can
address in a future software update so
let's wrap this up where's that leave us
with the cameras on the huawei mate 9
this phone is not for the faint of heart
this is the most complicated phone
shooter we've yet reviewed and the
learning curve here is the steepest
we've yet encountered it's not that any
individual mode is difficult to use more
that learning to navigate the app takes
a while as menus and settings are spread
out over multiple areas in the moment
when you just need to capture a shot
this phone requires more brute force
memorization to really take advantage of
everything it has to offer the mate 9
will go down is one of my personal
favorite phone cameras of 2016 but it
also tops the list as the most
intimidating to new users we think the
time investment is worth it though this
fund produces unique still photos and
going back over our samples has been a
joy as is the improved video it could
still use a bit more polish but Huawei
is much improved here as well and we're
just happy to see the attention this
phone has recently received where the
mate was a solid option out of the box
this recent update really has improved
low-light processing
we're hopeful that quali will continue
to refine as the owners learn more about
the phone they purchased it's not the
easiest beast to tame but we think it's
worth it when you do as always thanks so
