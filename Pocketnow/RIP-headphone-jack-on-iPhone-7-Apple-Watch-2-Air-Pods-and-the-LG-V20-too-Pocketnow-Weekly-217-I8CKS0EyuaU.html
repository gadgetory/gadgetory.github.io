companies Apple had the courage to
remove one of the most standardized
cable ports ever created
from the new iPhone 7 the Apple watch 2
won't turn any heads in terms of design
so will people buy it the air plants
feature some incredible audio technology
but will folks adopt that commander
Uhura Trekkie look or if Apple isn't
your flavor we also have this beast of a
phone to talk about called the LGV 20
these stories plus we're answering your
questions from Twitter and the live chat
so make sure you're charged and ready
for episode 2 1/7 of the PocketNow
weekly others weekly podcast is where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets that
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets and wearables it's all the stuff
you wished existed when you were a kid
and the term earPod sounded like
something which would have required a
visit to the school nurse a senior
editor of pocketnow.com blasting this
signal from sunny Southern California
fresh from his trip back from Berlin and
were joined this week by the man the
myth the legend mr. high made it ivenna
I'm really happy that you're fresh dude
I am still nah yeah I was I should have
put fresh in giant bunny rabbit ear
votes there it's I'm still recovering
from from that massive trip over it over
to Berlin and are all of our exciting
coverage from the ephah 2016 show for oh
yeah
and of course we're also joined by
plucky podcast producer mr. Jules Wong
how's it going out on the east coast
there buddy boy I feel like a frozen TV
meal right now yeah yeah that's my boy
nice and cold I guess that's the point
me first it's not really first now is it
in Boston here in New York it's um it's
not Chloe it's it's hot all the way down
the seaboard so that humid weather and I
suppose it's just so fine and SoCal
right now feels like home yeah well
actually you know what is it what we're
doing this is actually gonna be one of
the warmer days of the week before we
hit like a nice little sort of as
to fall as we're gonna get here in
Southern California so I think it's
gonna hit a high in 90 today so that's
not too bad that's enjoy deliciousness
and joy yeah so folks um before we get
into tech tomfoolery Mr Wong would you
be so kind as to explain how people will
be get a ballista the so especially
considering all of the changes that
we're trying to troubleshoot while
producing this show in real time
I was about to pretend that blast 15
minutes did not happen in this timeframe
but know what it's just been fun getting
through my problems
feedback all that it cut this time but
YouTube I might you know if you're
listening to this and was in the podcast
the audio podcast I'm gonna step this
all the way in the back so that you can
find out yourself what's going on but
anyways you can also give us live
feedback if you're here in the video
lands just head on over to our Twitter
page
and tweet at us with the hashtag P and
weekly and just go at it crazy we're
talking LG we're talking Apple looking
the iPhone 7 and V 20 today so tweets
about those very pertinent very useful
to us and we'd appreciate those and if
you can't come in if you are listening
as I said post Morton mortem is that is
that a term I can use here post more
than a share in a podcast at
pocketnow.com and send away any emails
that you may wish or us to answer yeah
we already have a couple PN weekly
comments because I mentioned commander
Uhura in regards to the air pods we Col
Joseph P and weekly had a Star Trek 50
reference and Andrew Wallace mister at
fat produce everyone should be wearing
Star Trek shirts and of course here I am
rocking my Star Trek shirts
I need invest in like matching well we
would have to decide which Trek you know
well I'm wearing a
SuperMario t-shirt by the way oh you're
gonna do Super Mario instead oh yeah
yeah no can you see though yeah yeah
that's cool
that's what the hidden coin the hidden
coins oh yeah so the picture the t-shirt
is an American flag and can you describe
what's at the bottom corner wait
it's flame thrower Mario about to over
uh he's stomping over a coin box we're
just part of the flag because the flag
is made of bricks just like old Mario
one good we have - Mario we have to
commemorate Mario reaching iOS yeah well
definitely something that I want to talk
let's jump in right there because I
think that was actually a really huge
piece of news that I was kind of
disappointed didn't get like a big
reaction from people so I tweeted out
like this is a huge deal Mario and iOS
and a lot of people sort of shrugged and
like I don't think you guys understand
even though this is just a silly little
running game this is like one of the
biggest licensing meet multimedia deals
in the history of licensing IP on
different platen on Nintendo stuff no I
feel that Apple Apple simply owned it I
you know I feel that if they would have
left this announcement for the for the
end it wouldn't have had the same effect
you heard the crowd the crowd went wild
not everybody went nuts and why because
I mean we all probably Mario is not as
relevant for newer generations as it was
for us thanks for us weaker I don't know
I don't know I do know that hey my kids
love playing Super Smash Brothers but
it's because they still have a you know
they still have a week because I've
always felt the min Tendo has been more
of a kids you know they've always been
more family like I think that the
gameplay dynamics and just the whole
theme of Super Mario Galaxy those games
for the Wii I've just been you know
we've been able to be revolutionized
have you know just reintroduce Mario to
our young
kids so yeah I think I agree that it's
the room
exactement Riverland so it's the reason
why my kids have a weed but I don't know
it's not the same case of every
generation you know right now we're in
the PlayStation and Xbox generation
where Mario is irrelevant where Nintendo
is dying and obviously Nintendo is
making this move because they need that
relevance again and you know I think
that sim cook started the okay so this
is a funny this is a very interesting
fun fact about tradeshow coverage a tifo
with one I have never met an individual
that plays more games with his phone
than one true sorry I like so I like
playing games but I've always been like
for example I have to be carrying a Moga
around I love controllers yeah I love
the concept of controllers and I don't
like not being able to touch to feel the
buttons and so I've always been a gaming
controller user and because I did not
bring the Moga I simply did not play
anything but my god you know it's this
is I think Tim Cook had a point where he
said you know the largest gaming
platform right now or mobile devices
true and you know I think I think that
whether a Nintendo likes it or not even
if they're the medium or not the medium
it doesn't really matter what's
important is for these brands to not die
off over the necessity to keep written
in Tendo being a relevant brand where
Mario on its own is a brand yeah with or
without Nintendo well but I think also
imagine happening here in introducing
Mario to other generations this is one
of those opportunities for Nintendo to
show that this character is still
relevant and especially in the fact that
Nintendo hasn't had quite the same
strength of hardware and console sales
they've had in the past I think this was
a brilliant strategy to bring these two
together and answering some of the
questions we have in the live chat and
also Joel G Joseph on Twitter using PN
weekly the PN weekly hashtag lil Mario
beyond Android at all or is it Apple
only and from what I understood this is
an EXO window for iOS not exclusivity
yeah it's limited and it's going to be
on Android at some point but until that
point which we do not know if this game
called Super Mario run basically you
know it's more it's a more fleshed out
platformer 2d platformer than other
thing I mean we're talking about
competitive one-on-one competitive
competition what game is this just think
about it think about and where did it
order the inspiration no no where did it
pull the inspiration 10 flappy bird you
told me this is pretty much flappy bird
oh you think this looks like Mario
temple run to me think about it this is
flappy bird what all you're doing is
pushing tapping on a display for Mario
to jump it's pretty much flappy bird
they're just pulling on that concept and
that's and that's what they're building
upon I was trying to write news pieces
around this and not looking at the video
game footage so take a second just to
check it out but know is especially in
AI I think when we saw what happened
with pokemons go we got a clear
indication that this isn't just a fad
this wasn't just some sort of experiment
that this was a very successful way to
bring content based on a certain
intellectual property to different
markets into different handsets into
different devices and so I you know I'm
not shocked that Nintendo made the move
to eventually bring Mario to mobile
phones I'm actually surprised it
happened so quickly then from the front
Pokemon go and I'm sure they've been
working on this for a little while but
from Pokemon go that the next property
that they were ready to release was
probably the biggest icon of the
Nintendo platform in Super Mario yeah I
agree I I think I would be surprised
because I mean that you didn't dislike
it zelda or you know metroid you didn't
try and slow play it you went to the big
dog from mario gonna see what else they
can follow it up with nintendo is the
most agnostic out of the major gaming
console companies i mean you have sony
and they have their own interests in
mobile and yes microsoft they talk about
their own this terrible as both are
nintendo seems to me getting away
Wow you're just heading off any
potential like Sohni iron you know
instead of getting bogged down in that
let's let's shift gears here I know we
sort of got a little off topic or a
little out of out of order but I want to
start the show off with because people
are already asking me a ton of questions
about this let's move and see if we
can't chat about the LGV 20 let's knock
that out since we have the the one major
phone announcement from LG this week
already getting so from Andrew Wallace
at fat produce asking if this is going
to be my new spirit phone or there's a
huge fan of the v10 last year so we got
a little hands-on time with the the V 20
it was definitely a pre-release
pre-release product that we did most of
our initial testing and first
impressions on so we're gonna we're
gonna have to shift some of that
commentary over once we finally get
retail units coming up soon but you know
we do have videos out comparing the v-22
the v10 the g5 then doing a full camera
tour full audio tour you can catch all
of those videos on pocketnow.com or on
youtube.com slash pocket now and I
because you were off covering the axon 7
mini while I was spending a little time
with the V 20 I really just kind of
wanted to get your impressions I'm a on
what you think on how you feel about
LG's reveal here this was a very busy
season for LG a very busy window for LG
to drop their second phone of the year
against announcements from Aoife note 7
news there was a lot of that and then
the next day talk and iPhone so this is
funny Tony reaches out to me and he's
like so who do you want to do the LGB 20
coverage and I'm like why and he's like
well because one really wants to review
that phone and that he looks at me and
he stares at me I mean one really really
really wants to review that phone I
don't know the different every leaves in
that and so I'm like are you sure he
really wants to go because he does let's
yeah I don't want to go it
so I I guess I was really just to give
an idea my favorite phone last year was
the LG g4 um I did not spend enough time
with the v10 because by the time I was
able to get my v10 unit in January it
was already galaxy s7 season yeah that's
true I I wasn't really able to play with
it like Jules you were the one that
received one of our units I think well I
know actually not unit and I guess
everyone would you know Michael Fisher
who back then was kind of incapacitated
because he was dealing with the Lumia
and the Prive so I would basically like
to do my review on on my unit and also I
interesting fact I actually broke two
units the screens I mean that's
impressive what screen repairs because
apparently you should never shoot
review videos outside or on gravel in
case you wanted but so the thing is I
obviously I was it's not until I was
really exposed to the phone that I
really I feel that LG really did not
show off everything that the v10 was for
me my top of mine of the v10 last year
was it's got a dual screen and I guess
that's all for me I guess LG did not do
a really good job at telling us it's the
same great camera of the g4 but you've
got you know an audio tag that you won't
hear on it on any other phone you've got
milspec milspec protection it's a I
didn't wear any I mean it was imaged by
carriers as you know is they were kind
of a you know stricken between
multimedia which was a t-mobile's angle
and then you know multitasking
productivity because of the second
screen you know it's the most it's the
most visually eye catching thing about
it and then most people were
disappointed because it had the
Snapdragon 808 and so and so 64 gigs of
storage natively I am for giggling man I
know but I feel I feel that I feel that
LG kind of did that same mistake this
here um I feel that the company could
have looked for a better window to
announce it absolutely something they
would have not stolen the thunder of the
stone because honestly after seeing once
coverage and everything I was like oh
wow
I wish I would have gone with you like
this Phil looks really really cool I
really wanted the g5 to be my phone of
the year because of that dual camera
approach you know I was at the
presentation of the g5 and I was totally
sold by the presentation and sadly the
phone I remember when I unboxed the
phone dude I set an alarm because I knew
the phone was gonna be an early arrival
on UPS I knew that that phone was gonna
be here at 7:00 a.m. I sit in the lawn
for six I was like I want to be ready
it's not because I wanted to do that
unboxing or anything it wasn't that I
really really really wanted that g5 and
then I pull it out and the thing just
scratch my hand and I'm like what I'm
like what and so I guess this is the g5
that I would have wanted it's a little
impression the finest compression I'm
just I'm just hoping we get two units
one so that you so that you're not the
only one that gets all the fun three
units make it three come on it's like so
LG we're gonna need a dozen LG villains
to properly conduct all of our reviews
and tests but I guess the point that I'm
trying to make is I feel that this phone
is being underestimated um after
everything you showed off at the video
especially the whole quad acting and
everything you know I feel that this
film deserved more limelight it deserved
more predominance and I don't know I I
hope that it doesn't end up being just
another v10 for LG where people didn't
really care much about it even though it
was a great phone you know I have to say
that was one of the one of the
interesting and I don't want to use a
word like concerning but you're sort of
a troubling aspect of the conversation
when we were bouncing messages between
us and LG PR that their expectations on
this phone are very low in terms of
overall sales and then how different
markets might be on itself like we're
hearing you know it's probably gonna be
slow played in Europe if it ever gets
released there at all and then
um that the carriers are exerting a lot
of influence over what features or
accessories might be included so like in
the United States we might not get those
bno earbuds
yeah just like we didn't get the AKG
earbud so if you had a south korean v10
like i do you got these amazing AKG
earbuds in with the phone if you got
your v10 through t-mobile that was gone
and so when when we look at those all of
those influences coming together all
those aspects coming together and
especially what you because I completely
agree with you Jaime I feel like LG's
messaging on this phone isn't on point
they're not really getting across what
makes this device special mom I feel
like we're probably in store for another
fan favorite device like if you're a fan
of this phone you will know about it you
will be passionate about it but it's
gonna barely scratch and yeah yeah well
let me be a little bit outside loop here
because I haven't touched the phone I
even for even you know thought of the
phone for a little bit since the events
that night when all the embargoes went
up so the you know news coverage
business and I'm talking about business
press here so Reuters and CNBC and all
that and even like some of the
mainstream like local stations CNN you
know some of the feeds even deigned to
mention the LG v-22 even mention this
launch and you know why they mentioned
this launch it was in the face of the
galaxy note 7 and it's battery recall
and combine that with the fact that LG
is trying to remake itself after the
horror horrible g5 sales performance
this is what people are somewhat paying
attention to now they're starting to pay
attention to the LG v 20 and I think LG
does have a more cohesive message this
time around because we've seen a
concerted effort with Joseph
gordon-levitt and his hit recording hit
record Joe yeah hey there paper core Joe
more multi hit record sorry Joseph
gordon-levitt is behind it record and
they were responsible for that v10 ad
with people like whistling sort of a
day-in-the-life kind of stuff yeah daily
music that you create and so they're
gonna be I actually saw the the if you
go to hit record you can actually see
the project that they're creating that
they're gonna be working the v20 into
also so a little things like that really
did help sort of bring exposure to the
v10 but I kind of feel stuff like that
still falls into the same trap that we
saw with the g5 advertising this year
where it's really neat that you gave me
Jason Statham in a wig and a dress
riding a motorcycle why is that neat
because it's Jason Statham so that is
neat but you told me nothing about the
phone outside of some wacky random stuff
that you just awful though but and again
again in getting across to consumers why
would you consider this phone what would
what would be the the killer app for
someone considering this phone
especially since that conversation is a
bit more focused on the V this is I
don't believe LG has any illusions of
this being some sort of widely accepted
soft around the edges all-rounder good
enough at everything kind of device I
still expect that even with some of the
improvements to the battery capacity and
we get a more power efficient and more
powerful processor this probably will
not be a battery champ this will be a
hard on the rails content creation and
multimedia consumption device those two
focuses taking us outside of the normal
sort of well the note is good for
overall productivity and the Galaxy S is
sort of an all-rounder and the iPhone is
good at everything
I think LG has a winner here if they're
nailing this demographic but I don't
feel they're reaching that Democrat yeah
the problem is the problem is marketing
I'm gonna take you back to the old Beach
audio ads pre Apple this is free Apple
you would see up these are either soccer
players or baseball players or
basketball players exiting a room where
they're they're full of the press the
press is complaining about something or
asking them information and they just
don't want to comment they don't want to
comment and all they do is put on their
Beats headphones in their ears
everything goes blank and they start
playing music so what do they what did
beats say with that ad it doesn't matter
what noise you're hearing beside you you
put on your beats in the world goes away
all right so I'll counter that with the
iPod heads which were which were well
into the iPods um I don't know life
cycle and we saw these stupid ads of
people's silhouettes dancing in you know
colorful backgrounds but that's that's
one of the most iconic ads why it wasn't
because of the black silhouettes dude
what color are the headphones that
you're wearing right now or what color
the headphones are pretty much almost
every phone that launches with included
in there the color of white headphones
he's wearing really wide oh they're
white what the whole idea was to create
a brand around wearing white headphones
and back in the day the only way you can
get white headphones was with an iPod
why the black silhouette it was because
they didn't want to deter so what's the
problem with I don't even get the whole
white ear from one thing in the first
place you're complaining about a Jason
Statham ad that is diluting the whole
limelight of the g5 what they did with
the iPod ads was simply let's remove
whatever artists we can put here or
whatever dancer we can put here because
it's not about them the ad is about the
iPod the triad is about making the iPod
look hip when you look at iPad ads what
do you see you see people working with a
tablet in so many different ways and
even though I still debate if the iPad
is good enough for work it's what I'm
using to record this this the audio for
oh come on I'm not the average consumer
I'm sorry people like the conversations
we need to have in terms of outreach
well is I because I completely agree
with Jaime here I think the least
successful ads are the ones that focus
on making celebrities do wacky the mana
robert downey jr that that's not an ad
and i have to say that the only company
that I think has actually successfully
given me a celebrity focused ad with
Samsung this year whoa Mike what's God
pouring champagne on his I had a number
of people in my circus family and
friends who didn't know who that guy was
by the waltz the Christoph Waltz oh yeah
what all of these things have in common
all these ads is that they focus on one
USP unique selling point and have some
Korean of some celebrity really hammered
home any like relatable person and well
I I'd argue that with Jason Statham he
wasn't one person he was 50 billion in
that in those 30 seconds and I had sort
of deleted from the point and you know
what that was fun but with you know we
haven't seen any you know campaign with
LG you know and it's v20 just yet maybe
the the whole you know social media you
know living life and looking at things
is great you know arts kind of thing is
gonna be great for them yeah it from
from some some grassroots conversation
Joe G Joseph using the P n weekly
hashtag he also put in hash tag no case
life he's referencing the more rugged
build construction on the v-series
phones oh yeah 810 a transit drop
complaints that's right so you know
we're gonna begin by applying battery
cover complied have you guys seen the
Android authority drop test for the oh
my god like that battery cover like flew
off on every single oh I don't think
that's a bad thing I really want my size
right my okay no I'm just gonna say you
know there are
number of different approaches that we
can we can utilize when it comes to
device integrity and you know what like
for example the Flex is an interesting
idea from LG in terms of making a more
durable device because the entire phone
casing can bend yeah you can still
shatter that screen but you have to
really requires a different type of drop
than a glass screen will so when you've
got a device where the force of an
impact can cause the battery to eject
that's the force of the impact causing
the battery to object if that device is
sealed up there is the potential that
the force of that impact is going to
ripple through other components where
that energy can be expressed in
different ways so it's not necessarily I
mean it looks terrible it obvious it
totally does but it's not necessarily a
bad thing if your phone flies to pieces
on those pieces that are supposed to
come off of the phone yeah I can just I
can just see the moment when people are
like shoot my battery just fell on the
sewer hole wait let's let's leave that
conversation for the air pot shall we
yeah go ahead Jules no I was just about
to say I do like the whole new approach
that it LT took to the bill old a little
more silicon-silicon for the back it's a
magnesium aluminium alloy and then the
corners are silicon with an E carbonate
so that it's more shock absorbent yeah
radio session and shock absorbent 20%
more than previous supplier nouns
computers will miss the steel rails from
the LG v10 I thought that was a sharp
look but all in all I know we've been
getting a lot of comments on the videos
on on our YouTube channel that the the
design is super ugly and I'm I kind of
find it try it on under like a
blackberry and a Motorola had a baby and
it ended up looking like an old ThinkPad
and those are some of my favorite
business looking devices I think it
looks sharp I think it looks clean
and we haven't even touched the software
I don't know how because because I want
to say and I really want to be clear
here we did our testing on pre-release
software very early pre-release software
so I have to believe that LG is going to
provide us with the ability to replace
the app drawer just like they did with
the g5 right now the current skin is
very much like an LG flavor of emui from
Huawei you have no app drawer just
everything's on your homescreen I would
argue about that with the aperture is
that Google's in apps as function is
meant to sort of be the replacement to
that it's just when it comes to
organizing everything I think there
gonna be some old fogies like me that
really like the metaphor of shortcuts
when I need them for most commonly used
things and then app drawer for dumping
everything else in and then there's a
guy like me who prefers not to dig
through the app drawer and organize
things and folders it's exactly such a
funny such in such a wide world of
different opinions and cultures and
people's coming together but you know
we're gonna be digging in super deep on
the LGV 20 the real camera review we're
gonna be throwing it through some of our
exacting headphone audio tests see
what's up with all of those quad Dax and
amps and whatnot and then a whole slate
of comparisons once we have the final
release version of the V 20 in our hot
little hands hopefully we can get one
for Jaime too because I'd love to do
sort of like a compare and contrast like
see how you feel especially opposite the
pixels that are going to be coming out
the the new iPhones that we're gonna
shift over to serve and I think there is
an interesting fight to be had between a
phone like the note 7 which represents
sort of the pinnacle the top-tier most
expensive and most sort of feature
complete idea of a phone from Samsung
they would expose well yeah first is
something like the V 20 which I don't
think that LG is looking at this to be
the winner for everybody I think LG
really is trying to focus this down into
a slightly narrower demographic and
those two fighting especially if the
different price points that we're seeing
and almost $900 phone versus I think
t-mobile listed it early for their
pre-orders at 600 you know do you really
get
two hundred and eighty dollars more
phone on something like the note seven
if what you care about is photography
and multimedia so definitely a lot of
questions we're gonna be digging into a
lot of coverage that we're gonna leave
but I think we need to shift gears now
and talk about the other major series of
announcements it came out of Cupertino
and of course Apple took the wraps off
of iPhones and Apple watches and ear
pods and stuff so we're all really
excited about that whoo those three ones
joining me on a whoo no weird no let's
start off let's drive with the biggie
let's start off with a major
announcement obviously I think what we
were all hoping to see and get good info
on was the iPhone 7 in the iPhone 7 plus
we have two iPhone models all of those
early rumors surrounding a potential
iPhone Pro obviously that didn't pan out
we've got these the the same smaller and
bigger general form factors but we see I
think a top-to-bottom approach to
reengineering the casing and touching up
some of those technology issues that you
know Android and Windows Phone fans have
been kind of hammering Apple about in
over the last year in terms of bringing
the iPhone into more current territory
against against competitors yeah well I
would only argue that that would be for
the jet black even though a lot of
resistance has been a black I pulled off
on arguments tools let's just talk
through the iPhone first so that we can
share what device is actually well we
went into arguments about Mario and the
LGV 20 before we go into the it's okay
mr. kuffs ready iPhone 7 what are your
thoughts oh my god I think this is the
first time I have been excited over an
iPhone since the iPhone 5s I remember
that in the case of the iPhone 5s it was
that fingerprint scanner we have seen
fingerprint scanners for years we have
to remember back then no company had
implemented it well and I just saw so
much potential in the whole concept of
that plus the larger pixels on the
camera
I've always the main reason why I've
always been an iPhone user is because
well number one it was I've made the
jump since the iPhone 3GS and I've just
followed that
but it's also because it's also because
I've always had to carry two phones and
before that I had to carry a telephone a
cellphone and the PDA and so I always
like to have a small unit to be my phone
and obviously the PDA and usually what I
would do is I would have an iPhone and a
note so it would be whatever current
iPhone it was the smaller variant plus a
galaxy note since galaxy note 2 I've
been a note user an Oracle user forever
but this is the first time ever that I
am really enticed over that iPhone 7
plus nice I am for a couple of reasons
number one the whole approach to the
dual camera I can't think of how many
times I've been in situations where
there's a photo that I want to grab and
you guys know that I do love to do a lot
I do love photography and even though
I'm not a professional photographer not
even close to that I do like to play
around a lot with photos and like for
example we were we were at Checkpoint
Charlie one yeah the photo that I wanted
to take at Checkpoint Charlie was
actually closer than the one that I
published on Instagram the problem is I
couldn't get any closer right and and
you know obviously if I digitally zoom
to it you crop it in I I was gonna crop
it in I was gonna lose detail and I hate
zooming into photos because of that crop
that's generated a software never does
it well enough obviously because we've
we've blown into a trend of lesser
megapixels in cameras in order for these
pixels to have larger microns now this
actually hasn't played well over over
this year particularly so I'm really
looking forward to see how Apple plays
off that topic of zoom because I can
tell you many times where I really don't
want to crop into photos but I really
don't want it I have no way of zooming
in and I really don't want to carry the
bulk of an extra lens or one of those
old clips or stuff like that I don't
want to I don't want to fumble with any
of those things I just care about that
number one number two you know the are
whether we like it or not the iPhone 6s
the iPhone 6s plus and the 6 plus were
the battery life kings
and I've been really disappointed with
the galaxy note 7 mainly because of its
battery life I feel that if every other
phablet in the market has really focused
a lot on on providing a ton of features
but not improving one of the main
reasons why the phablet market became so
famous years ago if you guys remember
the Galaxy Note 3 was the king of
battery life back in the day that
Snapdragon 800 processor I mean the
phone was it was amazing for tradeshow
coverage and everything and now you and
I have to be hauling battery packs
everywhere we go because these phones
are just not reliable enough so I'm
really I'm really excited about the
iPhone 7 plus like I haven't been over
any other iPhone in the past for those
two particular reasons I really want to
get a look try to that camera and then
you get the 5.5 inch model and just
stuff it down your pants well I already
I already do that with with a note you
know that I really did I did a
comparison between the galaxy note 7 and
the galaxy and the iPhone 6s plus the
size difference is not substantial I do
feel that I do feel that Apple could do
a better job designing it like for
example I mean screen I plan on Android
versus on iOS that's a big difference
look at the size of my hands and I can't
even touch the power button I feel that
Apple I mean come on Apple well the
criticisms of the the fact that it is a
5.5 inch screen in something that is
normally in the size surface area
territory of phones with you know five
point seven and yet almost 6 inch
screens in some cases depending on how
they build in bezel space you look on
cramming that stuff in it's it's amazing
the seeing I have to say like this year
for Apple in me has actually been pretty
positive I know a lot of people and
likely a lot of people are gonna hammer
me on this in the live chat is I thought
the iPhone se was a really smart reply
to this market of $400 phones is
starting to creep up you're never gonna
fully escape the Apple tax but I have so
many members of my my family who are
actually really excited about a phone
that can replace their iPhone 5s and
that they don't have to buy new cases
for but they get the you know
better camera and a faster processor and
a better fingerprint sensor so now
moving into the iPhone 7 I'm happy to
see some style issues addressed I don't
love the look of the antenna bands on
the pink and silver version
they're terrible hazard white cutouts
that don't unless you get jet black
unless you get black mmm you know that's
the only phone that's gonna do a better
job with that and obviously the matte
black which is the other option
don't don't we feel that this is a
little uncharacteristic is I'm gonna
start with just the fashion side of this
cuz Apple really has built themselves up
into a lifestyle brand more than a tech
first company yeah don't we feel that
this is kind of an uncharacteristic
misstep for those versions of the iPhone
where wouldn't it make more sense to
make those bands more in keeping with
the color of the phone like how that
bands on the rose gold version
I've been done fighting about antenna
bands and design with Apple they they
gave us black bands on the black iPhone
and I think that was just to remember
the launch of the iPhone 3GS if you
wanted to get the white I phoned 3GS you
had to go for the 32 gigabyte model it
was only available in that variant and
it sold out like immediately there
they're just making one model more
aspirational than the other that's what
they're doing well that's that's what
you know and your model is more than a
technology company right every new
season brings that season's variant you
know like thank you for this season is
is rose gold new for this season is
right no jet black but what is why
that's been step no no but what my point
is why produce an iPhone in pink and
have these weird non completed and tena
band line that also are not pink that to
me is obviously the probably probably
the material doesn't look good and think
I mean probably accept colors you're
like it's not really biggest most ideal
thing but but ultimately though when
when we're actually talking about the
tech and I actually wrote an editorial
on this on on pocket now is there are so
many little tech aspects and lifestyle
aspects on this phone
that like the iPhone se I'm feeling very
positive about this iPhone even though I
am not particularly an iOS fan I'm
really curious to play with Apple's
approach to a dual-camera sensor
obviously we've been looking at dual
camera sensors in real consumer facing
products since HTC delivered 3d on an
Evo and then moved to dual sensors on
the m8 and then Huawei has how does a
different approach to the p9 where both
of the sensors have the same focal
length and now we're looking at Apple
carrying on in the same conversation
that LG had this year where the two
sensors have different focal lengths so
you have a normal field of view and a
really really wide field of view Apple's
approach obviously being a normal field
of view and then giving us a 2x zoom so
we've got a in 56 and I agree I think um
Panther Zi is asking the right question
with the Korean weekly hashtag is a 2 X
zoom really as zoom worth mentioning or
is it in my case is it is it even worth
you know having that extra benefit of
just you know at 2 X's you know when you
were composing your shot at Checkpoint
Charlie and we were dodging that
McDonald's with all of their checkpoint
cheesy signs I really wanted to get that
KFC dude I was crazy about getting rid
of but it's you know that this so this
is the problem why did I like the LG g5
so much I mean they made that they made
a compelling point over a wide-angle
lens being so useful to you because
there are places like for example in
Barcelona you want to take a photo of
Saigon familia there is a point where
there's a fence behind you you just
cannot go back and if you want to take a
photo of the full church it would
involve trees if you can't walk any
further back so in the case of the I've
also been met with cases where I really
want to take a cool photo of something
that's far away and so here's the thing
there is a 2 X optical zoom
but apparently Apple has and you know
Apple has been famous for the way they
play around with their cameras I'll give
you I'll give you a perfect example the
iPhone 6 had zero stabilization I could
I could go out running with the iPhone 6
it was very rare in Guatemala that
there's a specific volcano that emerges
in
early in the morning and it only happens
certain days of the week depending on
the amount of humidity obviously I
didn't want to stop running but I really
wanted to take a photo of damn okay no
okay I would pull up the phone in a life
proof running I run at eight thirty
minutes four minutes per mile
which is you know not slow but yeah a
thirty good clip yeah it was not slow I
would pull out the phone like this
running take the shot put it back in
finish my run and I knew that the photo
would be stable
how did Apple pull that off I have no
clue with no stabilization so I you know
they are offering up to ten exhume in a
sort of a software play that they're
gonna be doing with both lenses how are
they gonna pull it off I don't know
that's the reason why I'm like I'm
curious I cannot wait to get my unit and
give it a try and you're gonna be doing
that real camera review as well one I'm
sure I'm sure that there will be you
know more of a I'm sure that there will
be use of scenarios where we'll find the
need for it and you know for me I would
rather have have it than not have it at
all I mean for $100 more if I can get
all these features I would have
preferred obviously to have them on the
smaller iPhone as well but if I have to
go plus the if I have thick let's try I
will I've been I found myself in cases
where I need the zoom and it's not there
you have to walk into that and you know
there are cases where you're gonna get
run over by a car or something if you do
well I don't want what I don't want this
to be is a token implementation because
first of all you're taking two shots at
once with both cameras so it wouldn't
you if you're taking one picture you're
actually taking two and the software is
that you know you when you're pinching
the zoom you know you'll still you'll be
on that first wider angle picture when
you zoom in and I want you to hit 2x you
get sent to the would be like oh geez
where you know you can zoom in and it's
a digital crop and then once you start
pulling back out again once you hit a
certain threshold it pops you over to
the wide-angle camera too and that
purpose I think I think it doesn't you
know 2x is inadequate because you know
you still get you know a very decent
detail up until May
3 or 4 X so why not do you know go
farther instead I know I think so I
think so and it doesn't I know you know
glass you know glass maybe for them
because it 28 don't know how far you can
pull them my Mary Austin II how Apple is
going to handle things like low light I
know that that the telephoto lens has
less aperture as we really expected but
you know one of the main reasons why I
avoid zooming whenever I'm filming is
mainly because of that amount of
aperture that's lost whenever you start
zooming the lens closer to whatever
product that is you're reviewing and
there are stasis where I need the
low-light where I would rather approach
the subject just to you have that
low-light available to me so listen
Apple is not the company you know
they've done a few gimmicks last year
with the iPhone 6s still Apple is not
really famous for gimmicks they're
famous for you know trying things out
repeatedly until they get it right
before they launch it on a product so
again I've seen so many attempts at
optical zoom and they've either looked
terrible or the implementation has been
bad I mean I remember the Galaxy camera
you had the 10x optical it was 20x
optical zoom but then they use the
sensor of the galaxy s4
why don't you just you know sell me an
adapter for it and give me it was
terrible because of the sensor so I mean
Apple is investing a lot in the sensor
there is this new ISP that they're
calling the image since image what image
they gave a processor sensing processor
hey maybe we're in for a surprise I mean
Apple became really famous ever since
the iPhone 4 for image quality
it took competitors it literally took
Sam's I imagine iPhone 4 was 2010
Sampson wasn't really able to compete
against Apple in digital photography
until the galaxy s6 no I think the note
4 oh well the note 4 but it was a very
clunky camera but remember that you know
four it was fine it was a really slow
phone no nobody
the s6 only just brought back the
features from the note four there was a
little software polish but the no for
true but but but the difference between
them is four months in launch cycles
well yeah so just think about it that
was what 2014 it took Samsung four years
to catch up with Apple four years so I'm
curious to see what we get I guess well
and well not only curious but I cuz I'm
kind of with you I have every
expectation that this is gonna be a
really smooth performer that now we're
going to have access to other apps being
able to capture the raw data yeah that's
a really big deal I don't believe we'll
see that in the actual iPhone camera app
but just the fact that you'll have
access to it just like we see on a
number of Android phones you know the
stock camera app might not have the
ability to capture raw but you can still
get it if you use a third-party camera
app especially with the number of iPhone
third-party camera apps available so a
little little things like that I think
are gonna be nice updates for things
like content creation I of course
because we've been getting so many
comments about it we had to put it in
the name the title of this video I mean
how you feeling about losing the
headphone jack what do you think about
Apple's solution for I was
headphones in and then also maybe moving
customers over to a wireless standard
okay let's forget about the wireless
standard I am definitely not gonna spend
a dime on that I'll let you explain
first like so we got we've got ear pods
that are gonna come in the box that have
a lightning connector on them then
there's also going to be a lightning
connector adapter so that you can plug
in regular 3.5 millimeter headphone and
then one of the major announcements from
this show was a pair of bluetooth
wireless ear pods called air pods to
have these little white antennas that
stick out past your ears so that's what
you so you're saying I mean you you're
not you're not gonna touch those that's
not your jam that's not what you know so
here's the thing these are my Apple
earpods
the only reason I'm using them right now
is because these are my go-to headphones
for the Mac because I can control music
with them and I can control the volume
levels of the Mac with the controllers
but I never use the
headphones on an iPhone or on any
smartphone or on-the-go for many reasons
number one because my ears are
dramatically small and petite as they
are these air these ear pods are
constantly falling off my ear up to the
point where I have to be investing in
these gels you get it for $10 on Amazon
and showed diesels give you wings that
snap you know that snap the the ER
bought it to your ear so I can I I
tweeted about this when Apple announced
it at the twit you know the tweet blew
up because I was like I cannot wait to
lose my first ear paw air pod and I'm
just gonna lose one I'm sure that I'm
just gonna lose one not two right
because those things fall off I feel
that when it comes to economics it's
their terrible 169 dollars for a pair of
ear pods that are not organic at all I
mean either need to get your opinion on
this Jaime because you were the one on
the show floor I got to go visit them
but you you did this great video on
Jabra Jabra has a wireless ear pot
earbud solution and then also I think
Sony Labs is looking at coming up nobody
has that Samsung has their their icon X
um sadly I haven't been able to actually
try a pair ad from the Jabra I mean
genre I've been a jobber customer for
years but not for audio I've been a job
rep customer because I feel that they
make the best Fitness headphones ever
yeah or me because I sweat like a
machine and you know i I've invested in
bose you know out of my own money I've
paid for Bose Fitness headphones I've
paid for a lot of variants and none have
survived the way I sweat like Jabra have
you know they do amazing amazing water
resistance and they have great audio I
guess the problem with those with those
Jabra headphones is that they only have
three hours of battery life for me
that's terrible
yeah but the cool thing is you know you
know if they would tell me okay I'll
remove the heart rate monitor because I
really don't use it on a pair of
headphones I've already got my watch
doing it and both of them are just
accurate if you're not using a band on
your chest it's pointless yeah so I
would rather remove that our bad
in life but I love that these headphones
from Jabra have the wins that I'm
talking about so you're sure that
they're secure on your ear whenever
you're using them they've got four
microphones for voice cancellation nice
and you've got all the music controls
embedded on on the on the on these
headphones and you can use them in moto
or in stereo how ever it is that you
want in the case of the air pods you
have some of that functionality for me
the problem is the design the fact that
this plastic is really slippery
they're gonna fall off your ear and I
can only imagine the next trip on the
subway when people are gonna start
knowing what air pods are they're gonna
know that they cost 169 bucks and it's
gonna be a simple walk behind you grab
them from your ear and take off a bolt
right exactly and say go I was also
gonna ask because I have refused to put
your pods into my ears since the very
first iPhone that they came with which
I've already forgotten which one that i
phone 5 iPhone 5 so you've used the ear
pods how do you feel that they rank for
one listening to music and then to sound
tracking a workout in blocking sound
around you oh they are okay so it's
funny these these ear pods if you listen
to reviews of mine from years ago I
would use the old iPhone microphone as
my microphone for these reviews that the
first out dailies were recorded
with that with that microphone it was
really good the microphone on this is
bad
there is terrible noise cancellation and
the only thing that's a benefit for me
is the fact that I can control the audio
on my Mac and that's the reason why I
use him here but you saw me one I use a
pair of LG over the Year headphones oh
yeah because again they don't provide
the greatest they're very loud but
they're not deep at all gotcha they're
very loud and that's just about it so
but the problem is that the average
consumer is you know not going to be
looking around and investing 150 160
hundred seventy dollars on a pair of
headphones you know if the phone came
with a pair of headphones and all
they're gonna use them for is while they
compete on the subway the last thing
they're gonna want to do is invest on
them so you know I that's the reason why
ear pods are so famous simply because
they come in the bar
that's popular just because they're the
most accessible come in the box you buy
an iPhone and they come included that's
the only reason
go ahead Blaine and then you tease beats
with like three products using the W one
trip that's gonna be you know using blue
two with that Bluetooth with that
special sauce whatever and the whole
point of the W one ship is simply being
able to talk to iOS products easily I
find that cool I find it cool that all I
do is like sweet I like that the air
pods have five hours of battery life
that's a benefit I love that they have
an accelerometer so they don't need
buttons you just tap on them and you
know they'll respond for Siri or stuff
like that I wonder how they're gonna be
able to control music is that's one of
the major deals people use these
controls a lot on on ear pods I don't
know how Apple's gonna pull that off but
okay that's one thing um the second
thing is the five hour battery life the
third thing is you pair them with one
iOS product and then through iCloud
it'll bring that pairing on the same
yeah yeah and so I love that about Apple
you know that simplicity where I know
that if I logged on to my Google account
on the Mac because I have iCloud
keychain on the Mac it'll transfer that
login to my phone to my tablet to
everything and makes it seamless so
that's really cool but I hired that it
can just work I'm just saying you know
that you know if beats you know goes out
with the solo maybe and you know prices
it at $1.99 they're just shooting
themselves in the foot well I think that
yeah they are cuz those I mean I'm sorry
those airports look terrible they just
do I mean think about it there's no
appeal to them they look terrible so
second question that I that I had about
ear pods in this Apple ecosystem because
I'm really glad that both of you sort of
brought up that's for the air pods you
know there's an eye your Apple account
sort of helps manage yeah the security
for which devices are gonna be pairing
with a piece of hardware now I know a
lot of people that just use their smart
phone headphones to also plug into
things like laptops and tablets and do
we think will there be some kind of
adapter you get your ear pods you have
your iPhone 7 then you
go over to your MacBook which has a USB
C port on there is there gonna be some
pass-through or another adapter because
in here you want to be there for just
Mac Apple iOS devices it's still running
on Bluetooth that is the nonono earpods
not air pause okay so here's here's the
thing I remember who I was talking to
yesterday the scene that's gonna be the
nightmare for example if you just bought
yourself a new MacBook the new MacBook
doesn't have a lightning connector there
is no Mac with a lightning connector so
you know you know Apple is like breaking
bolt here and the reason why they're
including that adapter of lightning -
3.5 millimeter is because you know
you're kind of going to you're kind of
going yeah you need one transition
device but then but then that's the
problem I won't be able to use those ear
pods on the Mac because there isn't a
backwards so I don't think that there is
a lightning - 3.5 millimeter connector
the backwards right the male yeah yeah
well they're thinking on that is that is
yeah I'm hearing myself with the
feedback this is fun yeah this is this
is this disease is spreading so with the
ear pods going in and like the adaptors
there because they assume that they have
a degree that users have a really nice
pair of headphones that they'll they
want to use anyways besides the ear pods
so you know they I think that's a tacit
admission that you really don't want to
be using your pops because they
recognize that you know you have other
products and if you're if you're gonna
put in a three-and-a-half millimeter you
know headphone into the adapter than
Apple's kinda sort of lost the battle on
and we've had a number of questions
we've had a number of questions from
people about things like backwards
compatibility so let's say you get new
ear pods will they work your pods with a
lightning connector will they work on
older Mac's like can you plug them into
an iPad and as far as I can tell
obviously we're gonna have to
some of this stuff as far as I can tell
that won't work
I think you know your pods on an iPad
will as long as there's a lightning
connector they'll work it is if you have
a fit if you have a fifth-generation
iPod Touch which has a lightning
connector they will work well but we
don't know that yet
they will work it's just the lightning
protocol is the same so I'm gonna know
the lie to call the lightning protocol
for data is the same but well okay so so
the protocol was expanded with iOS 8
they're having there have been there
have been lightning headphones ever
since iOS 8 and all iOS 8 devices and
after are compatible for lightning audio
but do we do we know that those other
Lightning devices don't have their own
DAC why wouldn't they
well no no that's the point I'm trying
to make is if a pair of headphones have
their own DAC then it's just the data
from the device going through the
Lightning connector and then the phone
is responsible for for producing its own
sound pretty much if these ear pots so
when we see a 3.5 millimeter adapter
there is a way that has its own no it
send the phone don't does the dot if
it's in the phone then that means Apple
is taking pin outs and wiring which
would have went to the 3.5 millimeter
adapter and is rerouting them to extra
pins on the Lightning connector if that
audio isn't being routed on an older
device then newer ear pods will not work
unless those ear pods have their own DAC
and I don't think your pods have their
own DAC you're the audio expert my
friend you will be able to tell that's
what I mean so when it comes to just the
data you're right if the if the
headphones if your headphones have their
own DAC and their own amp built into the
headphones then they'll work on anything
with a lightning connector because
that's just an USB style audio
connection but you know to actually
generate the sound waves that we listen
to you need a DAC in an amp if these ear
pods are relying on a special rewiring
of a DAC an amp built into the phone
then older products will not be able to
use these newer devices so a little bit
a while back
showed a the little adapter as a
pre-release thing or like something they
got from Foxconn Vietnam factory and
they tested it out and they with one of
their older ear pods and I believe it
worked and Eden even said like the iPad
the iPod or sorry the iPhone that was
running iOS nine could not recognize the
the adapter so this is something that I
just wrote on on PocketNow so I've got a
moto Z and the Moto Z doesn't have a
headphone jack but it has a USB c2 3.5
millimeter adapter yes is a standard USB
C plug but if I take this plug and I try
and plug it into another phone which
does have a 3.5 millimeter adapter these
don't talk to each other there is no
standardized yet there is no
standardized the adapter the adapter no
but if you get a pair of JBL headphones
with a USBC connector that were pretty
much designed to provide audio through
the phone and I believe that they should
work because USB C on its own does
support audio this is like so I would
say with JBL they're probably including
their own DAC it's there there has to be
something there I mean this is like the
early days of Bluetooth you remember you
remember the early days of boots where
we're depending on the version of
Bluetooth that the product had it could
support keyboards or joysticks or or but
it couldn't support audio it didn't have
eight what was it a 2 VP I think that
was the that was the big like you know
exciting ever bluetooth 3 hit it was
like major um but yeah you know I feel
that there will be a transition period I
just listen this is like Apple Apple has
done this so many times they launched
the first iMac they got rid of the they
got rid of the disk drive the diskette
and everybody who said that Apple was
crazy
the funny thing is Apple is not the
first company to get rid of the
headphone jack
OPO had done it before HTC I mean think
about it pocket pcs pocket PCs
smartphones did not bring a headphone
jack Apple was the company that brought
it back with the first iPhone but if you
used an HTC or a cue tech or any of
these pocket pcs that we used years ago
none of these brought a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack it was everything was
connected to the so that many it was to
the mini USB connector back in the day I
have a you know I'll have to say that
that is courage yeah Apple has the
courage that magic courage that helps us
move forward in this tech industry that
no other company except for Apple and
Lacko and Motorola have or had before
Apple managed to find their this this is
not new I just one thing that I do know
when you and I had the conversation one
and I don't know we I think that I would
like to end my comments with that if we
want higher quality audio on from a
smartphone I don't think that it would
be that easy to do with a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack how old is it I don't
think that you see that's that's another
thing too is is the age of a cable
standard really doesn't mean that that
standard is obsolete we're capable of
driving a 32-bit audio signal over a 3.5
millimeter yes but you need what within
the phone a nice DAC okay how big is it
well you that we currently have them in
in HTC's I know I know but I guess I
guess the point is you know I guess the
suite is into either I guess the point
is these companies want to reduce the
size of phones they want to make them
lighter and so I guess it's I guess I
would have loved for Apple to include a
USBC connector on the iPhone and if they
want to charge through lightning that
great I don't care but I guess the
biggest complaint is the only problem
with me using lightning is shoot I don't
only have an iPhone right and what if I
want us 200 $300 on a great pair of
headphones but these are USBC well and
USBC is going to be the standard that
wins because we know apples gonna be
shifting over their products to be using
USB C on things like MacBooks so exactly
lighting now looks like so this odd
outside player it's just Lightning is
also going to be the connector used on
the single most purchased solitary line
phones in existence which is that's in
that solitaire line is the one that
sells the most accessories sadly yeah
totally whether we like it or not so I I
hate the lack I for example even the
MacBook again the Apple's MacBook
doesn't have a lightning entry it has
USB C and a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack so I'm sure that MacBook owners are
scratching their heads
it's just that fragmentation that I hate
but do Amaya matte believe that the 3.5
millimeter headphone jack is dying no
actually I'm not I'm actually ready for
higher quality audio that can be done
digitally through a you know a different
protocol again I'll be really curious to
see if that actually comes to pass
though because it all comes down to a
DAC in an amp and all we're doing is
moving where that DAC and amp are and I
don't necessarily believe that that's
really going to provide us with higher
quality audio I I think what we're gonna
end up with eventually are phones that
don't have this Hardware built into them
the DAC and built into them because will
then have to buy headphones that do and
I don't think that's gonna all we're
doing is migrating so you'll still have
for most consumers will still have
crappy Dax and amps that are built-in to
headphones and then you'll have to spend
significantly more to have the DAC and
amp be nicer in nicer head ok but tell
me tell me something one how does this
work the clip mics that we use you're
the expert on how Sennheiser was able to
pull a seven $700 mic element and make
it work on an iPad so what I've got is
is that extra little dongle that's
that's sort of built in there
this little blockading is communicating
with the hardware built into the iPad so
it requires extra lumps or extra pieces
that are going to be sticking off of the
main unit right well I mean it's all
about signal processing you know I am
really impressed with this microphone
man I mean I'm really impressed and it's
all enabled through lightning well yeah
but that's also because there's a big
lump on the cable that allows yes but
what would that what that big lump have
worked through a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack is the question well
that's all
if Apple had included the microphone
connection to be of a higher quality on
the iPad or the iPhone there's not a lot
of contact there for a single input
because it's a 3.5 millimeter headphone
jack again that's not necessarily the
determine dose factor of quality jewels
you want to move on don't you we have 10
minutes for the Apple watch and you know
what I'll just say it
GPS waterproof speakers done I ladies
and gentlemen I despise the Apple watch
I will admit it
I spent $400 of my own money buying it
and I regret it
it's the clunkiest thing on the planet
the most convoluted and most confusing
SmartWatch in the market Android wear
continues to be my favorite Quan uses a
pebble like there's no tomorrow I have
to review the Apple watch I it's that I
have to order it today um I am going to
order the Nike berry and hopefully just
to see what the difference is good I'm a
big I'm a big Nike Plus user so I would
like to see what differences are there I
have no high hopes here because yes
there they're adding a dual-core
processor now even if you buy the Apple
watch one you'll be getting that
dual-core processor I think that was a
smart move but I think the problem is
not a problem of hardware it's a problem
of software implementation it is
extremely convoluted and confusing and
you know Apple wants to force you to
think that a SmartWatch is about the
apps and I'm sorry it's not I can't even
tell the difference between the timer
and the clock in the Apple watch and and
and I never do I completely forget to
think and handle apps you know all i
care is what's on the complications on
the sides and that's pretty much it
what's at a glance available to me
because if I'm gonna have to be
interacting and looking for an app to
launch I might as well just collab with
them right no absolutely the longer I
have interacting with the tiny little
screen the more I wish I should have
just taken my phone out of my pocket and
exactly why I like the pebble is that
it's focused on a very a couple key
features that I think it does really
really well and then applets I don't
really care about I guess the main
question that I've gotten the one thing
that I'd like to spend our
last couple minutes on this podcast
together on again Apple lifestyle
company they're really trying to make
their Brandt their product more about
you know sort of incorporating people's
style into it it's it becomes that kind
of a discussion on on a on lifestyle so
with the Apple watch to being almost
exactly the same form factor in shell as
the Apple watch series one do we think
that consumers are gonna adopt the newer
product or do we think that they're
gonna look at it see they that they that
they look the same largely and if that
style fits their personal fashion is
there any incentive to moving to the to
the Apple watch to I think that there
will be a lot of Apple watch ones on
eBay right now Kenneth crear and people
will I think that people if people have
already invested in liking the Apple
watch because I knew I know about three
people out of three hundred that
actually do like the Apple watch and if
hey I just listen for me the biggest
problem with the Apple watch is $400 for
a stainless steel variant that has a not
an ionics glass bottom and then that
that glass bottom actually scratches
with the charger so what's the point
about paying $400 for a watch that
becomes really unreliable about its
sensors over the course of three months
because of the scratches on that bottom
you know I would rather buy this polar
m600 watch that I'm currently I'm
working on a review for this thing my
god this thing is almost as accurate as
a heart rate as a chest strap right
right and then you know this thing costs
half as much
it's got Android wear it could be your
full watch if you want
if the band's tear at some point you can
snap the bands off put something on and
hey if you want to use a regular watch
for the rest of the day then you can you
know the problem is the other watch
tries to be everything and sure you can
swim with it but tell me how many people
do you know are swimmers very little you
know we're about to go into the winter
so it's not like if you're gonna take
this thing to the pool that's definitely
a user scenario that's not gonna exist
the only thing that I'm really stoked
about is the GPS yeah
because yes GPS functionality like the
Apple watch 1 was very inaccurate when
running you know it was pretty listen
the Apple watch was the first SmartWatch
you could take out for a run without the
phone I give Apple that but it was very
inaccurate very inaccurate and so you
know I bet that's the problem
you could run with an iPod touch if you
wanted to running with the I with the
Nike application and the pedometer was
very accurate on the on the damn ipod
touch the minute he took the Apple watch
out it was like night and day so you
know I feel that it's the the problem is
the Apple watch tries to be too many
things it is not durable enough to be
that so we'll see what we'll take we'll
put it for its pace and we'll see if it
survives the testing well I think you'll
see I I don't think I'm gonna be
spending any time gonna be curious to
see what you think I'm just to wrap up
here we've got some some more some more
comments on the PN weekly hash tag Joel
G Joseph he's he's upset that oh no I'm
sorry
we've got Panzer Z Panzer Z is outraged
that his Android wear won't have that
Pokemon go app hopefully we'll see that
transition over some some cool pokemons
go features that tie directly into apple
health which I thought that was actually
kind of cool seeing how whenever you
have a fun app it automatically sends
your data over into Apple health so I
think that that's a pretty cool
implementation same thing with app folk
at fat produce give me pokemons go on my
LG watch urbane or give me death forgive
me I think the stakes are that high so
we also had a really funny photo come in
from fat produce showing han Solo in the
Millennium Falcon advanced tech
spacecraft that can travel faster than
the speed of light still uses a
headphone jack on that headset there and
then uh from from at NIMH bug from my
friend Amir you know because we were
talking about dual camera sensors so
what's next will there be a triple
sensor for normal wide and telephoto
lenses and of course someone instantly
popped up the light l16 if you haven't
seen the light l16 i would totally
recommend checking out the images on
that cuz it's a crazy looking camera
back with all these different cameras
and distance and meter
sensors on the back of it to hopefully
improve your photography so folks there
you have it another episode of the
pocket now weekly has come and gone
this show is ending but the conversation
continues on Twitter where you can find
mister hi mate Iveta as at hi may under
sundar score of Iveta there you go and

site pocketnow.com were basically
everywhere now shows like this can't
exist without your support sharing the
weekly with your friends who love mobile
technology and by dropping some reviews
