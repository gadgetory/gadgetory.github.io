the Samsung Galaxy Nexus the gsm version
was released in november of 2011 and
it's been a long time since then but
we're finally starting to see some
accessories today i want to show you the
desktop dock for the Galaxy Nexus let's
go take a look so if you have a Samsung
Galaxy Nexus the gsm version this is the
desktop dock that you want to basically
charge your phone using the pogo pins
and take audio out via either analog or
digital audio out playback well high
quality music and whatnot now this is
like i said for the gsm version of the
phone it will not work on the verizon
version of the phone but enough of that
let's go ahead and unbox it and see what
it comes with so first of all we've got
this plastic container open that up and
we've got the dock in a ziplock bag will
open that up and start out on the bottom
down here we've got this kind of grippy
material so it's not going to slide
around on your desktop the dock itself
isn't terribly heavy but it's not
lightweight it's got a but basically
just enough weight to it so it's going
to be steady and stay where you want it
to stay we've got the cradle that the
phone sits inside with the three pogo
pins for charging and then a little
recess right here I don't know if you
can see that for the power button so
that it doesn't you know push the power
button when you cradle it that is taken
care of by those pogo pins so it'll
automatically turn on when you dock it
looking around the sides nothing
noteworthy there on the back we have
that audio out or line out port and then
over here we've got a micro USB port for
charging now the the phone itself comes
with a micro USB cable and charger the
dock however does not so I've gone ahead
and plugged in a micro USB cable off
camera
plug that in down there and now our dock
is powered so let's go ahead and plug in
a phone first film that I want to show
you is a Galaxy Nexus this one has the
extended battery again gsm version this
is running stock android 4.0 point for
which again is required to properly use
the doc well slide that down fits just
fine you heard a little bit of a docking
sound right there and then right away
we're charging and we're in the dock
mode go ahead and go to the home screen
will pull this down and go into our
settings you'll notice under system we
have a doc item in there we can turn on
or off that sound that's nice if power
gets removed or whatnot it will let you
know one of the advantages of that you
can turn it off if you don't like it now
something else is interesting this audio
configurator is not selectable I don't
know why that is but I've tested it and
audio still comes through that back port
and the only way that it's doing that
it's not doing that through the pogo
pins it has to have connected through
some other magical mechanism whether
that's Bluetooth or whatnot I don't know
but it works just fine nonetheless so
we'll go ahead and go back home and
that's what it looks like they're now
let's look at a different phone this
time it's a another galaxy nexus this
one with a standard battery and we'll go
ahead and dock that now the thing about
this phone again you heard the nice
little dock insertion sound will come
back here this is running cyanogenmod it
is a nightly that is running version 4.0
point for as well if we come down here
to system where did system go and i
pushed a little too hard and it
disconnected from those pogo pins so
i'll push a little bit less hard this
time coming down to system and choose
doc now you'll notice the same two
things down here we've got the use doc
audio and then the doc insert sound
which i have selected there's also this
doc bluetooth audio which is
disabled and a force undock these are
settings that are more advanced and that
come with cyanogenmod rom and you know
if i want to force on docket I can now
the phone is not docked and I can't
redock it so I'll go back in and do that
at a later time overall really impressed
but disappointed with the fact that it
took so long for this dock to be
released this is going to make a really
really nice addition to the nightstand
where I'll be able to just you know keep
it there and charge it up and hopefully
have a nice little alarm clock setting
going on there when you do plug it in a
couple things to note is it will dock up
and then it sits here this will dim out
so it's nice and I won't let it's not
bright and in your face while you're
trying to sleep the clock will also
change positions assumably to to keep
that from burning into the screen
overall quite impressive it's going to
cost you about 65 bucks delivered again
only for the gsm version of the phone
but i definitely like it
