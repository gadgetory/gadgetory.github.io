where there's a pretty decent chance
that you have a moto 360 and if so you
might have caught yourself lusting over
the android 5.1.1 update that came on
the LG watch urbane lucky for you
motorola recently pushed the 5.1 update
to the Moto 360 so let's see what's new
I'm high auto Houston and you're
watching pocket now so there's a lot new
here one of the first changes you might
notice comes with a simple tap on the
screen where Android wear used to call
up a simple voice input you're now
finally greeted with an app launcher
here you can scroll through whatever
apps you have installed on your watch
and if you swipe to the left there are
two additional sections one for contacts
and one for the traditional voice input
in the contacts section you can tap on
an entry to either call them or send a
text or email if you go with text
there's also the new option to send
emoji which you can either choose from a
list or dry yourself for a little fun
the quick settings have changed a little
bit too they're still accessed with a
swipe down from the upper bezel but the
notification toggles have been filed
into a line and swiping over now reveals
brightness boost in addition to the
existing theater mode and settings
shortcut finally going into the settings
there are a few new options for easier
access and security you can change your
watch face directly from the settings
now and there are great new usability
features like wrist gestures to sift
through your notifications on the home
screen without needing another free hand
screen lock works as a security measure
to avoid unauthorized access if you take
your Moto 360 off and just like on your
phone you can unlock it with a pattern
finally Android wear 5.1.1 enables Wi-Fi
on the Moto 360 allowing it to pull in
notifications from your phone even if
it's out of Bluetooth range you can
connect to an open network as well as
any others that you've connected your
phone to in the past there's a lot of
new features in Android wear version
5.1.1
so download it now and breathe some new
life into your moto 360 while it's
installing check out some of our other
Android wear coverage and subscribe to
