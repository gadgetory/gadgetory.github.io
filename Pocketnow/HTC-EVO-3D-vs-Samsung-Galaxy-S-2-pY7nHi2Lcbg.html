dual core world domination between the
Samsung Galaxy S 2 an HTC EVO 3d we're
going to cover the basic specs on both
of our combatants we're gonna do a
little boot up check for available RAM
we're going to run the quadrant Center
benchmark test a smart bench test as
well as will impact protest we'll also
have our unofficial speed test we'll do
a little gaming extravaganza and it will
wrap this up with our browser comparison
and hang out after that I'll have
attached to this video a couple of video
samples one from the Galaxy s2 and also
one from the HTC evo 3d for your viewing

alright let's talk a little bit about
memory galaxy s2 comes in two versions
either 16 or 32 gigabytes of internal
storage also comes with one get both
versions come with one gigabyte of RAM
the Evo 3d comes with 4 gigabytes of
internal storage 1 gigabyte of RAM both
of them offer Wi-Fi a total Evan B G and
n the galaxy s2 also offers 802 11 a
they both have DLNA support as well as
HDMI out through the microUSB port they
both offer bluetooth version 3.2 support
for a 2 DP Galaxy S 2 also has support
for high-speed data transfer they both
offer gps with support for a GPS they
both can be used as Wi-Fi hotspots
Galaxy S 2 offers the Exynos 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor Evo 3d
comes with qua coms 1.2 MSM 80 660
dual-core processor operating system is
Android 2.3 Gingerbread on both the UI
on the galaxy s 2 is Samsung's TouchWiz
4.0 and on the Evo 3d it's HTC Sense
version 3.0 alright let's start putting
them through their paces let's boot them
both up and check for available RAM
there we go one down one to go
and you can see we've got the quick
Bhutan turned out on the Evo 3d we'll go
into settings going to applications
running services let that settle starts
out with almost 600 megabytes of free
Ram and yeah it's going to the settings
on the GS 2 applications and learning
services alright let that settle on the
Evo 3d we've got 600 megabytes of free
RAM and Galaxy has to let that settle
looks like it's gonna stick around 630
megabytes of free RAM
let's kick this off with the Quadra
Center benchmark test and of both off
good clean start on both alright let's
check our results and the galaxy s2 came
back with a 3303 on the quadrant
standard benchmark test and the Evo 3d
came back at nineteen sixty so our
winner of the quadrant Center benchmark
test is the galaxy s2 alright next up
let's run a smart bench test and we're
off good clean start on both alright
let's check our results and on the smart
bench test the galaxy s2 came back with
a Productivity index of 38 49 verses
just over 2000 on the Evo 3d and on the
game's index the galaxy s2 came back
with a 23 12 versus 1690 on the evo 3d
so our winner of the smart spend test is
the galaxy s2 and last but not least
let's run our Linpack pro for Android
test and the galaxy s2 is our winner
with mega flops fifty six point zero
zero one and one point five seconds
versus mega flops of forty four point
nine O three and a time of one point
eight seven seconds on the Evo 3d so
we've got a unanimous winner on our
three tests
Samsung Galaxy s2 it's time for our
unofficial speed test and both of these
sand sets have built-in task managers
where we can clear the memory or kill
all the apps so let's do that to start
with so we've got that done let's go
back to our main screen I'll make this
as close as I can start with calendar
and that was definitely the Galaxy s2
let's try settings that look to be the
galaxy s2
let's try Maps I seem to be the galaxy
s2
let's try contacts that was definitely
the galaxy s2
let's try messaging that was definitely
the galaxy s2 let's try the market and
it both hooked up to the same Wi-Fi
network and that was definitely the
galaxy s2
let's try Gmail that was the galaxy s2
and then let's try what I want to do a
movies third party and that was the
galaxy s2 even while getting email and
then let's check as far as filing up
feed so looks like a galaxy s2 is the
unanimous winner of our unofficial speed
test alright it's time to continue our
face off for world dual-core Kuni Evo 3d
and galaxy s2 with our gaming portion
got raging thunder 2 loaded on both that
the lights turned out hopefully give you
a little better look at the graphics and
again remember I'm running this through
a camera so be gentle with your comments
all right there's a lap on the Evo's
Freedy let's take a look at the Galaxy
s2
alright there's our lap on the galaxy s2
alright it's time to wrap up another
packet now face off for dual-core world
supremacy between the Samsung Galaxy s2
and HTC EVO 3d with our browser
comparison kind of both running off the
same Wi-Fi network they both been
updated to Adobe Flash Player 10 point 3
they both have Flash fully enabled and I
don't think oh yeah don't forget to
stick around after the browser
comparison we're gonna have the video
comparison shot from both Galaxy s2 as
well as the HTC EVO 3d so make sure you
stick around and check that out alright
set up a Tang gadget first up and we're
off it looks like the evo 3d is out in
front and it's gonna be who's gonna take
it it's gonna be the galaxy s2 his done
Evo 3d is done galaxy s2 looks a hair
smoother but not by much both very very
smooth probably two of the best browsers
out there right now there's double tap
to zoom in and again pinch to zoom you
get the dynamic rewrap on the galaxy s2
which excuse me on the evo 3d which you
don't get on the galaxy s2 zoom all the
way out but both of them handle it very
well
you can see just how smooth the galaxy
s2 is alright let's head over to pocket
now there we go
and we're off and the galaxy s2 looks
pretty serious it comes to e both ridi
you can see the difference in the
displays with the depth of color on both
and clarity and right now everything's
loaded but the flash so we're gonna see
who's got the oomph the horsepower to
get the flash loaded first looks like
the galaxy galaxy s2 is gonna take it
but who knows we're both working on
getting that done
and it's going to be it's gonna be
does anybody want to do it galaxy s2 she
can see very smooth
fully loaded double tap to zoom in no
problems very very smooth all right
Ebola is done 3d excuse me smooth but
not to the extent that you'd see on the
galaxy s2 let's go check out that story
and a winner here is gonna be the and
then we've got a little our flash again
you can see the flash add up on top that
the Evo 3d is running that the excuse me
galaxy s2 is running at the Evo 3d did
not pick up on and again galaxy s is
very Smith little problem with rendering
the text here on the Evo 3d double
tablets if we get it to render properly
there we go now I've got it rendering
right but of the two I would have to
definitely say galaxy s2 is a smoother
of the two and definitely the most
responsive as well alright so there's a
look at our face off for dual core
domination between the Samsung Galaxy s2
HTC EVO 3d I'd have to say my personal
opinion Galaxy s2 is still our reigning
champion this is Craig for pocket now
and I hope this has been helpful don't
forget to stick around for our video
comparison soon as I'm gone
take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
