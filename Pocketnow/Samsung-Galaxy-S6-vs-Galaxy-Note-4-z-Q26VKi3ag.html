S and a Galaxy Note is actually pretty
easy the S line might be the best of
mainstream Samsung but it's the note
that's always brought something a little
more and this year the choice is even
easier I'm Michael Fisher with PocketNow
here to show you why in Galaxy s6 vs.
galaxy note 4
brought to you by squarespace these
smartphones aren't just from different
classes even though they're only
separated by about six months they're
essentially from different eras in
Samsung Design the s6 is glass on
rounded metal and it's extremely smooth
in the hand while the note 4 blends
chamfered aluminum with textured
polycarbonate for a much sharper much
brawny ER feel the structural
distinctions make for more than just a
different feel the note 4 seems
inherently more rugged thanks to its
plastic backing if you're planning on
routinely roughing up the s6 you'll
probably want to invest in a case or a
skin like this one from D brand to
protect the gorilla glass because it's
non removable by contrast if you mess up
the note 4's backside you can just
replace the battery door the pop off
back cover also grants access to the
notes larger user swappable battery and
microSD slot for expandable storage the
former means you can carry a spare
battery for long trips and the latter
means you can bump the notes onboard
storage up to 128 gigs while saving a
bit of money in the process
the s6 doesn't pack any of that
extensibility in this department about
the only things it's got built in that
the note 4 doesn't are the Samsung pay
hardware for wireless transactions and
wireless charging you can add the latter
to the note 4 with an aftermarket
solution but not all of those are
created equal
flip around to the front and the thumb
scanners are the next big thing you'll
notice if you're like me and can't stand
unlock codes the s6 is new press and
hold scanner is much more convenient and
less cumbersome than the note fours
awkward swipe pad once those displays
come to life though the note 4 starts
impressing again 5.7 inches versus 5.1
doesn't sound like that big a boost but
the note really does feel much more
spacious which makes the slight decrease
in pixel density more than worth it the
note 4 display also incorporates the
Wacom digitizer that the s6 doesn't have
because it enables the most visible
accessory that makes the note the note
the s-pen is much more than a stylus
it's a tool that unlocks a whole host of
additional features on the note some are
total gimmicks like action memo that
turns your chicken-scratch to actionable
data when it works but for adding flair
to photos or drawing something from
scratch it can't be beat it's also a
handy highlighter for scripts or study
guides it's good for calling out a
particular route on a map or a
particular detail on a schematic and as
a precision tool for maneuvering and
scrolling around the software it's
remarkably handy combined with the added
screen size the s-pen acts as a kind of
mouse to give the note a much more
handheld computer feel than the smaller
sleeker s6 and even if you only use the
s-pen once a month it's still worth it
because it slides into its Snug silo on
the phone's bottom edge when you don't
need it essentially disappearing until
the next time you do there's more to
Samsung's super stylus so much that we
even created an entire s-pen lesson
video teaching you how to use it but the
important takeaway for this comparison
is that the note 4 has it in the s6
doesn't
when we reviewed it in the fall the note
for impressed us with its 16 megapixel
optically stabilized camera and the
galaxy s6 built on that by bringing a
wider aperture and substantially
improved software the results are
incredibly close in most settings
Samsung might have turned down the
saturation just a Titch on the s6
compared to the note 4 but in broad
daylight that's about as much of a
difference as I can see even in
low-light the slight improvements to the
s6 aren't immediately apparent it's only
when you look closer that you start to
see the added detail and reduce noise of
the newer phones output and its superior
focus abilities when faced with bright
lights in dark rooms the bigger gulf
between the two is in the interface even
though our note 4 is running lollipop
it's not running the new Samsung
software the s6 is sporting so its
viewfinder is the older clunkier version
the s6 streamlines everything about the
camera experience and couples that with
a quick launch ability you just
double-click the home button and it
starts up very quickly that plus the
improved night shots and the upgraded
front-facing camera make the Galaxy s6
the superior shooter by a narrow margin
though and then there's everyday
performance software responsiveness is
quite good on both phones out of the box
though I'll stress that that's only true
if you're using the default look on the
s6 running a custom theme can slow down
performance quite a bit
you can't yet download themes for the
note 4 at least not for our snapdragon
powered version here so we'll have to
wait to see whether that problem carries
over which seems likely but the note 4
isn't immune to slowdowns like most
Android lollipop devices and Samsung
phones in particular it gets less and
less smooth the longer you go between
restarts in our particular example the
s6 is much more responsive but it's also
the newer phone time may prove these to
be tied we'll see if what you want is a
phone that last you through the day it's
a lot less muddy by a note I've seen
some claims of exceptional battery life
on the s6 but based on my own experience
with two t-mobile units and a verizon
model and our editor-in-chief's
experience with his own unit in romania
i can't recommend the s6 to a road
warrior
about three and a half hours of screen
on time between charges is the max I've
been able to hit which is a far cry from
the five hour screen on time I can get
from the note plus there's that
removable battery on the ladder if you
want to carry a spare the remaining
points of comparison are very minor I
tend to prefer the note 4 for playing
games both because of its larger screen
and its rear mounted speaker which isn't
as easy to accidentally block with a
thumb but as a daily carry particularly
with summer coming I tend to prefer the
s6 because it doesn't take up nearly as
much space in a pocket it is more
comfortable thanks to its rounded
corners I said this wasn't easier than
ever comparison and I meant it that's
because this year the Galaxy S and the
Galaxy Note are more different than
they've ever been if your priorities
dictate a smartphone that's a sidekick
rather than the center of your computing
life you'll probably prefer the s6 it's
more conventional it's simpler it's
easier to use one-handed and it's
software is much more modern even after
applying the latest updates to both the
s6
is the phone you get if all you want is
something modern that works well and you
don't care about anything else if on the
other hand you're shopping for a smart
phone that can do more one that can take
over for a tablet or even occasionally a
notebook something that you can expand
and tweak and carry a spare battery for
if you need to the note 4 remains
champion standing you get a lot more for
your dollar in fact you get the best
phablet money can buy something that'll
handle almost anything you can throw at
it if that still sounds tough well take
solace from the fact that either way you
go here you'll be getting a terrific
smartphone which is the better fit for
you is entirely a question of how you
plan to use it this comparison was
