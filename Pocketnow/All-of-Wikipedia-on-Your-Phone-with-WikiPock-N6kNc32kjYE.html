pocket now calm on this HTC touch pro
I've got all of Wikipedia stored in
English all 2.8 million articles can
press down to a size of about four
gigabytes so it fits onto a storage card
that i have installed in the back of the
device it's through a program called
wiki POC and the purpose of the program
is to give you access to all of
Wikipedia articles without having to go
through an internet connection and why
would you want that well let's say
you're on an airplane or you're on a
train or you just don't pay for a data
connection on your windows mobile device
and you want to be able to access all of
Wikipedia so that you can do researcher
look up interesting topics and that is
what the program is for so let me show
you how it works this is the screen that
you search from it's a very simple
interface I'm going to search for coffee
so I just start typing and there it
comes up there and here we have coffee
and because this is an HTC touch pro I
can flick scroll and just move my finger
along as I'm reading and just like
Wikipedia on the on the desktop you can
tap on other links which will take you
to other articles so if i click on
Southeast Asia here we'll go to the
southeast asia article and you'll get
some of the grids and the graphics that
you get on wikipedia although it strips
out the images and any sound files and I
think it does that to save some space so
if we want to go to a new search we
press a new search down there or if we
want to go back we click menu and back
and we'll go back to coffee and here's a
pretty cool feature a random page so if
you're just trying to learn about new
things you click on random page and it
takes you to a certain airport that's
not interesting to me let's go to the
next page let's see is a country radio
station okay that's not interesting to
me either and so on and so forth so this
program isn't free but it's very cheap
it's only ten dollars for the basic
version which doesn't let you get
updates if you do want to get updates
you can go for the 15-dollar version now
this comes in eight languages all the
common language
you know Italian French Spanish that
sort of thing and of course English and
they also have other versions where you
can get the get a microSD card shipped
to you with the whole thing on there if
you don't have a large microSD card for
a 8 gigabyte microSD card you add
fifteen dollars and for a four gigabyte
microSD card it's it adds ten dollars so
you're talking either ten dollars if you
already have a large micro SD card or as
much as fifteen dollars or twenty-five
dollars i should say if you want a micro
SD card shipped with you so it may be
worth it if you like looking up new
things and you find yourself traveling a
lot without any internet access so
that's it for now for wiki puck i'll
post a link on pocket now on how to get
more information about this that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
