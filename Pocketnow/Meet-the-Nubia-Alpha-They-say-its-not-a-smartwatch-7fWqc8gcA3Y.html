either already have one or don't care
but this according to Nubia is not this
is the Nubia alpha and from what I was
told in their booth this is designed to
be a smartphone not a SmartWatch a
smartphone you we're reporting Beneatha
in Berlin I'm high metally better with
pocket now and let's go hands-on so yes
what you see here at least in my opinion
is the coolest thing I've seen an ephah
2018 so far according to new via the
Alpha is inspired by the sci-fi genre
pushing the boundaries of design without
affecting the smartphone user interface
yeah I'm scratching my head over its
future or functionality as a standalone
device but novia does clarify that this
product is here to complement a
smartphone as well so let's give it some
air to breathe see this is what trade
shows are all about bold new products
from well-established companies like
Nubia and this is one of them now
disclaimer I barely got Nubia to remove
the glass covering the product they
didn't want to touch it they didn't
allow me to touch it and I wasn't
provided much details about it I can't
tell you this the casing of the Nubia
alpha is made at least in part of
stainless steel some of it doesn't look
like aluminum around the watch like
section of the body though the band
houses a speaker and the sensor we still
can determine what for there's a taller
than average screen made of a flexible
OLED panel
I'm sadly not sure what covers it as we
all know that glass doesn't really Bend
so I would assume this is plastic
there's a camera in the corner a power
button close to it and at the other end
we have a menu button that should lead
to some applications I assume there are
no specification to share
we only know from the demo video that
there is a heart rate sensor at the back
and it's hard to tell if the camera is
for more than just selfie photos or
video and then there's the user
interface it seems to be designed around
the concept of making a smart phone
wearable with easy ways to reach the
contacts track the time
your fitness etc yes this is Android
according to new via but no version was
provided and this is the most customized
version of Android I've seen without
it's compatible with any current
services or applications so obviously
that brings some concerns still Milius
fishes that the future of smartphones
shouldn't be the flat slabs that we know
that it could be something else and the
bet is so bold that the company claims
that this is not a concept that they're
working on having this product ready yes
I said product in q4 2018 yes I said
this year whether it does bring a good
smartphone alternative who knows but I
do praise new attempts and I'm willing
to stand by and give it a try once it
does it's seriously been a while since
I've seen something so different and so
bold and even if we don't have a price
point or markets we do know that it will
be released beyond China so that's gonna
be interesting what about you what do
you think do you think the new be alpha
has a future that is know in the
