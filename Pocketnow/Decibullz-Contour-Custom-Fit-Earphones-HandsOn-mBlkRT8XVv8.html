properly fitting set of earbuds ones
that fit like they were designed for you
and you alone I'm Stephen shank with
PocketNow and this is a hands-on look at
the decibels contour custom-fit
earphones brought to you by dee brand a
really nice pair of earbuds may let you
choose between a few different sized
inserts but even when they're not one
size fits all you're still making do
with a fit that may be less than totally
ideal the team at decibels thinks it has
the answer to that conundrum and it
showstoppers at CES 2016 we took a look
at how some unique materials let the
company's ear buds mold to fit the
curves of your ear like a glove drop the
blank decibels earpieces and hot water
for a few minutes and they're
thermoplastic material quickly becomes
pliable you pop one in each year apply
some gentle pressure and they multi take
the shape of your Oracle that'sa all
those interesting curves and folds that
make each of our ears unique even just
moments out of a hot water bath the
decibels molds aren't uncomfortably warm
and while the sensation of shutting some
gummy wads in your ears may sound a
little odd and don't get us wrong it's a
very unique experience
it's nothing particularly disagreeable
if anything it feels like having your
head underwater in a warm bath after
letting them set for a few minutes
you've got a one-of-a-kind set of ear
buds that fit like they're made for you
which they very much are as a result of
the custom fit decibels ear buds offer
both some impressive noise isolation and
they stay in place remarkably well right
now they're available as a wired
addition that retails for about $60 and
a new wireless Bluetooth version is due
to start shipping at the end of February
for 149 you can save a bit on either of
those by visiting the decibels indiegogo
crowdfunding page while you're paying a
bit of a premium for the custom fit
decibels offers it's still a heck of a
lot more affordable than a trip to the
audiologist for a professionally custom
molded pair
