to take a look at the verizon wireless
samsung omnia to which ones windows
mobile 6.5 on verizon wireless is cdma
ev-do network the omnia two comes in an
attractive black box which has an emboss
Samsung logo first we're going to do an
unboxing and then we're going to compare
the hardware and look at the hardware
tour and finally we're going to take a
look at TouchWiz and some of these
Samsung software customizations on top
of windows mobile 6.5 the device is a
relatively attractive device which
utilizes a tablet state form factor it
is a relatively thick device almost the
same thickness as the touch pro 2 which
HTC makes with a sliding qwerty keyboard
of course the omnia two doesn't have the
sliding keyboard we're going to go ahead
and set aside the device for just a
second and take a look at what else is
included in the box you do have a number
of CDs inside the box one of which is
the Verizon Wireless V CAST with
rhapsody to transfer music that you
purchase on the device as well you have
some manuals tips hints and shortcuts in
one of the CD contains a digital user
manual you have here a USB wall charger
which you can plug the USB cable into
the wall charger or into your computer
to charge and sync the device here it
looks like Samsung went away with the
Samsung proprietary charging connector
and instead use a micro USB charging
connector for standards you also have
eight three-and-a-half millimeter
connector which has a microphone here
and also a 3 9 millimeter headphone jack
so you can use your own headphones if
you want to use on the microphone that's
included as well which is a nice touch
this also serves as an antenna for the
built-in FM radio that's included inside
the device the device is a large device
with a 3.7 inch WVGA AMOLED display it
has a resistive touchscreen which offers
bright and vivid colors and also rich
blacks as well it's one of the largest
AMOLED displays right now on a phone and
even on a smartphone you on the left
hand side you have it you win a
three-and-a-half millimeter
phone jack volumes up and down control
which activates Samsung's proprietary
visual interface right there a microSD
card slot which is accessible once you
open the back battery cover there's also
an ok button right here on the left-hand
side and on the right-hand side of the
device you have a camera button here at
the bottom which is a double press
camera button so you press once to focus
and press then again to snap your
picture a lock screen that turns on and
off the screen and a micro USB charging
port which is accessible underneath this
flap on the front of the device you have
at the top on a light sensor to
automatically adjust the brightness of
the screen depending on the conditions
outside if it's bright the screen will
go brighter a ahead earpiece speaker and
it looks like an LED light that glows
orange once it's charging and can notify
you of notifications on the bottom you
don't really have anything except for a
notch here which you can take and remove
the back battery cover where you'll see
the battery and also a micro sdhc card
slot the device has eight gigs built in
memory but you can expand that with
external storage card memory as well
let's go ahead and snap that together
you do also have a collapsible stylus
which is the only thing that you'll see
at the top of the device on the back you
have a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus
face and smile detection as well as an
LED flash the camera can also do video
recording at 30 frames per second and
720 x 480 resolution which is DVD light
quality it also has dual speaker so you
do have stereo speakers one at the top
and bottom or left and right-hand side
of the device depending on how you look
at it the device has a contour here so
it makes it easier to hold the device
like this for watching movies or playing
games in landscape mode it can also
support divx standard or xvid videos as
well once you unlock the device you're
taken to
a three screen widget interface and you
can add more widgets or removing widgets
by pulling open the widget drawers so
you can just tap on a widget and pull it
and drag it onto the screen once you're
done with the widget you can just drag
it back and you can place the widgets
anywhere on the screen on the bottom
here you have the call and call n button
and what looks to be a directional pad
or even a trackpad is just a single
button which takes you to the program's
menu on the phone this does away with
the honeycomb interface that windows
mobile 6.5 has and comes with a skinned
TouchWiz UI that Samsung uses there's
also a handy task switcher a quick quick
launch or 2d settings and you can even
edit which programs show up here by
adding or removing different programs
the settings takes you to a skinned
settings and what we commenced a samsung
for is their ease of connection to Wi-Fi
interfaces so here we have Wi-Fi turned
on to connect you just tap on the
wireless network that you want and just
hit next and enter in your network key
so Samsung does a great job with
managing Wi-Fi that way compared to the
standard Windows Mobile fair samsung
also customize the contacts application
so you have a nice contacts directory
you have categories you also have
favorites and speed dials as well
there's also a skinned calendar that
gives you a month view week view daily
view and an agenda view the screen is
very responsive for a resistive
touchscreen however our only complaint
is that 2x outer ok a button you may
have to use a fingernail instead of your
fingertip because it's not quite as
responsive and is very hard to press
which is why Samsung probably included
the ok button here on the left hand side
of the device you also have a number of
applications dice is a good way to show
off the accelerometer on the device just
by shaking the device and your you know
throwing two dice around you also have
Ferrari GT evolution solitaire bubble
breaker and it looks like Samson did
away with Microsoft voice command for
nuance voice recognition welcome to
voice recognition by new on use your
voice to dial names in your phonebook
and phone numbers without having to
train other applications include a handy
unit converter a video editor for
editing your 30 frames per second DVD
quality clips let's go ahead and open
Microsoft Word I'm then do a new
document and we're going to go ahead and
use the Samson keypad the keyboard has a
nice visual interface and it does have
auto correction or predictive text at
the top and you can just space out and
it will accept the highlighted one the
visual keyboard or it also has these
swipe engine so you can actually type
without having to lift your finger so it
will connect the dots so let's go ahead
and type keyboard and there's keyboard
that we just type so these wipe engine
is good for people who don't actually
like lifting on their fingers when they
were typing and just want to swipe
across and connect the dots on the
keyboard is actually very good and
attractive the device has built-in GPS
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology the
screen is 3.7 inch it is a very
attractive device and feels a lot bigger
than the competing 3.2 inch HTC Pierre
on competing AT&amp;amp;T wireless network so
this has been a quick first look of the
verizon omnia two with the TouchWiz user
interface and windows mobile 6.5 there's
very few traces of windows mobile 6.5
even some of the settings have been
covered up by Samsung with the TouchWiz
interface and here we have an etiquette
mode so that it will
actually silence the device once you
place it facedown so that's a great
feature if you have a phone call and you
just flip over your device then it will
automatically silence your ringer so
stay tuned to pocket now calm I'm Chun
win and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
