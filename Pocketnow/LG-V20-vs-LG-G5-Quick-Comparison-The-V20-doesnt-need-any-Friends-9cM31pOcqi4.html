opinions delivered in this video and
right off the bat I can't remember a
time where I was more conflicted about
one company's products when looking at
gadgets released in the same year the g5
was an ambitious experiment in
introducing consumers to the idea of
modular Hardware plagued by build
quality scandals LG's greatest sin might
have been poor communication with
consumers about what the g5 was really
made out of following the LG v10 which
was my personal favorite phone of 2015
the g5 was at best underwhelming
now the v20 arrives looking to address
the concerns we had at the beginning of
this year the premium primer paint is
gone the V 20 has a legit metal back
both phones have quick release buttons
on the bottom corners but the V 20 has a
more traditional rear panel granting
access to the battery SIM card and
microSD there's a continuity of design
as the forehead and chin taper away from
the display but the V 20s lines are
noticeably more aggressive both phones
have dual rear cameras in great manual
modes for shooting photos but the g5
removed all video options where the V 20
is an absolute beast
of a video shooter and though both
phones have single front cameras the V
20 retains the trick of shooting either
a standard field of view or an ultra
wide like the rear camera and when it
comes to powering these devices the g5
battery shrank over the g4s but the V 20
gets a modest bump in capacity over the
v10 and the audio oh the audio we in the
United States were denied the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen friend for the g5 what we were
left with was one of the poorer
performing headphone jacks on any phone
released this year at almost any price
point the V 20 headphone jack it's good
it's really good
no modular design no gimmicks just built
right into the phone
v20 owners in the States might be denied
the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen ear buds because of
carrier influence but the hardware built
into the device should still save us
from poor audio playback the fingers
crossed at the end of 2015 if you'd
asked me what I would have wanted for an
LG g5 I would have said I
of v10 Mini that's obviously not what we
got now playing with the V 20 and it's
still early days and testing this phone
but we have a much better feeling about
this device than its G sibling
if LG were to continue offering only one
line of devices to consumers I think you
savvy viewers watching this comparison
might be able to figure out which one we
would prefer as always thanks so much
