interesting dilemma instead of waiting a
full year to make its new flagship
obsolete the company did just that four
months later or did it I'm here even
with pocket now and let's find out this
is one plus three T versus one plus
three some people claim that the one
plus three T is to the one plus three
like the iPhone 6s is to the iPhone 6
and that is right to a certain degree if
you set both devices on a table it's
really very difficult to tell them apart
they're the same design materials
measurements and you can't really tell
the differences in weight distribution
even the cases that work with the one
plus three work with the one plus 3t
like a charm the lack of a T on the
newer model even hints to this being the
same chassis but there are some
differences inside for starters the T
has the newer Snapdragon 801 processor
versus the 820 which we can't even call
old given its launch this year it's
forced 13% larger battery storage
options are still not expandable but
they now extend 228 gigabytes and to go
max storage you'll have to go for the
newer gunmetal color option which I
really like RAM is the same at 6
gigabytes dual SIM card support is still
here and even the primary camera is
technically the same what changes here
is the newer AIS support and the
sapphire lens cover on the camera in
addition to the fact of the selfie
shooter has doubled in megapixels the
1080p optic AMOLED panel is also the
same meaning you will love the punchy
color but this isn't the brightest
AMOLED panel in the market and
everything else you're pretty much
holding the same phone from a hardware
perspective software is a different
story the one plus 3t is rocking the new
or oxygen OS 3.5 with many changes that
are inspired by nougat even if both
devices are actually running marshmallow
this means a new notification shade with
quick launch icons that are
customizable each launcher is nearly
identical allowing for a better approach
to circular icons and icon resizing
across-the-board but the improvements
include a new optimized grid for the
widgets to be able to be resized in a
more efficient manner I really enjoy
using the shelf at the left as well the
new update brings a lighter tone and
more widget customization options and
then there's my favorite feature from
the one plus 3t allowing you to be able
to lock applications whenever you want
with your fingerprint everything else is
more design refinements than anything
else but the principle is the same this
is one of the best and most customizable
Android skins to date with options that
quickly switch between capacitive keys
when you want to in addition to
essentials that the light like the
operation of the notification switch on
the side before switching to the one
plus 3t for my review I was already
working on the after the buzz for the
oneplus three if anything this pulls the
predecessor back into buzz because the T
is actually replacing it in certain
markets and really when you play with
them it's really hard to tell the
difference between using one or the
other it wouldn't even be fair to call
the Snapdragon 820 obsolete as it's only
a year old and both phones show it by
pushing day-to-day tasks and graphics
intensive games like champs about the
only time that I felt differences is in
battery life where the 1 + 3 T is going
a bit longer thanks to the larger
battery and more power efficient
internals and it's also great to see the
Det charging makes a return as you're
actually able to charge a full day of
battery in pretty much 30 minutes or so
I suggest watching once real audio
review for you to learn the more
interesting differences between the
audio of the 1 + 3 T and the 1 + 3 but
from where I stand I just really wish
that the speaker design wasn't really so
easy to muffle the cameras story is a
very interesting one as well except for
the sapphire Glen's cover and the e is
on the 1 + 3 T the hardware is literally
the same you can actually notice that in
the resulting photos even under gloomy
conditions both devices take really good
photos and what pertains the color
saturation
dressed in detail in the light I do
notice the results to be similar meaning
they are good decent now what I call
great with other competing flagships the
selfie shooter now has double the
megapixels and greater low-light
performance in theory at least but I
found the results of both cameras to be
in need of really better stabilization
at least through software and speaking
of stabilization he is is now supported
to make video recording better on the 1
plus 3t and that is true for the most
part playing the video on each device
you really can't tell the difference in
stabilization it's not really until you
pull it into the computer that you
notice that the 1 + 3 T is a little more
superior not actually significant and I
guess the word significant is the best
segue to end this video overall it's
really hard to find differences between
both devices so it's only fair for me to
remind you that one device is not really
designed to compete against the other
the 1 plus 3t replaces the one plus 3 in
certain markets for an extra $30 and
only the latter is being sold in the
rest of the other markets this is pretty
much one plus trying to up the ante in
certain markets given the holiday season
and I think the move was smart given the
reaction we've seen in certain countries
like the UK if you're currently rocking
a one plus three my thoughts are that
you really don't need to upgrade and
mainly because most of the changes that
actually matter are software update away
regardless of your market these are two
devices I highly recommend especially
when you consider all the package you're
getting for $200 less than the nearest
competitor folks just like this we've
