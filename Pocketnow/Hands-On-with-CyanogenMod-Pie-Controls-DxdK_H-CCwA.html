you can install on your Android powered
device that puts your frequently used
apps buttons and information right at
your fingertips
or under your thumb in this case it was
a pie like launcher and it's showing up
more and more in custom roms all over
the place today showing up in
CyanogenMod will go hands-on with it
show you what you need to know if you
want to use this feature on your phone
this is CyanogenMod 10.1 nightly running
on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
it is rooted obviously and it is running
a custom ROM one of the things that I
want to show you here is I can drag up
to get this pie like interface it's not
really a launcher it's just my buttons
time and information the fact that I
don't have a cellular sim in here so I
have no service otherwise that would
show my carrier today's date battery
remaining and the Wi-Fi access point
that I'm connected to you can see over
here I also have my recently used apps
button my home button back button and
I've even added in a little search
button so if I want to go home I can go
home now how do we get to all of this we
come in here and launch our settings
coming into settings the next thing that
we need to do is turn it on to do that
that's under system we come down here
and you'll notice that we now have PI
controls this is turned off by default
so you've got to come in and turn it on
ioanna head and said I wanted mine to be
at the bottom screen border which means
that it is going to override my Google
now so I can no longer drag up for for
Google now if you don't like that change
a different location point I'll show you
away in in just a minute that you can
change that and and move it on the fly
so you don't have to come all the way
back in here that's step one step two
you also have to have your expanded
desktop so essentially that extends your
desktop around on all of the edges it
has to be turned on you can either do
that with the status bar visible or the
status bar hidden it comes by default as
disabled I've chosen status bar visible
and once we've got that done everything
should be good to go so let's go ahead
and go back home we're going to come off
screen you'll notice I don't have my
soft buttons at the bottom of the screen
anymore
I've liberated some of that screen space
and I simply drag up and I can go home I
drag up and sometimes it doesn't work I
drag up sometimes it's just kind of
finicky and I don't know why but that's
something that I'm not alone at so I
just tried it again at work this time I
can go back I can go to search if you
want to reposition your buttons to
another side of the screen simply invoke
the button bar and then you'll see these
little hotspots where if you drag up too
and lift your finger it will anchor them
so let's go ahead and do it off of the
right side so now when I come up off the
bottom I don't get anything but when I
come over from the right side there's my
menu that spike controls for CyanogenMod
10.1 nightly as you can tell it's still
a little rough around the edges and
doesn't do everything that we wanted to
it doesn't even launch apps but it's not
supposed to it's just supposed to free
up those buttons at the bottom of your
device kind of push them off to the side
you like it that's great if you don't
you're with me that's okay too if you
like seeing this kind of stuff make sure
you tell your friends about it on
Facebook Twitter Google+ or any one of
your favorite social networking sites
and while you're at it why not give the
video a big thumbs up for PocketNow
showing off CyanogenMod goodies I'm Joe
