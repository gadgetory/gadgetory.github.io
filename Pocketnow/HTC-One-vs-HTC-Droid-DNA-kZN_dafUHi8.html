year to a fresh new hope for 2013 in
some ways the two latest smartphones
that of HTC couldn't be more different
in others they're very much the same I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is HTC One versus HTC Droid DNA now
we're still relatively new to the HTC
One so rather than make guesses or
premature proclamations we're gonna
leave some conclusions for our full
review follow PocketNow on social media
and subscribe here on YouTube so you
don't miss it to get you the most bang
for your buck though we will be covering
build quality specs user interface
camera performance and a few test notes
let's start with build quality the DNA
and the one looked incredibly similar
from some angles you don't have to read
the HTC logos to be able to see that
these devices definitely come from the
same manufacturer we always found the
DNA's design beautiful especially
considering the 5-inch screen shoehorn
into a relatively slim chassis but side
by side with the one it quickly starts
looking dated yes the soft touch
exterior is more grippy but it's also
more conventional more commonplace the
one's shiny aluminum might scratch over
time but it's absolutely gorgeous in
person and there is a black version
available for a more subtle look the
injection molded detailing really helps
break up the vast expanse of the back
cover something you can't say about the
DNA but the one also retains the palm
kissing curve of the DNA doing away with
the Troublesome USB flap in the process
and the use of metal only increases its
weight over the DNA by five grams it
comes in at a very nice 143 grams all
this combined with the Machine 2 ports
above and below the ones smaller display
for the speakers and the much-ballyhooed
chamfered edge flanking the screen gives
the one a much more mature appearance
than the DNA just like the old one X
helped pull HTC's design language into
the modern era after a dull 2011 the new
HTC One is setting a modern tone for
2013 and sad to say making the DNA seem
quite ho-hum by comparison that
modernization includes the gut
of these devices and the HTC one packs
enhancements there to our global review
unit packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600
running at 1.7 gigahertz that's 200
megahertz faster than the DNA is
Snapdragon s4 pro but both models are
backed up by the same two gigs of ram
neither of these devices offers
expandable memory but the one is much
better off than the DNA with 32 gigs on
board to the DNA's 16 speaking of stuff
you can't remove the 2300 milliamp hour
battery is sealed up inside the HTC One
but at least it's a bit larger than the
DNA's similarly sealed mm 20 milliamp
power pack a good thing because it has
two power bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi a B G and
n NFC and of course the HSPA and LTE
radios that make it a smart phone an O
CDMA here in our global version by the
way moving on to something a fair bit
more visible the screen both of these
panels are s LCD 3 displays putting out
a full 1080p resolution the ones display
is smaller at 4.7 inches and therefore
kicks out 468 ppi to the DNA's 5 inch
441 PPI display color saturation is
excellent blacks are quite deep for an
LCD and sidon visibility is just
unbelievable these screens are as close
to perfect as you can get on a
smartphone in 2013
it's what's displayed on those screens
that's different and here we come to the
interface the Droid DNA shipped with
sense 4 plus the 2012 version of HTC's
Android skin it ran very swiftly on the
DNA but the skin still felt pretty
intrusive and it didn't age gracefully
as we noted in the DNA's recent episode
of after the buzz since desperately
needed a shake up and a shake up is just
what the HTC One provides with Sense 5
will have full impressions in our
forthcoming review but sense 5 is an
improvement in almost every way over its
earlier iteration it's not really any
less intrusive this is still a heavy if
not a heavier Android UI layer but its
flavor has changed from stodgy to hip
and the responsiveness has been kicked
up even further you may not find use for
all the chrome like HTC's new blinkfeed
and not all of the new paradigms feel
like a step forward the new multitasking
screen and home button positioning are
sure to be
polarizing but sense 5 definitely feels
less like another coat of paint over the
same rusting bulkhead it's more like a
ground-up rethinking of HTC's approach
to its skin and that's something we
welcome with open arms
another thing we are always happy to see
is improved camera quality something the
HTC lineup definitely needed the verizon
phone used the same optics as the HTC
One X from last year and produced
similarly disappointing results the HTC
one replaces the DNA's conventional 8
megapixel primary shooter with a 4
megapixel ultra pixel unit so-called
because of the increased pixel size and
a more extensive suite of software
features the results using automatic
settings are encouraging the 1 doesn't
produce the best smartphone results
we've ever seen and therefore megapixel
size means zoom ability is negligible
but on the whole the color balance and
sharpness of the ones photos is good and
it definitely puts out much better
photos than the DNA differences in video
output are more subtle but low-light
performance on the HTC One is amazing
right up there with the Lumia 920's
miracle-working we've covered the Lumia
vs 1 and DNA versus one camera
comparison more extensively in a special
pair of features at pocketnow.com but
there's no getting around it
overall the ones ultra pixel camera
beats the pants off the Droid DNA's
as it should we're continuing to test
the 1 so our findings are preliminary
and it's difficult to get meaningful
results when you're testing a Verizon
device against an unlocked global device
with an AT&amp;amp;T SIM card that said the one
has performed the standard smartphone
duties quite well just like on the Droid
DNA callers say we sound fine over both
earpiece and speakerphone and they come
through just fine on our end as well the
ones forward-firing speakerphone does
offer a much nicer experience than the
DNA's rear-mounted unit in this regard
and that's not confined to phone calls
everything that outputs sound from
Spotify to Netflix is just better
because the sound is coming at you
instead of blasting away from you when
you think of it it's amazing more
manufacturers don't fix this
similar to what we said earlier about
HTC Sense the one as a whole feels much
more like a ground-up rethinking of the
whole smartphone experience than an
iteration on an older concept the Droid
DNA is still an excellent smartphone
with a beautiful display and a flagship
class feature set and the presumed
software update to the new version of
sense will definitely give it some
enhanced staying power but from its
aesthetics to its camera it's very much
a creature of yesterday living in the
world of tomorrow a world the new HTC
one looks more than ready to take on
folks we have much more coming on the
new HTC One in the days and weeks ahead
stay tuned to pocketnow.com for our full
review as well as a whole lot of other
content in the meantime thank you for
watching once again I'm Michael with
PocketNow stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
