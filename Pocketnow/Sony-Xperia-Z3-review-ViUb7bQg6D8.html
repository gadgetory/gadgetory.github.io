build flagship specifications great
performance one of Android's best
cameras on a smartphone we're talking
about the sony xperia z3 but we might as
well refer to the Xperia z2 while the
predecessor was still a phone to get
Sony decided to slightly improve it five
or six months after its introduction was
it really necessary yes according to
Sony and now that we have it we'll see
if it's a phone you should look into I'm
Anton Dean I this is PocketNow and
you're watching the sony xperia z3
review our full text review will land
shortly on the website so make sure to
subscribe to pocket now social media so
you don't miss more details sample
pictures screenshots etc while you read
it you can also follow me on Facebook
Twitter and Google+ the Xperia z3 is
very similar to the Xperia z2 there are
only a few changes but these seem to
make all the difference in certain
aspects starting with the outside of the
device to the untrained eye it looks
just like the Xperia z2 however Sony
rounded up the edges to make the z3 feel
better in the hand you still have the
classic sony glass aluminum sandwich
body
we still have water and thus proofing
but this time sony has managed to
increase its IP ratings on the z3 from
IP 55 and 58 to IP 65 and IB 68 the
front firing stereo speakers on the top
and bottom have been not only redesigned
we now have a smaller cut out for both
of them but have also been improved more
on that later in the review the
notification LED has been repositioned
from behind the earpiece to the top left
edge and the slots for SIM and microSD
are now placed on the same right edge of
the phone the rest looks the same
granted the z3 has now a smaller
footprint at 152 grams and 7.3
millimeters in thickness don't expect to
find Sony's noise cancelling gear buds
that came with the z2 in the box you'll
get a pair of sony MH 750 in-ear
headphones they don't have active noise
cancellation but sound just as good
looking beyond the glass in the loom
them and you'll spot more differences
however only on paper in real life as
you probably see on our XIII versus z2
video
the difference is non-existent or
negligible at best so what's the same
three gigs of RAM and 16 gigs of storage
expandable the camera sensor is also the
same but only in its megapixel count
Sony has improved both the sensor and
lenses in order to offer higher ISO
ratings and wider angles the changes
however start with the display while
we're looking at a 5.2 inch full HD
screen same as before the new unit is
brighter than before though it doesn't
help much in outdoor visibility it's not
bad it's not the best either overall
performance of the display is good color
reproduction brightness and contrast
have been all improved as software
optimization plays an important role it
is definitely one of the best IPS LCD
displays we have seen and you can always
tweak your white balance to suit your
own needs by using sony's own white
balance setting side angle visibility
has been now finally fixed so you won't
have any issues like on the original
models and we're not referring to the z2
you but the z1 and the original Z behind
the screen and improved Qualcomm
Snapdragon processor powers everything
it's a quad-core Snapdragon 801 chip
clocking a 2.5 gigs a tad fast around
paper than the one inside the z2 battery
size has been reduced to 3,100 milliamp
hours that coupled with the brighter
screen and faster processors should
offer shorter battery life but in
reality sony has managed to actually
increase it more on that in our Test
notes all the other specs are identical
to those found on the z2 including NFC
Wi-Fi 802 m ABG and AC Bluetooth 4.0 GPS
sensors and so on oh and you have to
have a nano SIM for the z3 instead of a
micro sim on the z2 button layout has
been get consistent as has the overall
design of the device earpiece front face
sir sensors screen and bottom speaker on
the front USB port magnetic dock
connector lanyard hole on the Left
sim and microSD slots power button
volume rockers and camera button on the
right headphone jack and microphone on
the top nothing on the bottom and the
improved camera with flash and NFC on
the back waking up the device is just a
DoubleTap away and you're being welcomed
by Android 4.4.4 with Sony's own UI on
top of it we said it with the occasion
of our z2 review we'll say it again
Sony's user interface is quite heavy but
it's not at the expense of speed and
performance
the phone is snappier than ever and you
have a lot of customization options
Sony's own what's new section still
shares the swipe up gesture with Google
now but that's something you have to
live with you can also run windowed apps
or small apps but it's far from
Samsung's implementation of multi window
sure you can browse calculate or check
your schedule on top of everything else
but why would you especially with an
implementation like this the
notification tray expands from the top
as usual but swiping with two fingers
brings you straight to the Settings tab
within the shade where you can customize
your icons and shortcuts to your liking
built-in apps like the album or the
Walkman music player are beautifully
designed and fun to use
the app drawer is still easy to navigate
but in general you either like or
dislike sony's own UI there's no middle
ground here you will definitely get used
to it
but if candy like colored icons are not
your thing you'll probably have to
switch to another launcher we would also
really like to be able to play some
shortcuts on the lockscreen but the only
way to customize it is by enabling
widgets and talking about customization
you can change the overall look and feel
of your device by choosing one of the
seven themes available on the phone or
you can download a new one at any time
the 20.7 megapixel camera was the main
selling point on the z1 and z2 and it is
on the z3 as well it's not the same
camera though the z3 sports and improved
sensor which can ramp up its sensitivity
to ISO 12800 and the new wide-angle lens
allows you to capture more these two
combined result in better low-light
images however the lack of optical image
stabilization will often require you to
prop up your device against something in
order to avoid motion and use blur even
if the excellent software image
stabilization bundled the
great job the camera key which should
come standard on every phone and we keep
on saying this and we'll say it again
and again allows you to quickly wake the
device into the camera app snap a
picture or have press to focus the
camera application is packed with modes
though you'll spend most of your time in
Superior Auto and manual and if those
are not enough you can also download
more when it comes to performance we can
easily name the XIII one of the best
cameras on an Android smartphone the
superior auto mode does a great job at
coping with different shooting
conditions and if you want more color
and contrast depending on the scene
you're shooting manual mode allows you
to further improve your stills low-light
performance is excellent we've actually
started complaining at one point that
the camera amplifies the existing light
to an extent where night photos appear
to be taken late in the day not bad at
all oh and you know you can shoot
underwater pictures as well 4k video
recording is available but we shut our
samples in 1080p with the new
intelligent active setting for steady
shot Sony software image stabilization
your videos will look like they've been
shot with a device that features
hardware oh is it's that good we have
nothing to complain when it comes to
video needed in the audio or video
department at the end of the day we love
the camera experience in the z3 from the
quality it delivers to the ease of use
we consider the z3 to be the phone to
offer the best camera experience on an
Android smartphone it's no surprise we
said the same thing about the c2 as well
we think the z2 offers the best overall
camera experience you can find on an
Android smartphone today we spent an
entire week with Xperia z3 on 3G and 4G
networks in Europe we can't complain
about data speeds and reception but we
wish the phone would do a better job and
hanging on to 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi networks
Cole quality was good and people we
talked to sounded good as well and they
said the same about us after we disabled
microphone noise suppression with the
setting on we were told we sounded like
a robot at the end of the 1980 landline
speakerphone performance is also good
and so is media playback on the front
firing speakers which are improved
read the ones on the z to the audio
frequency ranges wider volume is higher
the phone is louder and while it's no
blue sound it's definitely close
you can also enjoy multimedia with the
bundled earphones no they're not the
noise canceling butts the z2 came with
but the audio quality is very good
Sony's own software enhancements play an
important role but it's all thanks to
the hardware we were afraid that the
smaller battery brighter screen and
faster processor would result in shorter
battery life compared to the z2 it's not
the case the z3 performs much better
than the z2 which was no slouch either
we've managed to go for more than two
days on a single charge and still have
9% left with a little over three hours
of screen on time and as well as
moderate to heavy use on a different
attempt we managed to squeeze one and a
half days out of it with more than four
hours of screen on time software
optimization and probably some improved
power efficiency features inside the
newer snapdragon processor allow the
3100 milliamp hour battery to last
longer long enough to satisfy everyone's
needs not to mention that you can also
extend this further by using Sony
stamina mode and the other power related
features like location-based Wi-Fi
expect these numbers to be lower if
you're heavy on games as the z3 doesn't
get as warm as the z2 and it can cope
with any modern demanding game out there
but the battery will deplete faster at
the time of our review the Xperia z3 is
not yet available in the US however this
can change as we're ahead of the US Sony
event happening on October 9 but as
we're currently recording this one day
before you can only import it to the
States if you live in Europe you can
grab it from third-party retailers like
loaded code at UK and the UK or your
local leading online store prices range
from market to market going as high as
800 dollars for an unlock unit of course
out of which a big part is European
value-added tax so should you buy it
it's a small improvement over the z2
which was a small improvement over to z1
will say this if you currently own a z2
you might want to wait for the z4 which
should land early next year if you are
looking to upgrade your current Android
phone or you want to switch platforms
the z3 should definitely be on your top
three list it's got a powerful camera
looking water and dustproof build great
screen excellent performance and
all-around capable device just like its
predecessor the Xperia z3 is also the
Xperia z2 is worth every penny worth
every penny for the full score
