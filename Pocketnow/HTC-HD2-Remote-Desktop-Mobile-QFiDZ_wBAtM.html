now calm and this is a look at remote
desktop mobile on the HTC hd2 windows
mobile has had this capability for many
years now but now with the hd2 we have
multitouch thrown into the mix which
makes a huge difference in your ability
to navigate around a computer desktop so
obviously remote desktop mobile lets you
use the same remote desktop protocol on
your phone that you would use on a
desktop or a laptop a few notes on
settings before I actually log into a
computer and give the demonstration
right now I have it set on high color
because i'm using a local network so
it's really fast if you're using any
sort of cellular data you probably want
to drop that down to 256 color just to
make things a little bit faster i also
have full screen unchecked so that i can
use the keyboard and fit remote desktop
to screen so that I can have the highest
resolution possible so I'm going to
click OK zoom into the screen a little
bit and let's login someone hit connect
and you're here we have the windows 7
login screen so I'm going to bring up
the keyboard and bring it down a little
bit so I can see and type in the
password ok there we go and I'm going to
click the login button this is welcome
and here we are in my computer right now
so right now my computer is open or
computer as they call it in vista and 7
i can click down into the start menu as
if i was sitting right in front of my
computer and go to all programs now
obviously everything is really small
right now here's where the multi-touch
comes in so i can actually pinch to zoom
and use this little selector right how
to get more precise and get closer on
the screen so if we want to open say
microsoft word i can do that with ease
and zoom out and obviously seeing
looking at those buttons up there and
tapping on them is very difficult on
such a small screen or relatively
speaking so i can pinch to zoom go up to
the top choose bold or italics are
underlined zoom in that's pretty much as
much as you can zoom in but it really
helps and of course closing the program
it helps to be able to zoom in to and it
says do you want to save changes no and
you can use it just as
if you were sitting at your computer
with a mouse and a keyboard so the
multi-touch helps tremendously in using
remote desktop mobile and it's great
that HTC was able to integrate this into
a client that has been around for a very
long time but I don't think gets too
much use so that's it for now for more
coverage on the HTC hd2 be sure to

that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
