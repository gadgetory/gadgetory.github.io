the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 were only of
one of them at least from the screen
after some dummy units reveal something
else what works have that we should
expect some new tricks on the iPhone 11
selfie camera along with a new codename
for other features then the issues rog
phone twos price tag is now available
and it seems kind of too good to be true
I'm Jaime Rivera and after much request
the after the bus series is back our
galaxy note 9 video is live make sure
you watch it this is PocketNow daily the
official news they begin with deals if
you're in the market for a Galaxy S 10
II there are a couple of options I
recommend you consider number one Sprint
where you get to pay like 10 bucks a
month for 18 months and if you do the
math that's what the like in total it's
like 240 bucks I know the math doesn't
really add up but with all the fees and
everything it ends up being that amount
which is crazy that amount of money for
that phone is insane but then for
example in the case of Best Buy they
still have it for 350 with all carriers
or at least the most important ones
where if you activate at the moment you
pay 350 but if you activate later you
still pay 550 which is still $200 less
than the retail price you can learn more
about everything in the description now
let's talk about Apple as those
interesting rumors today I have to do
with the company and its plans to buyout
Intel's mobile division at least when it
comes to modems we've known that modems
4 Qualcomm have been superior up to the
point where Intel just gave up and we
heard a couple of months ago that Apple
was interested in buying Intel's
division and now apparently the talks
are getting even more intense 1 billion
dollars for the division it seems that
Apple doesn't want to have a dependency
in just one company which is Qualcomm
they've always split things up which i
think is an understanding it's an
understandable way to do business you
know just don't depend on just one
company I get that we just don't know
when Apple would pull off anything when
it comes to modems at least not even
close to now mainly because I mean until
even gave up with their whole 5g thing
so yeah that's gonna be interesting
now let's talk about Google and a very
interesting and creepy thing that's
happening in New York City particularly
and Miami if you get stopped by any
Google employee offering you a $5 gift
card just to take a photo
it seems that well Google is working on
a secret project that has to do with
improving facial recognition for the
pixel for in pixel for Excel and they
need a larger database think about it as
it's creepy because employees are not
really telling people what it's for and
obviously it's an embargoed phone so
it's not like they're gonna provide any
information so I get it but it's still
creepy I don't think I'd participate in
something like that it still hasn't
happened to me but I'll keep you posted
and let us know in the comments what's
happened to you now let's move the
spotlight over to the asou sorrow gee
phone - it's taken the world by storm
because of all the specs you're getting
but we didn't have a price tag and we
didn't have a launch date just yet
finally now we get it seems that it will
be sold in China by July 31st and now we
have confirmation that the a kikah bite
variant and 128 gigs of storage which is
the entry-level model will cost five
hundred ten dollars or the equivalent
and if you want the maxed out twelve
gigs of RAM and 512 gigs of storage
it's a crazy eight hundred and seventy
bucks now the only problem is that the
ROG phone one didn't launch in the
States not that I remember um we
actually had a hard time getting our
unit and that's the reason why we didn't
do a review was so late but still my god
eight hundred and seventy dollars is
insane I do hope they still have in the
states we'll see and let's move the
spotlight over to Apple and a very
interesting twist when it comes to
iPhones or a couple actually as we know
that the company wants to feel 3d touch
on the iPhone 11s but we didn't exactly
know what the new tap thicker haptic
engine was going to be apparently 2019
iPhones will feature a new revamp taptic
engine codename leap haptics as an
alternative for 3d touch we also hear
that the selfie camera will now feature
slo-mo video and 120 frames per second
we also get confirmation on a feature
from Bloomberg in a report that will
allow you to use the wide-angle camera
to repair photos or videos in which you
cut somebody off we're also expecting a
bigger battery and reverse wireless
charging for airport
and Apple watches again we're not
exactly sure if this is gonna fall for
all three iPhones or just one or
whatever
we'll know soon and finally the most
interesting news that I have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and the note
10 plus or pro because we've been seeing
images and renders of the front and it
seems that that actually wasn't for both
devices right now we've got some new
dummy units of both devices that have
emerged on slash leaks and guess what
well we see no headphone jacks sadly
it's the same design that we saw the
same s-pen and we do see the censored
punch hole with the triple cameras at
the back of the regular note 10 but now
in the case of the larger variant of the
galaxy note whether it's gonna be the
note 10 Pro or no 10 plus you'll notice
that the cutout is larger and because
the rumors are that this note 10 plus or
pro is going to have literally the same
cameras as the Galaxy S 10 5g it could
just be that we're getting a
time-of-flight sensor also on the selfie
camera let us know in the comments down
below what do you think I mean do you
like the idea of this larger punch hole
in the middle to be able to accommodate
these cameras because in my case you
know I tried that time-of-flight it
wasn't really that great I didn't really
find the benefit to it I'd rather this
smaller cut out unless they gave me a
wide-angle selfie camera oh my god that
would be awesome but would love to know
what you think about the design and what
you would like to get on this phone in
the comments down below
