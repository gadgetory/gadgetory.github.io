another calm and since now the only
carriers we've been able to get a
windows phone 7 device on has been
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T so today we're going
to unbox the HTC arrived on sprint which
is the first cdma Windows Phone
available in the United States so let's
get started okay so we'll cut open this
package here from fedex high-tech
packages our fleet us i need scissors
please remove it and look at the box
let's see here on the front of the box
we have the device and it's in its
landscape mode with the full qwerty
keyboard and let's see on this side it
shows what the box includes and on the
back we have a little blurb about the
box and on the side we have our
information so we'll just open it up and
to start off we have our device right
here and feels quite heavy oh and it
just turned on so look at that
apparently the battery is already
installed and the keyboard is pretty
weird it's a spring-loaded screen as you
can see so it springs in and out just
like the other HTC 7 pro so we'll just
set this to the side and we will go
through the rest of the box here yeah as
you around a little bit so we have some
documentation a lot of documentation and
we have our micro USB to USB charge sync
cable and we also have some headphones
that's good some of the other devices
that came out which or Windows Phone 7
devices didn't have any headphones so
oils have a wall charger so let's get to
the device itself so it looks as though
the battery is already critically low so
we'll just go on to the home peel off
this plastic here we have a nice nice
screen and just go to the back more of
plastic and it's pretty interesting
let's see looks like we have to take the
battery cover off like this so the
screen has to be open before the battery
cover comes off and it is a 1500
milliamp hour battery so a good size for
a nice device okay so it should be no
that the device feels rather heavy in
hand the keyboards really nice a full
five row full qwerty keyboard so we're
view more of that oh I wonder if those
are speakers inside they'll have to
check that out anyways to compare it to
some other devices we have an iphone 4
right here and it's a quite a bit thick
but then again it does have a full
qwerty keyboard the samsung focus on
this side so again much thicker than the
samsung focus and the screen is not
nearly as big but it's pretty close
anyway stay tuned for the hardware and
software towards coming up next thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
