pocketnow.com Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich brings a lot of new features to
the table menus have changed there are
new ways to customize your device and in
this video we're going to share with you
our favorite Ice Cream Sandwich tips
let's get to it so just to start things
off a lot of these tips will be focused
on speed and performance and making your
Ice Cream Sandwich device feel faster so
let's get to the tips now so Android Ice
Cream Sandwich has an entirely new
launcher and the launcher has a
persistent Google search bar on top we
get a total of five home screens you can
only have five you can't have two or one
or seven if you'd like you can have up
to 16 icons in the main area and then an
additional four icons in the doc but
that's all and with the high resolution
screen of the Galaxy Nexus you kind of
want to have more icons because the
screen is so crisp and clear it has that
many pixels additionally in the new
version of Android Ice Cream Sandwich
you get a new dock and the dock will
show you a finite number of icons and
when you slide to the right you get a
kind of a 3d view but what if you have
10 pages of icons what if you have a lot
of apps installed on your device well
you're going to be swiping and swiping
and swiping to flip through your
application tray and of course widgets
is now included as part of the
application tray as well which also has
that animated look and feel but what if
you want more icons on your home screen
and more icons in your app launcher to
make it easier to find the apps that
you're looking for well you can install
a third-party launcher on Android 4.0
just like you could do on previous
versions I've actually gone ahead and
installed launcher pro here one of my
favorite launchers of course there are
many launchers like ADW launcher IX out
there and now I can have 30 icons on my
homescreen and I even took away the text
labels to give it that clean look I've
limited to one homescreen there are no
other home screens of course I can have
two three four five six seven if I 1 and
2 with launcher Pro additionally
launcher Pro has a different dock a
different application tray so now I can
see more icons on the screen at one time
I'm back to that vertical list and
thanks to this really high resolution
screen
I can see a ton of icons on the screen
at one at one time much more than the
default built an Android 4.0 launcher so
that is tip number one install a
third-party launcher and be able to take
away those animations and see more icons
on the screen at one time so you're
flicking around less and getting to what
you want to more next thing to talk
about is screen animations and previous
versions of Android you'd have to go
into display settings over here to turn
off screen animations not the case an
Ice Cream Sandwich you actually have to
go to development down here developer
options you scroll down a little bit
you'll see something called window
animation scale and you actually get a
huge range so if we go to 10x things
become really really animated but if you
turn them off what you'll notice is
things become more instant it feels
faster when you turn screen animations
off of course you're taking away some of
the eye candy but in my opinion it makes
the device feel a lot faster when you
turn off screen animations then there's
another item here transition animation
scale can turn that off too that
determines the animation when you
transition from one app to another that
was tip number two number three is the
lock screen in all previous versions of
Android you had to have a lock screen in
Android 4.0 you get a new lock screen
choice facial recognition or you can
turn it off completely which is
fantastic so here we are in settings
though we can go into security and
screen lock and here's a new option none
and I've chosen none so that when I turn
on my device hmm I get right into what
I'm going to do you might be thinking
well what if you accidentally hit a
button in your pocket well of course
this is a capacitive screen so there
unless there are any fingers in my
pocket that are touching my screen which
isn't the case I won't have any missed
presses so I like the to leave the home
screen off certainly it's a bit of a
security issue if you find yourself
leaving your phone out if you're at a
college or university you might want to
leave on the lock screen especially with
one of the security features but if you
like to just get to your phone you know
where your phone is all the time turning
off the lock screen can really help you
to get to that piece of email or go to
that website even faster next thing I
want to talk about is browser tab
management it
changed in Ice Cream Sandwich so here in
the browser we can go into tab
management by going to the tab button
I've got the little quick control set
but of course you can open up the tabs
with the tab button and let's open up a
new tab and then open up a new tab you
can have up to 16 tabs open an Ice Cream
Sandwich which is really fantastic but
what do you do if you want to close them
well we've got two choices you can hit
the X here or you can just swipe them
off the screen very intuitive way to
close the tabs and you are back to
square one and of course if you close
the last tab it thinks you're closing
the app completely along those lines to
exit applications and this is a very
obvious thing of ice cream sandwiches an
obvious feature so of course we have the
multitask UI and did you know to turn
off applications to force close them you
can actually swipe them out of your task
list so if you've got an app that is
using a lot of resources or that has
frozen or you just want to take out all
of the programs that are in memory you
just swipe them off the screen through
the multitask UI and they are gone and
one final tip for Ice Cream Sandwich
took me a long time to figure out where
the phony settings were I use Google
Voice so when I set up a new phone I
have to change the voicemail settings
and I was looking at settings and I
couldn't find it well where our phone
settings it's actually in the phone
application so here in the phone app
you'll find three dots and you can press
settings and boom that will take you
into phone settings it's a little bit
hidden and out of the way but it kind of
makes sense actually to have the phone
settings in the phone itself though it
would be nice to have it in the control
panel so that was a look at some tips
and tricks for Ice Cream Sandwich users
out there that want to get the fastest
experience possible again not everybody
wants to have it fast with no screen
animations certainly some people like to
have the eye candy there which is
totally fine hopefully you enjoyed these
tips if you like this video please give
