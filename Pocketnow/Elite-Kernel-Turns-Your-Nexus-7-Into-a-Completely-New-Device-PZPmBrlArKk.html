tablets that you're going to find it's
affordable it's relatively fast with a
1.2 gigahertz quad-core Tegra 3
processor but there are just some areas
where it could be quicker web browsing
with the Chrome browser in particular so
how does one go about making their
device faster well for one developer it
was releasing what's called the elite
kernel it replaces your stock kernel and
it's like running your Nexus 7 on
afterburners so like I mentioned this is
my Nexus 7 it's the 8 gig variety which
just means that it's got half the
on-board storage is the 16 gig variety
but everything is pretty much the same
let's go ahead and check about tablet
and you can see I'm running android
version 4.1 one and my kernel is 3.1
point 10 - mottely + blah blah blah a
whole bunch of other stuff this is where
all of the magic happens
ok now what do I mean by that first of
all I'm running the stock rom it's the
ROM that came with the phone I have uh
no e/m unlocked it which means it
completely is wiped brand-new that'll
happen anytime you OEM unlock after that
I had to route it after I routed it then
of course I put on my recovery image and
once that was done I was able to flash
this custom kernel so there was a little
bit of homework and legwork involved
there not too terribly difficult because
this is a nexus device but let's go
ahead and take a look we can run set CPU
this is an app that's available free in
the Play Store and you can see over here
my minimum speed is set at 51 megahertz
which is really really slow and my
maximum over here is 1800 megahertz or
1.8 gigahertz some people say with their
Nexus that this is a little bit unstable
for my Nexus it's a little bit unstable
when that's the case you just simply
move this over to 1700 people have had a
lot more success with it we'll see if we
can get by with 1800 without too many
problems now if you notice over here
I'm also running the interactive
governor versus a performance governor
we can go ahead and change that to
however we want performance of course
gets you a little bit more speed once we
have that's and there's lots of other
things you can do in here with voltage
and the governor's and whatnot I'm just
going to be very basic we're going to
set this at 1,800 minimum 1800 maximum
everyday use I don't recommend you do
this you might want to come over here
and do something else like I don't know
somewhere around 300 or 400 megahertz as
the low-end 1600 or 1.6 gigahertz is the
max but for this video let's go all out
with just basics changing the
performance up and changing things to
1800 both high and low once that is done
we're set we're good let's go ahead and
run a benchmark here we're just going to
fire a quadrant because it's got a lot
of stuff that it does not because it's
necessarily the best benchmark on the
market but it's probably one of the
prettiest at least in my opinion so
we're going to go ahead and run this
through first of all you're going to
notice how much quicker this runs then
just regular normal everyday when you're
running it through with a stock kernel
quite a bit faster in fact this is one
of the fastest times that I've seen
quadrant run through and complete what I
want to show you if we watch down here
is our frames per second 104 107 89 110
we're getting into the hundreds of
frames per second on this benchmark and
it's just amazing there are no graphic
anomalies there's no no hiccups no
hesitations over here we've seen in some
other devices will have some anomalies
when the planets kind of cross each
other nothing here it's perfectly clean
this DNA molecule it's usually a little
bit slower and not quite as high res 93
frames per second it's amazingly fast
and looking at it I'm not even getting
what the other people are reporting
because I'm not tweaking the voltages
and whatnot I'm getting 5446 now that's
significant this machine the same thing
without this kernel
Edge's about 3,500 so not quite twice as
fast but a good bit faster let's go
ahead and fire up the the web browser
over here now the web browser that comes
stock of course is called Chrome it's
not the browser browser and the first
thing to look at is just how fast
everything loads in and how smooth the
scrolling is this is where other people
have said hey there are some slowdowns
there are some issues but overall I mean
this it's smooth it's fluid I haven't
noticed the same lagging this the same
jumpiness the same hesitations that you
get when you're just using the stock
kernel it's amazing now I could get in
and run some games and show you that
unfortunately running at this speed I
ran into some compatibility issues and
whatnot and to my eye there wasn't a lot
of difference between running this at
full blown afterburner speed versus
running it on the normal stock I
couldn't see any difference though the
gameplay felt a little bit smoother now
drawbacks this device out of the box is
going to give you between eight and ten
hours of active runtime that's eight
hours of watching an HD video 720p or up
to you know ten maybe even more hours
doing normal everyday activity with
Wi-Fi on with Gmail going out and
getting stuff so real normal everyday
activities and then 300 hours of standby
time running this of course at the
full-blown speed that I just mentioned
to you before 1800 by 1800 you're
running at full speed all the time don't
do that in everyday life okay it's just
going to burn out your battery very fast
and it'll rip right through it it's
amazing in fact you can see here I'm
pegged out at 1800 and let's come back
down to let's say one gate you know
let's say just below this stock so 1100
stock of course is 1200 it will scale up
and down accordingly takes a little bit
of time to do that and setting your
governor to interactive helps a little
bit better as well now if I
back and forth here it still looks
buttery smooth but it's a little
smoother it's a little nicer I don't
have a lot of apps installed on this ROM
but you can see it's very fast it's very
fluid it's very nice even when switching
over to the widgets very fluid very fast
it's what this device should be and then
we get to another downside right back
here on the back of the device it gets
really really hot ridiculously hot don't
run this thing at 1,800 1600 1700 maybe
but it's going to get really hot and
it's going to get things don't end well
when devices get that hot luckily I
didn't have any problem with that
something else that you want to consider
you've got two speakers one over here
one over here when you're running at
1800 eventually you are going to get
weird pops and sounds out of this all
the time not just when you're playing
audio all the time
bump it down to 1700 they usually go
away so that means you're not actually
burning out your speakers we hope not
but it may be you know running the extra
voltage of running the extra extra speed
through the circuit paths that are
around wherever the speaker paths start
and somewhere up in here it introduces
some some extra static so it's not quite
shield enough to to take you all the way
up to the full speed but you know hey
it's its speed it's fast and that's what
we're after here right this is all about
speed absolutely amazing if you want to
do this if you want to get extra speed I
definitely recommend this kernel again
with the few little things that we've
mentioned keep it around 1700 you are
going to have some slower or some
shorter battery lives because you've got
the faster speeds running a few other
things that this kernel does head over
to the article at pocketnow.com there
are some other fancy things that you
might like such as lowering the how dark
the backlight can get so if you're
reading at night you have an even darker
backlight very very nice for reading
awesome I love it you probably will too
there's a whole bunch of other technical
stuff that this kernel does the article
at pocketnow.com will outline all of
that if you've got questions or comments
want to know more about it get the link
to where to download this kernel head
over to pocketnow.com
we'll have a link right down here at the
bottom of the YouTube video if you're
reading this on pocketnow.com of course
you're already there if you like seeing
this kind of stuff how fast we can make
our tablets go and you know maybe even
burn them out in the process make sure
you give the video a big thumbs up for
PocketNow showing off afterburners on
the Nexus 7 I'm Joe Levi
