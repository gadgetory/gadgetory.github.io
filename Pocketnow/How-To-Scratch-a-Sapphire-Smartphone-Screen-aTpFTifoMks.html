that's scratch proof drop proof
waterproof and therefore worry proof is
that true
the company has invited us to put it to
the test it sent along an elaborate kit
for that purpose particularly with
respect to its screen so is this
sapphire screen smartphone really
scratch proof let's find out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now this
is the Kyocera brigadiere let's beat it
up and see how well it fares first a
quick look at the phone itself the bear
grylls endorsed brigadiere is obviously
targeted for outdoorsy types and as such
it skips a bit on the specs beneath its
bulky brawny chassis a Snapdragon 400
powers Android 4.4 on a 4.5 inch 720p
display that's pretty middle-of-the-road
for 2014 but on the bright side there's
a big battery 4G LTE is obviously on
board and the base 16 gigs of storage is
expandable via microSD so how about the
figures that rugged folks care about
well the Brigadier carries ip68 dust and
water immersion protection up to six
feet a little deeper than we're used to
seeing which is nice
along with the military standard 810g
rating covering lots of other damage
scenarios from vibration to extreme
temperatures to salt fog and beyond of
course the biggest durability advantage
Kia is touting is the display protection
which instead of reinforced glass is
made of synthetic sapphire that Kyocera
has spent years perfecting we spent some
time learning about this process in a
visit to GT advanced technologies last
year so it's exciting to finally put
this material to the test in a
real-world setting what we found is that
yes you can scratch a sapphire screen
but it takes some doing and you need to
go beyond what they give you in the box
to test with we started out by the book
popping open the bear grylls pocket
knife Kyocera furnished we liberated
some rounded beach stones from they're
carrying sack and dump them into the
blender like test shaker then we dropped
in the Brigadier and gave it
very best martini shake the result no
damage then we switched to the natural
enemy of all mobile phones steel wool
we've lost count of the number of times
we've popped a phone in the same pocket
as our daily brillo pad and hey well
okay that's never happened but anyway if
you're anything like us you'd expect the
same results we did after pressing as
hard as we could on this display with
this steel wool disaster right instead
nothing there Kyocera was also kind
enough to supply us with a rusty
thirty-six cents so we could do our best
at carving up the display with pocket
change well when that didn't work we
switch to the more direct approach
taking the bear grylls knife directly to
the display
we tried carving a big pocket now pea
into the sapphire can you guess what
happened that's right
not a thing the glass is just as
untarnished and smooth to the touch as
it was out of the box if you're not
surprised by these outcomes we don't
blame you
Kyocera obviously chose its materials
very carefully when offering up review
kits so we upgraded to a bigger screen
cutting knife and we augmented the Round
River stones with some sharp boston-area
red gravel but the Brigadier refused to
yield its display stubbornly staying
unscratched no matter how hard we shook
it and when we tossed it into the water
to wash off the dust we took the
opportunity to test another of kiya
Sera's claims that if you had a gloved
hand say because you're working around
hazardous material you could still use
your phone and once again the Brigadier
delivered but for all its scratch
resistance the sapphire crystal is still
susceptible to impact which is probably
why the phone's display is sunken a few
millimeters into its casing dropping a
smartphone is almost a foregone
conclusion everyone does it at some
point so we did it right on the gravel a
lot
and then we did it on hard stone with
gravel on it even more and that's how we
got the brigadiers sapphire crystal to
succumb a very specific but also quite
common type of impact a fall from three
feet our Brigadier now exhibits several
visible scratches on the display though
not so many as you might expect
considering the rest of the case the
reason for this is simple scratch
resistance isn't the same as impact
resistance even though the rocks we
dropped our review unit onto are
technically softer than sapphire given
enough force of impact it doesn't matter
after all even water can cut steel if
you move it fast enough to kiya Sarah's
credit it only goes so far as to say
that it's sapphire crystal display is
virtually scratch proof and the company
is also going for a longer term type of
durability here in resisting many of the
day-in day-out scratches that plague
most screens the brigadiers panel should
stay stronger longer and no matter how
staged the whole stress test felt at
times there are no trick props in this
kit the knives are sharp the rocks are
hard the wool is steel or at least
something like it given the degree of
abuse we subjected it to kiya Sarah's
homegrown sapphire crystal holds up very
nicely indeed a sapphire crystal is
still a great display material just
don't expect it to be indestructible
