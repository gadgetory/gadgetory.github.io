phones has always been kind of not
attractive for many people HTC is
planning to redefine this this is high
meadow a metaphor pocket now Tony behind
the camera we're at the HTC booth and we
have the htc desire 816 let's go through
it okay now there is nothing absolutely
nothing that's mid tier about this phone
and yet HTC is planning to redefine the
category we notice this desire egg 16
has pretty much everything that you like
from the HTC One or at least a lot of
these features like for example you do
have boom sound you have something
that's stored in area which is a 5
megapixel camera at the front that's
wide angle lens remember HTC brought
this up with the HTC 8x a couple of
years ago then in the back this is a
glossy plastic back but it's you know
it's not a fingerprint magnet obviously
because it's the white variant there are
other color options we have a 5.5 inch
720p display that's IPS LCD aside from
that we also have as I mentioned the 13
megapixel camera at the back with LED
flash and the good thing about this
phone is that we do have expandable
storage up to 128 gigabytes and this
phone is actually the first Android
phone I'd say that sports a nano SIM is
compared to the Micro SIM that we see
everywhere else typical power button
volume rocker here as I mentioned we do
have boom sound this phone is rocking a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor
clocked at 1.6 a converge we have a 2600
milliamp hour battery 1.5 gigabytes of
RAM aside from a gigabytes of storage
and as I mentioned that is expandable to
128 gigs so even though this is a mid
tier device or at least it would be
categorized as that it would be rocking
LTE off the bed and it will be available
at emerging markets now the most
interesting points about this device is
that even though I can't turn it on
because HTC requires us not to this will
be rockin the new version of cents on
Android 4.4 this will be a very
interesting phone and with the 720p
display it is going to be rockin
honestly it feels great in the hand that
remember my hands are big so obviously
this is hard for me to tell you the
phone is bigger small I love the feel in
the hand and I'll tell you this much
this is not mid-tier in my opinion
I really like what I see here but
obviously it will be your opinion soon
Tony behind the camera hi meadow a
letter from PocketNow MWC the HCC booth
that we've got more videos coming up
from this phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
