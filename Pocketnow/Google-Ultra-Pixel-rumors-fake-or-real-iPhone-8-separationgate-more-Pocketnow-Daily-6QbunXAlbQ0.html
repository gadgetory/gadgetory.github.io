get close to the launch of new products
Samsung Galaxy X foldable design
continues to make the batch of rumors to
expect and we're already starting to
hear other rumors of separation gate for
the iPhone 8 I'm Jaime Ravenna and can
anybody get me the Super Nintendo
classic anyone please thank you this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for a new pair of wireless headphones
those are not inexpensive the cheapest I
believe are actually apples hair pods at
one hundred and sixty dollars everything
else can scratch up to two hundred fifty
bucks right now Samsung has got their
last generation icon X for just $49.99
and their store you can learn more about
it in the description that's extremely
cheap and speaking of Samsung we have
been discussing the whole samsung galaxy
X the foldable design it's a project
that Samsung has been working on for
years
because we just got that confirmed by
the company's CEO of mobile DJ Co he
just confirmed that they're working on a
foldable display that they're working on
a foldable smartphone to a certain
degree more like a clamshell again we've
been discussing these rumors now we just
need a date if possible now let's talk
about iPhone 8 separation gate because
there's always one for every iPhone that
launches and apparently we've got two
separate cases one in Taiwan of a user
that was charging his iPhone and then it
separated between the glass and the
chassis out of the blue and then we've
got another case of an iPhone a plus
that arrives separated in X Box it
couldn't mean batteries that are
expanding which is not a good thing
but this is something that's really hard
to confirm and the only reason why we're
covering it is because it came to the
news but really we wait a little for
these to become more significant before
we cover them we'll see what happens and
now it's with the spotlight over to
Google we're just a few days away from
the company's event and apparently
Google pixels smartphones is not the
only thing we should expect there seems
to be a Google home max in the works now
we did see the rumors of a Google home
Mini apparently the max is not just
going to be your typical Google
Assistant speaker it seems that this
will compete against
nose AKA will compete against apples
home pod because that's what all these
companies are doing now whether that's
going to happen or not or whether
they're gonna make you wait so long as
the question and finally the very hot
rumors today have to do with the google
ultrapixel because apparently well this
is you know take this with a grain of
salt
mainly because number one it came from
an anonymous tipster there's a video on
youtube that's currently trending that's
showing that the devices that we've seen
leaked are not real that apparently
there is another google pixel the ultra
pixel which has very little bezels and
it's nothing like the devices that we've
seen that's one thing the biggest
problem is when you have famous tipster
evan blast debunking the rumors claiming
that there is no such thing as a google
ultra pixel that HTC owns the ultra
pixel trademark but that doesn't
necessarily mean that HTC is forced to
allow Google to use it even with the
recent collaboration that's going to
happen anyways it leads me to the
question today do you believe that the
leaks are true do you believe that there
is an ultra pixel device yes or no in my
case that doesn't really matter I can't
wait to see what we get leave us a
