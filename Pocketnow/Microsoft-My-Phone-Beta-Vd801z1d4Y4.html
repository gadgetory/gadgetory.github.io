calm and we're going to take a look at
the new microsoft myphone beta now this
is a cloud service for backing up all
sorts of data on your phone to the
internet using your live ID so over here
you see my windows mobile phones
connected through pocket controller this
is a screen and I've already signed in
with my live ID and now I can check off
all the things that I want to think now
one thing you'll notice is if you have a
exchange account any kind that you're
sinking any kind of data with contact
calendar and tasks will not sync with my
phone you have to completely remove your
exchange account settings in order get
those to think even if all you're doing
is using push email on the exchange
account it won't back up contacts
calendar tasks that's a I think that
should be a bug but anyway I'm going to
hit done and then I'm going to hit sink
and I see it
now we're sinking to the web over here
is the web page and you can see how much
data i'm using right there and over here
is our contacts calendar tasks olives
let's take a look at text messages first
well this is still thinking over here so
you receive all the text messages on my
phone i can just select them and it
shows the location here and i can see
what it says right here date and time it
was sent i can choose in bad stress or
sent messages and I can go through pages
and pages of text messages one cool
thing is i can check off a bunch of them
and then over here I can either delete
them or archive them to the web so
that'll take them off of my phone and
just store them in the web page on the
website look at our photos
you can see that it synced all the
crappy icons that are installed by
default and up here you can upload or
delete or play slideshow this manage
menu where you can choose restore the
phone or our car archives web which will
remove it from the phone but leave it
out here so i'm going to upload one if i
click that correctly oh no oh look at
that it's over here you gotta choose
browse
and then go to
the truth
how about that one
upload and over here i'm still thinking
doing my tats and there's the picture so
when this finishes syncing that picture
should get uploaded to my phone you've
also got videos over here I don't have
any videos music all your ringtones and
whatnot are here documents
txt files
and let's see if anything synced here
ok there we are we have some contacts
join up
we have pages of those
here's our menu again you can find
duplicates archive the web resource the
delete command you can add new contacts
so there's our new contact add photo to
the contact that's pretty nice all sorts
of information for them tasks have
uploaded a few that's thinking well you
can create new ones delete them find
duplicates all the same things calendar
is uploaded to you can do new event and
that happens over here but there's not
much detail as you can add here just the
description where start and end date and
um not to advance not as outlook like as
you might like it to be
ok so that's everything for it's on my
phone now we synced let's see if that
picture shows up
yeps narratives
perfect and right here we have our
connected phones option and I you can
see I have two phones connected they
both say windows mobile 6 professional
and it's hard to identify which is which
you can select them and edit but you
can't put a name in it you just have a
phone number to field here
settings are very slim at this time you
change the time zone it's also deleted
items area kind of like a recycle bin
so that's about it right now I it would
be nice if you could reply to text
messages through the web interface that
would be pretty cool but it's not
possible and I don't see any way to
export the text messages to like a
offline backup you know txt file or
something like that so pretty good if
you your consumer and you don't want to
plug your phone into outlook or the USB
port on your computer and you don't have
an exchange account other than that it's
great for backing up text messages which
is not really possible elsewhere unless
you get something like Jo mobile
companion hopefully we'll see more
development development with the parts
of my phone that's it's now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
