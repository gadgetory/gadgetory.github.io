bought up standard definition on this
droids we have a comparison between the
two devices yeah so the the first thing
to notice is that the picture is much
more vivid and there's a higher contrast
on the actual evo 4g we're here in the
center we've got the droid we can
standard definition then on the other
greens we've got the higher quality
video and if you do a side-by-side you
can really tell the difference and you
notice there's a big quality difference
between high quality content and
standard quality content typically the
only way that he can take advantage of
high quality content with or on YouTube
players because if you had a Wi-Fi
connection and since we have 4G network
that's Mowgli available everywhere you
can actually take advantage of this
video a lot of pixilation dinner
definition over a subpar network like
with Android nose right now so on the
boat we're kind of those we also hear
mention this we have an hdmi for my
bottoms what are their high def things
we do because we have the support yeah
Kevin I'm early excited about this
feature i'll tell you these devices can
cover more with the center as the global
hub in your home and on the go one of
the things we're really excited about is
this hdmi output that you have in the
bottom of the device that which makes
any of gyration my platen LTVs so i
think i want to show you is a i'm going
to play for you a high-definition
side-loaded content for prince of persia
that's coming out later this summer from
jerry bruckheimer existing i think it
will be very impressed by the quality
so I know as we also have a player is
actually being controlled by the device
if you can see your honor have you
wondered how you could have found such a
treasure
the gods have a plan to you
I've seas bound with my own eyes
go to content but you could also do
street behind them I'm end of all right
yeah absolutely one of the things we
want to show you here as this is a evo
4g that's going to play the same trailer
but it's going to stream it over the
mobile 4g broadband network and i'm
going to head up the play here
you're actually Antonio coming out love
the device streaming the same trailer
one of the great features is that you
actually have this fixed and so those of
you watching mobile video before we're
going to watch it to our movie don't
hold in your hand so the kickstand
really helps make that an enjoyable
experience so innovation we haven't paid
megapixel camera on this device what we
do with that high resolution camera we
have the great thing about the 8
megapixel cameras as we all know as the
megapixels go up the size that files go
up and typically if people try to
transmit a polym the size of what an 8
megapixel camera creates it's really
going to take a long time to upload to
your picture mail services so what we've
done is we've actually utilized 4G
network as you'd be able to use the 8
megapixel camera to take a picture and
upload it very quickly on the 4g network
you know the other great thing is we
talked about content is preloaded or
that you can scream but you can also
create your own content because there's
a 720p high-definition camera it allows
you to take your old videos and then
stream them through the hdmi out of your
video schools so the Eco Gordy is
actually a divided house you think your
multimedia experience with you anywhere
but doesn't matter if you I loaded it or
if you're at home if you're away maybe a
hotel room or at the airport moving
screen content or we have your own
content the creative doesn't matter
you can have a full multimedia
experience on this device I'm actually
the demonstration area are going to see
some of the accessories that we've
created to enable that experience to go
to a flat panel TV and very seen this
way so it really does make this unique
device in terms of that control the
media experience we also have on the
front a 1.3 megapixel camera so it
really doesn't able more for social
networking experience that's right one
of these services that we actually load
on here is a service called quick it
allows you to stream video either phone
8 megapixel camera or the 1.3 megapixel
forward facing camera two quick service
or to youtube or even to your facebook
so it doesn't but some of the general
marketplace applications that are
available that really come to life
putting out
yeah so one of the things I want to show
you is an application and talk about
Google Goggles I think this is a good
representation of the current 3g
applications that take full advantage of
all features and specifications we talk
about all this device so for those of
you are familiar with Google Goggles
it's a visual search engine and what it
does is it allows you to use the segment
pixel camera on this device let's say
you want to take a picture of the Eiffel
Tower it can be a magazine cover it can
be a wine bottle like to be the cover of
a book it will actually take that
picture
and what it does it actually scans it
and if you saw that was an immediate
return from google on the search results
