pocketnow.com and this is part one of
the video review for the eaten Blowfish
x650 going through hard we're just going
through with the device offers on the
left side you'll see there's a volume up
volume down button with a that's a voice
command button reset 120 point five
millimeter audio jack which 3.5 to
standard but 2.5 is better than mini USB
and that's practically my point you have
the microphone jack at the bottom you
have a micro SD card which also supports
sdhc for high capacity you have a mini
OS before port for charging which this
practically good you have audio here
charging here not two things at the side
then you have stylist here which is
collapsible one thing I don't like I
don't like even more the fact that it
doesn't stretch the stylus when you pull
it out I like I don't mind classical
styluses but I would like for that to be
better you have a camera button on the
right with a turning on button power
button right here which is good for you
to grip it with your thumb trying to
turn it on in the bottom you have a two
point the megapixel camera with a flash
flash is really nice because it turns on
only when you take the picture so it
doesn't stay on a remain on which is
which is good it also has a flashlight
function then that keeps it on if you
need it you have a speaker right here
you have a rubberized feel at the bottom
and also at the sides with a metallic
sort of finish at the at the middle you
have a start button you have a send
button which doesn't really look like
assembling but it is a gps button which
calls in an e 10 application left
softkey right softkey you have a home
button which actually pulls in a task
manager and an application manager which
is really nice i'll show it on the
software part of the review you have a
joystick control which i must say i
don't i like better a d-pad or probably
a trackball but i'll be testing it out
see if it's really worth the really
worth the benefit and we have an end
button which has the peculiarity that if
you press it once it'll end the call and
we leave at press that also the
disconnects GPRS and an ok button
audio here to add two LED lights and at
the top you have just the GPS insignia
with the lanyard connection if you
compare the device with others for
example my Harold here your knowledge
you'll notice there are the same size
definitely a lot lighter the glofish is
a lot lighter definitely a lot thinner
because you don't have a built-in
keyboard he compared to the ipad there's
a very big difference but it's ass then
which is really good probably one of the
things I like the most about this device
is the vga screen I must say it's
definitely brilliant 2.8 inch screen
with vga is definitely seamless
resolution that looks beautiful I like
it definitely like it out of memory
probably what you'll get even though you
have 256 megabytes of RAM out of which
172-point 74 are accessible then for
program memory only have 64 megabytes of
RAM out of which only 47.2 are mentioned
but you actually only get 20 point 67
which is a something I don't like about
this device it's sad about that you have
a 500 megahertz samson processor you
have FM stereo and don't be confused
even though it does mention it has an FM
transmitter at least this device I got
here doesn't bring it which is a sad
part for it but it's definitely livable
you have the surf star 3 GPS which is
mentioned which is really good sadly
there is no gps application added s as
much as what is offered by eat n put you
could definitely get something third
party that will work for the device as
for now i'm really liking the device i
like the design it's really sleek
probably don't like the fact that you'll
notice there that the battery bay
doesn't fit in flush right here there's
a little separation but nothing nobody
can live with that's pretty much for it
for part one of our video review i'm
going to keep looking at software from
now on the thing is this device has 24
built-in applications so I'm practically
going to have to divide it in two
sections because there's a lot to cover
but I hope you enjoyed it for
