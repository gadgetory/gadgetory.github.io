and this is part two of the video review
for the palms
the UK sim free version in this short
video I just want to show you the media
capabilities of this phone and a couple
of features that it's got don't come
built in first of all there's a program
built into it called P tunes which is a
media player and you can load your media
onto your SD card on the side a micro SD
card and you load up p tunes now this
version over to other admit I've
upgraded this to the full version but it
comes with a really good version built
in and I'll just play you a bit of
Radiohead here so you can see the
quality of the sound
okay that's a really good sound quality
that's just from a small speaker on the
back now and use attached when you
attach the spare pair of speakers at the
bottom there it's really good sound
quality listen to and again it's similar
to other devices that use this format
it's got a library selector here so you
can choose the music that you want to
play and the answer to your playlist and
away you go now it also not out of the
box but if you download a program called
mm player and install it which is it's a
play piece of software it's not free but
you can actually also play videos on
here and I converted a film earlier
using a free downloaded converter and it
plays mp4 format but I've actually got a
copy of mm player here and now I've not
figured out actually how to play things
from mm player but if you do a search on
your card which i will talk about the
files program in a second if you go for
your card and you look for it and then
you can play the movie and you'll see
this now
yeah and you can fast forward your way
through the movie this is the day after
tomorrow one of my favorite films and
you can see the quality of the video is
really good really watchable it doesn't
skip doesn't freeze it's really really
good okay so you can you can play movies
on here not out of the box but you can
play movies so just shows you something
capability this phone it's not just a
chopped down version of a palm phone it
is you still can do an awful lot with it
okay just going through what I did want
to tell you the things that are on here
if okay if I can just take a second
there's a thing called my centro and as
i was talking about the help and support
earlier if you go into my centro you can
actually click on the support tab and
you can see here you've got a full user
guide all built into the phone you've
got support knowledgebase and there's
also some bonus software which comes so
you got solitaire sodoku palm files
which is the farm but the file browser
that i was looking showing you earlier
that i was using and Vox mobile which I
haven't used but is it's a blogging
service there you go vox blogging
service anyway go back here and one of
the things they've added into here as
part of the software package the bundle
i said it is google maps which is really
useful really useful if you go that's a
map of my hometown bognor regis in sunny
england or rainy england is it is at the
moment and you can see this there's a
whole host of functions if i just press
the menu key here you can see you can go
okay i want to find a location well
let's find a node by business so let's
find I want pizzas so there you go
you've got a list of all the things that
you can choose so you use a touchscreen
hey so you've got pieces flowers but I
want to find a pizza so I go okay click
on OK and it will using a GPRS
connection it will find
all the pizza places there we go first
one domino's pizza and that's the one
that I tend to use and now if I tap on
there it says okay there's the details
that's where it is there's the phone
number and I can call them directly from
Miss screen very very nice application
very useful you can also get directions
you can view the satellite just like you
can on others and even those GPRS it's
still a fairly quick download speed as
you can see it's downloading their
satellite photos of dominos pizza and
it's its really fairly quick and that's
not using 3g because this is not a 3g
handset this is a GPRS phone so you can
see it's still fairly responsive and the
rest of the applications are the
standard things you've got your calendar
you've got contacts you've got documents
there so you can do you can view your
Excel spreadsheets your Word documents
PowerPoint view a PDF viewer so it's got
a full a full range there and that is
pretty much everything that's extra on
the palm centro and i would say that if
you're looking to buy a new phone that's
going to fit somewhere in between your
existing non PDA phone and something
that gets you for a good price gets you
into a step up in towards the PDA and
will then then this is a really good
phone to go for so that is my video
review of the sim free UK version of the
palm centro and i'll sign off there and
thanks for listening and watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
