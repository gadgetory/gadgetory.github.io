pocketnow.com and this is our full
review of the Samsung Focus to let's get
to it the first Samsung Focus was among
the first Windows Phone devices and it
turned out to be one of the best based
on the Galaxy S the focus had a
beautiful super amoled display a zippy 1
gigahertz snapdragon cpu and a thin and
light form factor about two years later
AT&amp;amp;T and Samsung bring us the focus too
while not based on the galaxy s3 or even
the galaxy s2 the focus to is an
evolutionary bump that improves upon
almost every aspect of the original
focus plus it's only 50 bucks on a new
two-year contract unchanged is the
display it's the same 4-inch WVGA which
is 800 down by 480 across Super AMOLED
display which is of the pentile variety
unfortunately powering the device is a
higher clock 1.4 gigahertz single core
qualcomm snapdragon cpu with the same
512 megabytes of ram a front-facing vga
camera has been added while the camera
on the back remains unchanged at five
megapixels the battery on the focus to
is larger than the original focus by 250
million Bowers to make for seventeen
hundred and fifty mili amp hours
unfortunately there's only eight
gigabytes of storage included on the
focus two of which six point six
gigabytes are user accessible and you
can't add to it finally the focus to is
an LTE capable device and while AT&amp;amp;T LTE
network is still in its infancy their
hspa+ fallback network is still quite
fast so with the focus to you're likely
to have fast internet no matter where
you are in terms of hardware the focus
to looks a little bit like a toy thanks
to its shiny white coating it also feels
a bit cheap or perhaps light in hand
thanks to the casing being made from
entirely plastic the focus to is rounded
around the corners and on all sides
giving it a more natural in hand feel
than the more angular focus that said
despite being comfortable in hand it's
also very slippery thanks to the smooth
surface that surrounds the entire device
here at the top we have the front-facing
camera the light sensor and the
proximity sensor below the display are
the typical windows phone buttons which
are backlit but unfortunately they have
a pretty
muddy look when illuminated as you can
see here on the back we can see that the
chrome strip that begins on the sides
extends all the way to the top of the
phone which is a nice touch up at the
top is the 5 megapixel camera with the
flash and the speakerphone which we
found the feed plenty loud now onto the
screen we've come to know Samsung Super
AMOLED panels pretty well they provide
fantastic contrast low power consumption
and decent outdoor screen visibility but
sometimes poor viewing angles as you can
see here tilting the phone to the side
gives screen content a greenish tint
another gripe we had about the focus to
screen is the automatic backlight
adjustment which change too easily and
didn't fade making for kind of a jarring
look finally the focus tues display has
a pentile sub-pixel configuration making
text and images appear to be grainy
especially if you look close up the
focus to is running the latest Windows
Phone 7.5 mango software and coupled
with a quick 1.4 gigahertz CPU makes for
a very smooth and fluid experience
windows phone is already a very
responsive operating system but the
focus to is noticeably faster than the
original focus as it should be let's
take a look at some of the built-in
programs most of which are bloatware
from AT&amp;amp;T such as AT&amp;amp;T code scanner
family navigator and others most of
which require you to pay a fee after a
trial period fortunately all these apps
can be easily removed should you want to
clean up your program list let's take a
look at web browsing performance will
load up PocketNow first
page loading times are for the most part
above average when compared to other
smartphones however when you start
browsing a graphically intense page like
we're doing here the focus to can
sputter when trying to reflow text
columns or zoom in on various parts of
the screen oftentimes we saw white
spaces the browser tried to keep up with
our scrolling overall web browsing
performance was good but not amazing now
we tested the focus to over 80 s hspa+
network though it'll work on LTE if it's
available in your market on hspa+ we
clock decent download speeds of about
124 megabits per second down and about
1.5 megabits per second up which is
about average now some test notes
battery life on the focus too thanks to
its larger battery and small screen was
above average with moderate use expect
to get two days of use from the focus to
with heavy use you'll get through an
entire day of course your results will
be slightly worse if you're using the
phone over LTE another test note we grew
tired of the shiny coating on the focus
too after many hours of use it would
become extra slippery from natural hand
oils and while we didn't drop the focus
to during testing we imagined that doing
so will leave the device permanently
scratched you'll definitely want to seek
out a case if you're getting this phone
finally we weren't exactly impressed
with the camera on the focus to and
found it to be actually worse than the
original focus photos came out
oversaturated macro shots were soft and
low-light photos were a bit noisy videos
shot in 720p had similar characteristics
phone calls were clear on the focus to
it has a secondary microphone with noise
cancellation which is useful on a windy
day cellular reception was also quite
good and perhaps a bit above average on
18t you have two other very good choices
if you want a windows phone the Lumia
900 pressed at the mid-range level of
about a hundred bucks has won acclaim
for its fantastic hardware plus it has a
bigger screen if screen size is very
important to you the Titan two with its
4.7 inch display might be your best
option for windows phone but it's much
more expensive at two hundred dollars so
here's what we like it what we don't
like about the focus too we like that
it's only 50 bucks making Windows Phone
accessible to more people we like that
it has a fast and fluid interface helped
by a speedy
view and finally we like that it has LTE
for super fast internet if it's
available in your area we don't like is
that the case is made from plastic
entirely and it's slippery we also
didn't like that the display was pentile
and it had poor viewing angles and
finally 8 gigabytes of storage is just
not enough for a smartphone especially
if you cannot expand it in conclusion
the focus to is a fast and capable LTE
Windows Phone but falls short with
taking photos and with providing a
premium Hardware experience plus enough
storage space to really get you through
a lot of apps and a lot of music and
other multimedia downloads it's priced
right at 50 bucks to allow new people to
experience Windows Phone so we give it a
3.5 out of 5 stars if you like this
video please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
