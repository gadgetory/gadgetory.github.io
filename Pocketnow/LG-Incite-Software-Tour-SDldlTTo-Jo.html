pocket now
calm and this is the software tour of
the LG incite now on the AT&amp;amp;T network
now there's a lot to cover on the
insight in terms of software so I'm
going to stick to just the interesting
things and i'm going to have everything
thoroughly in detail coming up in the
full review on pocketnow.com very soon
ok so here we are now the way that you
turn on the phone is by pressing the
unlock button on the side of the device
and then you press unlock here and
unlock here now every time you press the
screen on the LG incite you get a little
bit of a buzz vibration some haptic
feedback and i think that the haptic
feedback is useful but just when you're
using the keyboard i think it's kind of
a waste of battery life throughout the
operating system but you may feel
differently it's a really a matter of
personal preference right now I have to
have it turned on so you actually may
hear it vibrate every time I tap the
screen so this is the standard new LG
today's screen and I like it a lot
because what it has is a clock on the
top and then it has a link to weather
and we can tap on the little cloud and
get a forecast here and we also have an
icon bar on the bottom and what's pretty
cool is that right in the center is the
standard today screen stuff that you can
turn on and off selectively so right now
I have no unread messages my calendar
appointments no missed calls right there
and I can also minimize all this junk
say it's the weekend and I really don't
care if I have a an email or something
like that I can just press this up arrow
and everything goes away ok now let's
cover these icons along the bottom if we
do the one on the left we go to the
phone application it's a quick way to
get to that one to the right of that is
contacts to the right of that is email
to the right of that is an application
launcher that you can customize so if
there are certain applications that you
launch all the time you can press press
on the plus button here and it will give
you all the applications that you have
on your device after you press register
and so we can choose one from there now
the next button is another launcher that
is more categorized so we have one by
phone one by media one by kind of
productivity shows so it shows you your
calculator stopwatch off this mobile
there's 14 settings and then pressing on
the home button will take you back to
the main home screen now the LG incite
has an accelerometer built-in with
pretty fast screen rotation so let me
show you how
fast that works let me zoom out a little
bit so you can get an idea if I turn it
this way it'll rotate rotate and the
other way and to give you an idea of how
fast this is let me bring out these the
omnia which also a screen rotation and
you can kind of get a feel for how fast
the insight is so here we are in the
same screen and let's rotate both
devices
so the insights actually faster than the
omnia and the screen rotation I don't
know if that's because of this us the
animation that the omnia uses or just
because the insight has actually a
pretty fast refresh on the screen
rotation but that's good to see okay so
before I talk about the programs i want
to talk about input because the insight
doesn't have a keyboard so on-screen
keyboards are really really important so
that you can type text messages fast and
email so i'm going to open up word
mobiles so that i can show you the
on-screen keyboard options and by the
way pretty much everything throughout
the operating system here is is finger
friendly so there's flick scrolling the
screen is sensitive enough where I don't
need to use a stylus which is good
because if you remember in the other
videos you need to carry this thing
around on your phone if you want to use
a stylus which is pretty annoying anyway
so here's one of the on-screen keyboards
it's a shirt type style keyboard and
every time you type a letter you get a
little bit of vibration feedback now you
can turn on t9 text entry if you press
function and then this button right here
so that we can type quicker and of
course it's kind of awkward to type
while shooting this video but let me try
to try to demonstrate how fast you can
go trying to type the creek quick brown
fox well you get the point but there's
actually another on-screen keyboard
which is really good and it only shows
up when you're in landscape let me show
you that here is the full screen
keyboard it's a really really good
keyboard huge letters and and you get
the vibration feedback so it feels like
you're typing on a real keyboard one of
the problems is that it takes up such a
large amount of the screen so over here
if you press this down arrow the bottom
bar disappears so you get a little bit
extra screen space but not that much
this is one of my biggest complaints
with the insight is that this on-screen
keyboard though it is pretty good takes
up a tremendous amount of the screen and
oftentimes it's kind of debilitating and
trying to use the application that
you're typing into
okay here we are back in programs let's
take a look at what we get let's start
off with apps here and apps just take
you to some java based trial where so
there's nothing really interesting here
unfortunately AT&amp;amp;T really likes to load
of their windows mobile phones with java
based trial where we saw it on the AT&amp;amp;T
epics also we can go into games and we
have the standard games but again more
java-based trial we're going down the
list we have messaging we've tools let's
go into there and then we have some
things we have the camera application
gps utility file explorer this comes
with remote desktop which is pretty cool
a full version of sprite backup which is
one of the best backup programs out
there very good let's look at the
browser this is really important this
device comes with netfront browser which
is kind of an older browser that is as
far as i remember based off of pocket
internet explorer and it's different
than opera mobile 9.5 and then it
doesn't let you zoom out all the way to
see the page double tap to go closer so
let me give you an idea of how net-front
works i'm going to go to pocketnow.com
and right now we are over a 3g
connection
ok here we are netfront has finished
loading pocket now calm and I'm going to
flip it over to landscape so we can get
a kind of a wider view of the screen and
there it goes and we have to wait for a
minute for it to reorient itself I see
up here and the little guide doesn't
show that site is being vertical ok
there we go and now we can flick your
finger around and it's being a little
bit slow right now this is why I really
don't like net-front that much here it
goes now it's rendered and you can kind
of slide around the web page as if it
were a piece of paper but zooming around
isn't as intuitive as it is on upper
mobile double tapping doesn't do
anything it's really hard to see the
content that you want although this
guide on the right side is helpful to
see where you are in the whole page I
think you're much better off just
downloading upper mobile 9.5 if you get
this phone because netfront really isn't
up to the task of good HTML browsing ok
let's move down the list we have
cellular video internet sharings let's
see see how the flick scrolling works it
works pretty well we've got media net
pictures and video task manager oh I
wanted to show you something on the
today screen in the upper right corner
there's a direct link to the windows
mobile 6.1 task manager and here it is
on HTC devices that would actually be a
task manager that allows you to end the
program selectively so it's kind of
another step to have to go into here and
if you want to end activesync you do end
task and it goes away ok so that's
pretty much it for programs let's go
into settings and see what we have there
ok let's go into buttons and see what
buttons we can customize and there's
only really two buttons we can customize
the camera button and the voice command
button fortunately this device has a
Microsoft voice command so you can talk
to it without having to train it with
various voice tags you can say call Bob
or what time is it or what is my next
appointment and it will tell you that
information here's another one for clock
style and weather and this dictates how
the clock looks on the today screen if
you remember I'll go back there and show
you you have a choice of clocks and this
is what it looks like we can change the
to a digital clock one or two we can
have an analog clock we can also change
the weather here you saw the weather
being displayed we can
by our city so that it shows us the
weather for our area okay let's go over
to system here and take a look at how
much memory we have unfortunately the
insight doesn't have that much program
memory we only have seventy eight
megabytes available for program memory
compared to about 200 or in the upper
100's on the new HTC devices that are
coming out and that are out right now so
that just may mean that you may be a
little bit limited in how much you can
multitask and to kind of fix that LG has
added this little LG button application
which will let you close programs
completely by pressing the ok or the X
button in the upper right corner because
of course windows mobile by default
doesn't let you do that it hibernates
the program keeps it in program memory
so you can have it close the program
from here let's go down the list we have
video share which we still haven't been
able to test yet because I don't think
many people have video share it's an
extra price and because of it a lot of
people aren't using it and finally let's
go over into connections and this device
does have Wi-Fi which is great so you
can use 3g or Wi-Fi if you don't want to
pay for a data plan and that's pretty
much it for settings now let me show you
the phone application which you can
access by pressing the green phone icon
there or you can get to it by pressing
this phone button there and listen to
how it sounds when you dial it's kind of
interesting it's kind of musical when
you dial it's it's really interesting
and of course if you want to dial from
this screen you want to dial Bob you
would do b.o.b and I don't have any
Bob's listed here so you can quickly
dial phone numbers just like you can in
any windows mobile phone of this type so
I think LG was successful at building a
good mid-level windows mobile phone and
I say mid level because it has
everything in terms of radios and
features that a higher level windows
mobile phone has it has a proximity
sensor hsdpa FM radio Wi-Fi a light
sensor everything like that but at the
same time the screen is grainy it's not
high resolution the screen could be
bigger it doesn't fill up the entire
front of the device the web
others not that great the build quality
is questionable so it's a pretty good
device we're going to have a full
conclusion on the LG incite coming up in
the full review on pocketnow.com of
battery life tests benchmarks and
everything like that so check back for
that soon but that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
