stay in contact with the people that are
important to you in your life has never
been easier but you still need to fire
up your contacts or dialer apps to do so
I'm Joe Levi for PocketNow today I want
to show you an app that makes that much
easier by putting your favorite contacts
in your notification shade let's say I
want to get a hold of my senator in this
case Orrin Hatch from the great state of
Utah to do that I can come into my phone
my phone app my dialer and to start
typing in his phone number if I know it
or I can use some of the search
functionalities in there another way I
can do that is to open my people or my
contacts app come in see if I can find
him it was it under s for Senator o for
Orrin h4 hatch I don't know or I can
just do a quick search not too bad but
it still takes time if I'm inside of
another apps am reading a political
article or whatnot and I want to contact
him right away I've got to get out of
that web browser or Facebook or wherever
it is go back home find my contacts find
him it's just a lot of work well there's
a way you can do that simpler on Android
and that's by creating a widget so I'll
show you that right now it's called the
contact widget and it's just right over
here a lot of people don't know this
exists there's a four by one widget and
a one by one widget you just simply
touch and hold drop that on your home
screen and select who you want that to
contact now you've got a one touch way
to contact whoever it is that you want
by the way if you want to call senator
Hatch's office that's his actual real
number I'm not afraid to give that to
you because it's public information
that's why I'm using public officials
for phone numbers and not you know fans
because you wouldn't want to be woken up
at 2:00 in the morning that having been
said that's still a lot of work and of
course if Orrin had some other ways to
contact him that I had programmed in
Google+ Twitter Facebook all of those
would show up and I can contact him that
way as well this is a very simple
contact card but again what if I'm in
another app isn't there an easier way
well there is and this is it the app is
called contacts notification and it
simply puts up to six of your most
common or frequently or favorite
contacts whatever you want to call them
up in your notification shade let's go
ahead and take a look at it
fire that up very simply we can now come
in here and contact sander or hatch or
contact Andy Rubin from Google or Erica
Griffin from xda-developers let's say I
want to add someone new we're gonna go
ahead and open this up I've created
somebody in here a lot of cameos all my
fans in there hey guys big thumbs up to
you go ahead and choose Benito poppin
Dorf and a thumbs up to one of my other
friends who's doing a cameo in that
picture right there you've got this
right here which lets you choose quickly
if you want to dial their phone number
or send a text message this is of course
not his real phone number and Benito
Papen Dorf is not a real person
but if you want to go ahead and call
that I'll get you to information once I
do that I'm all set I can put up to two
more in there if I want to not show the
toast notification I can do that I'll
show you what that means in just a
minute if you don't want it to start at
boot check that and if you don't want to
show the notification icon up there you
can check that as well
icon size defaults to tiny I've set it
to large that doesn't seem to do
anything at least not for me we'll go
ahead and update it I get a vibration
letting me know that it's updated and
now when I pull that down you can see
mr. Benito Papen Dorf is right there
nothing happens
that's because it's building this card
for the first time if I had my toast
left on I'd get a toast notification in
there saying hey we're creating this
that toast stays up a little bit after
this card has been created so I don't
really like it I'm willing to have the
lag there because I know what it's doing
if we want to come back in contact Andy
Rubin there we go very quick very easy
and once we've opened Benito Papen Dorf
once he's super fast open up again like
an email I can phone I can whatever the
nice thing about this app in addition to
it being free on the Google Play Store
is if I'm in any other app or any other
home screen wherever I may be I am a
swipe and a tap let me do that again to
show you the right way
I am a swipe and a tap away from being
able to contact Benny to pop in Dorf as
long as I'm a little bit patient with it
coming up
we like this kind of stuff if so go
ahead and download it give it a shot let
us know in the comments if you like it
or if you don't make sure you include
why if you liked the video make sure you
give it a thumbs up
why not tell your friends about it on
Facebook Twitter or Google+ or all three
if you're on all three the pocket now
showing off contacts notification for
Android I'm Joe Levi thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
