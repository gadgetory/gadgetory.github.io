pocketnow.com if you have an HTC touch
pro or any variation of that so the AT&amp;amp;T
fuze for example your phone can actually
connect to a projector or a TV to do
video out so you can watch movies on it
you could do a PowerPoint presentation
anything like that trouble is the device
doesn't come with the correct cabling
needed to make that happen you can buy
an HTC tv-out connector but it costs
about twenty-five dollars well the guys
over at pocket pc geeks forum has found
a way to do this with an ipod video out
cable which costs about two dollars on
amazon and i'll post a link on pocketnow
com on how to get that in addition to
that you will need the HTC converter
plug that came with your touch pro and
almost everyone comes with this and it
has a basically a 3.5 2.5 millimeter
headphone jacks plus 2 USB pastors be so
here we are over near the TV and i'm
going to get this connected so first
start off by connecting your the
converter plug here and then turn on the
device and plug in the ipod connector to
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack right
here okay now now there's a program that
you need to install to get this to work
so i will post the link on pocket now on
how to do that it's called enable TV out
you may not be able to see that because
of the low light and it says video out
and then you click done okay so here we
are with the video out working and we
can you know access any program really
obviously or launch a movie or a
powerpoint presentation or anything like
that the quality on the screen is okay i
mean its analog you're not going to get
that great of a of a quality from a
analog device but if you're doing a
presentation or if you just need to get
something on the big screen such as a
picture show or something like that it's
definitely adequate so again i'll post
links on pocketnow.com on how to do all
of this and for two dollars you can have
video out on your HTC touch pro or AT&amp;amp;T
fuze or any other device like that so
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
