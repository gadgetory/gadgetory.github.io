its benefits so long as you're willing
to invest in them one of the products
that takes the most advantage of this is
actually the most underrated as well the
Apple TV and we've decided to spend a
couple of videos showing you what it can
do I'm Hyneman better with pocket now
and let's start with a quick tip on how
to stream your music to your Apple TV
the functionality of the Apple TV has
grown over the years from being a simple
iTunes media player to being one of the
best iOS companion accessories that you
can buy surely you can stream music to a
Bluetooth speaker very easily these days
but Apple users have been able to stream
content and music over Wi-Fi through an
Apple TV for much longer so for the
purpose of this tip you'll need an Apple
TV of course which will cost you $100
your favorite iOS device like an iPad or
an iPhone and hopefully a TV setup
that's not as messy as mine I know sorry
about all the wires in the plasma
reflection and just to quick disclaimer
we're sadly not going to be able to
raise the volume of the music that we're
playing for the purpose of this video to
just the void not getting the video
pulled down over a copyright claim first
thing you'll need is to make sure that
your Apple TV and your iOS device are
both set to the same Wi-Fi network and
for part of this exercise you will also
need for the setup of the Apple TV to
have the same Apple ID that you've used
to purchase music with so for the first
way to stream your purchase content on
an Apple TV you really don't need an
iPhone or an iPad this is where you need
your Apple ID that's the beauty of this
product compared to the chromecast for
example you really don't need a phone
for this product to work this is a
standalone product that includes its own
UI remote control software updates the
whole nine yards simply navigate to the
music menu and your purchase music
should already be there through iTunes
in the cloud if you're an iTunes Match
subscriber like me for an extra twenty
five dollars your playlist in your
entire music library should also be
there available sadly this is the method
that we would probably recommend the
least not because it's not good but
because the UI on the Apple TV is a tad
archaic and really the remote control is
just too simplistic sometimes to
navigate from one point to another can
be extremely cumbersome
the second way is really the coolest and
easiest way to stream your music to your
Apple TV simply slide from the bottom of
your iPhone or iPad to reveal control
center and tap the airplay button and
set it to this particular Apple TV on
the list once you do that every song
that you select will play on the Apple
TV instead of the phone or tablet if you
move the Apple TV's cursor to music you
will also notice that an out playing
section will synchronize to what's on
your phone as well and if you are on any
other window you will notice that you
will get a notification over what song
is coming up next an even cooler trick
is that Apple doesn't really mind that
you use its Apple TV to stream content
from other sources if your Spotify
subscriber for example or any other
streaming service you can also stream
this music to the Apple TV end notice
that if you move the cursor to the music
button again whatever is playing on
Spotify will show up on now playing as
well which is really cool now all that
being said if you really feel like
impressing somebody simply mirror your
display to the Apple TV and use Cover
Flow to make matters even more practical
and enjoy your music from a broader
Wi-Fi distance than the existing
Bluetooth distance limitations folks
this is just the first of a series of
videos there are ton of tricks that you
can do with an Apple TV and with Apple's
AirPlay so please follow us on social
media subscribe to our youtube channel
as well and follow me on twitter heidi
underscore Iveta

you like what you saw I am hi Mary

we will see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
