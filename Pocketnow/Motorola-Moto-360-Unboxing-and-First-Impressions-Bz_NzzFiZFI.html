moto 360 let's unbox it and find out as
one might expect from a SmartWatch with
a round face it comes in a round box and
even the box has a lot of attention to
detail it's got a nice pull tab here to
help you pull the box off sealed kind of
tight inside you'll notice a nice pad
now that's there to cushion the screen
and let me tell you just looking at that
and the screen is beautiful let's go
ahead and open this up and of course
we're gonna do is set the device aside
and look at what else is in here nice
thumb hole to get your finger in and
open it up now inside here we've got a
whole bunch of stuff really heavy
charging cradle go ahead and open that
up just so you can see what it looks
like
very nice almost a soft touch to it I
really really like that
a little bit of a grippy base here and a
microUSB port so that's gonna sit down
on your desk and it's not going to move
around
you've also then got your power cable
let's go ahead and open this up now this
does not have a standard USB cable like
you might expect from a smart phone
because you're not gonna plug this thing
and it's just a wall wart right there
and then a micro USB end on the other
end of the cable also in the box our
QuickStart guides and manuals here's our
power on process how to charge it how to
setup Android wear on your device even
how to find your charge the level and
your charging indicator little LED down
at the the bottom of the device the
bottom of the charging cable very nice
and out of the way so it's not going to
be blinding from across the room so
little attention to detail and then of
course there's our manual so set all of
that aside and let's look at the watch
first of all this this feels kind of
rubbery but leathery kind of a suede at
the same time very soft and pliable
let's go ahead and knock that Center
out we'll look at this and open it up
for the first time I'm impressed with
the the quality of it just just what you
know what let's look that buckle very
well-built looks very nice a little tab
on the buckle blends almost exactly with
the rest of it so it doesn't stick out
relatively thick and a little hole over
here probably for your microphone walk
around the outside of course the michael
fisher moment here we go take the screen
protector off of that come around the
singular button around to the front
very nice chamfered edges over here
chamfered edge on the screen of course
there's that little black bar that you
have where your sensors are hidden
beneath the one that people either love
or hate one of the two
go ahead and push the side button right
there just for a moment slight vibration
Motorola logo another slight vibration
Wow
that's not my watch moving around that's
not my hand moving around that's the
boot animation and let me tell you if
it's not coming across right on
on-camera this thing looks nice just the
colors are beautiful the animations are
sweet I'm totally impressed with this
device already 97% battery life already
it's asking me to go ahead and set this
up but that's for another video
Wow can I just say wow that's that's
beautiful make sure you subscribe to our
video channel and of course follow us on
your favorite social media network we've
got a lot more information coming on
this cool little device in the next few
days and weeks as we do our full review
and additional coverage and you won't
want to miss out on any of that for
PocketNow showing off the latest and
greatest from Motorola I'm Joe Levi
