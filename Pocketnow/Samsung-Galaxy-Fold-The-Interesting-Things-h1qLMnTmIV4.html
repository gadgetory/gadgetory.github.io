the most unique devices money can buy
and also a completely new form factor
that's out to challenge smartphones as
we know them whether its bold enough to
achieve that premises still a little too
hard to predict but the last 48 hours
have taught me a lot I'm high metal you
out out with pocket now let's talk about
the Samsung Galaxy fold in our honeymoon
phase for details on specification Zoar
why this product exists I would highly
recommend you watch our hands-on video
that shed some more lights this video is
more our first impressions which have
been very interesting and really it
begins with the unboxing experience
those of you looking for a more detailed
video head on over to our pocket now I
GT B where this video plays in its full
glory our packaging was a bit fancier in
its presentation but you should be
getting the same internal product box
that we received this means you will be
getting the galaxy fold front and center
and under it you will be getting a
protective case made of Kevlar though
there are some leather variants already
shown in the Samsung store under that
you have Samsung's fast adaptive charger
that's already kind of dated when
compared to newer standards a USB OTG
adapter a pair of galaxy buds which
makes sense given the price and the
small box inside includes a USB a 2 USBC
cable for charging and replacement tips
for the buds
let's remove this plastic for old times
sake
oh yeah setting it up for the first time
is actually not as different as I
expected you're required to open the
full to go through the setup process but
then everything looks nearly the same as
if you were setting up a Galaxy S 10
you're given the option to restore from
an old device I used my s10 plus
expecting Wireless restore to work well
as wired but it didn't I had to go
through the whole process of restoring
from a Google backup and I couldn't go
back to start over sadly it then prompts
you for security which I decided to go
for the more secure fingerprint scanner
sign in to your Samsung Account and then
you're given tips on how to get app
continuity to work before you're sent to
the home screen
sadly my launcher folders weren't ported
so I reverted to Smart Switch to get the
job done for my Galaxy S 10 plus and
voila your Galaxy fold is ready and
honestly I don't think I've ever taken
so long to film a first impressions
video but it's just that the last 48
hours have taught me so much now the
positive front if you like one UI on the
Galaxy S 10 which I do then you'll feel
right at home here nearly the same
animations and the same experience
overall has been brought to the Galaxy
fold Samsung and Google clearly work
hard on having the foldable experience
feel very familiar that said let's jump
into a section that I'd like to call the
interesting things about the Galaxy fold
which are a few and it really starts
with the hardware build seriously it
feels like two phone stacked together
when closed and almost like a tablet
when open there is some minor give if
you grip it when closed and also while
open because it's full of moving parts
so I don't call that a problem
third this is not a pocket friendly
device so unless you like blue jeans I
might recommend you look for a holster
though I can't remember the last time I
saw one of those on sale fourth you
already saw the cases on the internet of
people breaking the display there is a
polymer protecting it you should not
remove it you should not place a screen
protector on top of it so far my device
is working well I'll keep you posted if
something goes wrong
and for those of you complaining about
the crease stay away from dark mode a
white background will hide it better I
honestly don't complain this is a
foldable and like a book for things that
fold you kind of need a crease it comes
with the territory now when it comes to
the software the first interesting thing
is the separate approach to the displays
both inside and out the cover display
seriously feels like more a crutch than
anything you may hear four point six
inches diagonal but the screen is so
tall that you won't find it useful for
more than the basic things and then
there is the fact that the software has
two launchers that only work together in
certain things so for example your
wallpaper won't be the same outside than
in if you create folders inside they
won't work outside which I find to be
the worse and then app continuity works
cool from the outside end then if you
want to do the opposite certain apps
like Twitter will just relaunch and not
work the only thing that I noticed
mirrors is your selection of whether you
want the app tray or not another thing
is the interesting approach to the
keyboard if you want to use the external
display I highly recommend you go into
settings and switch on the swipe
functionality for the Samsung keyboard
as that makes it easier to handle with
one hand the Samsung keyboard also
offers a very convenient split on the
inside my problem and this is more a
personal issue is that I'm not a fan of
its multilingual support I decided to
switch to Swift key because of this
which works great on the inside as a
split keyboard the problem is that it's
not fully optimized yet for the fold so
the cover display will also split the
keyboard which you don't really need and
speaking of fine tuning since the aspect
ratio of the inner display is close to
four by three some applications will
behave weird Instagram stories for
example won't be fully visible and even
if apps like Chrome adapt between
portrait and landscape apps like Gmail
sadly won't but probably the most
interesting question that I have for
Samsung is why move the fingerprint
scanner to the bixby button and not to
the power button I mean I was so used to
the awesome way you can unlock the
Galaxy S 10 II but then on this phone
it's not the same experience
now the cool thing is that there is an
option in settings to have the phone
wake and unlock just by touching the
fingerprint scanner do yourself a favor
and enable this on day one though to
switch it off you will have to use the
power button now a positive interesting
thing about this product is its battery
life I mean the battery size is smaller
and you have a larger screen than the
galaxy s 10 plus but for some reason I'm
able to get more than a day of battery
life here and I'm not playing around
with this product I am really taxing it
to its maximum I'm not using any other
phone as a crutch and seriously this
phone performs far better than I
expected
hopefully it ages this way as well and
then there are the missed opportunities
this phone has six cameras but I feel
that it doesn't really need all of them
if you were to fully extend this phone
this way you have a screen at the bottom
the primary camera is at the top and
this would have been the perfect selfie
machine I don't really understand why
Samsung didn't build this in hopefully
they will bring it in a software update
and I don't mind getting credit for it
but then if we were to talk about the
full-blown camera experience if you like
the galaxy s 10 plus you will definitely
love this phone you literally have the
same versatility of the galaxy s 10 plus
and I initially even thought there was
some extra software tweaking or
something I noticed more detail in the
shots and better low-light performance
but as it turns out it wasn't that the
photos were better you simply have a
bigger canvas to portray them pictures
are more in-your-face and that's
something a conventional phone just
can't give you and I think that that's
the best way to conclude my first
impressions of the samsung galaxy fold
do you need a foldable no are they cool
oh you bet it is and this one in
particular is awesome at first the
experience was a little weird sort of
like that time when I moved from a
BlackBerry keyboard to a full glass
display where the first couple of weeks
were just different they were cumbersome
but every day that I use this product it
continues to grow on me we've got more
videos planned for the Samsung Galaxy
fold so let us know what you would like
for us to compare or what questions you
have for our next video and while you're
at it make sure you follow us on social
media subscribe to both our channels
English
for more videos like this one you'd
follow me on twitter heidi underscore we
did on Instagram but I mean it'll be
data please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw
I'm hanging out we did I think so much
for watching we'll see you on the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
