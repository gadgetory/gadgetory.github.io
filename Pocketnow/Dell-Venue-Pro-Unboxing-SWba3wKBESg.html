pocketnow com the dell venue pro
previously known as the dell lightning
is the last missing piece in the Windows
Phone 7 launch devices it's possibly the
best Windows Phone 7 device thanks to
its huge 4.1 inch AMOLED display it
slide down keyboard and other
interesting features let's get to the
unboxing
ok so again the dell venue pro has a
four point one inch amoled screen bout
by our count that is the largest
shipping AMOLED display most AMOLED
displays max out at about four inches
and the 4.3 inch display smartphones you
see out there have traditional LCD
displays okay here it is now the dell
venue pro is made to work on tmobile so
it's not going to get 3g on 80 but it is
an unlocked phone so you should be able
to put your sim card in if you're using
AT&amp;amp;T and get edge data so let's take a
look at what we have around the box Dell
doesn't really do much in smartphones it
seems like they're going to do more they
have the streak they had the arrow and
now they're doing some Android and
Windows Phone 7 devices so it's
interesting to see how Dell does
smartphone so let's look around the box
here it says 4.1 inch AMOLED screen full
qwerty keyboard has that awesome
slide-out qwerty keyboard in fact
there's not many smartphones in history
that has had this form factor you've got
the blackberry torch the t-mobile shadow
really not that many that have this
really interesting slide down keyboard
design 1 gigahertz processor that's the
Qualcomm Snapdragon same as all the
other windows phone 7 launch devices has
512 megabytes of RAM 5 megapixel camera
Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS here are the bands
you're not going to see any AT&amp;amp;T 3g
bands in there unfortunately so let's
break the seal here and see what we have
in the box all right there we go we've
got the windows phone logo down here
let's see how Dell presents the device
okay right here on the front can't wait
to mess around with the hardware we took
a look at this device in the Windows
Phone 7 launch bar back in the fall but
it has been sort of missing in action
ever since then del thought it was going
to ship in the fall then they pushed it
too early December than mid-december
then they went to late December then
they actually shipped it as you can see
in mid-december it's December 16th today
so a little windows phone 7 quick start
guide we know how to use Windows Phone 7
by now t-mobile SIM card if you want to
get that activated and working
let's see what else dell includes in the
box here with the dell venue pro finally
we get about surprisingly headphones
right yes or some in ear headphones
basic stuff a charger warranty blah blah
blah let's see the dell venue pro we're
actually going to turn it on compare it
for a few minutes next to the Samsung
Focus so it's got a lot of weight to it
and you know for a device that has a
slideout keyboard it's going to one of
the most unique form factor devices
especially for windows phone 7 so here
we have the glorious 4.1 inch display
you know it's got a nice curve to it if
you look at it it's kind of curved that
way which is really unique for a
smartphone curious to see how that
impacts usability so let's take a look
at this keyboard nice spring action
although when we remove all of the
plastic it should slide even easier
we'll talk about the keyboard in a
minute we've got tons of plastic
protection although that's not a not a
problem and it's got a really
interesting backing here it's actually
like a a textured checkerboard like
material which really makes it feel nice
in the hand so we're going to pop out
the the backing here so we can get to
the battery and put in the battery by
the way the battery is over here let's
take a look and see how big it is
interesting to see dil on a battery for
smartphone it's fourteen hundred million
hours alright so let's pop off this back
wow that was easy pop this and we're not
going to put the sim card in just yet
it's going to go without it so pop it in
really easy to insert your your battery
there got a nice flash on the back the
dedicated camera button see if we can
get this on okay here we go let's find
the power button you see the power
button is this it yeah that's the power
button remarkable okay so let's uh let's
let it boot up if that is the power
button and it is screen looks screen it
can already tell you that with the the
Super AMOLED screen or the AMOLED screen
Super AMOLED is Samsung's technology of
course and we'll be back in a sec okay
so it says welcome dell venue pro so
click get started
okay Samara I know accept the terms of
use let's do the recommended Windows
Phone said very nice touch response here
choose timezone let's see if we can get
to eastern time we could probably change
that later so I'm just going to hit next
what's the date today don't really care
about putting any of that stuff in right
now just sort of want to get to the
start screen so we can take a look at
how this compares to a text message
already the samsung focus here which
also has an AMOLED screen i can tell you
actually the Super AMOLED screen from
Samsung looks better then does the dell
venue pro i'm saying that because the
blacks are blacker and you may be able
to see that right here but let's take a
look at how this device feels sort of
first impressions here it is big thick
and heavy gotta tell you that and when
you open the keyboard it gets even
bigger let's just compare it for a sec
in terms of size really weird with this
power button on the top so from the
front they look about the same but
thickness there's just no comparison I'm
telling you this is a hefty device but
of course you get the glorious slide up
keyboard which will turn on the screen
and so let's see how this keyboard
actually feels so we'll go into
messaging it's going to be a fast device
just like the other windows phone 7
launch devices now Windows Phone 7 has a
really good on-screen keyboard so only
the die-hard keyboard users will want to
consider this phone so let's say this is
a test of the keyboard very nice
keyboard us keys are quite small but
there's a good level of tactile feedback
and as you can see it's glowing which is
nice so that when the night time comes
you can actually use use the keyboard
but very very fast has great performance
right out of the box we're going to set
this up and start to use it as our daily
driver and give you a full report with a
full review and a lots of upcoming
videos please give a thumbs up if you
like this video if you've been waiting
for the dell venue pro and thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
