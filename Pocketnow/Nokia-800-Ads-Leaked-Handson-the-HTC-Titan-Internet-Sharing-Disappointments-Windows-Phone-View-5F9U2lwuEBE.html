hundreds first ads we later go hands on
the HTC Titan and what's all the hassle
about internet sharing all the sin more
coming up right now hello everyone I'm
hi I'm every letter with talking out
common welcome to Windows Phone view the
show we wrap up all this week's good and
bad inside the world of Microsoft's
Windows Phone platform let's start this
week off with what's good now what could
a weekend Windows Phone be without some
hot Nokia rumors so far we still don't
have any dates as to when we'll see both
Nokia and Windows Phone together but it
should only be a matter of time the
nokia siri is now being dubbed just the
nokia 808 first popped up in some airtel
banners in india and we later
exclusively leak some ads of the phone
where according to nokia the sun will
rise and set set your calendars for
october 26 and 27 as nokia will be
having their nokia world events and
london and their special guest is none
other than Microsoft and remember
Stephen Elop recently came on record to
state that he will be releasing devices
this quarter so hopefully we will be
getting something good now let's go
through rumor mill and you bet there's
more nokia stuff here to talk about
first of all we got some new nokia code
names like the nokia Sun and the Nokia
Lumia we've just begun to make noise
around though we still don't have any
specs we've also heard about some
Samsung monument out there again we've
only got code names no real specs here
to talk about we recently also leaked
the LG LS 831 which stop by the FCC with
some sinamay bands though we still don't
know if this will be the LG fantasy
that's been talking about and we still
don't know if it'll make it to verizon
or sprint but it's still looking good
its specs though rumors also have
samsung releasing their much expected
focuses on ctia so let's cross our
fingers for that and on the software
side of rumors we also have people
talking about future windows phone 7
versions allowing you to resize your
tiles on the home screen our question
there is what took them so long so
rumors have it will see what will come
up
speaking of releases and updates acer
has just brought a new windows phone to
the table it's called the Allegro and
bring some really compelling specs for
around a hundred and ten bucks unlocked
sadly we only have confirmation that
will reach Europe between Christmas or
probably before but we still don't know
if it'll cross our shores and get to the
US those who've been using the 18 th
tcht 7s and are still waiting for the
mangle up that you'll be happy to know
that it's already available so make sure
you connect your device the zune
software and to see if your upgrade is
already there most likely it will be and
out of our coverage for the week make
sure you look at brandons recent review
of the HTC Titan where it got four stars
out of five so far the device looks
really good really great hardware from
HTC really commanding the vice with that
4.7 inch screen everything looks really
good except for the fact that they could
probably have brought better resolution
to the screen though we're not really
sure if this is actually HTC's fault
probably the software so far the only
thing that wasn't compelling about the
device was the camera performance it
fits really good in the pocket even
though it's really big in size so read
the full review it looks like a really
good device it could probably be your
next gadget now in an interesting job
posting recently Microsoft is looking
for somebody to help him out with the
camera performance of Windows Phone 7
and if you look at brandons recent
review of the AC he tightened well one
of his only complaints is the fact that
the camera was really lacking even
though the sensor was all that it seems
that something is wrong and it most
likely has to do with the software in my
honest opinion I remember that my dell
venue pro did a much better job taking
still photos before the mangle update so
it seems that mangle really did
something wrong with the camera
performance hopefully Microsoft will
figure it out soon probably put some
sort of update that will patch this
because obviously we're not going to be
waiting for the next software release
within a year to be able to take one
good photo so far my images come out all
blurry and it could probably definitely
be the software
now that doesn't for the good let's
continue on with what's bad LG has just
confirmed they'll be pushing internet
sharing to their Optima 7 device and
well why is this in the bad section well
because Microsoft at first confirmed
they be offering all their services to
each of their windows phone devices and
that we wouldn't be seeing fragmentation
when anything was released now the
problem is when you release mango and
you confirm that only manual devices
that were shipped we're going to be
offering internet sharing and then we
see other OEMs being able to provide
internet sharing and then we see people
like Dell not being able to offer it
because they don't want to and see that
they'll has been probably dropping their
whole windows phone lineup for the
future and it's just sad news to see
that some devices will get it and some
devices don't I mean Microsoft
supposedly should have more control of
their OS to be able to push things and
then carriers be able to block it but
still it's sad news to see that
fragmentation has begun in Windows Phone
7 we already know how bad this is an
Android and probably iOS at some point
so sadly we expected more from Microsoft
Windows Phone on this department sad
news to see them we would not be getting
internet sharing on every device out
there anyways that's a Pradesh oh thank
you very much for watching them I'm
every event remember to give us a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
