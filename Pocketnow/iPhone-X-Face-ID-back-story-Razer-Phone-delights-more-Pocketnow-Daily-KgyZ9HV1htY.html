face ID in Wyatt digit ID altogether the
razor phone goes live and yes it is as
beastly as you expected and we get more
leaked information on the HTC you 11
plus I'm Jaime Rivera and yeah that hot
product that I couldn't talk about a
week ago that was the razor phone this
is PocketNow daily
the official news today begin with
information that's long overdue I don't
know exactly why Samsung has to beta
test their versions of Android and they
take so long to launch them while other
companies just do a good job at doing it
but anyways the beta for Oreo are on the
galaxy s 8 NS 8 plus is apparently going
to launch very soon
so that should mean that we should wait
another couple of months for the final
launch oh well now it's all about the
HTC U of xi plus n' i don't even know
why i'm covering this right now if by
the time you're watching this video
it'll most likely be announced at 3 a.m.
still that's when the event is going to
happen at Eastern Time and we've got
some leaked renders that show us what to
expect the only problem is that
according to some sources it doesn't
seem like that this phone is going to
launch in the United States at all so
let's see what happens the spotlight
over to Oppo this is one of those
companies that I do look up to when it
comes to design and surely a lot of its
products lately look like iPhones but it
seems that that's going to change once
again we've got some leaked patents of a
foldable design for an oppo device in
the future the folding design doesn't
necessarily seem enticing but then again
the point is that the company is
actually working on it let's see when we
get something that we can play with now
let's talk about Apple as for those of
you that have been wondering why Apple
had decided to ditch touch ID and this
and that there's a very interesting
article from the TechCrunch in the link
in the description that shows us that
apparently Apple was considering killing
touch ID altogether evidence that
realized that it could do face ID this
well meaning they weren't even testing a
fingerprint scanner under the display or
a fingerprint scanner at the back
apparently ever since the iPhone 10
project began it was all about face ID
this is completely an opposite to the
rumors that we heard that the company
tested many prototypes which is usually
the Apple way but again if you want to
learn more over what happened it's in
the description we can't wait to get our
iPhone tend to tell you more but
apparently not everybody's happy with
face ID and finally the very hot news
that they have to do with the razor
phone probably one of the coolest
products I've seen this year mainly from
a design standpoint from those speakers
from the whole consideration of 100
when he hurts on the display the fact
that it's not necessarily a gaming phone
I'm still not a fan of mobile gangs many
of our pretty much redundant and not
necessarily as powerful as PC games and
that makes all the sense in the world
another thing is I would have loved to
see some sort of a controller that works
with this phone but still it is a
gorgeous design that I am definitely
recommending and that I cannot wait to
get for review but it leads me to the
question today the question I didn't ask
in the video is what did you think about
the razor phone that you like this
device or not again in my case this is
definitely a contender for my personal
daily driver leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
