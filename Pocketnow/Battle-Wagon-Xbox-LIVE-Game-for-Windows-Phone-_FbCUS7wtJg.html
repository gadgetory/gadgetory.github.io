and we're going to do a quick preview of
a new xbox live game for this phone
let's check it out okay here we are with
battlewagon kind of on down a little bit
so we have some cool graphics let's just
jump right into two new game I really
like the graphics on this you start off
with a map and we can go around and a
lot of places are locked because it's a
only have for a little while and we can
choose let's go to this castle and the
object is you're a young king who was
kicked out of Kingdom and you know how
to build a wagons and so right now I see
the wagon and I can scroll over here and
see what kind of obstacles are in the
way and then what else have to do so
let's play and now we can arm this wagon
it's my battle wagon mill put a a what
you call that on the front and you can
choose a cannon as well change the
wheels and you see my weight is getting
too high that's my scale over there so
you can choose all sorts of add-ons to
build on your battle wagon and now I
press play now I have to crank this
thing because it's going to launch the
battle wagon so I got to do this I got
to get it into the green I was going to
plow through all these rocks and
chickens and barricades and barrels and
I want to get it in between those
markers and now i have to slingshot my
cannon to hit those doors so here's my
my bomb is on there i'm going to bring
it back like so maybe how about right
there
oh that didn't go very far let's try
again I'm better right there a little
roll a little bit there we go so that's
the game and I assume that once i unlock
other the other locations here will have
maybe some different types of games with
our battle leg that's treasure where's
my gold ok so let's get back and of
course there's achievements and
leaderboards just few options so it
looks pretty cool and i think i will
enjoy playing this a little bit more so
that's it for battle wagon hope you
enjoyed this video is the thumbs up we
did</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
