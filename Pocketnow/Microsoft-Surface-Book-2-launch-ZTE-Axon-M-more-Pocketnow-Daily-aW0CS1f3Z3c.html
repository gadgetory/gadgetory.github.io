the two displays are not something of
the past
Microsoft announces a new batch of
surface books though it is still
uncertain if the former issues were
addressed and it seems that HTC has
something to announce very soon I'm hi
I'm meadow Rivera recording this in one
city editing on a plane and publishing
in another because it's crazy
this is parking out daily the official
news today begin with a probable event
as HTC seems to have an event scheduled
for November 2nd and what exactly are we
going to get is still up for grabs are
not exactly sure what we're getting but
we do know that the company wants to
continue the legacy of the U 11 it
started with the u ultra then the U 11
let's see exactly what we get this time
now let's talk about Qualcomm as the
company has just announced a couple of
new products at an event in China and
one of these is very compelling it is
the Snapdragon X 50 modem it's got a
name and the most interesting part of it
is that it enables 5g capabilities now
exactly when are we going to get this
architecture on future smart phones
apparently you can't sort of get 5g in
certain devices not all of them it
depends on the spectrum device a lot of
things but once these modems reach
current smartphones in the future
current smartphones of the future that
was bad but anyways you get the point
we should be getting new data speeds up
until then and for those of you that are
wondering which are the best smartphones
are 2017 so far that's rather
interesting Consumer Reports has just
published that regardless of the Galaxy
Note 8 and iPhone 8 it still considers
that the galaxy s 8 and galaxy s 8 plus
are better devices oddly with a software
that's outdated and so many other things
you know I guess my biggest question to
you in the comments is do you trust
consumer reports with these ratings now
let's talk about Microsoft the company
has just announced two new surface books
yes - one of them is a 15-inch the other
is a 13-inch model and even though they
look pretty much the same as the devices
that we got last year the year before
well there seemed to be a ton of
enhancements when it comes to
performance when it comes to the fact
these products apparently will bring
won't bring the quirks that we saw with
the originals
his book whatever the case might be I
can't wait to give him a try even though
you know for many cases when those still
doesn't solve a lot of the needs that I
have when it comes to video editing but
that's just me and finally the very hot
news is they have to do with the ZTE
axon M yes I got to see it a couple of
weeks ago before it was announced and
I'm gonna tell you this much when I
walked and I was like yeah it's another
Kyocera echo but no it's actually not
android has evolved significantly over
all this time up to the point of
allowing this product to be possible and
it's one of those things where you won't
trust it or believe it until you
actually give it a try but it leads me
to the question today I mean you saw our
hands on video what do you think about
the axon M when you invest in a product
like this and let's forget about the
specs let's focus on the experience in
my case I would I definitely would but
leave us a comment down below we'd love
to know what you would do
friends again if you want to get the
news earlier follow us on poking out our
