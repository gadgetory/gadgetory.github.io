and tell you all about it mango goes
live for everybody and more details
emerge on the samsung focus s and focus
flash all this and more coming up right
now hello we're when I'm high a minute
later on with pocketnow.com and welcome
to Windows Phone view the show we wrap
up all this week's good and bad inside
the world of Microsoft's Windows Phone
platform let's start this week off
what's good you know we should start
calling this the Nokia segment because
it's dominating all of our attention we
recently leaked exclusive images of a
Nokia saber which has nothing like what
you've seen on Windows Phones recently
because first of all it focuses on
minimalism with a 3.5 inch display in
this world and monster specs like 1
gigabyte of ram and a 5 megapixel camera
even more interesting is the price tag
at 400 bucks were a little more in this
war unlocked phones it's really
interesting when phones cost a lot more
other recent happenings have nokia using
exclusive fonts for Windows Phone it's
called pure and will it's a pure that's
pretty much it and finally Nokia 800c
rays what's dominating and drooling
everybody in the market images recently
have the device sporting the typical
colors of black blue and pink and well
if you want more about what to expect at
least on the hardware make sure you
catch up on Anton's recent coverage on
the Nokia n9 because it's pretty much a
10-9 with another operating system so
set your calendars for October 26 and 27
because it's nokia world and you bet
we'll be covering everything about it
because according to Steve Ballmer
recently there are a bunch of phones
that are going to be released they're so
interesting enough wait for it and just
when Samsung spends the last couple of
months showing Android a lot of love we
finally get images from none other than
Microsoft and what to expect from the
samsung focus s and a samsung focus
flash as we predicted on our past video
the focus s will look a lot like the
samsung galaxy s2 only cuter smaller
specs obviously because Windows Phone 7
doesn't really need that much power to
run smoothly the focus flashes another
cousin from the samsung omnia w we
recently leaked and roll
sure you catch our website for the
images and what to expect future ly
because hopefully it will be released
probably not on nokia world but soon now
let's talk about the future windows
phones because well first of all we
already know that tango will be the
cheap version of the next generation
device and well Apollo will bring that
dramatic link to a new version of
Windows Phone spec-wise leaks have it
that tango will support hvga resolution
black nothing really interesting there
because it's so last decade but
apparently it will also have smaller
specs on the chassis in comparison to
what we currently have Apollo on the
other hand will be something totally
different first of all LTE support and
dual-core processors will also be in the
option and apparently manufacturers will
also have an option to use anything
that's not snapdragon as they currently
are obligated to use sadly we still
don't have dates when these will be
released most probably you know Windows
Phone could probably surprises with
sending something like tango at the
beginning of next year and well will
most definitely have to wait for Paolo
until next year good news for those of
us that are windows throne enthusiasts
but bad news for those people that are
after having the best because obviously
Android offerings currently have better
specs even though we really don't need
them and Windows Phone anyways now for
those of you that haven't been lucky
enough to get your mango update we've
recently received confirmation from the
Windows Phone blog that that's just
being replied to pretty much everybody
sadly there are some isolated cases of
people that are not receiving the mango
update so make sure you connect your
device to zoom software and see if it's
connected and if you get the update and
it's something goes wrong we'll leave us
a comment down below to see if there's
something we could probably complain
about and probably get your update soon
so far well Microsoft has done a really
good job in deploying mango though there
are a lot of differences and
expectations from carriers that are
pretty much slow in doing what they have
to do but they're working on it and for
those of you that are still waiting for
skype to make that Windows Phone leap
reports have it that the service will be
bringing calls and video calls to
windows phone mango Hansen's very soon
hopefully by the end of this month or
early next month so stay tuned for nokia
world because probably microsoft would
Isis there because most probably Steve
Ballmer will be there releasing devices
and under skype belongs to Microsoft now
so this is the guy that has to stand up
on stage and say hey Skype is up
hopefully okay so that's it for what's
good that's continual with what's bad
ATT seems to begin to phase out devices
recently Windows Phone devices at least
we first learned that the HTC surround
which uniquely brings a slide-out
speaker when those thrown hands it
recently was declared as reaching its
end of life now rumors also have us that
the samsung focus and the LG quantum are
also meeting the same you know fate
because apparently AT&amp;amp;T will phase them
out now we're not sure of AT&amp;amp;T plans to
phase them out before we receive new
windows phone mango handsets but
anything could happen so if you're after
these devices make sure you move quickly
because AT&amp;amp;T is not going to be waiting
for anybody well remember there are new
devices that are coming around the
corner the Titans one of them the
samsung focus as is coming out so i
really sure this is actually bad news
giving new hardware is coming out that
will cost the same money so you know
just make up your mind before something
happens that's it for today show thank
you very much for watching i'm high
memory they don't remember to give us a
thumbs up if you like what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
