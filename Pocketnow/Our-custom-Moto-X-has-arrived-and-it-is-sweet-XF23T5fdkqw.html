design the look and feel of your own
smartphone and have it arrive at your
door just as you'd built it online well
we got a feel for what that's like using
moto maker here at pocket now last week
and Taylor Martin's unit came in a
couple days ago and I just woke up to
this unit on my front porch we're gonna
unbox the Moto X I designed on my very
own see how it came out and hopefully
give you a feel for what it's like to
open up your own customized smartphone
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow
let's get to it so we've got a pretty
good feel of what it's like to unbox the
Moto X in general from our standard
unboxing and the full review and all the
rest of our Moto X coverage but as a
reminder this is the device I'm going to
slice it open as I speak here by the way
it's not often you get to do this in an
unboxing it's not often that it's it's
shrink wrapped right from the factory
this was put together in Fort Worth the
difference as I was saying and this
unboxing is that this was designed by me
using Motorola's customized customizable
customization Ladin whatever moto maker
software which let me choose my colors
my trim colors and stuff we had an
editorial about it last week I should
read this first before I even turn the
power on I wonder what that is all about
ok this is about porting your number and
all that kind of stuff that make sense
makes sense gotta find out where you
gotta have you gotta make sure you got
all the right things to have I'm very
tired alright so let's see oh look at
whoa I'm actually quite excited the
review unit was black and kind of like
unremarkable end but this one will not
be that oh I show you the back plate
first this is my royal blue Moto X my
own design if you will some of you will
find it very ugly others I have more in
common with will like it this is a royal
blue backplate there would be some
engraving here if I had been braver but
I decided to go song's engraving Taylor
Martin's unit
if you want to see that now that we got
the box out of the way we can actually
take a look at the unit see the yellow
trim on the camera bezel there at yellow
trim is also duplicated on the volume
keys and I decided to go for a white
face plate instead of the black figuring
that the black would clash with blue and
hopefully I made the right decision
there it is interesting first of all
it's interesting how this unit looks
with gunner optics on let's go ahead and
take those off and now I can actually
see there is not much contrast between
the yellow and the white but boy it
really pops nicely in the this feel I
was worried about the back cover feeling
different considering it lacks that that
we've finished but it doesn't it's just
as nice the soft touch is wonderful that
dimple is perfect and it feels very very
comfortable to hold in the hand would
get a wider view here we'll go ahead and
power the unit on for the first time and
as it powers on we'll go ahead and peel
our screen protector off yeah that went
and it can wait folks as about say
drinking and driving well that's a
really bad idea to texting and driving
though that that can wait
oh it's interesting okay do not change
your device's orientation while it's
booting it will become confused
just holding the device in your hand and
kind of giving it a spin around for the
first time it's it's it's unlike any
other experience not necessarily because
of the colors or the options and stuff
although there were many and I do like
the colors I chose but because you know
that you you're stuck with this you're
not gonna be able to change this with a
casing or a skin I mean probably do a
scan but it wouldn't look very good you
know or anything like that I mean these
are the colors you've chosen for two
years so you really better like them I
know that I like the blue I like the
yellow I wish that I had had more than
two choices for the faceplate because
I'm not sure I love this the white
faceplate on this device but aside from
that mild bit of concern I think I would
be pretty happy to open up the box to
find a phone like this because I like my
own design
so they're really just a quick look at a
customized motox royal blue yellow
accents on the buttons and a white
faceplate folks do you love it do you
hate it would you have done something
differently would you have done
everything differently most importantly
do you have questions about the process
