packing.com heard you wanted to see some
more Samsung Galaxy s3 so we have the 18
key version right here and we're gonna
unbox it let's check it out alright so
here we go now I was kind of surprised
to see this type of box for an 18 t
phone we have no ATT branding at all
except for just a little logo in the on
the back it doesn't even say ATT and so
this box is all blue so I'm expecting a
blue version of the galaxy s3 which
would be pretty cool you see it slips
out like this let's look at the back a
little bit first so we have 4G LTE 4.8
inch HD Super AMOLED display NFC enabled
AllShare Play 8 makes old rear camera
1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor full
HD 1080p playback and we also have some
logos down here for Android and DivX and
all that kind of thing and I like the
front we have a nice shiny logo there so
let's open this up we go slide it out
I'm gonna get another logo we're gonna
open that up like so you have a Quick
Start Guide there you go and here's the
phone tip don't forget out
some protective plastic on there and
there it is
pretty nice-looking alright I'll just
set that over here for now and let's see
what else we have so that's pretty tight
there's a Spanish man manual and English
on that side alright well so we got
headphones it's all taped in there our
usual microUSB cable and of course the
adapter and our battery appears to be
here so that's what's in the box
and now let's take a look closer look at
the device so peel this off first
there's the top and we have this really
nice-looking brushed metal blue there we
have some sensors the speaker and the
front-facing camera down at the bottom
we have our home button
there's our home button let's take a
little bit back this nice blue color you
can see my fingerprints on the brushed
metal style backing here
there's our camera and a little LED
flash and a another speaker
at the bottom we have our galaxy s3
branding see that over here you got your
micro USB port little microphone on the
side what if we got volume buttons over
here we have a power button this blue
looks really nice
to open the back we got up stick it
fingernail in there and look how bendy
this is there's the back so we can see
inside there's our microphone slot I
believe and a micro SD card slot right
there
so let's put the battery in
like so and can let's look at this
very flimsy feeling well it's it's very
bendy
and that's how you pop it back on
so the power button down there is a
little vibration and we're going to be
up and running
little sampson animation 18t animation
and here we are
I heard is against the councii Nexus
how much for wheat difference
so that's a quick unboxing of the
Samsung Galaxy s3 for 18 t stay tuned
for more on this device including a full
review I hope you enjoyed this video
give us a thumbs up of course and that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
