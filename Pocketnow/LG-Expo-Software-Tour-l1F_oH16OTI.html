and we're here with the software tour of
the LG expo on ATT now right now I'm in
the lock screen this is the default
windows mobile 6.5 lock screen and you
see it goes to the default windows
mobile 6.5 home screen with the sliding
panels this is what's enabled by default
we have our little optical joystick down
here which is really nice very easy to
navigate so I like that but something
that most people aren't probably not
going to find is that the LG expo
actually comes with a special LG
designed user interface so if i go to
start settings today and i swipe to the
side there it is l gittel or LG idols if
you manage to find that we can turn it
on like this and go okay and that's
going to load our LG x-class interface
which is what's called in the manual and
i can swipe this way and get contacts go
this way and get custom media shortcuts
down here we have some shortcuts this
little menu brings up some other options
wireless manager you can shut off all
those things flight mode or lazy
ringtones alerts themes and wallpapers
this is nice because it uses the same
today's screen themes those are right
there that's pretty cool we can change
our wallpaper there's a lot of eighteen
t branded ones
I go back
oh there's also our tutorial you can
learn about this interface how to use it
this will come on actually when you
first turn on the LG idols Beatles
interface and you can learn about how to
use it there's little dots are making
our buttons press let's go ahead there's
the LG menu and rearrange icons
so this will be pretty useful for
learning had enough okay
and let's get out of there
you also have your schedule weather's
nice and notifications no miss calls no
text messages emails are here no
voicemails is about over the back I can
swipe like that and get some more
shortcuts
this LG menu is another new thing these
are all rows of icons that slide around
and down here are settings let's go to
fingerprint sensor this only controls
the optical joystick properties of the
fingerprint sensor doesn't it's not
natural fingerprint recognition settings
but if you happen to go to phone
settings which you would think would be
related to the phone there's actually
themes wallpaper here and backlight I'll
all sorts of options not really phone
related but here we have a lock if I
turn it on and go to detail and I got it
I swipe my finger
I can register fingerprints I already
have some registered and now that's odd
if i go to lock it by holding down the
end call button now i have to scan a
fingerprint to log in if I use one that
is not registered it doesn't let me open
the phone so there you go that's a
really great feature and its really
buried hard to find in here you gotta
touch feedback some more settings their
sensors let's look at that accelerometer
vibration feedback
XD 9 input screen output options since
where we can go TV out or pico projector
that's a attachment that we have to put
on the bottom
and Bluetooth now you'll notice this has
kind of a windows mobile 6.5 point three
interface design and it's very similar
to the bluetooth stack the HTC is using
which is a few thin and a bad thing the
bad thing because it breaks most
programs that need to use bluetooth but
a good thing since if we have a finger
friendly interface it's kind of nice
looking and got some other features like
PC remote so let me go back to our Start
menu speaking of bluetooth we have voice
command on here its version 1.6 point2
and it does work a lot better than the
touch pro 2 if I press the button on my
bluetooth headset it will activate voice
command fairly quickly however because
this bluetooth software is the non
standard version voice command is not
able to announce notifications through
the bluetooth headset which is really
annoying even if you set the options
like this doesn't work ok so soundly LG
menu I'm going to press a button on the
side right here this is the multitasking
task switcher button which is really
nice because we can go quickly to other
programs
and I can close them right from there
that's a really great feature windows
mobile 6.5 default has practically no
way to easily switch tasks you have to
go to the star mega so LG added this
multitasking task switcher button which
works really great so that's definitely
useful so let's go back to the start
menu see what else we have instant
messaging that's our 18t version of that
bios you got am messenger yahoo
messenger we also have ATT Wi-Fi the App
Center mobile web let's look at the
camera there's something cool in here
they people might not find you got your
settings over here can take a picture by
pressing that button and down here is
something cool
see I can flip through these pictures I
can flip to the side
that's pretty neat and it's not
available in any of the other menus to
start menu or the LG menu I couldn't
find it anywhere so that's only
accessible from the camera let's see
what else we got marketplace 18 teen
navigator of course App Center I already
said that apps we have these are mostly
widget type apps two versions of weather
wikipedia msn mobile there you go tools
over here you got search widget this is
another task manager this is the windows
mobile task manager which is often not
included but i like it because we can
easily and I'll task there let's go back
to that tools sprite back up as a nice
inclusion mobile zip proxy manager to
shut off or turn on the 18 feet boxing
manager or the proxy server in case you
have issues with that internet sharing
notes and tasks are here activesync is
hidden in here acrobat reader adobe
reader and enable dial-up networking
let's see what that does
so basically the same as what internet
sharing does you got two programs for
that tethering not sure which is better
or what you would use the other one for
wrote desktop that's good one AB swear I
saw multimedia this is where your
podcast program is mobile video FM radio
this does have an FM radio RSS reader 18
to music has a bunch of music programs
XM radio music ID shot music music
videos music sync and then we have music
apps which goes to a web page all right
don't need that Windows Live does not
have include windows live messenger
office mobile of course the usual
suspects I'm going to go back there file
explorer is there and when is meted
players here pushes in videos and these
programs i added those have to install
all right now let's go back to the LG
menu let's see if there's something we
missed here
I can scroll most of these are still
though oh there's our multitasking
button see that brings up the
multitasking program which is also easy
hardware button here's something we
missed photo album this is a LG designed
interface it gives us another way to
view pictures
alright what's my multimedia another
program we missed
LG contacts this is another different
program different from normal contacts
we have big buttons and you can flick
through and you got a big scrollbar here
there's a couple other programs we
missed stopwatch and tip calculator whoo
okay so that's LG menu now another thing
and show you when i go to landscape mode
this is all you get you know in the LG s
class interface so not many options here
but we have hardware keys for accessing
the Start menu but I can't type
something and jump quickly to as a
specific program that's disabled by
windows mobile 6.5 they remove that
unfortunately and if i go to program
normally with a keyboard interface I can
see underlined letters here that allow
me to jump quickly to a specific menu
item but that seems to be gone here
however if I type the letter if I know
what the letter is I can activate those
menu items see it's just that the the
mnemonics are invisible to the user
unfortunately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
