pocket now calm the iphone 4 has a
Retina display and in this video we're
gonna talk about what that means and
whether it actually matters when you're
using the phone let's get to it so first
a little bit of background on screen
resolution and display technology and
sorry if this is a little bit of a
review for some of you just want to set
sort of a foundation here screen
resolution determines how many pixels
there are on a screen and pixels are
what make up the picture
so usually screen resolution is measured
in pixels down versus pixels across so
you have Q VGA which was around heavily
in the early 2000s on I pax on the early
palm devices which was 320 down and 240
across if you've ever seen a qbg a
screen you know that the quality is
horrible you see lots of pixels images
are blocky text is hard to read it's not
a pretty picture and then in the
mid-2000s we started to see VGA which
was double QVGA so that's 640 down and
480 across and then towards 2008-2009 we
started to see screen resolutions max
out for Android and Windows Mobile at
800 down and 480 across which still is
pretty high resolution for a device that
only has a screen that is the size of
you know this are a little bit bigger
but then Apple came along and said you
know we're gonna do something a little
bit different we're going to go much
higher than that do 960 down and 640
across the results of which is that the
pixels are so tiny that you can't see
them why is this well let me show you
okay so what I have on my monitor right
now is a swath that is 480 by 320 pixels
that's the same resolution of the
outgoing iPhone now this monitor has
pixels large enough to where if you sit
about three inches away you can see them
you can actually see the pixels that
make up the screen now if I hold up an
iPhone 3GS next to this swath in order
to get from that to this they had to
shrink the pixels a little bit to a
point where you still can see pixels on
the iPhone 3GS if you put your eye close
to it but for the iPhone 4 what they've
done is
taking an area this big which is 960 by
640 this comes out this 326 PPI and have
packed it into a size this big what's
the only way you can get an area with
this many pixels into a space this big
you make the pixels really really small
that is why the Retina display is so
unusual because the pixels are so tiny
there are so many pixels per square inch
that you're I truly cannot see them
unless you use a magnifying glass so
let's get to some hands-on
demonstrations so in practice the
high-resolution retina supportin is half
there let me explain why what is zoom in
on the screen a little bit and what
Apple has done is upgraded any operating
system level graphics like text and
buttons to be supported so
out-of-the-box applications that are
using the operating system elements text
and and graphics will have a higher
resolution look but the author of the
program still has to go in there and
upgrade everything manually like icons
let me give you an example I'm going to
try to zoom in on the maps icon which is
super super crisp and it just got blurry
let me get to the sweet spot here it is
so hopefully you're watching this in
high-definition
you can see how crisp and clear that
map's icon is it looks painted on the
screen now if we look at the analytics
application here that hasn't been
upgraded to is oh I oh s4 with retina
support so it's a little bit more blurry
same thing with the Facebook icon it's
not perfectly scaled to the retina
display down here the weather channel
icon is not perfectly scaled let me try
to get out a magnifying glass I don't
know how well this is going to work and
this will become even more apparent so
let's see here so if we go into the
smaller lens here perfect look at the
maps icon look how crisp and clear it is
and then look at the analytics icon not
so much it's got some jaggies on it I
know it's tough to see on camera but try
to bear with me look at the camera
application this is high resolution very
crisp and clear but the weather channel
not so much you can almost see a little
bit of feathering around the letters
because they haven't upgraded this to
iOS 4 so let's drill into an application
that has an
have been upgraded to iOS four with the
retina support so we're gonna go into
the Weather Channel has not been updated
and you're gonna see why in a sec okay
so text is super clear and crisp because
this is being rendered at the operating
system level but if we look at certain
graphics let me try to get to certain
graphics maybe go up here the
advertisement it's not scaling properly
to the really high resolution screen
when you get this through other
applications as well so let me drill out
and go into se and doodle jump so doodle
jump works but it hasn't been upgraded
for a retina support so let's see if you
can see this
there are jaggies around the word play
and if we go into here we see pixel
doubling and it just doesn't look quite
right but there are some applications
that have been completely updated for
iOS for support like gun-range this is
an awesome awesome game you could look
at the text right now it's just doing a
loading screen look how crisp and clear
that is I'm just gonna play this for
about a second just so you can see that
this has no jaggies it's super super
crisp and clear using all 960 by 640
pixels this is the first game to use the
gyroscope and it is a lot of fun it's
$1.00 in the App Store so
oddly it is not working oh there goes oh
I think I have the gyroscopes turned off
because I'm manually moving around the
screen but hopefully you can see how
crisp and clear this is look at the the
smaller magnifying lens very well done
okay let's do in comparison here so with
the Google Nexus One the iPhone 3GS
iPhone 4 and the HTC hd2 both of these
devices have 800 down and 480 across
resolution the iPhone 3GS has 480 down
and 360 across and of course the iPhone
4 has 960 down and 640 across I'm going
to go to the same webpage on all of
these devices and not zoom in so you can
see the zoom dot view so let's get
started with that and I'll cut back in a
second when I'm there ok and here we are
and what I'm looking for is text
readability that's why I want to show
you in this segment of the video so I'm
gonna take each of these individually
and show you what it looks like without
zooming in so right now I cannot read
the text I don't know about you but it's
it's blurry it's small and in order to
read the text of this webpage I would
have to pinch to zoom zoom in a little
bit okay I'm gonna go to the iphone 3gs
also very blurry I cannot read the text
it looks a lot more pixelated than on
the Nexus One because there are fewer
pixels by bringing over the iPhone 4 the
story changes I can read the text
because there are so many pixels making
up these little letters even though
they're really really small on the
screen a fair number of pixels are still
being utilized to draw that on the
display and then if we shoot over to the
HTC hd2 I still can't read that I'm
going to have to zoom in in order to
read the text but on the iPhone 4 that
is not the case don't need to zoom in
can less I 1 2 so in terms of zooming
less the iPhone 4 really helps
tremendously I find that oftentimes I
don't zoom in on a website I just kind
of flicked down in this zoomed out view
which saves me a lot of time and a lot
of finger travel now let's take a look
at how text appears in the Amazon Kindle
application now that it's on Android I
can show it to you on the Nexus One so
I'm going to go into the Kindle app over
here and likewise on the Nexus One and
should synchronize to the exact same
page on a book that I'm reading let me
unlock the screen here okay so here we
are on the same exact screen and this is
where the sort of limiting factor of so
many pixels comes into play the text on
the iPhone 4s display looks painted on
it's absolutely gorgeous but it also
looks very very good on the Nexus One
which has also a lot of pixels on the
screen
not as many where the difference is and
I don't know if you can see that we may
need the magnifying glass look at where
it says so when people complain here it
is so when people complain you see it
there keep that in mind and I'm gonna go
over here so when people complain the
text is a little bit more fuzzy on the
Nexus One because it has fewer pixels
but not that big of a deal so in terms
of reading books and reading text a
device with a high-res screen like the
Nexus One like the Droid the Droid X all
of those devices not much of a
difference but going from the iPhone 3GS
to the iPhone 4 is just a monumental
jump in terms of text readability let me
bring up the New York Times application
because this is even more impressive I
can make the text much larger and when I
do that you really get to see the screen
shine I mean even though the text is
massive again you do not see pixels it's
just really really difficult to see them
on the screen another place that the
iPhone 4 really shines is in looking at
photos so I'm gonna bring up my photo
gallery here let me jump to something
interesting okay so here's a picture I
took of a back of a car that has a name
of a dealership and the clarity is just
mind-blowing it's a picture of text and
even if i zoom in a lot you cannot see
you cannot see pixels there are no
jaggies the quality is absolutely
fantastic let me play some YouTube video
for you so you can get an idea of how
the video playback is and I don't know
what that is so let's go to okay that
looks good to me let's check this out
just outstanding quality on the retina
display super crisp and super clear it
looks like high-definition from where
I'm standing right now and one more
final note before we wrap up outdoor
screen visibility you know a lot of
phones aren't so great with outdoor
screen visibility especially AMOLED
displays like the Google Nexus One and
the Droid Incredible the iPhone 4 does
an awesome awesome job in fact it's the
best screen I've seen outside and Brunt
bright sunlight ever I played with in a
Super AMOLED display which comes close
they are on the Samsung Galaxy S series
and on the samsung galaxy wave but in my
opinion the the iPhone 4 screen is the
best in terms of clarity outdoor screen
visibility color reproduction and
contrast hands-down the retina display
is fantastic they really need to get
developers to update more applications
because there are still places where you
get a little bit of jaggies because
these the application hasn't been
upgraded for the retina support so to
answer the question in the beginning of
the video does the retina display matter
yes it does matter in fact I think that
we are going to see manufacturers come
up with higher resolution displays
trouble as a software doesn't support
Android doesn't support over 854 by 480
Windows Phone 7 doesn't new above 800 by
480 so we are going to have to see this
actually can out over a couple of years
as Google and Microsoft and the other
smartphone operating system purveyors
out there come up with ways to boost
screen resolution because more pixels is
absolutely better but of course there's
a law of diminishing return once you get
past about 300 PPI the human eye can't
detect any difference so I hope you
enjoyed this video please give it a
thumbs up Retina display is awesome
can't wait for higher resolution
displays coming out across the board in
the future that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
