and I'm proud to bring you this
exclusive unboxing video of the t-mobile
shadow the newest device for t-mobile's
Elena first things first let's get a
good look at this box we got a nice
embossed image of the t-mobile shadow on
the front some more icons on the side a
list of what is in the box then on the
back some of the things that the
t-mobile shadow is capable of ok let's
open this thing up alright we have this
nice high quality box feels pretty tough
feels like our shadows going to arrive
in good order let's open it up look at
that we got a tmobile shadow on board
alright we'll take that out and I'm
going to set that right there take this
foam out of here and we have some more
covers in hands what's under here first
looks like we got some user manuals this
plastic got a tips and tricks guide with
some really quick reference for the
tmobile shadow we have a start guide
this is appears to be a poster in case
you have some wall space you want to
take up and we have a user manual sings
pretty thick for all that in-depth
knowledge it's actually 211 pages with
the index so be sure you set some time
aside read that limited warranty
microsoft software agreement and a
getting started CD i connect that to
your pc probably has activesync on there
for you alright let's see what else we
got here we have a carrying case good
a nice soft leather it's got a magnetic
attachment there and a belt loop back
there one else we have we've got an
audio charging cable and you open right
up it appears that the tmobile shadow
has a proprietary connector on the for
the tmobile shadow for charging and
whatnot it almost looks like a mini USB
but it's some different type of mini USB
I guarantee you don't have this cable
laying around it appears that you're
going to need this attachment to charge
your tmobile shadow it has a normal mini
USB and another proprietary there I
guess we'll find out what that's for
later do not lose this I guarantee it's
going to cause you some problems and we
got a charging cable seems to be the AC
adapter all right AC adapter that's mini
USB right there get some focus alright
and then we peers that we have five
volts one amp set that aside most men
will be have a stereo headset
some soft ear cell cushions for your
headset and it appears that t-mobile
isn't going easy on us with this
proprietary attachment again we have
this here's the attachment again and it
it's about the same size as a mini USB
but not quite there we'll get a good
look at that later I'll find out what
the exact specification of that is let
you know and finally a USB sinking cable
for syncing to your computer and the end
of this is mini USB so that appears to
plug into here to our little chart and
thinner and then on the headphones I
suppose we can listen to music while
it's charging so how often we're going
to do that I'm wondering about this how
valuable this is going to become alright
so let's move all that out of the way
and get a good look at the shadow all
right there's the case now for the
t-mobile shadow as you can see you might
be able to see I've already gotten some
dust and some fingerprints on the the
top here except it's really shiny and
slick the back real soft and we got a 2
megapixel camera the speaker the battery
compartment see under here ah the sim
card goes into there so you can get a
good look in there all right and this
little metal tray slides out so you can
pull your SIM card out push back in when
you're not pulling it out the battery
back in there the battery is 920
milliamp hours so depending on how
efficient the tmobile shadow is what
power usage depends on how long that'll
go we have a button here on the side and
camera button over here the bottom has a
land yard attachment seems to be a
microphone input the microSD slot looks
like the power attachment there and
there is our proprietary cable and then
we have volume buttons top vanilla
nothing there now for the front face we
have speaker up here we got two soft
keys this is a windows mobile or windows
mobile smartphone we have a home button
looks to be a back button a send button
and an end call power button of course
the t-mobile logo then we have this nice
scroll wheel here which also acts as a
d-pad so you have different directions
there in the center is like an ok key
let's slide this open and we have our 20
key Cordy style keypad which is a little
bit different it's one of the things
that makes the t-mobile shadow truly
unique is its qwerty phone but it
doesn't have a full-size keyboard so
this will take a little bit of getting
used to one of the things I like about
this is it's one solid piece these
aren't individual keys so you're not
gonna get a lot of dust and grit inside
of these keypad and in between the
buttons so there's some nice sliding
action whoo hot sliding action good
stuff all right
