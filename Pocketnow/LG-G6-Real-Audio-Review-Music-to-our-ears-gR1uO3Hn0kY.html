audio going from the v10 to the g5 the
modular experiment was a flop and folks
in the USA never got to play with the
high quality DAC add-on what we were
left with was one of the poorest
performing headphone jacks of the year
the g6 walks away from modular but
introduces a confusing feature
fragmentation between the various
regions where this phone will ship the
Korean model gets the quad DAC made
popular by the v20 the American model
gets wireless charging does this mean
the North American variant is going to
be another dog like the g5 well let's
start with the speaker happily to my
year we hear subtle improvements to
clarity over last year's g5 they're both
similarly loud but they're slightly
better instrument separation and the
mids don't get as muddled a mono bottom
firing speaker won't allow anyone in an
age of phones with stereo speakers but
hearing any improvement from g5 to g6 is
a critical victory why well the common
knowledge is once you waterproof a phone
then the speaker performs worse the
iPhone 7 disproved that notion and the
g6 reinforces that idea
now getting back to the headphone jack
our pre-release unit is set up to
resemble a North American retail phone
wireless charging and the standard DAC
instead of the quad I'm happy to report
that folks in the USA shouldn't be too
concerned this is not the same as the g5
s anemic headphone output and in one
year
LG moves from near the bottom of the
heap to grab a spot much closer to the
top of our review list quality numbers
are now within spitting distance of the
iPhone 6s trailing just behind the HTC
10 significant improvements to dynamic
range and reducing noise with proper
support for full 24-bit playback the amp
is still the weak link here but again
the g6 noticeably improves over its
predecessor no issues at all driving my
Sennheiser 599's using the lower
impedance cabling the sweet spot for me
about three clicks down from the phone's
maximum volume so let's wrap this up LG
g6 what do we hear it's good really good
it's the best sounding G Series we've
yet reviewed and it's more competitive
against other flagships and premium
mid-range errs the only disappointment
is knowing that there will be a version
of this phone which will more closely
resemble the insane headphone
performance of the V 20 but those
advantages come mostly from using higher
impedance cans to light up the V 20s amp
most consumers on regular headphone fare
likely won't hear a significant
difference which is exactly how it
should be for a mainstream smartphone
