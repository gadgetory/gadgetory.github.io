edition HTC one despite this
announcement Google confirms that the
nexus program continues and yes believe
it or not the motorola x phone finally
becomes a reality this summer I'm hi
meri beta and I can finally stop
thinking about unicorns every time i
hear motorola x this is a daily
let's say of talking about HTC we've got
a leak spec sheet of the t6 codename
phablet that everybody's curious about
first of all you're getting a 5.9 inch
1080p display along with a Snapdragon
800 processor two gigabytes of RAM full
link to the description for all the
details on every other specification
apparently we are getting an ultrapixel
camera of undisclosed mega pixels or
ultrapixels and obviously will most
likely get this device by the fall so
stay tuned the rest of the day is all
about Google that started off with
google music all access the service was
launched for android customers at Google
i/o and apparently it will be available
for iOS customers in the next coming
weeks price points are the same but
that's with everything google we don't
know exactly when you're getting it so
we'll keep you posted and can you
believe it we are finally going to be
talking about the motorola x phone yes
the company CEO was recently interviewed
at the 11 and he was very specific the
device is gonna be called the Moto X and
it's gonna be launched in the summer you
didn't provide any details on the device
itself but he was clear this is the
first smartphone to be assembled in the
United States Dallas Texas to be
specific which is awesome for us jobs so
stay tuned obviously we can't wait for
this device to finally show itself but
this is not the only news we got a deal
Evan sundar Pichai was also interviewed
and he was very specific when asked
about the galaxy s4 Google edition they
asked that the Nexus program is closing
down because of this and he said no the
Nexus program is important to push
manufacturers limits when it comes to
hardware and software and according to
him we will be getting more nexus
smartphones in the near future obviously
it in will is specify when but most
likely by the end of this year in the
fall so we'll keep you posted and
finally for the hot news of the day
those of you are waiting for that
announcement of the Google edition of
the HTC One it is now reality sundar
Pichai also mentioned that at the 11 it
was clear this device is launching in
June it'll be the 32 gigabyte model and
sounding the only bad part is that will
cost the same 650 bucks is that galaxy
s4 Google edition but still if you want
the full experience of stock Android
without having to root the phone well it
is the way to go but that leads you to
the question of the day now that you're
being
with the question of the google edition
of the HTC One and the standard edition
of the HTC One which one are you getting
to be honest with you I would rather go
for the standard version just because
you can get it with a subsidy you can
also obviously just root it links down
below for a whole video from Taylor
Martin on how to do it how to make your
current HTC One into a google edition
man well that's pretty much it i mean if
you could already do it without waiting
for the phone or paying 650 bucks i
would rather stick to the standard
edition but leave us a comment down
below why would you prefer the google
little should let us know of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone it's all over she follows on
target.com subscribe to our youtube
channel as well you can also follow me
on twitter and hang on there squirt or
iveta please give this video a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am high
never event thank you very much for
watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
