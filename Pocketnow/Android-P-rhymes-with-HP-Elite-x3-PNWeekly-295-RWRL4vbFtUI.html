for Android P is out in the wild let's
take a peek under the hood Qualcomm is
already teasing their next-generation
mobile chipset with a new modem in tow
and Lenovo moto might be laying off more
staff we've got a lot to talk about so
make sure you're charged and ready for
episode two nine five of the PocketNow
weekly recorded March 9th at noon
pacific this weekly podcast is where we
dissect and discuss those gadgets that
make our lives mobile smartphones
tablets wearables it's all the stuff you
wished existed when you were a kid and
Android Pi would have been one of those
weird fruit pocket things you could have
bought from a gas station I'm Juan
Carlos bag now contributing editor at
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. Jules Wong not on
the East Coast this fine evening where
he's at no no no you're wrong because I
am on the east coast of the United
Kingdom Oh burn look at that excellent
yeah broadcasting from the UK you're
facing some of the same issues that I
was facing on recent travels to where it
didn't seem to matter what hotel I
stayed at it didn't seem to matter what
upgrade package I paid for the
definition of high-speed Internet when
it comes to the service industry is
laughably poor well when it comes to our
needs which is communicating to a broad
audience here a massive audience it
doesn't really fit us so that's
unfortunate but we strive on and
including with the lights here because
if you are not watching this I suggest
that you don't because I'm using my
pixel to use a flashlight which is
blinding me in the eyes and it's it's
very like it's it's way too much and
it's not even it's only producing
mediocre results for the bang for buck
well a so apparently the UK is going
through like a blackout right now they
don't have any lights this is the
Travelodge and Norwich okay what do you
expect
well III understand you know keeping
your room cozy but that's that's
hilarious you try try like bouncing it
off a wall or something right up against
the wall and like this is like it's just
as muddy like this and that's so you you
go lens flare and then I'll join you
with just silhouette mode on the podcast
and now we're both equally unwatchable
[Laughter]
in other effects now we should we should
probably kick into some actual news
stories I think we're all recovering
from recent travels and trade shows and
shenanigans and stuff before we kick
over to the news of course we do want to
hear through from you the listener while
we are broadcasting live there are a
couple different ways that you can join
the conversation including hitting the
p-n weekly hash tag through the
Twitter's that's the easiest way for us
to get a comment noticed on the show
while we always appreciate the live chat
on YouTube it's it's a little difficult
to keep up with if there's a crazy
conversation happening for us to
decipher what you guys are talking about
and of course traditional email you can
also get in touch with us podcast at
Pocky what is email
oh no email is this this hot new
technology that's sweeping the globe
it's it's gonna replace text messaging
it's I really think it's gonna be big I
think it's gonna be a big deal great in
fact we have two of them coming in yes
we do so we're kind of cheating in that
we've kind of got an off schedule from
our listener mailbag and listener take
the wheel episodes and so to kind of
make up for that the end of this
broadcast we are going to take a look at
two messages from folks that have sent
them in for previous podcasts finally
get back to back around to answering
some of their questions and of course
just whatever commentary you guys want
to provide throughout the show if we
think it's cool enough we'll we'll talk
about it to live on the air yeah indeed
I've cut with the pretense on the
lighting because that would be a
subtracting factor in the viewership
here so I apologize for the overall you
know darkness but we'll move on we'll be
moving forward here so for the week of
March 5th 2018 this is all the news that
is fit to podcast we're finally taking a
good look at Android pee with the first
developer preview released this week
this initial stage will last through
Google i/o in early May and will be
flash only for pixel phones at this
point including the pixel C tablet some
of the features include support for the
hafe and vp9 HDR media formats and
stricter API level targeting for apps
which meaning that they will be updated
regularly they have to be updated
regularly or they will get pushed off
the Play Store 5 previews are scheduled
with a final launch date
late in the third quarter excuse me soft
banks earnings report has spoiled this
name of the next big chipset from
Qualcomm it's not that a Snapdragon 855
but the Snapdragon 855 fusion platform
if you've heard the word fusion before
think Apple a10 fusion it will be the
first to have the x-15 modem that's
acclimatized to 5 G's standards some
jogging still on whether it hits in
early 2019 or late 2018 for at least the
phones that will be having that but
this coming nonetheless
speaking of Qualcomm the Committee on
Foreman investments in the United States
has put a 30-day hold on the chip makers
shareholders vote on the Board of
Directors this as the agency looks into
national security impacts and other
consequences if singapore-based Broadcom
or to acquire the company Broadcom which
has its own ballot of board candidates
says that Qualcomm has made a voluntary
investigate investigation request to the
CFIUS and is denying the will of its
investors Apple has reportedly been
working on and off on a pair of over-ear
wireless headphones it's thought that
this holiday season product will share
many features with Apple's own beats
products like the w1 chip for easy
pairing and noise cancellation as well
her sauce windows10 chief Joe Belfiore
has confirmed that Windows 10s will be
converted from an iteration of the OS to
a mode on the home and pro versions
sometime next year
currently enterprise users can activate
s mode which runs only with optimized
applications and a security tailored but
restricted environment a class action
lawsuit against Google and Huawei has
been allowed to go forward
the federal judge overseen the case
refused to toss out the whole case which
centers around poor warranty treatment
over hardware issues causing sentence
sudden shutdowns and boot looping on the
Nexus 6p expect 3d boot loops in this
case by June local chatter and that has
spilled on to the layoffs comm claims
that about a third of the estimated 500
employees at Motorola Mobility Chicago
are being let go
this April furthermore air prominent
moto mod developer has shared his
concerns but won't reveal private
information on major consequences to the
Moto Z line and the modular modular
extent accessories that go along with it
the state of Washington has passed a law
enforcing net neutrality principles on
internet service providers those who
violated would be subject to provisions
under the state's consumer protection
laws that would be the first in nation
to do so Oregon has a law but it only
affirms what the government continued in
terms of purchasing Internet service the
bill goes right up against the FCC's
revised rules that remove net neutrality
facets the restoring Internet freedom
order has written dictates that it would
supersede any state law so we'll have to
see if any legal brouhaha comes from
this finally the Electronic Frontier
Foundation has received a dump of
documents from FOIA Freedom of
Information Act requests detailing the
FBI's practice of paying off Best Buy
Geek Squad employees as
formance agents would be called down to
repair repair facilities to look at Geek
Squad customers computers after having
child porn discovered on them the e FF
claims that the FBI absolutely ceases
what becomes evidence for prosecuting
the customer a violation of Fourth
Amendment Amendment rights and as we go
into the discussion on this story here
I want to tap into Andrew Wallace fat
produce on Twitter saying as someone and
who worked at Best Buy for years I find
the evidence that the Greek Geek Squad
had was spying on us for the FBI
sickening I don't feel that the illegal
done without warrants price paid is
worth the the the good this strategy
might have done
shame on you Best Buy so let's Rome to
this what do you think of the overall
assessment that's the use documents have
uncovered well and this is one of those
sort of ongoing and developing stories
where documents are yeah when when when
we start getting the actual documents
you see one of the tricky things about
this is reading people editorializing
about the initial discovery of this
practice so it's gonna take a little
while to unpack what what the
ramifications of this might be but I
think it definitely wraps up into a
larger consumer discussion on data
protection your own redundancy right to
repair that's actually another story to
that that just got a little bit of noise
this week was California introducing
legislation for right to repair your
consumers ability to crack open their
own devices and fix them and have access
to those materials and stuff so we're
going to continuously run into
boundaries and conflict between keeping
citizenry safe and trying to maintain
some notion of privacy or absolute
privacy for consumers gadget you know a
phone is now the main point of entry for
almost every single service and piece of
data and banking information and
personal information that a
a customer might have so if law
enforcement is getting wind of certain
trends like child pornography or sex
trafficking or information relating to
that I think it is law enforcement job
to try and exercise any point of entry
that they might have for unwrapped
unraveling or untangling how to get at
the people who might be engaged in such
nefarious deeds this is constantly going
to step on the toes of what we expect as
consumers for our right to privacy and I
think it's gonna be a generational
conversation that we'll need to have in
how we can rectify the discrepancy
between law enforcement third Point's
third party points of services cloud
technologies you know the fact that you
might be able to protect the data on
your phone but if you back up to a cloud
service well that's a hard drive that
lives on someone else's server that can
still be served a warrant for releasing
your personal information so I think we
have a ways to go yet even just getting
the basic vernacular and education out
of the way so that consumers can fully
understand what their rights are and
what their protections are and what
their options are for this kind of
information I'm torn on what a company's
responsibility is if if they're if
they're served with certain types of
warrants if they're they're trying it
should it be up to a private corporation
to be the up holder of our Fourth
Amendment that I'm not entirely sure
where we should try and draw those lines
or where we should lay the blame or
where we should expect protection and
once the fact that they were that there
were employees within the company that
were paid that were acting on behalf of
the government without the in explicit
disclosure to the consumer so yeah and
and that starts to sound like an
industrial espionage kind of situation
but to the same token if we're talking
about international you know child
pornography rings which are very
important that
government's stem that that doesn't it
doesn't it start to sound like you know
this would be a covert op from an
organization like the NSA or the CIA or
the FBI to infiltrate what's it what
networks they can to try and hash out
where this information is being
generated from and where it's being
trafficked I want to see that escalating
arms race where you know there's a part
of me that wants to say I want to see
the government do everything they can to
try and stem bad actors in this space at
the same time as I want to see the arms
race for better consumer protections
better our encryption a way for us to
safeguard our own information at the
same time and I think the the best way
to get that is through sort of an open
window clear transparency policy you
know I don't think you can have
encryption and protection in secret
because then if there's a flaw or if
there's a hole in that security if
there's a problem with that security or
if that Security's been compromised no
one will talk about it so you know this
is this is a bad look for Best Buy it's
not necessarily a great look for our law
enforcement agencies but there's also I
think there should be an understanding
that the law enforcement job is to try
everything they can to get in infiltrate
and disband people doing terrible things
so I don't know that what not to defend
you the trafficking of child porn but as
defending the principles of undo of
being probed the Constitution which
allows for seizure with a warrants of
property private property now where that
line of disclosure where that line of
letting a third party come into the
picture here whether that tacitly
includes the government or any other
federal or no no I completely agree
Jules this is why I really hope we'll
get unfortunately I feel like the new
cycle and this is gonna be really short
because something else is gonna shock us
in a week and we we might not get to
revisit this in the way that I really
think we should we're we're I feel
this is a living breathing document when
we talk about the Bill of Rights and why
these topics are so important to debate
in a grown-up fashion over a period of
time not necessarily with the specter of
a threat looming right on top of us but
actually when everything's cool and
hunky-dory is exactly when we should be
trying to unravel where we move forward
as a society because let's say the
practice was this is completely
hypothetical i I'm not well-versed
enough in the story to say that this is
the situation but to me it rings a
little bit like the way that you can
request or serve a warrant to Apple you
know if someone's got information locked
up on an iPhone I feel that should be
the safest of all that a consumer can
rely on I feel it's law enforcement job
to battering-ram their way into it it
should not be a technology manufacturers
job to build in a backdoor but if you
utilize iCloud then I feel the
government should be well within their
rights to to serve a warrant to Apple to
get information off of their services so
let's say part of this service a Geek
Squad was
duplicating information as soon as that
information is off of the primary device
then I feel the privacy discussion
shifts dramatically to what information
is on Best Buy's servers
what information is on a Geek Squad
workstation and then I think you have a
good faith argument for the government
to requisition that information it's
just again technology is moving way
faster than law enforcement or our
lawmakers can contend with and I think
it's going to take us a long time for us
to sort out what the new normal will be
and once we're in that conversation the
goal posts are gonna be moving on us
substantially it's gonna be a very fast
process with a very long conversation
there's gonna be further conversation
about what we do with the corporate
overlords that have our data because
already absolutely those servers are
just getting wrapped up and up and up Oh
totally and and and think about the
points of failure too because you know
let's say you're your iCloud account
doesn't necessarily just have Apple as a
point of failure because we
the the sort of the full scoop that
Apple was utilizing Google cloud
services as part of their iCloud
infrastructure so so again we're talking
about an ever receding number of players
at the very top of this and if a bad
actor were to find a way to compromise
Amazon that's just as dangerous I think
to a lot of people out there as if the
the government or law enforcement was
able to compromise Amazon in in light of
all of the security threats that we've
been facing at the beginning of 2018
from the local and an individual level
with chipset problems security flaws
inspector and what was the other one
well Grenada Laporte says that's the
constant element with digital security
we don't want criminals to go on without
being discovered well we don't want
those agencies to infiltrate our devices
leaving the doors open for malware's
water cry somewhat oh that's right want
wanna cry wanna cry inspectors so for me
I think the only thing that makes sense
for a new normal is a rapidly escalating
arms race between consumers bad actors
and law enforcement and and as long as
we have a very open conversation about
what the next phase of security is going
to look like who's going to be involved
in the implementation of that security
and what consumers can do to better
safeguard their material I think that's
the only thing we should be able to rely
on in the near future
I feel like realistically a corporate
our businesses are going to be the proxy
for biz consumers in that situation but
we have to move on lots of other topics
again see I want to try and deescalate
this a little bit here as we get into
more of this topics that we'd like to be
talking about you know just as hardware
nerds but we do have this other little
government bit here with the CS
suffice I'm gonna try and make that into
a pronounceable acronym suffice
intervention into broad comms
acquisition efforts here Broadcom has
been very active and very public in
terms of promoting its acquisition bids
for Qualcomm they be combined they'd be
the
just mobile semiconductor Overlord
on earth basically so there's a lot of
reason to be interested in what's going
on at the very least and in terms of
this core bit at the moment Broadcom is
still a Singapore based company they're
filing to read domicile in the US they
say they're gonna be able to deduce that
on may but there's question as to
whether the Committee on foreign
investment would still have jurisdiction
over investigating what national
security impacts on this deal would be
much less the other the whole the whole
package here because of the antitrust
worries and other regulators across the
world so this is but this this little
issue here is holding off the board of
directors votes that is was bound to
happen on March 6th now that's going to
be on April 6th and we'll see if
investors choose to keep Qualcomm board
of directors as it is right now or
whether broad comes board nominees gets
put on and they get to hijack the
destiny of well I think the most
important company in our industry right
now yeah definitely one of the top
players and especially I this this seems
like it's the wrong political climate
for Broadcom and Qualcomm to be making
this move I mean especially when we were
covering the the woes from law
enforcement agencies regarding the
advisory against Huawei and ZTE products
Qualcomm has kind of become a little
sweetheart company in that it's American
so even though Broadcom has offices
where do they have offices isn't it
like I said before I think it was 2015
San Jose but like it was 2015 they were
a US company back before then and then
they read ama south for tax purposes
right but but again that's also that's
also one of the things that's gonna be
sticky in this political climate
they seem to be not not quite outrightly
hostile or xenophobic towards
telecommunications giants that aren't
necessarily American but there does seem
to be a flavor of that discussion
happening throughout these different
sort of regulatory discussions and
merger acquisition discussions so III
really think that just because there's
so much money involved and eventually at
some point the top players will find a
way to wedge this I think this is gonna
be a speed bump I don't think it's
necessarily gonna halt the the the
joining of these two mega corporations
but I think we're gonna see that that
sort of security theater conversation
the sort of we're making mm-hmm a
good-faith effort into looking into this
acquisition from our federal government
which will be a lot of sound and fury
signifying nothing if if these two
companies want to join then they're
gonna join yeah well if they wait what
if it doesn't want to join and the other
does want them to join so it's more of a
war between two big a corporate it's
it's all just numbers man I Broadcom
will eventually be able to put numbers
out there that Qualcomm shareholders
will eventually say yes to it's a lot
they cut this the third offer which is
the current one was four billion dollars
down from the second one and that's
after like this big deal with nxp which
revalued it at a higher valuation of
whatever the heck and so it supposed to
be more money oh I'm not saying it won't
be hostile
but eventually I mean this you know it's
kind of like mafia politics right
eventually there's gonna be a number on
the table higher or lower that Qualcomm
shareholders are not gonna wanna say no
to less do they wake up with
metaphorical horse heads in their beds
yeah I can appreciate that argument move
on from that and into Android P how
about that finally something that we can
get the Nerds excited about I guess
right well excuse me man I can't shake
this cough yeah definitely some
interesting things I'm packing with with
Android P especially in sort of the
light that were in
sort of the time that we're in with
competition iOS taking a back seat for
new features on iOS to clean things up
Android I think finally finding its feet
I'm not necessarily too upset with
manufacturers that might be skipping
over Android eight Auto to skip to 8.1
and I think right now we're gonna be in
a good culture of refinement and
optimization definitely some new
features that we're going to be excited
to be playing with an Android P but it
seems to be an ongoing conversation with
Google to rein in manufacturers just a
little bit more a little bit of lobster
pot here a little bit of refinement
there factors that one of the aspects
that they have a of the rein and they've
adopted too is the cut out the notch and
whatever late you know there's one place
where hardware is gonna be the key
factor in terms of Android catching up
I feel the discussion on that is maybe a
little short-sighted that supporting
alternative screen shapes and form
factors doesn't necessarily stop at the
knotch so let's say you want foldable
bendable displays let's say you want
dual flip-out displays let's say you
want a smartphone that's a compact or if
you know that matter we like your matrix
scanners on your face for whatever
purpose not just for security but for
just face right I get that but it's it's
going to be something that software
always reacts to you because or at least
like a wide base platform like Android
instead of Samsung with its own
experience UI or whatever they can
tailor their own thing and they could be
the first on proprietary hardware as
about yeah but but the the first who
does it proprietary typically it
typically that's terrible um so we can
take back to the Kyocera echo and say
like you know what not having actual
good operating system-level support for
this dual screen implementation really
hurt that product and I feel there are
some significant teething pains when we
move up to a product like the ax
em in this is a great hardware idea of
very well implemented very well executed
that feels really clumsy when you're
switching between some of these
different modes so I don't want to get
too hung up on just the idea of a
flip-out display but again making
Android more Hardware aware I think
could be a good step towards future
implementation of more radical
departures from the rectangular glowing
slab that we're at I think I think the
media in general just gets overly hung
up on this this unibrow discussion
because of the iPhone 10 especially with
blue was it Bloomberg that set the tone
of the discussion where the only thing
they talked about on Android P was the
knotch oh that's but like really I mean
it's no they dedicated two minutes of TV
news broadcast to only say that the that
the major update coming to Android was
that they were gonna copy the notch on
the iPhone 10 propped up the column that
was good it was like in itself there's a
snowball effect I get it I totally get
it but you when people you know look at
this and see and say why they start to
dig into the factors that are going in
my favorite word is factors today and
they're they're talking about getting to
the point where alright this hardware
necessary this estates this people are
demanding bigger displays better than
ever and whatnot and sure that may be a
part of it and that might be what it
takes to fit in the selfie camera or the
earpiece or whatever well I just I just
mean even even down to simple things
like look at the LG G 6 and we had
teething pains just supporting rounded
cut-offs for the display you know the
you know just making Android aware of
that was a tricky endeavor in the the
very initial launch of that product so
taking that kind of pressure off of
manufacturers where if they want to do
something you want a perfectly oval
screen for no good reason you want a
roll up a bold display that then changes
depending on what parts of the display
are actually visible to the consumer
those types of things I think play a big
deal of course the disappointing thing
is going to be the
the first implementations of this
probably will relate directly to knotch
phones which I think I think the notch
is terrible I think it's absolutely
horrific design for the implementation
of an all screen front face and I think
it needs to tragically die in a dumpster
fire but what I do see is the potential
for this is getting Android out of
hard-coding a specific kind of aspect
ratio and resolution and giving those
tools to manufacturers and developers so
they can more easily implement you know
modular foldable and and design shifting
implementation that Android can play
with much easier than it currently can I
think that already happens at the
Android developers level at the with the
studio and whatnot in it's up to them
just you know I mean it does it does but
we can always make those tools better
and again I point to the axon M in that
I don't feel the user should have to
push buttons on the bottom of their
navigation bar to tell the phone oh by
the way I want you to mirror this I want
you to go fullscreen with this or I want
you to you know like I go split-screen I
that that that feels like an Android Ice
Cream Sandwich style solution to user
interface and navigation it doesn't feel
like Google can proactively work with
your behavior to feed you the kind of
content that you want kind of solution
and it's because ZTE is doing something
that Google isn't looking to do with
Android there they're cramming an extra
feature on there that isn't really
native to the way that Android interacts
with hardware so as to avoid this topic
you didn't have been hyper focusing on
the notch but to avoid that becoming
this segment here I want to talk about
the media side of things multi camera
API that finally letting app third-party
applications do their things with
however many cameras these manufacture
just want to step onto their phones as
well as the hafe I'm not sure or high
hi whatever that a gif yeah the
successor the imminent successor to JPEG
and also vp9 HD are wondering what your
take is on that especially after Apple
has been adopting - I don't know that
Apple is properly supporting vp9 other
than what might be built into
application level support no and any
time we start talking about moving
forward on media codecs and compression
I'm gonna be a big fan of that
it'll help having Google involved with
image compression because even with the
iPhone moving over into this style of
image compression it's it's taken a
while to get good consumer support
across multiple services and editing and
different different solutions that
people might want to use for uploading
and sharing or editing uploading and
sharing images I kinda wished that
Google had maybe made a little bit no
more noise about HEV C but again because
apples doing it Google is now tacitly
supporting in YouTube and on Google
photos so they don't necessarily need to
make a lot of noise about that they can
keep trumping up vp9 HDR but I won't
really consider vp9 a solid solution
until a pixel comes out that natively
shoots with a better video compression
than what they're currently utilizing
where I can still I can shoot HEV C on a
wall way and I get great image quality
at significantly smaller file sizes I
can shoot phenomenal 4k video on an
iPhone with great image compression
great file sizes I want to see that on a
pixel if it's vp9 great duly I'm excited
I want better video at a smaller file
size that's ultimately all I care about
but if they're not going to natively
build that into and we're gonna keep
playing this game of well the phone
shoots h.264 and then it gets uploaded
to a server where it's then rerender din
to some kind of streaming acceptable
format that's not a solution that's not
a way to go well
I mean maybe Google has its reasons for
not being too excited about a GBC is
licensing yeah anyone does licensing but
you know whatever I mean there has to be
a better solution for this and Google
has the infrastructure and resources at
the end of the day it's just like there
is a solution and people are using it
and Google's not in that discussion
directly at all so that makes them far
less relevant when we're looking at
improving the situation for people to
have better video that followed smaller
Peter hatin on the tweeters great points
a gadget guy would be the first to say
new screen screen designs aside from the
glowing rectangle idea we could get back
to something people are really
interested in look at no Nokia with the
banana phone nokia 8110 we know this
creates interest which I'm looking at
this right here it's with the knotch
yeah that's remain it was with a notch
with the Motorola bat-winged logo for it
that's one layer a lot of imported
whatever this phone is I'll use that
segue in just second but also Peter
Hayden says plus michael fisher mr.
mobile never did get his runcible which
was the the circle round thing that was
like a phone was made out of plastic
from the Great Bear in our island of
plastic trash or whatever the heck it
look like kind of like an offshoot of if
you ever saw the movie
it follows they have this weird like PDA
phone thing that looks like a makeup
compact with a circular screen and it's
supposed to be anachronistically
futuristic for this sort of low income
area in in Detroit diner kinda hilarious
oh yeah totally
for the record he did actually get
around to getting his device and
reviewing it as well I would be very
remiss not to note that so go look it up
our UN CIB
and also we do have just a from from
Peter hating to that Apple apparently
did drop support for vp9 in favor
265 again I mean we've been working with
h.265 in the consumer space since the
Samsung nx-1
I mean this is a really well understood
codec and people companies not
supporting it now are basically just
impeding progress because it's great and
it works great and it it does exactly
what we want it to do in trying to free
up bandwidth issues and storage
limitations the fact that we're not on
it is hilarious in the worst way
possible it could I mean make it a
standard essential patent and then we'll
to be talking about something but yeah
maybe maybe that has to happen we'll
move on from that
speaking of Motorola just a few seconds
ago little sad news better the layoffs
that might be happening as well as the
ruminations of what is what's comprising
of those layoffs here so for a
perspective I believe just maybe a
decade or 15 years ago we were talking
about 40,000 a Motorola's ranks mm-hmm
at this point if if the cuts are coming
as they say they are at the third one
third proportion that we're talking
about here we could be looking at 3 350
at best Wow yeah and this is this is
coming lenovo took over in 2014 i
believe and if i look back into things
at least the the the company was still
in five figures 10,000 at least
so from pants that is that is a rough
blown especially difficult for the
industry where i think there are a lot
of us that are feeling a bit nostalgic
for some of the more exciting days of
smartphone manufacturing a same thing
like a company like HTC facing a number
of woes and their earnings report coming
out and being not particularly
motivating that the company might be
writing at
it's course after Google buying out a
significant part of their smartphone
team it's a it's upsetting
i I I kind of just hope that what this
means is we'll see a more focused Lenovo
moto I he's so is okay both Peter wins
their focus ah that's that's exactly it
Peter and Andrew in our and our we're
having a Twitter conversation about just
like the insane number of Motorola
badged devices that are apt to come out
where the Moto G series used to be a
very simple argument for an entry-level
to mid-range er phone now spans I think
what seven different products for 35
beats mostly I've 5s the g5 S Plus the
g5 s special edition like getting
getting these disparate teams between
Motorola engineers and Lenovo engineers
all working on the same page might have
been a bridge too far
and unfortunately ways well but that's
it is lenovo owning the motorola brand
who's gonna get let go of people in
house under lenovo's umbrellas or the
people in house under Motorola's
umbrellas and if that means that we can
get a more focused approach to how
they're developing products this is a
this is a problem we've detailed with
other manufacturers too like LG making
certain phones for some regions with
some features that other regions don't
get that's a bad way to position your
products having a million different Moto
e variants doesn't help move the needle
getting consumers acquainted with your
products and teaching them has said they
want to strike a chord in the premium
market in the toughest not to crack the
US and they have not been successful at
the low levels of the employments that
they have in terms of the US where their
native market is so and they're trying
to do that they're trying to replicate
that elsewhere in the world I get that
and they might think that China might be
the best place to do that but they're so
like even in Lenovo zone brand where the
premium
just been pour their own bread phones
have done very poorly it's the sense
isn't there they can have they can have
their people work on a Motorola brand
and it'll make all the sense of the
world but they have never struct
anything premium that has been a big
success or at least at a big enough
success reportedly to offsets losses in
China which but that's that's the that's
to read I'm getting on this news here so
yeah but I so don't think that you can
have split focus between Motorola
branding and Lenovo leadership and
arrive at something where they're gonna
be a bit more focused we do have a
couple tweets on this from fat produce I
wonder if the moto layoffs are a result
of the moto mods failing as a strategy
Allah the LG g5 that's an interesting
hypothesis but I don't feel that the
accessories division is necessarily you
know gonna be the the sticking point
here III think just phone sales and
getting excitement and getting people up
front probably a bigger problem Lenovo
needs to focus on marketing this comes
from a clay pot at Chatty boy and
actually I gotta say I think Motorola
does a good job of advertising the
United States I see pretty heavy
rotation on all the TV channels it's
more again when you when you're banking
on something like modular you have a
different kind of conversation with
consumers and educating them as to what
your platform has to offer and that's an
uphill battle and again we would only be
into the second generation of limo dozy
phones that support that feature and I
don't think that feature really becomes
consumer viable until we're through
generation three and then I think
consumers start to take that more
seriously but at the same time
smartphone manufacturing seems to be
settling into a good enough place where
I think a majority of Samsung and Apple
customers don't necessarily feel
their phones are lacking anything
specific you know I I could put a better
speaker on there but okay that means I
need to put my phone down and then it's
a speaker and then I can't use my phone
because it's my phone as a speaker you
know like that's that's a hard
conversation to have to try and inspire
consumers as to why they should switch
teams to a modular device what else
would they have other than being like
Samsung rather than being like LG other
than being like Nokia I'm seeing Renato
Laporte here again talking about do or
what they should do because everyone has
their own prescription for an ailing
company that's dying the first thing the
lenovo should do is get their software
update strategy together so go Android
one Nokia second focus on three lines
with match each max two phones a year
which has been the case for Motorola for
the past several years also like we've
been talking about this for Microsoft
back when it still had a stake in mobile
and that didn't really work out but
there are more blocks that crumbled on
them I suppose and fix the failures that
have been plaguing moto since forever
for example the camera call quality
alright so if even if you do include
good cameras on two black ships or
whatever devices that really puts you up
against Samsung and price bracket for
that value which they reiterated III
should specify that wasn't a Jules rant
that that was coming in from tweets from
renato Laporte that was partially so so
here so here's the deal I and anyone who
says they have a cure I mean we're all
enthusiasts so we all have ideas as to
what we might help a brand or what might
what might improve the situation i I
think messaging is a very important
factor for a number of companies but
only when you have something to message
only when you have something that's
about and the smartphone market is so
heavily commoditized right now that I
don't think any company should expect a
three to five year mission where they
can really crack into the market share
especially in the United States crack
into the market share that is currently
dominated by Apple and Samsung like 85
to 90 percent of all phones sold in the
United States have a Samsung logo or an
Apple logo on them if you're going to
disrupt that market the opportunities
you need to take especially at the
premium end differentiators matter you
know it's one of the things that like
bugs the crap out of me about LG
commercials is not a single one focuses
on the fact that they do have an
objective best on the v30
objectively without question not open to
interpretation not not not how you feel
about your phone if you want the best
headphone jack and the best support for
high quality audio on a device it's the
LG v 30 so where is that commercial
where they can simply directly
communicate to consumers saying this is
something we offer that none of our
competition can match so so for Motorola
I don't necessarily know what that is
because I think the conversation on
modular is is a bit too broad telling
the consumer you can make your phone
whatever you want it to be when they're
looking at the most popular phone saying
well Motorola can you make my phone at
galaxy s 9 because according to the
media that's what I want
especially opposite Samsung is a
juggernaut of advertising it's also part
but really not that they're crippling
the body but like the chassis of the
phone for the sake of promoting the
freakin accessory is which this is
definitely a lenovo idea because i don't
necessarily look at it as crippling the
device it's because i mean you look at
some of the like especially lenovo in
the early days of modular and multimode
Windows 8 devices there was a definite
aesthetic push towards making ultra slim
ultra light ultra portable
and so the converse the compromise to
that is not being able to include the
largest battery so they focused on fast
charging technologies they focused on
modular accessories they focused on
different power bricks they focused on a
number of things I could make that
solution because to them you could make
a super-thin laptop that then someone
else could carry extra weight if they
wanted more battery power but you can't
build tons of battery into a product and
then satisfy someone who's looking for a
MacBook Air style solution this move for
the Moto Z line to me feels very much
like a lenovo aesthetic the Moto Z that
especially the skinnier ones the moto Z
in the Moto z2 you know we're looking at
an ultra thin battery that's not gonna
satisfy a lot of the enthusiasts and the
people who are gonna echo-chamber about
specs and Android phones but this is
balanced by having a proprietary
infrastructure of accessories and
support that can build on to the
functionality of that device so I get it
but I still say that is one of the
hardest conversations you can have with
the consumer telling them not only
should you buy this phone but then you
can do all these other things with this
phone and well most of these things are
not going to apply to you but that's
what you're gonna pay extra for to
support the engineering the development
the the the QA on a modular device if
you can't crack that conversation for
your general consumer in a way that they
can understand when they walk into a
carrier store see a display and go oh
that's something that I think will
benefit me then all you've done is
you've confused the consumer you've made
them realize that the galaxy is the
safer choice because it just has
everything in it you don't have to worry
about buying extra pieces to slap on the
back and you've kind of reinforced your
competition and that's where I think
Motorola has made some messaging
missteps they've definitely I think done
a good job of keeping up the advertising
I just don't think they found the killer
app for it and it feels like a work in
progress that won't be finished by the
time that they've abandoned support for
it so we're gonna switch segments and
talk
your listener meal just about three
minutes but I want to make this final
point before we do so if if modular just
to be crude about it is a problem that
needs to be fixed by getting rid of it
that's the solution all right so what
can Motorola do in the premium space
where it is a prerequisite to have a
superlative on there and it's not just
enough to have being you know camera
because oh samsung has this freaking
adjustable aperture thing going on and
oh there's this trick in that trick
software - AI there's a lot lots of
bombardment going on already where's the
worst the superlative and where's
Lenovo's justification in even fighting
in $700 $800 ranges at this point that's
my question to you oh all right well I
mean just to take a stab on it the the
the problem is is that you need to make
a superlative somewhere I mean notice
that I didn't claim that the superlative
for the V 30 was the camera it's the
best camera for me but I completely
understand why that's a much broader
differing opinion kind of situation than
Beck's bro
but Dax bro I mean you I got math on
that there's science back in me over
there laughs like four four yeah right
no so the the the problem is that a
company has to go out of their way to
create a niche where they can deliver a
superlative you know I I would be
willing to posit that the best
communications device of the last year
was the BlackBerry key one and then
consumers are going to have a
conversation as to how much do they
value certain methods of communication
to warrant the cost of a device that has
a hardware keyboard you know that that
that becomes at least a data point or a
discussion point that you can engage
with your consumers saying you can make
your phone anything is too broad III
would love to see some kind of return to
a more sort of a Motorola of old where
moto maker maybe
introduced a conversation of you know
all phones have these great specs all
phones have these solid cameras audio
screens are looking really cool
we're the only manufacturer don't don't
look at essential we're the only
manufacturer that can offer you this
type of premium build experience for a
device not only business grade in the
way that you remember Motorola's of old
being the preferred choice for the
business men on the go but then also
that to match the style that's needed
when you walk into the boardroom and
that could be a superlative conversation
do you want the back of your phone clad
in customized embossed or wien leather
do you want the sides of your phone to
be made out of titanium or carbon fiber
or another material that's truly exotic
and not just another BS piece of glass
shiny jewel tone device coming out of
every manufacturer this year I feel that
could be a conversation that Motorola
could easily revisit capture the
nostalgia of the Motorola brand the
batwing brand and then also set
themselves apart from these techie geeky
discussions again it's not us
enthusiasts so you've got to get general
consumers onboard and I think you can
win points with general consumers by
saying specs don't matter they seriously
don't and you can get a $400 phone with
the top-of-the-line processor and a
great screen and a good camera that's
not important
but can you get a top-of-the-line phone
that's customized and built with this
exacting like fine automobile aesthetic
that isn't is an interesting
conversation that a manufacturer could
have and again it would definitely be
branding and advertising it wouldn't
necessarily be true but enthusiasts
crying about it won't matter a skosh it
won't matter at all to the consumer who
walks into a carrier store and sees a
display of we will custom build we this
is a bespoke gadget that will fit you
and and fit your style and fit your
lifestyle you don't have to worry about
throwing a case on this because we've
got the shatter shield and we've got
this and this is the best accessorized
platform and got brand
is superlative no but that's just that
that's that's just it is that's what I'm
talking about is in terms of the
advertising on this and is for the
optics on this shatter shield is really
cool I'm just mad that Motorola doesn't
make their own first party glass screen
protector to go on top of shatter shield
that I think solves all of our problems
included as part of shatter shield but
that's just me I will go to your point
about five years ago I was pretty
unwrapped in the Moto X and what it
really brought in terms of the potential
of my creativity in terms of making a
statement about my phone I really missed
that I want that back definitely a great
thing to bring back I think it was a
little head of its time actually so now
I tell my years later who knows that
could be one chip in the in the armor
that is everyone else out there right
now if it's just glass with a Qualcomm
845 and a good camera you you've
basically given up I mean like specs
were an HTC you twelve sound great but
why would I get one over every other
competing device that's gonna enter the
market with kind of the same bucket oh
stuff and if if that's the only thing
that's entering into the conversation
again smartphone is a commodity
consumers need to have them they aren't
exciting in the same way that they were
five or ten years ago and if you're
going to try and command a premium I
think essential had it right I think
they were talking to the wrong
demographics of people they were trying
to impress the wrong demographics of
people and I think they were focused a
little too much on some of the
enthusiasts discussion when they could
have entered in and said what other
phone is made out of a ceramic back with
a titanium frame the same thing LG
missed an opportunity to say what other
phone other than the v10 is durable and
built with stainless steel rails on the
sides of the device those words sound
awesome a commercial featuring that
language targeted to general consumers
sounds awesome and I think it's a missed
opportunity when the design team goes
out of their way to do something
interesting
and then the company advertising
department never talks about what's
interesting is oh hey looks like the
iPhone 10 right now and and oh there's
this AI software so I think breaking
away from that the first out of the pack
to do that is going to have their cake
and eat it too

and old and I don't know where I'm going
with this interaction
I am totally lost again dude I try to
yes and you whenever I can but I'm not
sure how to back you up on this one well
it's the mailbag and we have two letters
here we'll start off with the Zane sure
bhaji here
talking about the elite x3 you remember
that that phone from oil is a 2016 I
told her last year it's it's old yes
20 phone with Windows 10 mobile weather
for you that did also banging banging
off off some sound just all all the
things that you would want in a phone
but with Windows 10 mobile on it
Zane writes good insert time of day my
dudes I work in a hotel and have seen
rare electric slabs from across the
globe but tonight I try to put a little
emphasis and cough there but today I
have seen a beast so exotic it
astonished me the HP Elite x3 being
wilted by the most hipster businessman
and the one comment he said was it has
its problems thank you for listening in
and keep on sailing into the virtual
sunset ziggety ziggity Zane no thanks
saying I know but I love I love hearing
from people that have those like sort of
like wild phone out and you know
sightings you know okay I saw this out
in the wild this phone exactly because
this was like the save here this was
supposed to be the third-party savior of
Windows 10 mobile or something like that
a couple years ago with its high-end
specs of all the features for enterprise
and for even the biggest has been dying
because of what Nokia couldn't do which
was produce a decent flagship or what
Microsoft couldn't do excuse me
Microsoft couldn't do Nokia was doing
great nokia was doing great and then
Microsoft had to come into it um but
yeah and this is the phone that's still
being sold today it's gonna be sold
through 2019 as the lasting vestige of a
dead what's effectively a dead platform
hmm
and in the one comment that the person
who owns the damn thing says is it has
its problems so apparently this phone
got out to people to customers that's
just hard to get a phone and it's not
being properly appreciated or it's just
that it's already could not even be well
it's or its tasks it's a sad state
because you know a companies like HP and
Microsoft kept playing this game where
they dip their toe into mobile and then
run away screaming and then come back a
couple years later and try it all over
again and this goes all the way back for
HP this goes all the way back to their
acquisition of Compaq I was a huge fan
of Windows Mobile PDAs and then we got
AI pax and then they absorbed the
giornata line and we started getting
these like Palm Treo competitors you
could get like Windows Mobile PDA phone
with like a clip-on keyboard or like a
dial pad on the bottom and there would
always be this sort of half-hearted
attempt at making it a something that
businesses would want to use as a fleet
device and then they would just
disappear for years like terrible
support no updates no no infrastructure
and then they would come back and try it
and do it again
and I still maintain I was in a discord
conversation with with Andrew Wallace
and and Renato Laporte talking about I
you know we occasionally still see you
know like people who opine about live
tiles and and Nokia Lumia and stuff like
that and and we got to a point where
there were many regions in Europe that
were starting to crack over 10% Windows
Phone market share the United States I
think we peaked up for but I was seeing
Lumia 1520's
out in the wild like I was seeing them
here in Southern California that was an
audacious device that I think helped
start part of the conversation along
with the note in getting rid of mini
tablets is like this really consumed
consumer desirable product segment and
if we had only seen more regular support
and more regular updates from Microsoft
that I think we
would have seen progress on this front
instead we got this Microsoft treated
Windows Phones like a desktop operating
system like here's Windows Phone 7 we'll
see you in 3 years when we update it but
no new devices will get it and then
you'll see Windows 8 and we'll see you
in a couple years when Windows 10 comes
out and that's a terrible way to try and
have a relationship or a conversation
with a consumer let alone like saying
that you're supporting developers to try
and make apps for platforms which then
just hard and support so your Windows
Phone 7 investment in making an app is
completely destroyed when Windows Phone
8 comes out I imagined this one fleet
manager uli he's been able to convince
all the higher-ups this is a good
investment the lead x3 get it for all of
us and it's like hey here's the lead x3
use it now and everyone's like well this
is not intuitive and it's not really
good but but it was like no you have to
use it you must use it properly you're
using it wrong and well and in yeah kind
of goes to what you know a company like
HP put their necks out there to build
something again they're not they're not
completely faultless in this because
they keep dancing in and out of the
mobile strategy their mobile strategy -
but you know they put it out there and
it just reinforces not only to
manufacturers but also to consumers
why you should never stray from the iOS
or Android ecosystems and that's that's
a major bummer and I think I'm not gonna
be surprised I'm gonna be I'm gonna
laugh and I'm gonna be very hesitant to
jump on board but I do feel that there's
going to be this long term end run from
Microsoft where again they're not gonna
call it a phone operating system it's
gonna be some flavor of a future version
of Windows that's modular kind of like
this Windows 10s mode but we can make a
mode which is just for a small screen
device which could also incorporate an
always-on connection thanks to our new
support for Windows 10 on arm chipsets
and it's just gonna change the form
factor of Windows so that it's more like
gesture based and easier for smaller
screens and it's got an LTE radio so you
could make phone calls on it
it's gonna be a new breed of Windows 10
mobility products I believe that that
will happen that Microsoft will say
they're all in support of it all
committed to it it'll last for about a
year and then they won't update it
properly and we'll be right back where
we were again with with Windows Phone
again and and that's a shame because I
think I think we could be doing a lot
better and I think if we had more
competition I think if we had a plucky
third-place smartphone operating system
to draw support from developers and to
just kind of keep the discussion going
on innovation then I don't feel Android
and iOS would be approaching the same
meeting point of shared UI shared
application state shared feature
functionality every time they announce
Apple announces something that they're
moving forward on Google has an
immediate counter to it AR kit versus a
our core depth of field blur on cameras
versus new camera api's this is kind of
what's leading to some of the feeling
that this market has stagnated at least
in the rhetoric whore which I totally
understand but I feel like there are a
lot of gaps and valleys and nooks and
crannies that would be filled if we
looked a little bit deeper into that but
we're not going to because well that
could be its own whole show yeah around
here come on we do have a couple tweets
here this is from Andrew Wallace the
last time I went to a Microsoft Store I
saw this phone he's talking about the HP
elite x3 I saw this one on display and
there wasn't even a security device
keeping it from being stolen and then
from Renato Laporte come to this
business man's defense Windows Phone had
the best mail client I've ever seen on
mobile so a business man without the
need of a snapchat or an Instagram could
be really happy with it but you're also
mostly missing out on things like
banking apps and those are very
important and I have to agree it it's
when we started seeing that support
pulled that was definitely a major nail
in the coffin for Windows Phone if there
was a growth at least some growth
well I would be outraged at the app you
know decline but there wasn't growth
there was it there was an arbor and Grif
so there couldn't be software growth uh
you know what one company I used to make
a few Windows Phones on occasion I've
hmm that's a very good question what
company used to make Android phones they
used to make Android fields well they
used to make him back in the day I think
you might be segwaying into a discussion
on HTC is what I think you might be
trying to do a good attempt but this one
this little male that's coming in from
goran petrovic says what dilemma our
HTC's manufacturing instrument expenses
too high so they can't lower pricing or
are they just too proud lowering price
for their phones would instantly help
them in short terms they remove the
headphone jack they replace the one name
they didn't even include OLED on their
phones what's next another you jewelry
phone sent from my HTC 10 I'd like to
point that out since that was the last
of the one series it had the metal going
on and a dying in sign language and it
wasn't a jewelry phone as as
Quran says but I'm right the HTC has
always had some pride in terms of being
able to manufacture high quality
designing even creating those designs so
that's always been built in just like
Apple as to some part of the price tag
but in terms of other innovations
they're give-and-take and I'm not
exactly sure where the manufacturing
expenses would be on that but certainly
well I think a couple things are at play
here one we know HTC doesn't have the
leverage to command the most preferred
pricing on all components
an Apple or Samsung can walk into any
office and say hey we're gonna we're
gonna be using your product to build
galaxy s 9s and we guaranteed this scale
yeah so we need 50 million Oh what
you're going to manufacture for our
phone and you're going to give us the
absolute razor thinnest margin that you
possibly can to support that
manufacturing endeavor HTC cannot come
anywhere near that so even when it comes
to things like Ram chip sets the the raw
materials that go into the PCB or the
the logic boards of these phones they're
probably paying more per unit than
Samsung is for what would be a
comparable product at the same time if
if an HTC flagship suddenly got price
cuts at launch not only do I actually I
really do believe that HTC is already in
a dangerous position with pricing I feel
they probably are trying to work with
the smallest amount of padding that they
can they're also going to start losing
the conversation of premium products I I
hate to say it this way but I think that
the reason why the pixel is becoming a
better competitor for the iPhone from
the pixel to the pixel too isn't because
Google did anything special with the
manufacturing of the phone I think the
biggest change was that they priced it
to be more cost competitive they priced
it up to be more cost competitive
against the iPhone so now it looks like
a proper competitor to the iPhone
it looks like the Google iPhone and that
price tag plays a lot into the
psychology of a consumer who might be
comparison shopping if you saw a Google
phone that was priced two to three
hundred dollars less than an iPhone well
then obviously the Google phone is two
to three hundred dollars less good than
an iPhone and I want the best phone so
I'll buy the iPhone winning that
psychological battle is huge so from the
enthusiasts point you
absolutely correct you know when it
comes to HTC technology they have a hard
time competing against an outlet like
oneplus where you know oneplus is able
to draw on some of the manufacturing
acumen of Oppo a much larger
manufacturing partner and so they can be
more cost aggressive I'm sure we'll see
something similar when honor starts
selling phones in the United States
again the honor of you 10 will might be
getting some pricing soon on what that
might look like for the United States
but again while honor and Huawei don't
necessarily share a ton of direct design
influence honor gets to benefit from the
manufacturing acumen of the world's
third largest smartphone manufacturer
and I think that's that that two-factor
that not having preferred pricing and
preferred negotiation leverage and the
psychology of we need to have a premium
price tag on this product just so that
we can cut a profit is probably what's
hammering HTC right now I will posit
this HTC has never made a name for
itself in smartphones they were ODM and
then they came out as their own little
thing and they thought they had the
ground level covered they did for a
little bit but unfortunately that wasn't
enough then they couldn't momentum when
it came to the 1-series
I disagree III think I think there was a
very brief window where HTC was regarded
by consumers as a top tier manufacturer
Windows Phone like Windows Mobile was
definitely I have where I'm doing a
challenge with Erica Griffin where we're
going back and revisiting old phones and
so this is the one I picked is the HTC
touch pro imeem this is one of the
phones that really properly lit me up
for for modern mobile smartphone Aang no
so definitely the Windows Mobile Erica's
HTC was the odium of choice for every
label out there if you had an audio Vox
it was an HTC if you had an ohm eight or
an I'm eight it was an HTC but I think
into the Android ecosystem Android would
not have gotten the launch that it did
had it not been for what was it the
the very first Google phone on t-mobile
the chin the g1 and also the Nexus One
in the Nexus but also don't forget that
the Evo was a major player for Sprint
for 4G no even the first the first Evo
totally stole the conversation away from
the early days of Samsung until Samsung
got smart with their line of phones
the first Galaxy S which had differing
models on every carrier the Evo was a
big deal phone and there was like I
remember there being a segment on what
was it was a it was on g4 before it was
called attack of the show this was the
killer Android phone to go head-to-head
with the iPhone was this humongous Evo
device with this enormous 4-inch screen
and they had so many so much of that
conversation locked up that the only
other competitor was motorola motorola
with the droid on Verizon and and that's
that was the big fight was Moto vs. HTC
until we got I think until we got into
the galaxy s2 era and once we got into
the galaxy s2 era because they were
targeting Apple from the start for the
iPhone ad that person yeah but the only
the only reason why I say that that was
the transition point I think the galaxy
s2 actually walked away with the
conversation but the galaxy s1 was split
between the epic which had a keyboard on
Sprint the captain was at the captivate
that had the metal back on AT&amp;amp;T you had
plastic back unlocked devices
internationally it was just too broad I
think with the galaxy s2 Samsung
realized they couldn't let carriers
dictate what every individual flavor of
their phone was going to be at the same
time HTC had not figured out that
conversation and HTC phones were
different than Sprint HTC phones and I
think that that it's starting to leap
down for from 2011 onwards and they try
to reorganize themselves they tried to
recover with the 1-series but still that
was that was still a very messy affair
- it took until after they lost a lot of
credibility with the carriers especially
after that wound up not that look yeah
the one the one m7 and one of me I think
we're still reasonably good performers
it just came at the same time as a lack
of advertising less manufacturing clout
and I think the one that really hurt
them I think the one that really severed
their relationship with AT&amp;amp;T was the one
a9 that was too expensive a mid-range er
phone for being such an iPhone copycat
that I think it really soured the
relationship between HTC and 18t then
HTC gets burned literally by Qualcomm's
terrible chipsets
with the one m9 and the recovery with
the HTC 10 they didn't have carrier
partnerships in place for the HTC 10
like they should have they didn't have
preferred you know showcasing and floor
space dedicated to that phone and and
there was no way to recover from that
even though they had one of the best
phones of that year but all of these
ingredients come down to a point where
HTC's brands attraction is at an at a
low at an all-time low
except for smart phones sure excuse me
for VR they're rising up but for smart
phones they're they're pretty low and I
don't think even if it hurts their
bottom line to go for a lower price
point I think at this point in order to
spur something or to stimulate something
at the very least that has to happen so
so here's my hypothesis this is also
what Miriam
draw a Tank Girl and I talked about on
her podcast before MWC there I do not
believe there is any hope left for HTC
as a smartphone manufacturer I hope I am
wrong but I do not see an outcome that
makes sense in the current business
market with every strategy what well and
with with again with the current
dichotomy of smartphone players in the
market I don't see an outcome for HTC
which revives the HTC brand I truly
leave that selling off a major part of
their smartphone division over to Google
was a piecemeal attempt to give HTC time
to figure out what to do with the vive
how the vive can be spun off into a
separate company the HTC label has about
two years of phones left in it from the
designers that went over to Google so I
totally expect we'll see a u12 maybe
even a you thirteen or whatever those
phones might be called and then that'll
give the HTC corporation enough time to
kind of divide up its assets and the HTC
brand can crater in the safest way
possible Google didn't get stuck with
all of their baggage like they did with
the Motorola acquisition or the way that
Microsoft did when they acquired Nokia
they only got the designers and talent
that they wanted to make new phones the
vibe will easily live on as a brand
under any other company I mean you could
go to steam and and the vibe is gonna be
fine and so the HTC label gets chopped
up with what's left at HTC and maybe
that label just gets slapped on a bunch
of desire level products or it gets
licensed out like the way that HD hmd is
licensing the nokia name for their
products and it's just slapped on a
bunch of mid rangers or you know like
phones at MVNO carriers so if you want a
virgin phone with an HTC label on it
maybe it's even made by TCL and it
doesn't have anything to do with the HTC
of old but they paid to have the HTC
brand trademark and that's that's what
we're gonna see in the future I do not
see an outcome for HTC to stay as a
top-tier player against the competition
and especially against themselves
from Google as competition the HTC DNA
is over at Google if you want an HTC you
go get a pixel so what fun things are
you doing this weekend
[Laughter]
you know I I'm gonna I'm gonna be
testing out some microphones and playing
with some gaming gear and that's that's
that's the weekend it's going to be fun
and chill and relaxing I'm gonna be
exploring Norwich with the date and
afterwards I'm going to be going perhaps
up to Leeds perhaps all the way through
to Liverpool
I'm not sure at this point that that
part of that Sunday is gonna be a little
bit tricky but I'm gonna have some fun
even with some rain coming and I want to
make sure that this flight diversion
which was caused by a storm that was
ravaging Boston and is still doing so
with power outages flooding and whatnot
and has forced the rebooking of my
flight home to next Thursday I'm going
to make sure that I'm gonna spend the
money I can't spend to have a decent
time I I think you I think you've earned
it Jules I think you're due um we did
actually get a tweet from goran petrovic
thanks for the comment I really
appreciate it I love HTC but with metal
and 3.5 millimeter jack removal they
lost me does HTC have more choice than
to be Samsung or oneplus a 9 was HTC
killer in Europe it sold so bad that no
one wanted HTC phones and their
offerings in the future and and the
thing that sucks is I really liked when
HTC's differentiator was boom sound I
really liked when they had something
special to offer phones that no other
company was playing with even back to
their really funky I think was called
the HTC surround was that Windows Phone
7 phone with the slider speaker grill
like HTC was responsible for so many
amazing experiments radical design
language pushing the boundaries on what
we could put in our pocket and I think
all of that is gone I think all of that
spirit is gone and and I really feel
like if you want the next flavor or the
HTC DNA for your next phone you gotta
look at a pixel the pixel 3 I think will
will be the first true representation of
what HTC design
designer acumen and Google software
focus can truly deliver and I hope it's
not a split launch like I really hope
they don't do another HTC builds one and
LG builds the other I hope this is a
unified focused vision from Google using
that HTC talent I really want to end
this on a brighter note since let's say
no I was just bringing that because
Goran sent us Goran spent you know I
understand you know tweet you know we
you know we're very obliged for the
privilege of email it's very very nice
but I'm trying to look at something
that's interesting you know we're now
