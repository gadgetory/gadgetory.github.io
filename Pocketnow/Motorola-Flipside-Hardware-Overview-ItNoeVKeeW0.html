pocketnow.com and a few days ago you saw
sun box the motorola flip side which is
this device right here well now we're
going to do is right you're going to
take a in-depth look at the hardware of
the device and tell you what makes this
device tick and what it's made out of
let's get started all right now as we
said in the unbox and this is actually a
mid-range android device on AT&amp;amp;T now in
the very front of the device you're
going to see the motorola logo as well
as your trackpad they actually use an
optical trackpad on this device which
gives it a different feel different
touch if you will you can actually
navigate through applications by after
taking your finger and swiping to the
left and to the right up down etc to
actually navigate using that track pad
which for most people that want to use
the touchscreen but if you don't want to
use the actual touchscreen to navigate
through this is a nice touch that you'll
want to actually take advantage of now
next to these we also have the typical
Android capacitive buttons now as you
can see we have the menu home search and
back buttons unfortunately do wish there
was some sort of consistency with these
buttons in this case if you're used to a
certain layout this is going to change
things up for you completely you're also
going to see the 3.1 inch capacitive
display with a resolution of 320 x 480
it is a TFT type display so you're not
going to get the colors the resolution
or the overall vibrancy of an AMOLED or
super amoled however the screened
actually does look very not even over to
the right side of the device we're going
to see your dedicated camera button as
well as your volume rocker up and down
now typically the volume rockers on the
left side this is definitely a new feel
however you can easily get used to it
moving to the top of the device we're
going to have the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack as well as your power and
a lock button on the left side of the
device we're going to have the micro USB
charging port now on top of that you
probably notice is actually a little bit
of a lip or a gap here and that's
because this device is a sliding full
qwerty keyboard the keys actually feel
very similar to that of the HTC tilt
there almost a rubberized feel they're
very flat and they provide a great
amount of feedback immediately hear the
actual clicks here but they provide a
great
amount of feedback so you can actually
tell which button it is you're pressing
this keyboard does in fact light up if
you are in a darker environment closing
the device and moving things toward the
back you're going to see the 18t logo on
the battery cover you're going to have
your speaker grille or speaker opening
for your speaker phone as well as the
sound from music sound effects games
whatever it may be and you're going to
have a 3.1 megapixel camera
unfortunately without a flash if we go
ahead and take off this battery cover
question you going to see the battery
first now you can get the microSD cards
you can see here without taking out the
battery that's a nice treat it actually
has a rubber lift segment here you can
actually pull this portion out and that
will allow you to slide your microSD
card right out now it is very nice to be
able to take out that micro SD card I'll
having to pull your battery out each and
every time removing the battery will
actually leave you with the slot for
these sim cards you can see here which
slides from the right to they left into
the device itself you will have to
remove your battery now beating at the
heart of this device is a 720 megahertz
processor now we did say this is a
mid-range android device and that proofs
so right there with that sort of spec
however it does have 512 megabytes of
RAM which easily makes up for the
processor in most cases and 512
megabytes of RAM or onboard storage
apart from that micro SD card for
connectivity options you're going to
have Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G Bluetooth 2.1 and of
course this is going to take advantage
of 18 T's full spectrum edge and 3g
network coming up in our next video
we're going to take a further look into
the software of the motorola flipside
this device does use motoblur over the
android 2.1 operating system so we're
going to give you a tour of the motoblur
skin be sure to stay tuned for that
video if you like this video please give
it a thumbs up and as always thank you
very much for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
