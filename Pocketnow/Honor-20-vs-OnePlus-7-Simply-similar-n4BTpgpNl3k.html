everybody let's talk about a couple of
interesting phones this is the honor 20
and e1 plus seven they're a couple of
reasons why this comparison is
interesting these are two phones that
are not be pro variants and for all
intents and purposes the pro variants
are the ones that get more attention but
the other reason why that is the case is
because both of these phones are
actually kind of hard to find here in
the US the 1 plus 7 is hard to get in
the u.s. because oneplus decided to put
the 1 plus 7 Pro out to the masses and
that one obviously has a few different
aspects to it while the 1 plus 7 looks
like a throwback to the previous
generation the owner xx is a phone that
kind of continues a trend from honor I
mean you used to see on your phones a
lot on places like Amazon but now this
is not the case for the last couple of
generations and of course there's all of
that while other stuff going on like I
mentioned before the oneplus 7 actually
looks a lot like the 1 plus 6 or the 1
plus 60 it has a lot of the same design
cues even though it does retain some of
the colors that you see in the 1 plus 7
Pro in particular this really shiny
glossy reflective mirror gray like many
smartphones these days there's no
headphone jack but there is the alert
slider another trope that comes on a lot
of one-plus devices and let me know why
this phone kind of looks a little
old-school is because well it has that
notch at the top it's a teardrop notch
and it just houses that front-facing
camera so it's not all that intrusive
but of course this is not something that
you find on the oneplus 7 pro which has
a pop-up camera on the other hand
literally the honor 20 is the understudy
of the honor 20 Pro it still has a
really colorful backing the same colors
as the honor 20 Pro including this
really nice Icelandic blue you still get
that hole-punch design here something
that we originally saw the on review 20
and it continues here it still looks
really nice it's a small hole punch that
is nestled right in the notification
area so it allows for it in almost full
screen display but there are some
elements around the phone that are
pretty unique as well mainly the fact
that it has a fingerprint reader
embedded in the power button as opposed
to the in display finger provider on the
1 plus 7 one thing that I came to really
appreciate about these phones is they're
handling the the footprints of these
phones are not all that big compared to
especially their pro variants especially
in the case of the 1 plus 7 the 1 plus 7
pro is just a big phone in general and
this just feels a lot more comfortable
the honor 20 actually has a bit of a
rounded design all over the place so it
is
resting really easily in the hand and
one-handed usage is good across the
board but then we can get into some of
the other details and specifications now
the one plus seven has the greater
internals 256 gigabytes of on-board
storage eight gigabytes of RAM as far as
performance is concerned you have
different processors here but the
experience is largely the same between
these two in the case of the one plus
seven you do get oxygen OS which is
optimized and it's supposed to be one of
the smoothest versions of Android out
there but that doesn't mean that color
OS is really all that far behind color
OS might be a little bit more bloated
might have a few extra features that you
may or may not end up using and it might
be a little bit cumbersome in comparison
to oxygen OS but that doesn't mean it's
any less speedy one thing I really do
enjoy about the gaming performance in
the 1 + 7 is that it includes modes and
different features that help enhance the
gameplay experience including the
fanatic mode which actually super
charges that Snapdragon 855 so that you
can get even better performance while
you're in your gameplay the other twenty
is a little more subtle with these
performance enhancements however honor
is well-known for something called GPU
turbo now it is compatible across a lot
of their devices but GPU turbo only
supports specific games including pub G
mobile and fortnight but no matter what
you're going to have a really good time
with those displays in particular you do
get two different types of displays here
the AMOLED of the 1 + 7 allows for
things like an always-on display and the
colors look really great on there
however you're not getting that high
refresh rate on the 1 + 7 that's
something that was left for the 1 + 7
Pro on the other hand the IPS display of
the honor 20 is tuned really well its
colors look really nice as well it does
not have a high refresh rate either but
both of these devices have 1080p
displays that are still going to give
you a great daily experience and then
let's talk about the cameras between
these 2 phones which is actually a game
of numbers it's pretty obvious just
looking at 220 that it has more lenses
you not only get a regular lens you also
get an ultra wide which is pretty useful
for getting more into the frame and then
after that you even have a dedicated
macro camera if you want to get really
close on some subjects though I'm not
too sure how many situations that
actually comes into play and then
finally a depth sensor for things like
portrait modes the front-facing camera
is also a little bit more powerful at 32
megapixels compared to the 1 + 7 which
rocks 16 the 1 + 7 is actually
example of just sticking to one really
good camera and trying to get the best
out of it and they've picked a good
sensor it's one of the sony 48 megapixel
IMX sensors for the sake of posterity
this is also what the main sensor of the
honor 20 uses that other lens is a depth
sensor so the main comparison between
these two would have to be between the
two main lenses and they both perform
really well after all this is a sensor
that we've seen on a lot of phones by
now and it's doing a great job across
the board however beyond our 20 kind of
edges the one plus seven in this
comparison because it just gives you
more options that ultra white is
something that's really really
appreciated from time to time and then
the front-facing camera is able to get
some highly detailed photos at least
until you turn on the beauty modes and
then you soften a lot of the details out
I guess the main way of talking about
the camera experience on here is that
you're going to get a pretty similar
experience between the two because the
main sensors are very similar however
with the honor 20 you just have a little
bit more to play with if you decide to
do so as far as video is concerned both
the videos on these phones turn out some
pretty good results however it's the 1
plus 7 that is capable of 4k 60 frames
per second so the honor 20 has a little
bit more in terms of the camera but the
1 plus 7 has a little bit more in terms
of the internal specs there's this game
of one-upmanship here but what I noticed
in my usage of these 2 phones is that
the experience is strikingly similar
there's good handling across the board
and good software depending on which one
looks better to you and then the
batteries are pretty much the same
capacity with power saving modes found
inside of the software so you can get
this phone to work pretty much all day
and then fast charging is available on
both the camera experience is similar
like I already said and ultimately these
are two phones that are pretty much
neck-and-neck
it's just unfortunate that they're not
available in more places because they
are very easy to use very enjoyable
devices so in a nutshell I like both of
these phones and like I alluded to at
the beginning of this video it's a bit
of a shame that we don't get these
versions of the phones or even these
phones at all available here in the US
but they're available in many other
places so if you happen to have one or
both of these phones maybe you can let
us know which one you would choose in
the comment sections down below I'm
gonna hand off the discussion to you
let's talk about these phones and see
which one you guys all prefer but for
now we're gonna go ahead and call it on
this one thank you so much for watching
and get into the comments sections down
below to have a discussion about the
honor 20
and the one plus seven the comparison
between the two or which one you would
take or even then just talk about the
phones themselves because they are a
rather rare commodities these days after
that subscribe to this channel if you
haven't already and don't forget to drop
some likes on our video so we know you
love what we're doing here at pocket now
after that we're just gonna go ahead and
call it on this one thank you again and
we will see you in our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
