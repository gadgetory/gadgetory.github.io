mass-production in the next couple of
months retailers prove that they can't
wait for the launch of the Nexus 5 with
pre-registration somehow beginning and
the motorola project ara promises
modular smartphones in the future I'm hi
Mary meta and how about some modular
cell phone plans because I really want
to get rid of those SMS text messages
that are free that I don't really use
and get some free data this is pocket
out daily let's search day off with some
official news as we did get a google
event today but it was not about the
Nexus lineup so I'm sure a lot of you
are not as much as we are but the point
is that we get a new hangouts
application it should roll to your
devices in the next couple of days and
the whole point here is that everything
is moving to the whole leaked images
that we got a 4.4 kitkat where SMS
messages get merged to hangouts aside
from give allegations or Jeff Emig
ations whatever you want to call them
etc etc so make sure you stay tuned for
the new app is apparently it is cool and
speaking of smart phones that have not
been announced but that carriers cannot
wait to start selling you when mobile
has just begun their free registration
form for the google nexus 5 so yeah you
can pre-register for this phone now
apparently you will be able to get it
there but still speaking of that it
seems that when mobile is not the only
carrier that's talking about this phone
as sprint will apparently get a google
nexus 5 after the whole fiasco of the
verizon galaxy nexus so hopefully they
figured out cdma now you won't have to
be waiting for software updates and
speaking of Google we've got new reports
that the company is haunted work in
trying to start mass production of their
future SmartWatch which we still don't
know what to make up don't know what to
expect but apparently google is working
hard on figuring out the battery like
this watch in order for you not to have
to pull a galaxy gear on it and have to
charge it every single day Ali they want
a week of charge or something like that
of the sort but still we wonder what
exactly is google planning to bring to
the SmartWatch to make it unique and
better than everything we already have
to don't want to buy now let's move the
spotlight over to motorola's apparently
the company has just leaked the name of
their future moto smartphone it's going
to be called the Moto G and why moto G
is this a lesser phone on the Moto X is
hard to tell hopefully that is not the
case because a lot of us really like the
Moto
said everything except for the camera so
a lower-end moto is not going to cut it
trust me but again this was just the
leak of the name on the website we don't
have any specification on this phone or
details so hopefully we will be getting
a better phone I just try to understand
what the G stands for and finally for
the hot news of the day we learn about
Motorola's project ara the whole concept
that we found recently to be pretty much
everything that we saw the whole
phonebloks concept that was leaked a
couple of months ago phonebloks allows
you to replace specific portions of your
phone and not have to throw the whole
thing away meaning if your camera is
already did you just swap the camera and
if the RAM on your phone is already did
it you can just swap the RAM and your
storage etc etc which is really
interesting as motorola Valley has been
working on this for a full year and
still we don't know exactly what to
expect but that leaves you to the
question of the day would you be
interested in a modular smartphone
something where you can replace one
thing or the other in my particular case
I would like the idea as long as it's
affordable number one and number two it
doesn't look as ugly as we see in these
concept photos because why don't they
just make that internally and make the
back cover replaceable so we could get a
replaceable battery as well it's not
necessarily modular included in the
package but leave us a comment down
below what do you think and friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is filmic
treat follow us on parking our comment
subscribe to our youtube channel as well
he also follow me on twitter Jaime
underscore to be better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am high metal you later thank you
very much for watching we will see you
