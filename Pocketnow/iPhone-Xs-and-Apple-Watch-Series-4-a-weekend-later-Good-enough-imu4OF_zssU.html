an uncompromised smartphone and
performance this is the Apple watch
series for what Cupertino defines as an
essential redesign and re-engineering of
its predecessor whether both claims are
true or not a little bit too early to
predict but there's really only one way
to make a good first impression I'm hey
metal even at with PocketNow and I've
just spent a weekend with both the
iPhone 10s and the Apple watch series
for brought to you by the geniuses over
a Twix I got a couple of questions on
social media over why I chose the 10s
instead of the 10s Macs and honestly it
had everything to do with me wanting to
give the form factor a second chance see
I love the idea of having a large screen
on a regular-sized phone but sadly the
iPhone 10 wasn't my favorite phone of
last year sure I know it defined a lot
of designs going forward but its
features were easily dwarfed by
competitors that cost a lot less money
this year the design was literally
unchanged the same stainless steel and
glass finish that's quite hefty in the
hand but now with a new color option to
answer other questions on social media
yes iPhones and cases do fits but it
depends on the case the movement of the
camera hump is almost indistinguishable
even in Apple's own cases and then there
are some that are just so snug like in
the case of this one from spigen that
they won't fit though I'll have a full
comparison once I get more time between
the iPhone 10's on the iPhone 10 in case
you're looking forward to an upgrade now
setting it up is literally as Apple as
Apple can be meaning it can actually be
quite simple if you're coming from
another iPhone set your language and
region then simply set both phones
together
the new one will detect the old one and
then you take a photo of Apple's fancy
version of a QR code and boom the
restore process from your old iPhone
begins you then setup face ID in the
process
says that's nearly identical to last
year's during that time as well the
phone will just ask for your iCloud
credentials and then the ones from your
App Store account and case they're
separate and then the restore from
iCloud begins the process is seriously
that simple
once the device reboots it begins the
process of installing your old
applications and restoring your photos
which are now faster than ever and I
assume it has everything to do with the
a12 Bionic processor now in the case of
the Apple watch series for let me put a
couple of worries to rest yes I chose
the 44 millimeter variant but this
doesn't mean that your existing bands
from the 42 millimeter won't work yes
the screen is now 30% larger but on a
footprint that's nearly identical to the
larger variant of the past now I will
tell you that I am regretting choosing
the sport loop because well the material
is nice but the loop makes the watch
look asymmetrical at a glance
setting up the series for was another
breeze once again just place the Apple
watch close to the iPhone both get
detected scan apples fancy QR code and
then since I had a previous Apple watch
it offers to restore from the older
version which I actually recommend now
even if the process is simple and even
with apple's updates and hardware and
software i still find the process on the
Apple watch to be a pain it crashed
twice and it seriously just takes
forever that said once the process was
then we now have a new iPhone a new
Apple watch all set
iOS 12 may look like every previous
version of iOS but Apple has done an
amazing job and making it more efficient
up to the point where it's revived older
phones like the iPhone 10 iPhone 7 as
well still imagine how all that
optimization will work on the latest and
greatest Hardware from Apple like
seriously this phone flies it handles
all animations well it runs absolutely
every application quickly so yes I would
definitely consider it uncompromised I
like new changes in iOS 12 like being
able to close applications by just
swiping from the multitasking menu
avoiding the stupid need to touch and
hold and then swipe to close I also like
how notifications are stacked this
should seriously be an industry standard
to avoid clutter my favourites are
really the new do
disturbance screen time if I'm editing a
video I hate getting notifications that
distract my focus from getting work done
and I love that you can now easily say
that you don't want to be bothered for
an hour on a schedule and then screen
time is awesome for winding down helping
me set limits on how much social media I
consume during the day and the finding a
time when I should focus on going to
sleep actually like how smartphone OEMs
not just Apple but even Google are
working in ways to help consumers not be
stuck on their phones when they should
be doing other things I find that to be
great now in the case of the Apple watch
series for let me just say this to start
this is actually the first ever Apple
watch that I could say that I actually
like it's gotten lighter the aluminum
seems more polished and the back now
appears like if it came from a science
fiction movie and I love changes in
design elements like the crown with its
fancy chrome on it even if I find
vibrations to be the gimmick the screen
is really the major deal with everything
being larger than before leading to a
more comfortable experience using the
watch for the basics but sincerely even
if this is not the best-looking watch
out there probably what I like the most
about the Apple watch series for in
combination with watch OS 5 is that this
finally is a very fast watch and I mean
like the kind that would make any other
watch look ridiculously slow kind of
fast it almost feels like if all
applications were loaded in RAM
permanently because there is no weight
for Apple applications and in the case
of third-party apps the weight is
minimal and sometimes none at all raise
the watch to talk to Siri get a response
almost immediately
like I'm not even playing with the edits
here this is how fast the watch responds
like holy cow I am really impressed and
yes I do agree I don't like the fact
that there are no customizable watch
faces on watch OS but I will tell you
this much even though people made fun of
the infograph watch face that's probably
my favorite one you know how my Android
home screen is full of things like
temperatures sunrise and sunset activity
and world clock so hey I now have a
watch face that has everything at a
glance I still need to test the watch
out more and
things like Fitness but so far I have no
complaints as to its accuracy in my
first couple of spins on the bike
photography on the iPhone tennis is one
of its major selling points but I still
need to test more the iPhone 10 was not
at all my favorite and dynamic range or
portrait mode last year and this year I
do see some improvements at first glance
I noticed zero lag when taking photos
regardless of its day or night
my first impression so far are positive
portrait mode seems improved and I love
that now photos can be edited after the
fact but I do notice that there are some
cases where it struggles and separating
hair from the background and one out of
my five tests so not bad actually
and as we reach the conclusion let me
just interrupt this video for 30 seconds
to tell you about our sponsor Wix if
you're interested in creating a
professional website blog or online
store without any coding knowledge Wix
offers an insane portfolio of tools for
you to design something that's right for
you and it's all drag-and-drop which is
so practical or you can choose from any
of the hundreds of templates they offer
learn more about Wix in the links in the
description below to conclude I think
that actually the phrase not bad is
probably the best way to end my first
impressions of the iPhone 10s and the
Apple watch series for in the case of
the 10s really not bad definitely a
refinement from last year's model but
still more testing to go in order to the
fine of all the internal upgrades make
it worth considering when it comes to
the Apple watch just wow
I don't find it as ugly as it was before
even if the improvements are subtle but
watch OS has really made me not care
like seriously all I ever wanted was
this watch to deliver on its promise and
it has this is how the Apple watch
should have always been which took four
generations to achieve but overall so
far so good let us know in the comments
