list of top smartphone manufacturers as
it took fifth place for itself clearly
it's doing something right but can its
newest flagship the me--for compete with
what many have called the best
smartphone of the year thus far LG's g3
I'm Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the Xiaomi me four versus
the LG g3 before we get started we'd
like to thank our friends once again at
28 mobile for lending us the Xiaomi me
for for review you can purchase your
very own me for or browse dozens of
other handsets for sale by clicking the
link in the description below or going
to 28 mobile comm xiaomi and LG clearly
have different tastes when it comes to
aesthetics while the g3 claims to have a
metallic brushed weave design its casing
is made almost entirely of plastic it
looks and feels accordingly even though
we've often stated how much we actually
like the design and feel of the g3 it's
one of the best feeling plastic phones
around oh and lest we forget the unusual
placement of the power and volume
buttons which are hit or miss with
consumers shammies me--for has a
stainless steel core that has been
machined with incredible precision and
the me 4s build has often been equated
to that of the iPhone 5s though we feel
it also resembles the Lumia icon the
power and volume buttons and the SIM
tray are also made of a premium
stainless steel which is awesome and
uncommon in smartphones and the speaker
grille is machined drilled the me--for
reeks of quality it's one of the most
well built Android smartphones we've had
a chance to review though we wish the
backside of the white model wasn't a
slick glossy plastic there's also a
discernible size difference between the
two the me--for is 7.1 millimeter
shorter and 6.1 millimetres narrower
than the g3 get both or 8.9 millimeters
thick and hit the scales at exactly 149
grams
despite all these visual differences
these smartphones are strikingly similar
under the hood both come with the same
Snapdragon 801 SOC with a quad-core
Krait 400 CPU collected 2.5 gigahertz
both have three gigabytes of RAM and 13
megapixel cameras though the g3 s is
Hardware stabilized and the connectivity
options are exactly the same Wi-Fi AC
NFC infrared and Bluetooth 4.0
beyond that the differences are minor
the me--for comes with either 16 or 64
gigabytes of storage with no microsd
card slot and the g3 comes in 16 or 32
gigabyte variations with up to 128
gigabytes of add-on storage via microsd
and the g3 comes with a 3000 milliamp
hour removable battery but the me--for
has a 30 80 million power fixed battery
some would say the displays are a huge
contrast but aside from the physical
size of the displays we'd beg to differ
the g3 of course has a 5.5 inch quad HD
true HD IPS Plus display that's a total
of 534 pixels per inch the me--for has a
5-inch 1080p IPS LCD for an overall
density of 441 PPI color reproduction
and contrast are great on both though
the me--for is noticeably warmer and
more vibrant than the g3 display and
surprisingly the g3 s display is
marginally brighter in all as far as
Hardware goes we'd give the upper hand
to the meet for the quad HD display on
the g3 is gorgeous and we know many of
you value removable batteries and
expandable storage but the sheer quality
of the me--for is astounding and we
thought the bezels on the g3 were slim
the me fours are even smaller color s
impressed the software situation is a
bit tricky both devices ship with
Android 4.4.2 beneath heavily customized
versions of software we've already
covered the g3 in depth more than once
LG managed to improve its software by
simplifying it without removing any of
its customization features you still
have things like user definable
navigation buttons fonts and animations
and it still comes with NOC code split
view multitasking and quick settings
toggles in the notification shade the
LGU I went from being one of our least
favorite custom skins to one of our
favorites seemingly overnight with the
me--for you don't really get any of
those features it runs me UI currently
version 5 though me UI 6 is slated to
launch in a few days me UI is different
from most other versions of Android it
doesn't have an application drawer
Google services do come pre-installed
and everything is centered around the me
market where you can find thousands of
applications and themes to purchase and
download speaking of themes some are
free though others will require me
credits or currency within the main
market you can heavily tweak the
appearance of your phone software from
lock screens to home screen appearance
to wallpapers and different notification
shades despite having chosen English as
a primary language on the phone much of
me UI is left in Chinese making many
parts of the OS difficult if not
impossible to use like me market me UI
is built-in voice assistant and several
different pre-installed apps fortunately
there is a quick and easy albeit
unofficial way to install Google's
frameworks and get the Google Play Store
and all Google apps up and running
within a minute or two still we'd say
the software isn't the strong suit of a
v4 and it's one of the defining features
of the g3 unsurprisingly you're going to
get roughly the same performance out of
both of these handsets they're both
powered by the same chipset the
Snapdragon 801 but that doesn't mean
they're totally equal the g3 has a 1440p
display while the me--for has a 1080p
panel meaning the g3 has roughly 1.8
times as many pixels to push and as you
all know very well every custom strain
of Android affects performance in a
different way as far as we can tell
day-to-day performance is going to be
about equal with these phones launching
apps and returning home all happen in an
instant but switching apps may be a tad
faster on the g3 with its dedicated
recent apps button we'd be hard-pressed
to say one phone is definitively faster
than the other but we do feel the me
four runs a little more consistently
than the g3 in benchmarks however it's
the other way around
the g3 continually scored higher than
the me four across the board that's just
another testament to show how synthetic
benchmarks don't exactly translate to
real-world performance we haven't really
had a chance to put the me--for to the
test yet so we're not comfortable making
any final comments on stamina however
with a smaller lower res display the
same chipset and a slightly larger
battery were hopeful it can at least
withstand the same amount of abuse as
the g3 which we regularly get around
four hours of screen on time with and
seeing as the me--for isn't optimized
for use on networks here in the States
comparing call quality and network
performance with an AT&amp;amp;T g3 doesn't make
a lot of sense though I've mustered some
respectable speeds with a me--for own
t-mobile HSPA+ and winston-salem will
focus more on this in the final review
of the meet Ford and you can find our
full thoughts on the g3 s call quality
and both of our reviews the 1 watt rear
firing speaker on the g3 has more oomph
than the bottom mounted speaker on the
me 4 no question about it that's likely
due to the dedicated amplifier but it's
not only louder it's also clearer
even if you have to do the old hand
cupping method to bring the sound around
front and although both cameras are 13
megapixels the g3s actually seems to
take slightly better shots we miss focus
board with the me--for and its images
weren't as lively and were far warmer
and even though we found the g3 to be
just mediocre in low-light its
noticeably better than the me for import
lighting which produced an insane amount
of noise and artifacts so for the rear
cameras we definitely give the edge to
the g3 but the front cameras is a
different story entirely
the g3 only has a 2 megapixel front
camera and it's exactly what you would
expect just good enough for a noisy
low-quality selfie or video call the 8
megapixel front camera only me--for
isn't necessarily good enough to compete
with primary 8 megapixel cameras but
it's leagues better than the g3 s front
camera leagues so with all that in mind
which is the better Buy which gets our
vote of approval well both depending on
what you're looking for we feel the g3
is the better overall phone the fuller
package but we also feel starting at
just for 59.99 the me--for is a better
bargain with far superior build quality
still me UI and its idiosyncrasies like
the Chinese text throughout and no
Google services built in solely the
experience a bit although you can
unofficially add Google Play services
with ease it feels like an add-on and
never truly feels like an integrated
function if you need the absolute best
specifications money can buy go for the
g3 but if you're looking for a solid
piece of hardware for less money
the me 4 is a fancy little piece of kit
