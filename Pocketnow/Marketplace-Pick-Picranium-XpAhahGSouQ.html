packing.com and today i will show you a
new game called the cranium and this is
a puzzle game that allows you to change
squares it's hidden behind the puzzle so
where's our a new game so we'll select a
small puzzle and we'll choose this 5 by
5 which I've already done but i'm going
to show you again okay so it's pretty
simple all you do is as you can see on
the top that says 111 so that means that
the sequence will be a one nothing a
one-nothing and a one or you can also
add an X so to select those squares all
you do is double tap and if you want to
add the x's you can do that as well and
for the next one I have a five so i know
that all five and this five by five
configuration are going to be X are we
going to be boxes so I'm just going to I
can either double tap or I can tap and
hold and just drag it all the way across
to fill up that to fill up that row or
column something to do the same on this
one and as you can see we have the
configuration of a tea here so we're
going to move on to the next one so I
have the same thing as I had on column 1
here 1 1 1 so 1 1 and then I can also
add my exes and for these two I have a 3
and a 3 so I know that they all have to
be together ok so now I've actually
solved the puzzle and once you've solved
the puzzle will actually reveal the
image behind it to be a son and it's
kind of in the same shape as the Sun
which gives you a little bit of a hint
and depending on how fast you complete
the puzzle will actually show you which
metal you insult I've won the silver
medal because it was sent within one
minute and 20 seconds but greater than
40 seconds so I can move on to the next
puzzle if I'd like so this one is a six
by five puzzle so we can continue
playing this as you can see I have six
here so I
is going to select this dry it all the
way across and I have a five here so I
know that's going to be all five all of
the little green Squared's so select
that and I have a 4 here so let's see so
I have a 4 here again so I'm just going
to select these ones because I know that
it's going to be a 2 at 202 and I 9e 24
also in my row and a 3 so let's see here
and I've solved the puzzle and it will
reveal the image to me again ok so
that's a rainbow and then we can just
collect here and see what our rank is so
we did that in 55 seconds so that's also
a silver ok so if at any time you need
to learn how to play the game you can
also go to how to play and it will go
through a tutorial or through advanced
tutorial so we can go through the
tutorial and its pretty long so as you
can see we'll just click Next and we'll
show you how to actually go through the
tutorial and actually how to play the
game so we're just going to go back so
on the controls it shows you exactly how
to select the tiles or exes or you can
also use a soft keys so click done so
this is for cranium and the full version
does cost two dollars and ninety-nine
cents but the cranium light which i'm
using right now is actually free on with
a small market place and this is another
marketplace pick where you pick some fun
interesting games and applications on
windows mobile marketplace thanks for
