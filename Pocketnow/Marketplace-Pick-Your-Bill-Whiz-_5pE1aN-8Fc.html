five okay so that's equal to 60 4.89

seven let's say there are about 250
apiece so add that 7.5 and now we have
72 dollars and thirty-nine cents okay so

70 2.39 and it will show up there and
click done and we'll calculate our tax

I've been put that and click done and it
will show our tax rate and give our
total bill with tax was just 79 27 and
let's say we want to change our gratuity

today and we're going to change it to
eighteen percent so click done and now
we have a total of 90 to 30 so how are
we going to split this up well this
program actually allows you to do that

three people as you can see I have up to

click cancel split up among 3p bola can
also click at any point if i want to
change how its set up if it wasn't to
