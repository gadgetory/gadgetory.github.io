parking out at calm and if you're quite
the foodie and social foodie as I am
then you will be interested in this
little application which helps you break
down your bill after you finish eating
and the program is called your bill Wiz
and it's pretty simple but has also some
very powerful features ok so let's say
we're going to order something and we
have the prices on the menu so all we
have to do is to go into this little
calculators quick the sphere and then
down calculator okay so here's where we
can add up our plates together let's see
if it was 24.95 plus let's say 16.99
plus let's say twenty two point nine
five okay so that's equal to 60 4.89
will add three drinks let's say they're
seven let's say there are about 250
apiece so add that 7.5 and now we have
72 dollars and thirty-nine cents okay so
now we can just go to our bill and input
70 2.39 and it will show up there and
click done and we'll calculate our tax
and we can actually change the rate of
our texts so we'll click on here and
attacks in my area is pretty expensive
it's actually nine point five percent so
I've been put that and click done and it
will show our tax rate and give our
total bill with tax was just 79 27 and
let's say we want to change our gratuity
let's say we're a little bit generous
today and we're going to change it to
eighteen percent so click done and now
we have a total of 90 to 30 so how are
we going to split this up well this
program actually allows you to do that
we can click on here on this blue sphere
again and go straight up to the divide
and now if we want to split it among
three people as you can see I have up to
I can have up to like thousands of
people actually on here it will just
click cancel split up among 3p bola can
also click at any point if i want to
change how its set up if it wasn't to
even i can go here and go to individual
and change each person's built inside of
this program so I'm just going to go
back to the split so now I have it split
up three ways with Bill tax bill tax and
gratuity for a total of thirty dollars
and seventy cents person okay so this is
another marketplace pick and the program
is called your bill Wiz and the
application costs only 99 cents on
windows mobile marketplace thanks for
