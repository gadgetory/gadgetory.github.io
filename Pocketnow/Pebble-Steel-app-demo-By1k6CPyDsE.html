and we're here at CES in Las Vegas with
Eric majakowski
of pebble and he's going to show us that
a new ya the new the apples pebble steel
with some new apps and some new
functionalities yeah let's get to it
so watch races look great on pebble I
mean on pebble steel it's that's very
cool so uh one thing we're adding with
the new firmware is a notifications app
so you can now see a list of recently
received notifications around on your
list instead of having them dismissed
after you just missed them show off the
Yelp app so Yelp is a partner of ours
we've been working with them to look for
a little while to make a pebble local
app so this is an app that shows you
what's around you
since pebble doesn't have a GPS on the
watch it actually leverages the GPS on
the phone they also built a pretty cool
feature where if you flick your wrist it
actually shows a bit of like a random
recommendation for a restaurant to try
out this is called cut that has four
stars and it's point two miles away you
can even get reviews on your wrist from
Yelp you can sees seems like a good
steak hose for the five stars yeah
so the Yelp app just provides like
recommendations it's kind of an idiot
the idea is that the water the watch app
is not meant to replace the smartphone
app it complements it so for this it's
about quick just-in-time recommendations
the ESPN app so we partnered with ESPN
ESPN API so you can quickly glance down
and see see what's going on - as you can
see affecting the NBA right now you can
see the games that are ongoing Toronto
is losing too bad that's final yeah you
can also see you can change sports
pretty easily so no strikes we have an
NFL can the city
who's playing now is everyone done yeah
they're all done but like during games
you can get real-time updates right
there I'm a little real time update on
the watch
yeah you have literally every five
minutes it grabs the latest score it's
great because it's just a glass full
screen you don't have to do anything
it's just always there when there is an
update like an injury or something
happening during the game it'll actually
push notification to Washington and
you'll get a vibration let's see sb an
app the Pandora app is interesting it's
in that so the Pandora app when it is
not playing ads allows you to upload or
download songs and you can easily even
change stations by changing stations
right from your wrist which is pretty
cool the idea is that the idea here is
that if you're playing Pandora from like
a speaker dog or your headphones in you
can still get the benefit of the rating
system right on your wrist yes let's
check out the Foursquare app cool so
with Foursquare they built a super
simple check-in app like the goal here
is just to get in and get out so it's a
one-button checking app so it see the
GPS things with Bushan but know what the
Venetian so if you just press one button
you're checked in and it's kind of like
you know on your phone there's oh
there's a Foursquare app and it has all
kinds of different features but on your
watch you want to focus on the one thing
that matters if you really want you can
just like grab your phone and roll into
the the Foursquare app but put on your
watch it's just a check-in a simple
check-in yeah so it's a few apps on on
pebble steel thank you and stay tuned
for more coverage at CES and more from
Pebble tomorrow morning or when you see
this it should be going live around them
so stay tuned for more from pocket now
I'm Taylor Martin and I will see you
next time
Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
