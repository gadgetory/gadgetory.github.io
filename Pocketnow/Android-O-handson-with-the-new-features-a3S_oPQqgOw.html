Google and we have some healthy hot
takes for y'all on what Android OS first
developer preview has brought us so far
but first let's take a minute to break
down a few features you'll definitely
get the most impact from first of all
more venues to dig through for the
settings but it get used to searching
out what you want to toggle you can now
snooze notifications and toggle what
topics you'll be notified on from any
certain app apps that do autofill
like pillar and LastPass can play with
system-wide API is to plug their data
into other apps forms for you iPad pro
fans there's picture and picture mode no
not like that
like that with customizable functions
from that view adaptive icons will show
updated data and some animations OMS can
make these animations fit within their
UI aesthetic there's what color gamut
support for those pictures and videos
that needed advanced Bluetooth audio
codecs are in the mixed including app
decks and there's an API for high
quality low latency audio streaming the
webview experience as crash prone as it
is gets to be a process separate from
the app it comes from the crashes will
report under the original apps better
finally if you know how to get into the
system UI tuner
you've got customizable lockscreen and
nav bar shortcuts of course there's
always the disclaimer that things will
change and with three more developer
previews coming over the next five or
six months they'll probably have to come
back to this conversation several times
over okay now that that's done here's
what we take away from this not much I
will say that if there's one thing
androids don't have the corner on its
out of doing notifications right there
are way too many of them around for all
of them to be useful this is a Bravo
update that said while we're dealing
with mature software that gets iterative
changes a lot of these features tell
that Android is playing catch-up to iOS
and for a guy that first being in the
green bubble of knowing the history of
who's been the edgier player in our
mobile era personally don't feel
comfortable saying that but
picture-picture the audience pc ID 3 and
the adaptive freakin icons those are not
firsts that Hiroshi Laughlin I can claim
does it feel like keeping up with the
Joneses well yes it does I'm just glad
that we well some of us can get there
and in some cases get it done better I
am hopeful that more big consumer pushes
will be done through Google Play
services updates like Google assistant
and I'm also really tired of having to
wait until next year to get all the
features we've talked about this year
for me
fragmentation really takes the o out of
Android
