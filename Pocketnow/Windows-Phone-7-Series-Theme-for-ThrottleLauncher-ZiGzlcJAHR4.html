now calm and today we're looking at a
windows phone 7 series theme for the new
version of the throttle launcher user
interface this theme was created by our
Lee 12 from XDA developers and it has
some rather impressive features however
since this is the first beta not
everything is fully developed but let's
see what we can do here as you can see
the start screen looks a lot like what
we've been seeing with the windows phone
7 series demos lately we have the
familiar blue tiles which can be changed
to other colors like red green and
yellow we have notification tiles for
missed calls text messages and emails of
course tapping on them will drill into
those applications as well there is an
animated tile for the People Hub which
I'll get back to in a minute this tile
for pictures doesn't actually lead to a
hub yet but it will launch your picture
album and this is the game tub and I
believe you can link a custom avatar
which will animate in and out just like
the me tile over here the music and
videos tile will launch your media
player and we can add and remove our
favorite programs down here as you can
see if I I've already pinned the camera
facebook IMDb mobile and the Opera
browser if we slide over to the side we
get a nice clean list of all the
applications on the device so let's go
back and this time we're going to
actually explore the people hug so here
you can add all of your favorite
contacts and as you can see their
avatars will pop up and down which is a
nice little effect if you have more than
six contacts you can slide over here and
expand the grid
let's go back and we'll go into games
here we can basically add shortcuts to
games and entertainment apps and of
course you can slide over and expand the
list so this was a quick look at Windows
Phone 7 series for throttle Aundre one
point zero point one it's still early in
development but it already has some nice
effects and features we're interested to
see how this evolves after a few more
releases so we'll post more information
on pacquiao com that's it for now thanks
