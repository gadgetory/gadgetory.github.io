resistance and a brand famous for making
tractors that's pretty cool I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow this is the b15
from Caterpillar and we got some work to
do
let's unbox it as you can see folks
there's going to be an authentic
unboxing with the bubble wrap still on
the box I have not laid eyes on what's
inside so while we get through the
bubble wrap we will throw a quick thank
you to our friends at clove Co UK who
provided us with this demo unit visit
them for your smartphone needs now that
that bubble wrap is out of here we can
see the yellow and black branding many
many durable devices that have gone
before this is kind of the the default
color scheme when you want to indicate
your device is bad and lean and mean and
in charge and all that kind of stuff
this is just some copyright information
here detailing the use of the CAD brand
we had a look at this device actually at
MWC in Barcelona and where we were told
that it was made by obviously not made
by caterpillar itself made by another
company and and branded as cats if we
can just pop the device on top of this
box off right here and there it is
interesting
no big surprise to see the phone couched
front and center but certainly
interesting to see it encased in this
sort of faux velvet packaging here let's
take this sucker out of the box it's a
fairly lightweight device coming right
out of its cradle there you can see some
fingerprints on the screen so maybe
we're we're second wave on this maybe
another outlet had a look at this first
that's okay
first time I'm seeing it pop up from the
cradle here see what's inside here if
this is the user manual oh it is this is
awesome check that out that's one of the
cooler user manuals I've seen obviously
it's in the shape of the device
well done caterpillar you have amused me
so maybe we'll take a look at that
that's the first user manual I
considered actually reading in a very
very long time this would appear to be
some instructions for removing the
battery door that's handy to have this
is a European power adapter of course ah
there's our USB cable now this is uh
it's a mounting bracket maybe this has
something to do the instructions we just
saw earlier not really sure here's the
battery which explains why the device
was so light to wave in the lamp our
rating on this yes we do indeed it is a
2000 milliamp hour battery included with
the unit out some headphones in the box
another surprise these are some people
like us to take the headphones out of
the box so we can actually see what they
are yeah no foam on these they just go
right in your ear canal and and love
falling out but whatever it's still nice
to see them there this kind of recalls
blackberry toggles of your this little
chrome thing didn't necessarily expect
to see your buds on a durable phone rest
of the box is empty and the rest of the
packaging is just completely barren cat
really going for simplicity there and
let's see if we can figure out how to
take the battery cover off and unlock
switch right there we slide to unlock
and maybe we do pry this sucker off
there we go that's how we do that we'll
stick the battery right in
replace the back cover to preserve the
devices immersion resistance now this is
rated to ip67 for immersion in water
it's also got these this is actually
aluminum here slightly cool to the touch
volume rocker there
what is this USB port is off to the side
here protected by a rubber gasket and
the headphone port up top is similarly
protected looks like a three-and-a-half
millimeter jack there as it should be
there's power standby and why don't we
go ahead and try and press that power
standby button see if we can get some
some life out of this unit here there we
go there's a cat splash screen first of
first of my career certainly maybe it
won't be the last we will have to see I
do want to remind everyone we will not
be doing a full review on this device
but we are going to do a video feature
on it a cat is calling out in addition
to its ip67 certification the aluminum
body the toughened rubberized casing is
what it calls it with minimal openings
that's a Corning Gorilla Glass up front
there we got a low battery warning there
and there's that almost stock Android
build right there it's jellybean 4.1 is
what it ships with here
so this is your quick look at the
hardware of the cat b15 following the
first caterpillar unboxing of pocket
Mouse history certainly hope you enjoy
it once again we want to thank our
friends at clove code at UK for sending
us the cat b15 demo unit and please stay
tuned for the feature video covering
this device coming very very shortly in
the meantime though like us if you
enjoyed the video leave us a comment
below if you have a question or a
suggestion for the next one follow us on
social media and thank you as always for
watching we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
