Wong I'm with pocket now and this is the
Galea 7 vs. Galaxy s8 got the unpacked
brought to you by D brand one cents to
round up the Galaxy a7 they would be the
s6 refined the Galaxy s8 well don't
compare it with the SLE but we shall
contrast you'll definitely feel and see
the difference between the two
generations bezels got the curved edge
treatment comes standard with both the
s8 NSA plus so your hands will really
slide on and off this thing if you don't
hold tight and while we don't need to
dis the flat laterals of the s7 if you
do have to say that this is a pretty
miracle of ergonomics for the s8 coming
off of the spec war samsung came up with
broken record telling us about the 10
nanometer fabrication on its chips which
are supposed to give us an umpty percent
improvement in performance we'll have to
pull the Liggett ory benchmarks when we
get review devices because we're not
playing the oh it opens is that faster
game but the numbers on paper seem
pretty obvious pocketnow.com has worn
those digits the main camera more or
less appears to be the same 12
megapixels with dual pixel and laser
assisted autofocus but as we're talking
as a we now have 8 megapixels on the
front instead of 5 the knowing bit is
that there are no Hardware navigation
keys in the front of the s8 instead you
have to figure out what you're rubbing
on the camera lens or the fingerprint
sensor the camera lens are the
fingerprint sensor the camera lens are
yeah that fingerprint sensor should have
been stuck somewhere else maybe on the
front like on the s7 on top of the s8
there's an iris scanner and facial
recognition
sometimes an s7 didn't have the
headphone jacks are there but bluetooth
5s on desings not on to s7 tell us about
that for you audio files the move to USB
C is also a very much reversible welcome
at this point well
it's welcome and that's reversible well
touch wiz feels roomier on the super
amoled infinity display than on the s7
is boring but just as dense qHD panel
it's more colorful with wide color gamut
support and while we've yet to have been
able to unlock the full power of bixby
with its contextual understanding voice
recognition and advanced camera reading
software we gotta give it credit that
it's there over the s7 which has Google
assistant which is also on the s8 oh
wait that's something that we should
check out we'll have more impressions on
the software as we get ready for our
full reviews they have it yeah
did you know that the bestseller that
Walmart is in fact the banana no well
I'd like to thank our sponsor D brand
for reminding us that if you want to put
your local Walmart or business wealth
best bet is to plant a banana tree
that's terrible yeah this is our ad and
our Samsung unpacked coverage is brought
to you by D brand check them out in the
link below

coverage on the galaxy s 8 NS 8 plus so
