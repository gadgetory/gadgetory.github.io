announced LG G pro to Galaxy Note 3
competitor and hopefully the Sony Xperia
z2 that and much more
I'm Anton I'm Jaime Rivera we are pocket
now coming to you from Barcelona and
you're watching what we are expecting to
see here at the show floor let's start
this prediction video with probably one
of the things that we don't really
anticipate much from and it's Nokia
we've been hearing a lot of rumors of
the company bringing us a ton of Windows
phones and then again all we see is the
Nokia Normandy which is the Nokia X as
well we're expecting for this to be the
first Android iteration from Nokia and
hopefully something new to the table
something close to what Amazon does with
their Kindle lineup but that doesn't
necessarily mean that we will like what
we see right Tony that is shoe f +
Barcelona MWC is knock yes turfs
Microsoft F we're expecting to see some
announcements for Windows Phone 8.1 and
who knows maybe some high-end Lumia
devices running the new operating system
we could all cross our fingers about -
that the Sony Xperia z1 is due for a
refresh we didn't see it at CES we
expected to see the Xperia z2 hopefully
we'll see it here in Barcelona alongside
the refresh for the Xperia tablet Z and
keep in mind the Sony Xperia z2 will
most probably be like the z1 when it
comes to design we're just expecting for
this to be the Sony phone that Sony
should have always published the 2014
Sony flagship so let's see if they could
get us out here then going through LG
the company has done a fabulous job with
their g2 it's probably one of the
favorite phones that I've had last year
and this time we are expecting for them
to give us the international variant of
the LG G pro 2 which was announced in
Korea recently we're obviously going to
expect some hands-on time with it and
we're hoping that this will be more than
just another Samsung copy that we saw
last year they're keeping the g2 design
which is great we just want that
tremendous wonderful battery life of the
g2 as well we have good specs great
specifications and LG already made it
public we're seeing a great speakerphone
on the back and also optical image
stabilization from the g2 but this time
I steroids from software optimization
let's see that let's see
so guava is here as usual as their
sponsors of the show like every year and
we're expecting to see not one but two
ascent phones a tablet and I've heard
rumors of a
of a SmartWatch yeah we've also been
hearing about ziti for example the
companies did a decent job last year
they haven't really published a flagship
and we are hoping that they will but the
company is not really committed to that
market though they're trying to go into
the United States really hard and that's
really what they need but there's
another company that's doing a much
better job in trying to get into the
United States and talking about the u.s.
Motorola's here now under the Novo
ownership given though we have to still
wait for approvals and it's gonna be
interesting to see what motorola /
Lenovo will bring to the table I'm
definitely looking over for that let's
see how that goes and finally the
biggest and hottest piece of news for
this show is Samsung we've got their
unpacked event we've got a number five
at the top and a lot of us are assuming
that this could be touch was five and
not the galaxy s5 but yeah there are a
ton of rumours that the galaxy s5 will
make it to the show or there could be
five devices but no we're all hoping for
the Galaxy s5 and the executives said
whenever the five lens we're gonna see
the galaxy gear - so we're also
preparing for that yeah so that leads us
to the question of this video what are
you expecting from WC 2014 our biggest
bet is that we will see something very
hot from Samsung we've already heard the
commitment from the company CEO that he
doesn't want to make another iteration
of the s4 for the s3 so we are hoping
for something big but leave us a comment
down below and tell us what you expect
to the show so that is just part of what
we expect to see here in Barcelona
there's gonna be other devices from
other companies so there's lots of
reasons to stick with us yeah make sure

video a thumbs up if you like what you
