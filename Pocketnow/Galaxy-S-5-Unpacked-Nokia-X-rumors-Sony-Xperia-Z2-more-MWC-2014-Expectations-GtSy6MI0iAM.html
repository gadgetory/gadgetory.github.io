announced LG G pro 2 galaxy note 3
competitor and hopefully the Sony Xperia
z2 that and much more i'm anton i'm
jaime rebhan we are pocket now coming to
you from Barcelona and you're watching
what we are expecting to see here at the
show floor let's start this prediction
video with probably one of the things
that we don't really anticipate much
from and it's nokia we've been hearing a
lot of rumors of the company bringing us
a ton of Windows phones and then again
all we see is the nokia normandy which
is the nokia X as well we're expecting
for this to be the first Android
iteration from nokia and hopefully
something new to the table something
close to what Amazon does with their
Kindle lineup but that doesn't
necessarily mean that we will like what
we see right Tony that is qu f +
Barcelona mwc is nakia stirs Microsoft
derf we're expecting to see some
announcements for Windows building but
one and who knows maybe some high-end
Lumia devices running the new operating
system we can all cross our fingers
about to that the Sony Xperia z1 is due
for a refresh we didn't see it at CES we
expected to see the Xperia z2 hopefully
we'll see it here in Barcelona alongside
the refresh for the Xperia tablet Z and
keep in mind the Sony Xperia z2 will
most probably being like the z1 when it
comes to design we're just expecting for
this to be the sony phone that sony
should have always published the 2014
sony flagship so let's see if they could
get us wowed here i'm going through LG
the company has done a fabulous job with
their g2 it's probably one of the
favorite phones that I've had last year
and this time we are expecting for them
to give us the international variant of
the LG G pro 2 which was announced in
Korea recently we're obviously going to
expect some hands-on time with it and
we're hoping that this will be more than
just another samsung copy that we saw
last year they're keeping the g2 design
which is great we just want that
tremendous wonderful battery life of the
g2 as well we have good specs great
specifications and algae already made it
public we're seeing a great speaker
phone on the back and also optical image
stabilization from the g2 but this time
I steroids from software optimization
let's see that let's see so guava is
here as usual as their sponsors of the
show like every
and we're expecting to see enough one
but two ascent phones a tablet and I've
heard rumors of a while a SmartWatch
yeah we've also been hearing about ziti
for example the companies did a decent
job last year they haven't really
published the flagship and we are hoping
that they will but the companies aren't
really committed to that market though
they're trying to go into the United
States really hard and that's really
what they need but there's another
company that's doing a much better job
in trying to get into the United States
and talking about the u.s. Motorola's
here now under lenovo ownership given
though we have to still wait for
approvals and it's gonna be interesting
to see what Motorola / lenovo will bring
to the table I'm definitely looking over
for that let's see how that goes and
finally the biggest and hottest piece of
news for the show is Samsung we've got
their unpacked event we've got a number
5 at the top and a lot of us are
assuming that this could be touch was 5
and not the galaxy s5 but yeah there are
a ton of rumors that the galaxy s5 will
make it to the show or there could be
five devices but no we're all hoping for
a galaxy s5 and the executive said
whenever the five lens we're gonna see
the galaxy gear too so we're also
preparing for that yeah so that leads us
to the question of this video what are
you expecting for mwc 2014 our biggest
bet is that we will see something very
hot from Samsung we've already heard the
commitment from the company CEO that he
doesn't want to make another iteration
of the s4 for the s3 so we are hoping
for something big but leave us a comment
down below and tell us what you expect
to the show so that is just part of what
we expect to see here in Barcelona
there's gonna be other devices from
other companies so there's lots of
reasons to stick with us yeah make sure
