one of the things I'm really excited
about with Windows Phone 7 it's the new
OneNote integration so you may not even
know what one knows good for so another
here on my tablet PC this OneNote 2010
and we're going to take a quick look at
some of the basics so let's check it out
ok so here we are on my tablet and right
now I'm looking at my SkyDrive and I've
got a couple notebooks here already so
let me go to this one and it's gonna
open the one note web app this is the
free version of OneNote that anybody can
access from SkyDrive you know it's you
just need a Windows Live ID or hotmail
account to access this and this brings
up the OneNote what web app and you can
see there's a lot of things we can do
here you got different sections on the
left so you can see your primary
sections there's a there's a lot you can
do and OneNote web app here's it you can
select that's a picture you can move it
around you can type in here you can just
type more text in there there's a couple
different tabs you got formatting for
your text base of things headings you
can insert pictures or clipart or
hyperlinks and new tables that new page
in news section so that's great for
organizing and you only have a couple
options there's a show authors this is
for if you're sharing it and a reading
view but here's if you really want to
get into OneNote there's the open and
OneNote button so we're gonna say ok now
this is gonna download that OneNote
notebook off my SkyDrive and open it
right here in OneNote 2010
and what that also does is it sets up
automatic syncing between OneNote 2010
and the sky the notebook on SkyDrive so
if I open that notebook on multiple
computers from the SkyDrive all those
computers will be set up automatically
to sync with that notebook on SkyDrive
and there's no saving or anything so if
I change anything here let me get a pen
that's that's gonna sink right away with
SkyDrive and that's all going to be
updated so here's our tabs those are our
sections you can create a new section
with that and here's our pages so
whenever you have something new that you
want to talk about I like to create a
new new page and you can create plenty
of scrolling space here as well so let's
go back over here and there's lots of
stuff you can do here
I got multi-touch I can zoom in a little
bit
oops so each tab at the top is kind of
like a tab in your folder and you know
you can organize in different ways we
can have a different tab for each
project that you're working on maybe at
work or each class you have the school
and you can put different notes on each
thing and what's great is that you can
put practically anything in here so let
me just create a new page at the end
okay so that's going to be new page I
can draw stuff I can write text so
and I can change that to regular text
very easily and I can this is a feature
that I really like screen clipping it's
fun doing some research and I want to
save something off a web page there you
go and it gives us the hyperlink and the
date that I got it really great for
keeping track of things that you're
researching so that's one awesome
feature another one we've got
you can put practically anything in
these notebooks you can link them to
Outlook you got math equations up here
so let's try a video hello hello
this is a video recording and what
happens if I type stuff while I'm
recording video
okay nothing officer let's finish that
but look at what that is
we get that icon there let's see the
play button
that note is associated with the point
in the video that I was recording and
writing the note at the same time so if
you're listening to a lecture you can
also it works the same with a voice
recording so if you're listening to
lecture and you start taking notes about
a certain part of that lecture this
little play button will show up right
next to the note so that it will jump to
the exact point in the video or audio
recording where you were taking that
another that's a really cool feature I
love that sharing see you hide offers
you can share this notebook even over
SkyDrive with multiple people so more
than one person can be working on at the
same time and you can show who's done
what that's just me here so and I gotta
see any of those so you can use this for
all sorts of things planning weddings
planning vacation trips you know
researching projects organizing projects
organizing tasks organizing your
schoolwork it's really really powerful
there's another feature that's awesome
the condenser space just moves it over
and that you can even include Word
documents here we're not any kind of
document you can actually insert and
include a notebook so anyway that's the
quick look at some of the basics of
OneNote we don't know exactly how this
will work with Windows Phone 7 we know
something's going to be there but uh if
you take a look at what OneNote 2010 is
actually capable of it's pretty exciting
to have this synchronized on your phone
anyway that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
