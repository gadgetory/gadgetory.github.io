revealed with for more information we
get possible pre-order and launch dates
for the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and LG has
just spilled the beans on what makes the
LG b 30 special i'm hi i'm adam Iveta
and the Jack Skellington would see his
new Darth Vader suit I'm sure he'd be
proud this is PocketNow daily the
official is that have to do with deals
the Moto G 5 plus is probably one of the
best inexpensive options out there that
you can pick and if you're in the market
for a budget smartphone this one is
fairly available for $180 on Amazon and
you actually don't have to be a prime
member to take advantage of this deal
you can learn why the description let's
talk about the essential phone I get
asked on Twitter every day when this one
is going to launch and well Andy Rubin
has just teased on his Twitter that
production has already begun that we
should learn more of exactly when we're
going to start getting this phone as of
next week so stay tuned we'll definitely
be recording on that I'll talk about LG
as the company has just spilled the
beans and a press release over what
makes the LG b 30 special it has
everything to do with photography the
company is telling us that it's number
one going to be the first camera out
there with F 1.6 aperture in the lens
which is great the second is that
there's this LG crystal clear glass lens
powering the show here which apparently
is going to do a far better job than
anything we've ever seen addition to
that there is supposed to be an extra
element in the wide-angle camera to
allow less barrel distortion and believe
it or not all this in a body that's at
least thirty percent smaller than the LG
v 20 yes LG I can't wait to see what
this is and I can't wait to give it a
try now let's talk about the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 we've been covering
possible launch dates for a while we've
heard dates for Korea dates for the rest
of the world right now will we have as
possible pre-order date September 1st so
make sure you prepare your wallets and
second of the phone is apparently going
to arrive in doorsteps as of September
15 the Galaxy Note 8 is probably one of
the hottest phones that we've been
waiting for
I particularly cannot wait to confirm
that this is real and finally the very
hot rumors that they have to do with
more information on the iPhone 8 this
claimed with all the functionality that
you can get with this phone again
more rumors coming from the whole home
pod leaked firmware number one we hear
that the home button is actually
resizable because now it's software base
you have that advantage second is that
well apparently that whole design with
the top bezel is intentional at the left
you'll be able to get carrier
information like you currently do and
the battery information on the right and
then that whole speaker in the middle
actually kind of blends in it looks
really nice once you see the markets
that emerged on Twitter third is that in
the case of pro ID apparently in things
like Apple pay you will be able to use
different phases meaning people can
register different credit cards and
authenticate with the face of a parent
or the wife or whatever the case may be
that makes a lot of sense and given the
fact that Apple pay still hasn't really
taken off this could help it a little
but these went to the question of the
day I mean when I heard about this I
thought huh Pro ID for us to be able to
log in with different user accounts to
an iPhone and every time I lend my phone
to my kids I don't want them to go
through my information so that would be
really cool but leave us a comment down
below would you like pro-lite be to
allow this friends you louie goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
videos filmed otherwise I'm talking
