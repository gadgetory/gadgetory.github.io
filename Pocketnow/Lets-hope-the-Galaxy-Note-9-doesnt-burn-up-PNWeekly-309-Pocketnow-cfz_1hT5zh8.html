card would visit a Microsoft store near
you today hello everyone let's get
things started shall we
we're slowly slugging our way to a big
big phone with a bigger battery than we
might have expected just two years after
the mess that was the Galaxy Note 7 is
Samsung prepared for a four thousand
milliamp hour hack in the note nine
well we'll eventually find out we'll
discuss things first but before that why
can't we have a dark theme on Android so
easily
it's LD splash splash on the g7 thinkI
working out well new United States and a
big big bigger phone could be on to
horizon from overseas we're bringing on
Ryan down of Ryan down of his fried face
blog and Daniel Cohen of dear diary this
week on the PocketNow weekly recorded
4:00 p.m. Eastern on June 30th this is
the podcast that brings all things
together from mobile tech smartphones
smartwatches tablets everything that you
used to dream of when you were a kid my
name is Jules Wong you said there's a
pocket now and I guess we shall start
things off with an introduction to Ryan
Dow hello to you sir
hey guys it's great to be back on
talking now weekly it's been a while but
um yeah great to be here lots of topics
to go over today and yeah look important
you're here I wonder how things are
going with fried faced says you've had a
very busy year of evolving yourself
there oh yeah last time I was on pocking
that weekly I was just starting off as
an intern for content creators now and
now you know even I'm still a student
but I still put out some content here
and there so you guys are interested I
you know Mike
ten berries from foods attack more
anything you know consumers like just
feel free to check it out you know it's
a it's mainly a hobby but if you guys
enjoyed feel free to follow get that
promotion on baby alright that's a go
over to mr. Daniel Cohen of first time
guest here the first time representing
gear dari hello to you sir hello there
thrilled to be here and thanks for for
having me on how are things today for
you things are things are great so it's
great just having a super time with tons
of news coming out and really anxious to
see the next iteration of all the
devices that that we've been talking
about that we're gonna keep talking
about especially thrilled to be here a
longtime reader pocket now so thanks for
absolutely no I mean you guys cover have
a greater coverage area to talk about
when you're tensed like drones and Docs
and all of these sorts of things so like
definitely check them out if you want to
get some accessories on could get your
whole tech life round it out properly
the beauty of gear is that if so many
things apply to it so whatever your gear
is that's what we like to cover its gear
they do it every day I guess that's why
it's a diary like you write it down and
it's like yay and I don't I'm not sure
if people like actually write in like
dear diary how do I get over my
relationship with my Garmin I don't know
that'll be interesting if it happens
hasn't yet mmm we'll see we'll see just
a quick note to our viewers and
listeners if you are reading in if
you're writing in if you're doing things
right now that are happening to be
coinciding with this live broadcast that
we're doing right now you can put in
your feedback with the hashtag P and
weekly on Twitter and I'll be able to
track that down and get your comments on
the air maybe we'll start a new thread
and see how things are going on in the
conversation and if you don't have to be
here right now well of course there's
always the email alternative and that is
podcast at pocketnow.com for all your
thoughts and questions and whatnot so
with the hole schematics out of the way
let's try and see if we can talk
Bethan needles we start off with the
galaxy X this well we're calling it the
galaxy X it's been a long time talking
about foldable smartphones and Samsung
everyone's starting to get into things
now xiaomi Alpo huawei are all trying to
compete to be the first went out there
and from the longest time it's been a
rosy picture it sounds a million sounded
like the rosy picture from samsung and
they had all the patents out for this
centipede hinge that would fold this to
this display and well that I mean the
folding apparatus is kind of not the
problem here it's more or the question
of how does how does a display handle
now how does an OLED flexible display
keep able to is how's that able to
handle those redundancies of just going
back and forth so that has been the main
question and that has led to some doubts
here so from the Korea Times we're
talking about a product lunch maybe
early next year 2019 and this would be a
limited run Samsung has been pretty
clear in telegraphing to 2019 date so I
guess it's all up to whether or not it
will make its promise at this point but
the price could be fitting of this
limited edition or loaded nature of
things
2 million Korean Won which translates
out to about $1,900 at this point yeah
that's gonna hurt and that unsubsidized
I'm not sure if people will have to are
able to like spread that out over like
30 months or something but it's it's
gonna be painful so I want to Center
this around the main question here is
foldable really going to get people back
into the smartphone market again are
they going to increase that upgrade rate
because we've been analysts and talked
about this as a kind of a stagnating
market I'm wondering what your take is
and either of you can start I think
Daniel has something more to say well I
mean my question is is you know we've
seen we've seen this before we've seen a
lot of suggestions of this previously
the technology really was
there yet but a lot of stuff that ended
up turning out to be vaporware and my
biggest question is why why do I really
want something that is my phone and my
tablet especially now that we've got
phablets even though we're not using the
term that much anymore which really are
able to actually hit that middle range
why would I want it why would I want it
and why would I want it when when the
likelihood is that it's going to be not
uncommon for some apps to work really
well with it and other apps not to work
well with it I think one of the things
you might be talking about here is the
ax on em with that kind of dual play
deal from ZTE back when it was two rigid
panels I was there for the actual launch
of things and it looked promising I mean
it had that kind of dual screen mode but
in the end it's just two separate
displays and when you go back to like
the Kyocera echo there's obviously that
bezel that goes across the middle of
things but there's also just the fact
that it seems like an incongruity
deal in terms of the user experience in
terms of having to carry the phone in
kind of its outs you know Eagles spread
kind of form so I mean Ryan what do you
think
where does foldable go on from here okay
I'll say the assist device you know like
people have been referring to as the
galaxy s on galaxy X it's rumoured it's
been rumored for a while and I know I
know
samsung behind closed doors have been
showing off prototypes you know at trade
shows like CES for the past couple years
I actually think a few years ago one of
these trade shows actually came the
there on stage presenting these flexible
displays I think at the time they were
calling them the young the young
displays right yeah this point you know
I think any interest in the phone any
real interest in the phones come from
you know hardware smartphones
enthusiasts like ourselves because the
only reason why I I can see people
purchasing this device is if you know
like
it's listen if they're able to come they
execute this fall asleep I think people
would be buying this just for the
engineering like prowess for itself but
you know that that rumored price tag
when you when you have like devices such
as the hydrogen what red is doing with
the hydrogen phone you know it really
comes down to how Samsung a Samsung
because it because asides from Apple I
think Samsung has done a great job of
marketing in the US you know you see
companies like HTC not really being able
to make a dent with consumers in the US
but I really think what Dan says like
why why do I want it I think what I was
is you don't know you want it until the
marketing team tells you why you want it
okay so I I can though I can see not not
everyone you know who's follows you know
parking our readers wouldn't be a
hundred percent excited giving Samsung's
track record of software updates so like
I said it really comes down to how they
approach this phone when it launches
with the marketing and you know also
what really concerns me even with a
flexible because I believe this is also
an OLED panel right yeah what concerns
me is what you know what materials are
they gonna use are they gonna go back to
like plastic cuz I don't think like the
aluminum that they use now it's really
like flexible you're even like plausible
to use a little device right so are they
gonna do what Microsoft does with the
surface book you know like a magnesium
hinge so there's a lot of questions to
be you know answered and you know what
they're doing with the s-92 it's a it's
a it's a iteration year where they're
playing catch-up so they've got exterior
speakers right so are they gonna bring
you know some of those features to the
device to and you have questions like is
there gonna be notch words like where
the front-facing cameras going to be put
so it's a lot of question marks so I I
think the best thing to do is just wait
and see and just let the market decide
okay sorry no no I was about to say that
sounds like a stone soup of unappealing
yeah go ahead to continue idea so here's
my question so what they're talking
about at least at this point I think is
is a device that's a
seven inches open and four and a half
inches when folded down so so great so
you get the advantage of having
something that's more pocketable that's
smaller when it's closed and you get the
advantage of something which which it
has a lot of screen real estate screen
estate when it's open a couple of years
ago I might have actually been much more
enthusiastic about this before we
started watching phones get larger and
larger and larger but but most of us are
now carrying phones which are a lot
larger than we were just three four
years ago and we don't have a problem
with it so I'd be happy I'd be fine
carrying something even a little bit
bigger than the iPhone X which actually
gives me probably most of the size of
what we're talking about here without
the additional expense concerns about
the hinge concerns about the apps so
again I go back to other than the fact
that okay Greta can pockets only that's
only four and half inches large small
when it's closed why I'm really
regretting how I stack this show now I
really wanted to like tail on to that
7-inch topic but well we're gonna get to
that in just our minutes right now I
know is like totally it's just you know
all this goes you know hand in hand with
each other I feel like we still haven't
resolved the question of that you know
redundancy that fatigue that happens
especially if the design allows for some
tolerances in terms of just being able
to store it and it kind of flexes a
little bit while it's in your pocket
like is that gonna survive I don't know
at least the year like two years what's
the story on that for 2-grand it better
bit better yeah I'm actually I'm
actually gonna go back to my previous
point I was thinking about this so
asides from you know smartphone
enthusiasts like the mean I think the
mainstream consumer that will actually
purchase this this device are people
that are already that are you own
Samsung devices like the people that
like how big producer Ola panels and
also people that the rare the rare the
rare hundred people in each state that
have a gear s3 SmartWatch I don't I
don't I don't think unless they do
something special with you know their
cameras it's like I don't think a
foldable display really gonna win any
mainstream
consumer over its although yeah no
totally it's just that initial wow
factor and the rest of its going to be
in the marketing machine there a lot of
it's gonna be software because again
we've seen how this has played out
before with like the separate apps or
even just androids native split-screen
kind of thing going on they're probably
gonna maybe amp that point out just a
little bit more than they usually would
but otherwise this is gonna be a tough
one I mean if the folding mechanism is a
streamer you know like folding it in
half and or it's expense a larger screen
I don't really think consumers want that
the only the only thing I can see where
it's really taking off you know with
consumers is if you can somehow wrap it
around your wrist I think like that's a
huge draw but so just expand like you
like Dan said we're already having the
norm now for screen sizes is around like
average like 5.2 inches to 6 inches
these days I don't see why there's a
needs this is all the stuff of trade
shows from like 2010 onwards like you
just go every single year they have the
demo tape that has the freaking foldable
phones they were fully around the wrist
and then that's it that's a Las Vegas
for another year so I mean well I think
it's I also think it's def a do a got
fun arrival if they just slap on you
know basic Android who TouchWiz if you
don't overhaul the UI for this device
you know yeah I'm staying on this topic
around abouts
but something a little bit more closer
to at least our current moment we have
rumors lots of rumors talking about the
Galaxy Note 9 talking about its camera
and how the battery it's large
extremely large battery that's not
bloated at all by any stress from the
design of the engineering inside no not
what happened to the note 7 at all
talking about that going on there's a
possibility that we might see roughly
around the four thousand milliamp hour
mark as I just said and all this
launching perhaps on August 9th we also
talked about just a couple of weeks ago
about how executive
there was an executive decision that
delayed the thing by a couple weeks
because apparently they will um I think
it was the vice president of the group
wanted a thinner phone after seeing some
Chinese phones that were like all crazy
so yeah we have yeah I also heard it was
also like rumors also not only this but
actually I heard it was they wanted to
make it a little thicker so it feels
better in hand that's what I read
thicker okay hmm interesting
I don't know no no no yeah I think they
want to I think you're right they want
to shave off a few millimeters so that
in hand feel is better compared to
competing Chinese large number I
remember was half a millimeter which I
mean we're talking about smartphone
we're talking about things that living
things even though it's you know huge in
the hand it's still very small space
when you have so many components stuffed
in there and you're fighting for every
single cubic micron that goes into it so
right four thousand meter for lives and
four thousand millimeters for there's a
million powers into that space which is
said to be huge
anyone have any doubts anyone have any
lingering feelings right now
well I think when the shortcomings of
the no date last year was that it to my
recollection it had a smaller battery
capacity in comparison to the s8 plus
but aside from that you know like I
didn't really have that much gripes you
know after coming off with the note
seven the display was solid I always
like I was handsome displays look the
camera was solid I think my my biggest
gripe with the no ii like i said was
battery and also long the speakers i
think there would bottom firing speakers
they were a little tinny but given what
they've done with the f sign that's nine
plus if they can just refine the no date
i think you know um they might have a
winner in hand but you know doctors
those 2015 have kind of been stagnant so
I don't think consumers are gonna you
know since it looks the same I don't
think they're gonna be rushing out for
the note nine but I think it's a it's a
solid choice maybe hopefully I mean
well Andrew Wallace says on Twitter
hashtag peon we
clearly I don't know about you guys but
a bigger screen is pretty good to me as
long as I get to keep using my pop
socket lols um Daniel do you have
anything to follow on in terms of this
look I think at anytime that we can
actually see a bigger battery since
since battery technology has not kept up
with with any of the rest of the
technology that we've been seeing I
think any time you can get a bigger
battery it's a good thing and and you're
talking if you're talking point four
millimeters you said most of us would
end up putting it in the case anyway so
slightly thicker phone slightly thinner
case all good I mean totally that's
totally fine it's just the fact that
again I bring up the note seven not to
be blind but to be okay so they were
working with this amount of thickness
and this amount of space in the phone
for the battery to fit in they put it in
a 35 million 3.5 amp power unit I'm just
gonna say that and in the problems were
caused to say the least and frames were
just a little the little problem you
know no smoke or anything but like
design engineering firms we're kind of
worried about this being okay this is
kind of crazy you didn't put enough room
there were no tolerances in that space
for the battery to swell and contract so
now we're going up to another level of
power here 4000 million powers and
there's going to be a slightly larger
space apparently that's why the camera
module is being rumored to like go
horizontal because that that that's
saying that much of that excuse me that
much space up to be able to like you
know fit everything in so and the worry
is that if they you know cutting any
thinner than it is right now maybe it's
gonna be all that like that point five
millimeter it's gonna be all glass and
the glass will just be thinner and the
insides will stay the same but I don't
know at this point I'm still kind of
we're Lee watching here and look and
look they they they were able to
overcome that tobacco debacle they need
to get this right if they're gonna do it
they really can't afford to actually
have another issue with batteries so I'm
curious to see what they come up with I
think it alright really it really
depends on how they optimize the
software to I think this is the first
year where the models with the Koala
comm chips that have been reported to
get better the better like stamina in
comparison to the Exynos equipped
handsets so you know I well what was the
capacity on the no date last year I
think around thirty five point but no
date was around 30 it was it stayed the
same I think yeah 3500 and you know it
was I think it was averaged you know it
definitely not meant for power users so
it remains to be seen if a 500 milliamp
hour you know difference it's you know
if it makes a huge difference but then
the day I really think it depends on if
samsung has really refined TouchWiz to
be less bloated and less you know
consume less power
but um I I think I think you know in
real-world usage I think you'll probably
get like an hour and a half I'm just
saying an hour Nelson home more than no
date correction 3300 milliamp hours for
the note aid they all really being
conservative right there honestly after
that yeah no seriously and that was that
note five I think was around 3000
something 3,000 below that there if
that's the case and I'm gonna update my
prediction and say it'll probably last
the stamina is probably gonna be maybe
as long as my pixel to Excel but guess
it's we'll wait and see wait and see the
game for a lot of the news that we do
here but hey just a matter of fact the
future is coming don't be concerned it's
gonna be here let's talk about well I
guess it's the elephant in the room just
because it's just so huge and it's okay
I mean frankly speaking we're in the age
of the extra tall
to you by 1 or whatever ratio you want
to put on it nineteen point five by nine
they're doing crazy math on these things
but apparently the sequel to last year's
mate ten could be pretty darn big so if
we're talking about to buy ones display
we're talking about a seven-inch display
a six point nine inch display I should
be more exact at that on the May 20
it sounds like Gundam 820 proud maybe
both it could be me twenty could be me
twenty Pro we're not sure as of yet
people have been kind of SEO exploiting
the thing by just putting in me to May
20 promo
who knows so um to buy one flat flab
let's because they're flabby
I don't know to one phablets what do you
all think is it time to bring back the
phablet or do you think that in our
current age everything's just a fact
bring it on yeah I hope already like you
know even though we've been going up in
screen size I think like I don't what's
that ask that one weird aspect ratio
that every manufacturers been adopting
they're really thin a narrow one I think
it's like a 2 by 9
note the note 8 is 18 by 9 18 18 and 1/2
by 9 right I liked it better I did
better when when these tablets were a
little wider because I understand they
made it you know taller so it's easier
to hold in the hand but you remember
like the HTC EVO days from Sprint with a
kickstand I like that yeah I liked it
when the phone's were wider because it
seems much more of a cinematic
experience and I find it much more
easier to type in portrait mode when the
phone is wider so totally that's just
dirty or bill it's it doesn't have black
it doesn't have like the litter box
thing that happens because as a matter
of fact if you if you really want to be
all cinematic about it then you'd have
to go all the way up to two point three
five to one and by then I'm not sure if
anyone would even go would even venture
that far near seven inches I would
say if we were to like if that's to buy
wine and we work and to convert that
into like a something that has a sixteen
by nine traditional traditional it feels
so weird saying that it's we've been
growing up too much in the sixteen by
nine age but in any case that that
sounds like maybe six point three inches
I guess maybe it sounds like six point
three inches and a sixteen by nine thing
you know I've never been a fan yeah I
work with a lot of content creators
asides from you know what I do I used to
work with a lot of youtubers as well and
I don't think anyone out there you know
is on the top of their head you know
it's thinking I'm gonna film my you know
videos in the 18 by 9 aspect ratio it's
always been sixteen by nine I think the
18 by 9 aspect ratio is just an attempt
by smartphone manufacturers to just keep
their devices tall and thin I don't
really think people are making a
conscious effort to really go adopt that
aspect ratio I think a lot of it has to
do with how you use your device is your
device primarily for consumption and if
it is for video then then wider can be
really welcome you know for me my device
is probably more on the communication
side of things and I do find it much
more comfortable to use something that's
a little bit thinner and a little bit
taller than something that's wider so I
think a lot of its gonna have to do with
how do you how do you use your device
what's your main purpose for it are you
looking for a something that's primarily
a phone or communication device and you
use some sort of a tablet for most of
your for more of your consumption than
not or are you using your you want to
use your phone for everything and just
not have a tablet at all right that's
that's a great point because like that's
let's say for example with Samsung what
they do with their S line in their note
series the let's say the s9 is their
flagship device right most people are
gonna use as a communication device so
obviously I think it should be tall and
thin but when we're talking about
phablets I think more people are buying
tablets as more of a consumption device
me because it's easier to type on but
also I think because they want to watch
videos I think those devices in order to
differentiate none from the flagship
devices should be wider because if it's
just you know tall and thin then it's
just like an XL size of the existing
flagship you know I think phablets have
really aside from having a stylist have
reached in the recent years just having
a difficult time differentiating
themselves and they really just become
the Excel versions of existing flagships
yeah I think everyone has the right
fourth factor for them and they'll know
it they'll seek it out for themselves
and again it's even though as much as we
talk about Hardware here it's all about
the software the tailor is that
experience down and make it more often
mole for whatever it is out there um
couple things from hashtag P and weekly
on the Twitter's goran petrovic says
that I don't think Samsung can keep the
note in line successful for too long
there's less and less differentiation
between the Galaxy S and the note line
they're too similar
it's just that S Pen I mean well how
much of a difference does that S Pen
really make yeah I don't think it makes
the world of difference anymore I know
of before when there is more than one
chipset manufacturer because when we
when we had Texas Instrument and I
forgot who else like Nvidia making chips
like Qualcomm was forced to rest's
released two to two flagship processors
I mean two top-of-the-line processors
per year now it's just streamlined so
one single processor so I think yeah I
think if Samsung had options more
options from Qualcomm I think they would
have included you know to the more to
their fairness I mean the the Qualcomm
strategy here is kind of more widespread
they got windows to on arm to consider
as well as all their mid ring it's like
well not even memory it's like premium B
and as opposed to like the premium a
like the 845 they have like maybe the
710 Eclair like that so they're really
tried to adapt to things and I just
remembered when the note you know was
was known to be the power users phone
and I think that yeah the common we had
from Twitter you know it's it's really
Samsung forgoing the note line and a lot
of it has to do with the battery I mean
Daniel what do you think is the what was
the genocide quoi for you about the new
line
I mean look I I haven't used the no date
when I when I used a note I loved I love
the s-pen I love being able to take
notes I just I worked differently now so
I don't need it I don't miss it and
going back to the previous conversation
if you're worried about battery life if
you're worried about every single micron
of space you have available
having the s-pen built into something
really does you have to make other
choices so I think it depends on how you
use it we've got Mike Anderson one of
one of our editors on gear diary
uses the know date who loves it swears
by the s-pen I mean it's how he works so
a lot of this has to do with you know
what are you using your phone your
phablet whatever you want to call it
what is your purpose in having it what
are you using it for and and I think
that kind of drives a lot of a lot of
the choices people make when when
purchasing something and I think the
more options that are out there the
better
alternatively they can just
alternatively they can just make the
note a bigger phone I was I was playing
with the si+ and the no date and they
just felt really similar in size the
size from the fact that the SAT had
rounded corners and the no Nate had more
of a boxy feels like bacon I think they
can you know make the screen a little
bit bigger to accommodate a bigger
battery and I suppose
yeah totally especially at the like the
two by one aspect ratio we're dealing
with nowadays like it really takes that
much more of increase in the diagonal
under the screen in order to generate a
larger increase in width so when the
first came out if I'm remembering
correctly it was it was significantly
larger than any of Samsung's other
offerings if I remember correctly so
that was like a freeway preemption oh my
god it's huge I mean I remember like the
first time I picked up something that
large I was like oh my why would I ever
want to use this and now I pick up you
know the phones I used to use I'm like
this is too small but but I do think
that if they went up in size as as
you're saying I think that that would
actually reinforce the the
differentiation of the lines ya know
yeah that was the point I was trying to
make the differentiation between
flagships and phablets you know you
don't have to go water but you can go
bigger you know
like you don't necessarily have to make
it the Excel version but yes totally
totally um I've got a few more topics to
do you ago through not much time to do
so so I think we can just go with a one
answer from each y'all on the next ones
started off with dark theme Android will
barely actually adopt a manual toggle so
far on the pixel - it's just been an
adaptive feature so whenever you put on
dark wallpaper then the notification
shade and other parts of the UI would
turn into black and this is something
that been people have been asking for
for years since Android and sentence
even before then and Google has kind of
waffled on this so um finally great this
is this is awesome and why or I guess
even a better question is where do you
most appreciate your duck beam your dark
mode I think the Google of paths would
have no-brainer included a dark theme I
just feel like Google as of lately has
been omitting a lot of new features I
remember using the razor phone last year
and I think there was a manual toggle to
enable dark mode on your device because
it seems like the razor phone was you
know meant for power users and gamers it
seems like Google as of late has been
trying to target more of the mainstream
consumer and I don't think off the top
of people's head they would want a dark
mode so I think you know there's
definitely been a shift of focus and I
don't it also goes back to this theory I
have you know Google has been really
disconnected with the user base that
really you know put them to where they
are today you know with the original
Nexus devices and the pixel devices it
just seems like they they aren't really
listening to what their user base once
do you agree to him I'm trying to wrap
my head around like I used dark mode on
my computer sometimes just because it is
easier on my eyes but I think you know
Apple of Apple comes out with it's a big
deal with you know dark monel i think in
a the year is so iterative that that i
think
a lot of companies are talking about
these things and trying to make a big
bigger deal out of what I don't think is
as big a deal as it as it ought to be as
far as a manual toggle for me personally
I wouldn't need it it's one more thing
to fail it's one more thing to actually
have to deal with primarily if I'm gonna
go in dark mode I'm probably gonna want
to use it across the board for a period
of time on my device so I have no
problem actually just going into hitting
going digging down into a menu a little
bit and going for it don't see it as a
huge huge deal personally yeah I mean
yeah well I was just about to head on
over but the one thing I just want to
say is that a lot of apps in lieu of
system-wide changes have been doing to
our quote on themselves a Twitter for
example both on iOS and Android they
were right doing it so they've been
taking our inside with a slack that a
lot of these OS developers just for one
reason or another just don't see is
important to them or is not really
practical gotta go over to you the LGG
7th in queue yes we're still talking
about that yes thank you very much as
well so what's it gonna take what's it
gonna take for all of you to switch over
to an LG phone how about an ad from the
team over there the creative team but it
features freaking Audrey Plaza like yeah
of course you want to have a celebrity
to deal with that but I think as opposed
to like other campaigns that they've
done I'm not sure if you guys are aware
of any of their campaigns but for the g5
they had Jason Statham basically
interactive clones of himself and go
around remember that and crazy just like
doing things I don't know here's the LG
g5 like I'm like having not learned from
some of the Silurian doors launches like
look at what laughs look it's relevant
good luck the BlackBerry 10 launch with
water
Halle Berry and then when Windows Phone
was still a thing they had just all but
I don't I
it's like they never learned yeah 1 plus
5t Jessica like rest I can't pronounce
her name but she's a great model great
actress whatever but apparently
apparently a smartphone expert
apparently
yeah exactly yeah they should have used
the money to book all these you know
like celebrities and you know I I would
have used that and portion it for aside
to give away phones for more reviewers
to review or just as a giveaway I think
that would been a better marketing
tactic rather than getting you know a
celebrity and telling you how why you
should get this phone drink if you're
trying to play to the market if you're
trying to go on TV then you're going to
have to play the game you're going to
have a celebrity because that's part
that's part of the ball field that
you're on but I feel like they've
actually taken some advice from people
that have their head straight and have
actually wrapped these things these
little commercials on features like the
hey Google take a selfie that's a pretty
cool thing you know they can show off
I'm not sure if it you know in the age
of privacy hawkish Ness and Google being
this evil data and Overlord that has
become this way because they've always
been removed don't be evil from their
mission statement kind of scary oh well
that well faith look in Google because
Google but yeah that's a totally I feel
like you know they have a boombox
speaker of a little ad at of sorts
talking about that and they also have a
couple things with a I can't miss
well-liked the entity centering these
ads around it's single feature and I
feel like that's something that has been
sorely lacking over the past several
years and I think it's and I think it's
key in a year when we haven't seen much
that's made us go much that's new much
the minute that's
go Wow to really focus on okay these are
some of the ways that this particular
device is going to be more usable for
you than what you're currently using
this is why you're going to want this
phone I I love steak the movies okay
that's not getting me to buy a phone
it's not but I mean at least they have
another kind of the also take a little
dig at Apple I guess because they were
talking about Oh your phone is so slow
why don't you just switch it out already
so I mean they're kind of being
opportune I think that they're doing a
good thing it's a good step at least and
finally for the news do you want an
iPhone 3GS in 2018 quick answer yes or
no Ryan no and Dan no more than I want a
manual typewriter okay sure I mean so
the story behind this is that there's a
little bit of nostalgia a little bit of
happenstance going on in South Korea
where eske's a MVNO 7 mobile I think is
the name of it is apparently we just
unearthed a whole crate of iPhone 3GS
they did that due diligence on checking
to see if everything's all right and
they decided hey why not just sell them
for like 40 bucks apiece and if anything
they'll make interesting paperweights I
mean I'm not sure how the software
situation would be on this because they
started out on iOS 3 the most they got
was iOS or the latest they got was iOS 6
but I'm not sure if the servers are
still kind of they're not sending out
any of those updates anymore so I don't
know I mean what do you think the stalls
are gone wrong yeah actually the only
reason why we'd get it through yes is to
appreciate the scheme work design
language of iOS of the past
I personally I still haven't really you
know come to gripes with the new one pre
this pre iOS 7 days were amazing right
do you agree yeah I know I know people
are getting tired of it
looking back I'm much more prefer cuz
every it's iowa's now just feels a
little bit too simplistic did I mean
it's it's definitely it's definitely
changed in ways that are that aren't
always to the positive for sure a friend
of mine actually just recently upgraded
his iPhone 4s I think and so he gave me
this one yeah so he gave me his 4s and I
cleared it I loaded my stuff on it and I
put it back in the drawer because it's
unusable I actually have you seen the
App Store now in comparison to the App
Store back then the App Store now in my
opinion is is horrific oh I hate it I
hate it it's horrific it's unusable you
have to know what you're looking for
yeah ya gotta really if you're not
trained in SEO again like this is the
something that you might want to avoid
but again somehow apples captured all
these people into using iPhones and
iPads and somehow they are getting by so
and then there's all the developers
themselves they're kind of complaining
about how much Apple's taken from them
so yeah we can get into you can get into
a drainage pipe on that topic for like
hours on end but I really want to
apologize first of all to Donovan Turney
on Twitter hashtag can weekly my Google
home just asked which device T's for a
selfie Thanks also your walk let's all
let's all make let's all make a pact and
revive level s I think that'll do
everyone at you know I mean TCL has the
palm license they say they're gonna do
something this year hopefully maybe I
mean I'm excited I'm excited that the
prospect of a Palm Pre form factor with
Android I know I know black rates have
to do with the print those it was a
decent attempt but I'm excited because I
I know that the key one has been
receiving phenomenal reviews Dan quick
word on any palm hopes before we take a
break no sorry
nope on you on you just I'm good with
the way things have been evolving I mean
I I actually like the consolidation that
we
because I think it actually gives
developers gives the companies grossly
gives the developers the chance to
really refine what they're doing rather
than having I mean a couple years ago I
was thinking about this there was so
much more fragmentation even with so
many more lessons that have now gone
into the end of the graveyard that it
really made it I think that much more
difficult to get the apps that you
needed working on the devices that you
were using and working well so I'd
rather I'm really at a point where I I'm
happy to have a diversity within the
range of Android and iOS
but I really like having stuff that
really just works and works well and
works quickly onward and upward as we
say right sorry I hate to be boring but
I like my stuff working you know the
days the days of things crashing
constantly I'm really happy that they're
gone yeah yeah well I mean that's the
part that people block out of their kind
of rose-colored glasses but hey I mean
I'm not one to prevent that from
happening they have the Liberty to do
that we'll take a quick break before we
get into our next segment and talk to

are back with our next segments and this
one I'm going to call the good and the
gripes I've been recruiting both of you
guys
and an hello to you again talking about
just like one topic from each ear that
has really gone at you you know in a
positive way in a negative way whatever
way that it has taken you and I want to
start off with you Ryan because you seem
to have a soft spot for a phone that is
getting critically bashed and you're
like saying that people it's not
original it's not good at all
what's your deal oh wait which phone are
you referring to here twelve oh okay
right because I know right okay so I'll
say this I think you know tween eighteen
has been such a stagnant year granted
industry has been stagnated stagnating I
think the flagship launches of 2018 have
been just so boring I had the chance to
go into the Best Buy the other day and
go you know play with the G some and
didn't queue I can't believe I just said
the whole name but um it was my first
impression you know playing with the
device it was just so aggressively
average you know like the colors on the
LCD panel you're so washed out and the
cameras or you know they've been doing
wide-angle but just not impressive
anymore so just to see HTC go back to
basics cuz I mean I did I did go to a
launch event like the for an LCD panel
because I think they're using SL at CD
six like the colors pop you know it's on
par of AMOLED the obviously contrast is
not there but they seems to be going
back to basics and refining you know
what's worked and improving on it kind
of goes back to Dan's point at first
about things just working but everyone's
adopting the notch I think you know not
the notch is horrific from the pixel
three leaks you know looks like the
Excel variant it's also getting a notch
- um I'm all for what Samsung and HTC is
doing which is making the bezels dinner
because um you know I I have an iPhone
10 - but um when you're watching videos
and you're zooming in you're not really
making the most out of that screen real
estate so I think the fact that HTC has
gone back to basics is just that
actually differentiates them from the
rest of what the industry is doing
besides from Samsung but Samsung you
know it is they're you know they're
they're variant they're it Odori you're
you know so and it's also disappointed
to hear that Essentials not coming out
with a sequel for their phone because I
was really excited for prospects of a
essential phone - I maybe I'm just a
nostalgic person I'm I'm I'm work you
know bring back the Moto maker days you
know we really want those glory days to
come back now I really want more to make
her - okay that's it I mean the motor
Motorola now I don't it's like their day
think about what would happen if we
could get some of the phones that we
loved with the current tech built into
them that would be that would yes that
would be awesome
which which I would want an Icee c-17 I
would you know I would actually go back
I would say I wouldn't want a droid
incredible a little a little bit bigger
with today's tagline that phone was such
an it was such a phone a strong
statement but um yeah maybe like a Moto
X pure edition or a Nexus 6p
you know refined internals and slimmer
bezels I hate to say that this podcast
is taking place in 2018 but what Android
P is shaping up to be you know it's I
know it's inspired but no it's it's
incorporating gestures but you can't but
no help but think it's kind of inspired
but what Apple has been doing with iOS
it also goes back to that little back
and forth we had about dark theme you
know if you're coming off a device with
ice cream sandwich or but then you go to
anodized with Oreo II or if you're going
from Ice Cream Sandwich to the device
with Oreo you notice that it went from
the holo blue team con dark theme to
more brighter theme right and I think
you know mainstream consumers would have
appreciate the bright themes because
very reminiscent of what Apple's been
doing with iOS but - I think power users
who want
options like that bright team rep great
theme with no default stock option to
disable it it's just too like it's too
straining on the eyes so like you're
going to play in Google sandbox you go
to you won't want to have the Google
Adam skins if you don't conform to these
sorts of design guidelines and whatnot
then well you might it's gonna be a bit
it's not fair work that way but it is
what it is it's Google's ecosystem think
of it a CV system I I kind of see it
this way Google's you know approach to
their products because I'm assuming once
they launch the pixel I'm assuming
didn't keep a lot of the people who
worked on previous Nexus devices to work
on the pixel devices I don't know it's
just speculation but it seems that since
that you know transition occurred
Google's world or approach when it comes
to products it I describe it as the
world of Tron and now it's like Google
since not even a world it's Google's
playground that makes any sense it's a
little bit - for toddlers with the
exception of I think he did a great job
with the pixel book calendar hmm I mean
well totally I mean their Hardware game
has been stepping up but it definitely
helps that HTC contributed half their
team to it but half their engineering
team to it so don't get me wrong the 2xl
is a great device but you know I
yeah yeah we kind of ended them on a
little bummer there but I loved what you
said before which which is such a great
term and it really does capture it
you're talking about phones being
aggressively average and and I think
that's part of I think that's part of
what's kind of weaving its way through a
lot of the the thoughts that a lot of us
who love our tech and have have been
doing this for a long time and really
passionate about it and I think that
term really captures
where a lot of us are at right now
having said that I have to say you know
that Huawei of all the companies around
whoa easy yes doing an amazing job yes I
am blown away by what they've been doing
and the stuff that they're doing even
though they don't want it called Huawei
honor they just wanted to be honor
I reviewed won the honor phones I mean
they're really amazing stuff good style
good hardware really impressed with that
this year you see like I I totally
forgot I never put hall in the picture
because I mean I've been on Verizon all
my life and they never really had a
Verizon compatible phone but I always
when I when I saw the great reviews for
the p20 or any of their main devices I
always make an effort to overlook it
because I know this is something that I
can never have sorry I was you know I
was really excited you know because they
were supposed to I know 18 its et and
Verizon weren't supposed to you know
carry you know their flagship what was
the main tenant may 10 Pro but you know
with politics and all that kind every
Federation but yeah like I I mean I know
not just Holly I make a conscious effort
to overlook all the buzz about oneplus
in Bali because those are phones that I
can never use besides from the small lab
I mean totally but we're laughing
because we're trying to start by just
stop ourselves from crying here yeah I
just read something before the oneplus
in the first I think it's been out six
weeks has they've sold a million devices
which is more than they've ever sold
before
so 30 days 22 days there you go
yes unbelievable that's like three three
weeks three weeks in one day that's
pretty amazing so that's the bosses
they've done it yeah they've come a long
way especially with their marketing you
remember the little marketing Fiasco's
they've had you know during the day
inception remember those like smashing
your phones in the past and it was a
lady in the frickin forum vote like that
yes sexist like marketing I don't know I
think that was the whole PR if you ask
go for them but it's great to see them
doing well now
Carl pacing like a like a nice guy huh
no belly no he's straight up he's all
intense from all the counts that I've
heard and he's just you know right at it
he just goes it I feel like we're at a
good place but this was far off the road
that we were originally on i like it i
like it but yanari no no no totally no
please I want you to actually take over
the conversation for a few minutes and
talk about what you have to talk about
let's support this conversation over to
your territory all right so here's my
great well we're touching on this before
we actually started the podcast so I'm
curious what you guys think um I was I
was looking at the devices on my desk
and so I've got my Apple devices with
lightning and I've got a couple of
devices with USBC and then I've got a
couple of current devices that actually
are still using micro USB and I just
want one connector for all my devices I
want I want some unify unification
across the across the lines and that
really would be USB see and I really
really don't understand why we're not
seeing that move and and I read one
article that said that Apple at some
point in the next couple of years would
be adopting us PC and then other
articles saying that's never gonna
happen
I want one connector from my mobile
devices period I mean don't we all
seriously
especially as we start getting more and
more you know devices into our lives
with like health and fitness kind of
deals those trackers maybe we have a
work phone these days that needs to be
updated and whatnot I mean I totally get
it and then there's also the fact that
USB see within itself within the same
standard people manufacturers are just
kind of using it to their own ends I
mean you had you do have the connector
there that's reversible that's great but
the pen outs are different because they
want to be they wanted to be proprietary
for their headphones or whatnot so it's
all still just a mess in even when we're
trying to converge onto one it doesn't
seem like people are kind of listening
to hey we want one choice and one choice
only because everyone seems to think
that well we have our own application it
will be better if we do it this way and
yeah you can go you can go eat your a
ham sandwich if you want so I don't know
what do you think Ryan what do you think
about our sorry state of shapes and
connectors well I was I was talking to
Dan at first too and I totally agreed
USBC is the way to go but how likely is
it you know that Apple will actually
adopt us PC on their smartphones I think
you know it's you you think about in
retrospect well Apple really drop its
arrogance you know like well they really
forego their proprietary okay are you
expecting Apple to forego their
proprietary cut like connector to adopt
you know a universally use Ryan Ryan I
do have an answer for you I have a big
in for you and the answer is yes they've
killed off fire wrought-iron any chance
that you know the the co-developed
Thunderbolt with Intel but Intel has
taken most of the lead from there and
it's all you know related to USB see now
that's the connector shape they're going
it so at least there's that and
lightnings really the last holdout they
had that 30p connector and then it
turned into lightning you know great
revolution it brought with the
reversible nature of it but like at and
there was also this one point and in the
past few months that they had talked
about this ultra accessory connector
which would be a I don't remember what
like and what connector it was but it
was four cameras like they would use a
connector that was being used by Nikon
and maybe Canon cameras like it was it's
accessible and it's available but it
they would screw up the pins so that it
would be to their own advantage so he
means yet another connector I mean it's
like my wife and I are taking a vacation
next month and I realized that before
when we're packing I need to think about
okay do I have cables for the phones and
for the tablets and for the e-book
readers and for headphones and like
enough already need a mag design for the
accessories for your devices I don't
think we're at a good place you know
what I think
at a good place because we could have
been dealing with slis and all the
things like like the old connectors for
masters and keyboards and whatnot like
those things were just all proprietary
and we had large logic boards and
motherboards just to support plugging
all the stuff into the back end of our
computer and nowadays we only have to
deal with three of those connectors like
it's not it's like we've gone down and
well of course you still want to go even
further I mean fair enough three meaning
to give me nothing so put wireless
charging and everything for me that's
what I want okay
Oh charging is gonna take forever though
oh my gosh I mean going going back to
the likelihood of Apple adopting USB see
you know I think both Dan and I you know
we wanted a lot I'm just you know we've
seen Apple in the recent years they've
come out with Apple music on Android so
that was kind of a curveball I'm just
thinking it cuz does it doesn't the
lightning ticker the lightning connector
it doesn't it take up less space and I
didn't USB type-c would and you know my
question is if they do get all yes yeah
even if they do a table USB type-c is it
is it gonna be you know Thunderbolt
cable you know like um there's a whole
bunch of stuff that they could do that
they might want to do in terms of just
being able to accessorize the darn thing
I mean ultimately they also have they're
made for iPhone and made for MFI
licensees that they have to consider as
well right even though they you know
Apple is at its own right and privilege
to just you know throw off people at a
moment's notice
yeah I'm still waiting I'm still waiting
for them to make FaceTime an open
standard for video calling so follow me
man they follow me finally today I just
want to take like maybe two minutes and
talk to y'all about how much I am kind
of enjoying the Nokia the new Nokia 6.1
Nokia six 2018
I recently just got it as a personal
kind of secondary phone not really a
burner I intend on using this if I have
any like downtime I'm reviewing Alcatel
what 3v I think right now and let's just
say that the review is going as I had
expected it if so well talk about that
another time
but yeah I'm amazed at what Nokia is
doing
obviously it's hmd global that's the
smartphone brand licensee and also
Foxconn that is making the phones and
having their hand in design a little bit
but this is quality stuff it feels
substantial they got the design down
right and you know the components are
pretty decent and what's this 250 bucks
269 on Amazon
that's to something that's that's
unbelievable that's impressive the
screen is super bright speakers kind of
a you know it's a bottom firing thing
and it's kind of okay but like this is
and this is like this is freaking if
there were a nexus program right now
this would be the phone that was that
would be on it
I feel like that's all I have to say I
mean yeah simple as that it's fast
appreciating speed ease yeah it's not
working 630 few gigs of RAM Android wine
latest updates
what type of connector charging USB see
correct
are you trying to quiz me on my own
advice but is it a is it a LCD panel
it's an LCD panel and it's but the
brightness is just insane like I'm going
to bed and I have to you know I'm trying
to read and it's just like wow I'm gonna
blind my eyes but don't turn it down so
yeah it's just I'm appreciating it and I
guess one last thing that I could ask
you guys is what phone or what gadget
you might have in your life right now
that you're appreciating for just what
did
is hmm everyone's getting on their
thinking cap for a little bit like dad
says everything has just been so
aggressively Irish lately oh my it's
your face buddy yeah I love it I would
hey I was going to say my pixel book
because it's been such a delight to use
but since I did return it and repurchase
another one I think that's a fair thing
um I don't think I would ever be saying
this but I think either my ear pods or
this battery case I got off of Amazon
for my iPhone 10 you know the iPhones
head cuz I came from my last iPhone with
seven plus coz always making effort to
have one Android phone and one I phone
and well you had the battery on the
iPhone s Hut on the iPhone 10 because
I'm usually out 8 to 10 hours a day and
it's been rather disappointing coming
from the Sun plus but this battery case
3200 milliamp hours on Amazon $30 and
doesn't better have a good profile look
like leather or like what color oh yeah
it's I believe it's well I don't know
the same material but it feels exactly
the same of what of the materia that
they use in the official Apple silicone
cases and it's an it's not bulky if I if
I can go grab it real fast if you guys
want to see it hold on yeah sure well
let's get the damn thing right there so
the teeth thing is one two things come
up for me actually
um one one is this this is because I do
love on the iPhone 10
I love finally having wireless charging
on my main work device and this is the
the my charge unplugged 10k that I'm
reviewing and I love having a huge
capacity battery that does wireless
charging also so and which is great for
throwing in my gear bag for traveling so
I love that and the other thing that I'm
really enjoying I'm reviewing the Jabra
lead 65 T true wireless headphones and
they're great I mean they're super
comfortable the connect the connection
they maintain is fabulous and the sound
is awesome
I think they get an hour more battery
life than the air pods and they have a
charging case as well and they're a
little cheaper than the air pods I think
so Deborah's really stepped up their
game even for like the 25 e uh on words
like that's been pretty good
yeah I mean they're really and super
cover I mean I review the job relief
sport and I like them a lot
the new ones are so much more
comfortable and just so much more secure
they're just they're really they're
awesome and the the 65 t is currently I
think it's 149 pretty Darrin reasonable
Ryan I know I'm going to be doing a
disservice to our listeners but show us
the case oh yeah it's um yes and see
this is about how thick the iPhone 10
would because this part fits comfortably
like a glove and thickness as you can
see it's not that big yeah the thickness
goes from like a little before the
camera bump to the bottom of it and man
that's a better profile than anything
that the freaking smart battery whatever
that they're calling that thing did
right and it's comfortable you know it's
a you can hold it on with two fingers
like this so it's a perfect grip you
know what's it it's actually thinner
than like some some phones that came out
you know in like 2011 2012 so it's
really not that bad I mean if we're if
you're still comparing things to the
2011 you know 2011 I mean that's yeah
fair fair enough yes I can say it to
that um gentlemen
