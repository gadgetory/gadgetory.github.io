pocketnow nightly n that's actually a
good idea welcome hollister goodbye
Tommy Hilfiger and I like to change
things up a bit this guy is such an
apple fanboy on that specific day when I
don't talk about app that's right it's
that time of the week I am hi Mary that
this is pocket now and this is the
parking out daily recap the last week
sunday asked you if you wanted in the su
zenfone 2 one of our favorite phones
from CES 2015 and one that should be
launched very soon in the United States
we have 350 2 comments out of which
cormac says four gigs of ram would be
nice but I'm gonna wait for your review
and yeah I'm actually gonna do the same
thing sajjad says I would prefer the one
plus one or the one plus two over the
zenfone because of the you whine I don't
think I would see much difference
between three gigs of ram and 4 gigs of
ram and that's really a very interesting
point it's very hard for us to see Ram
differences but then again that's mainly
because of how bad multitasking is on
lollipop then Abu says it's affordable
but let's be honest the only techies and
geeks like us would buy this phone I
predict the flop hope i'm wrong though
and i hope you're wrong too because this
phone is really catering to techies and
people that want the option to swap
backs and everything so this is actually
a very good business model it's just too
bad that assumes doesn't have much mind
share in the united states and i'll do
is they ask you if you think that
apple's business practices are fair as
the rumors are that the company is using
its leverage to convince music labels
away from the freemium model that we
currently see what Spotify and YouTube
we have 698 comments out of which says
that says Apple mind your own business
and yeah I agree dejean says see that's
why I hate apple and it's not common for
Apple to do this but yeah if it is true
that the company is doing so then yeah I
do agree with you the master Simon Says
says if I were the CEO of Spotify and
Tim Cook asked me to change our business
model I took an actual apple and showed
up is well you got 140 2likes for a
reason I do believe that there is
nothing wrong with this business model
users should have a benefit and warner
music just reported that it is working
so why move away from it Apple needs to
learn
on Wednesday ask you what is your wish
list for Android M as Google pretty much
teased everything for Google i/o we have
914 comments out of which a beer says I
would want multi-window support for
larger phones like the GE LG g3 or
galaxy phones but without the bloat and
my god that would be amazing but what we
would want is for those multi-window
supports to also support every single
lap so yeah it should be a google thing
and soccer lover 50 98 says Android M
seriously I just got the note for a
lollipop update it's going to take
forever the G damn note 6 is gonna come
up by the time i get that update and
that is I get the I guess your point is
that you want timely updates and I have
to agree with you Google needs to figure
that one out and vice especially fix the
RAM management both on backups to Google
Drive timely notifications yes that's
what I asked for a stock Android camera
application that uses the camera to API
from lollipop and uh yeah everything
then on thursday i ask you galaxy note 5
or galaxy note 5 edges we've got rumors
that the two phones are coming but it
seems to the galaxy note5 edge is going
to have lesser specs we have 534
comments out of which is a bull says if
they go for a one side edge with more
functionalities than yes and no I don't
agree with that one sadly that's the way
the note edges compared to the galaxy s6
edge and it's just bloat it really sucks
that pbk 418 says I thought the purpose
of the note wine was high specs so the
notify vet just kind of seems pointless
and I do agree with you there is really
no point for it to lose it on specs
unless Samsung wants to keep the same
price tag let's see how that goes and
pro model builder says I have accessed 6
edge currently but I have to choose
between the note 5 or the edge variant I
would go for the one with the higher
specs and well it all depends I do
believe that Samson didn't make much use
of the edge on the galaxy s6 edge only
to make it cool so yeah if it's just
going to be cool then I would go for the
higher specs as well and finally on
friday i asked you even if you weren't
shopping if you had to pick a phablet
today which one would it be as the news
are that tablets own twenty-two percent
of the US market so far
they're selling like hotcakes thanks to
the iphone 6 plus sadly but we have 11
hundred and thirty-nine comments thanks
a lot guys out of which anthony says I
may be the minority here but I would
really love my lumia 1520 it's a great
phone but still respectable specs I
can't wait for to see a successor to it
by Microsoft and you're right you're a
minority dude and John says my two-year
contract ends on May 26 yay for you I am
definitely getting the galaxy note 4 I
can't wait three more weeks and I think
you will be very satisfied with that
phone I don't feel that there are any
gimmicks even though this is not running
the latest version of Samsung's TouchWiz
which has less float but the camera do
it is just worth it and thorne a Montana
says for those of you who wear slim and
skinny jeans where do you carry your
fallot back pocket kind of want to buy
one but I don't want a huge bulge in my
pants and what you do Tony Montana is
you what are your skinny jeans and you
tell everybody say hello to my little
friend if you didn't get that joke you
missed a really good movie that's it for
