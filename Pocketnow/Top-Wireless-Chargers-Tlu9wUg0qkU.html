sponsored by AT&amp;amp;T wireless charging is
not a new feature it's been around for
quite a while now but only recently in
the last two to three years has it
become a more common feature in flagship
phones one that we hope to see in all
phones in the future it's just a
convenient way to go about charging your
phone and while we wait on a certain
fruit company to release their wireless
charger we figured we'd round up some of
our favorites I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and here are four of the best
wireless chargers around right now so
first off let's talk about this
AT&amp;amp;T fast charge wireless charging pad
this thing is built like a tank
this bottom construction is all-metal I
imagine and anodized aluminum and then
one of my favorite things is you've got
this nice grippy texture on the top
which keeps your phone from sliding
around there are plenty of wireless
chargers that do not have this
rubberized top it you you would have to
physically push hard to get this to come
off this pad whereas some other ones
they're not rubberized and they will
slip off I've had phones that slip off
my nightstand at night when you're using
a charging pad that don't have a
rubberized top this wireless charger
also delivers 10 watts of wireless
charging power and that's pretty fast
for a wireless charger that means you
can charge your phone in about 3 and a
half hours from completely dead which is
really good that's not amazing speeds
especially when you compare it to a
hardwired charger but for wireless
charging that is not bad at all
so this charger also has a built-in LED
indicator around the ring and you can
see the light ring turns blue and it
will pulse while you're charging and
when your phone is fully charged it will
turn red to let you know that it's done
charging the other thing is this one has
a six to eight millimeter charge
distance so I'm hovering this up over
the charger it's not touching it's uh I
don't know how far away but it's far
enough away that there would definitely
be room for a case in there next up we
have the ravpower fast wireless charger
this is much smaller much more
lightweight the bottom is aluminum but
it's very very thin compared to the AT&amp;amp;T
charger in the top is this soft touch
plastic it's not really rubberized you
do have rubber feet on the bottom so the
charger itself
move but if you put a slick phone on
this I was having trouble with this
yesterday the phone was just sliding off
so sitting on my desk
maybe my desk isn't perfectly level and
the phone was just gently sliding off
this thing and and I'd set it down then
30 minutes later I'd come to my desk in
my phone would be off the side so that
is a problem unless you are using a case
that gives it a little more grip enos
and it's not gonna slide off then so
again this one is thinner and smaller
than the AT&amp;amp;T charger it's also cheaper
this one's about 25 dollars worth the
AT&amp;amp;T charger is about 50 so you do get
that benefit there saving some money on
a wireless charger you can see here at
the bottom this one also puts out 10
watts max power so if you have a
compatible fast wireless charging phone
you can fast charge with this charger as
well and yeah I think it's a quality
option for the price and the one problem
is just that slick top next up is
something a little bit different this is
the skosh magic melt Pro charge home
slash office charger and this one is
super grippy so this one that works a
lot like those suction cup chargers for
your car press this down clamp that and
this sucker I can probably pick up the
desk both lists but this it is on there
really really well and this one you
really have to pull on this to get it
off the table once it's really secured
so that suction is a ridiculously strong
especially for a charger like this one
thing you do have to be concerned with
with this one is a flat surface
something that's relatively smooth my
other desk is not a smooth top and this
thing just fell right over but with this
one you can actually feed a cord through
the bottom of it plug it in let's just
plugged in you've got an LED indicator
on the top there and once it's there you
can just snap your phone to it and
you're charging pretty simple you can
turn it horizontal if you want however
as you might have already guessed it's
magnetic which means that you've got
this here you have to put something on
the back earphone or on
back up your case so if you carry your
phone in the case they provide these
strips that you can attach it also tells
you based on which phone you have if you
have one of these popular models iPhone
8 Galaxy sa iPhone 10 eight plus a
Galaxy S 8 plus or no date it tells you
where to line them up with the bottom of
the phone and where they'll go on the
back of the phone and then the case will
also work with this mount a fourth and
final charger is from Samsung this is
the Samsung fast charge wireless charger
stand and while it looks like your
standard chuck this one has a little bit
of a hidden secret and slide it back
until it's up just really really neat
and around here on the back you see all
this venting there is a built-in fan to
keep this one cool this one does charge
up to nine one so there are some that
are up to ten this one's only up to nine
the charges with the USB see you plug
the USB C cable into the back and it is
geared heavily towards Samsung's own
phones it will work with others but you
can charge just like you normally would
with any old pad in either direction you
can slide this back tilt it up it's also
very agnostic to where you place your
phone you can place it vertically there
or donnelly down here it's still gonna
charge let's take a second to register
but it should also work with other
phones as well it doesn't have to be a
samsung phone and of course you may have
noticed that there is a little LED
indicator so when you place your phone
on the charger it turns blue to let you
know that it is charging so when it
comes down to price on these chargers
you can expect to pay $50 for either of
these two options the AT&amp;amp;T fast charger
or samsung slash charger both of those
are about 50 bucks and get this rad
power for about $25 a half the price of
these two and this will falls around the
middle this one is between 29 and 39
dollars depending on where you buy it
