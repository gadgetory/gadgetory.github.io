bring monster specifications other
reports also claim that Apple is already
working on revamping its iPhone naming
scheme and a ton of hot smartphones
finally get marshmallow on a few
carriers I'm hanging metal iveta and
yeah coffee is how i roll and i'm sure
that's most of your cases too especially
on friday this is parking out daily you
know they hate for US carriers is kind
of normal and especially when you have
to wait a ton of time for your software
updates such as the case with AT&amp;amp;T those
of you that are rocking an AT&amp;amp;T LG v10
like me you can finally get marshmallow
in addition if you're on sprint if you
got a galaxy note edge from two years
ago pretty much you can also get
marshmallow as well and we also hear
about the galaxy s5 active in addition
to others you can learn more in the
elections description and for those of
you that are wondering where market
share stands when it comes to
smartphones believe it or not Apple is
currently king of activations forty
percent compared to Samsung's 37 sure
one company apparently ships more units
than the other but one reports how many
they shipped to a store the other
actually reports how many they sold so
these numbers are rather hard to come by
but hey activations do matter and it
seems that iphones are wanting the rest
of the OEMs are just trailing behind and
you know that market share is even more
interesting when it comes to the iphone
SE we do not have final figures yet and
sadly we'll never get them from Apple
but then when it comes to Asia analysts
are already predicting that the iPhone
se is making a significant dent in both
Huawei and she amis a market share again
no final numbers we should learn more
over the next few weeks but believe it
or not that four-inch iPhone it's not
really that bad and yeah we're actually
going to talk a little more about iPhone
because we haven't really done so over
the last few days it seems that there is
a change in naming scheme coming to the
iphone apparently well we will be
getting the iphone 7 this year but next
year it might be the iphone 8 it makes a
lot of sense we've been hearing so many
changes for this on iphone em all that
display in addition to probably other
materials like glass on glass so it
could just be that Apple plans to change
everything and it also makes sense
mainly because well smartphone market
share is down we've been talking about
this for weeks
so these companies really need to come
up with something I don't know smart and
fast we'll see and finally the very hot
news today have to do with the samsung
galaxy note 6 we have been covering a
few specifications this time we hear
more 5.8 inch display which is what we
heard a few days ago but to even more
interesting as a 4000 milliamp hour
battery and this makes a lot of sense
mainly because well the galaxy s7 edge
currently has a 3600 milliamp hour
battery we do need more battery on the
note lineup it has been famous for that
for years and then the galaxy note 5
just did not deliver that but hey it
leads me to the question of the day
would it be important for you for the
galaxy note 6 to get a large battery or
a replaceable battery in my case if I
had to choose honestly I would rather
prefer a replaceable battery if they
figured that out somehow but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
