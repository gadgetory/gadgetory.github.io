any optimized content for Android
tablets but is that the whole truth has
anything really changed in the last two
years I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and these are some beautiful
Android tablet applications when Android
OMS entered the tablet space it didn't
take long for the media and consumers to
start ripping the platform for its lack
of tablet optimized content it was to be
expected very few new platforms ever
have an excessive amount of content from
day one the arguments were coolly
brushed off on the hopes that the tablet
optimized content would eventually find
its way to the then rapidly growing
mobile platform but that was over two
and a half years ago and people are
still saying the same thing don't get an
Android tablet because there aren't any
great tablet apps or games on Android it
constantly comes up in conversation
especially when comparing any high-end
Android tablet with the infamous iPad
brand granted Android tablets still
don't have nearly as many high quality
apps or games as the iPad but there are
some seriously gorgeous apps for tablets
in the Play Store Google has paved the
path for better app design especially in
the tablet realm and it's beginning to
show for the longest time Android like
one almost necessary application a
beautiful and vult performing google
reader client then Along Came Press it's
simple and it gets the job done
seamlessly syncing your Google account
and pulling all the subscriptions from
Google Reader account its interface is
not unlike any other typical google
reader client but the flat gray
interface with red of dark grey accents
make it easily the most gorgeous google
reader client available on android it's
sort of like reader for iOS best of all
the navigation and press is extremely
intuitive its gesture based fling to the
right to go back a page and fling to the
left to go forward on top of all this
press vows to stick around after the
Google Reader service is killed in June
another gorgeous application for keeping
up with your RSS feeds is feedly the
interface while quite different from
press is flat and clean but press seems
to utilize the extra display real-estate
more efficiently feedly on the other
hand is a great free alternative
Google's owned reader replacement app
currents is also an incredible-looking
application unlike feedly and press it
displays content anymore digital
magazine esque style once you choose a
section you want to read scrolling left
and right changes the channel so to
speak and scrolling up and down reveals
to new content and said channels with
expansive photos and a very clean
interface Curren is definitely one of
the most visually pleasing ways to catch
up on your news and other feeds
not all the beautiful Android apps are
RSS or feed readers though some are also
great for all sorts of multimedia if
you're into podcasts and you have yet to
download pocket casts you're doing
yourself a disservice not only as pocket
casts the best looking Android podcast
app it's one of the best looking Android
apps period the discover tab allows you
to find new and popular podcasts to
listen to don't forget to subscribe here
of course to our YouTube channel for the
PocketNow weekly podcast in Pocket cats
there are two different views for your
content that you've subscribed to a
library or feed view in terms of design
and UI pocket casts is exactly the type
of application Android needs more of an
application that I have personally been
using for years now is called pocket
prior to the rebranding from read it
later the application wasn't much to
look at but it was one of the
frontrunners to implement a beautiful
tablet UI for Android using the holo
theme ensure pocket is no different from
every other save it later style
application save a link from your
computer or mobile and the link is added
to a feed of other saved links and
downloaded for offline reading later the
interface is simple it's either tiled or
a list and it can be filtered by type
tags or status either unread archived or
favorited and the reading view is
extremely clean exactly what you want
from an app that's meant to cut out all
distractions best of all it's entirely
free spring pad has been around for
quite a while it's sort of like a pocket
for everyday things a direct Evernote
competitor or a personal Pinterest you
can save links images videos places and
all other sorts of content to your
account and these things are meant to be
organized and user-defined notebooks the
interface is simple to navigate it's
extremely easy to start a new note or a
notebook and it looks great on larger
displays the best use we found for
spring pad is to create a shopping list
for all those expensive gadgets you
can't afford
for a long time Twitter clients on
Android were mediocre at best the
interfaces were cartoonish they weren't
optimized for tablets and they often
lacked important functions there are
several great Android Twitter clients
these days but Falcon is regarded as one
of the best looking to date it was also
recently updated to support larger
displays the interface and UX are almost
identical to the smaller smartphone
interface but it's a to paint layout for
better use of the extra display space
the Left column is a feed view for
either timeline mentions or messages and
the wider right column is the expanded
view of individual tweets you may click
on conversation lists and content
previews for links pictures videos etc
no nonsense straight to the point and
beautiful one of the larger issues with
the lack of beautiful content on the
Android tablet front was the fact that
Google itself felt to update and
optimize its own apps for tablets but
these days things are quite different
almost every Google application has been
updated for large and high res displays
the Play Movies application for example
is one of the best-looking apps on
Android Google+ is also among the more
gorgeous applications out there and
Gmail on a 10-inch Android tablet is
actually the best Gmail experience I
personally have come across nothing
beats the satisfaction of physically
dragging and dropping a batch of emails
into a label even the updated Play Store
is nice to look at and it serves as a
testament to Google's dedication to
bringing higher quality content to
Android tablets once and for all and
that's only the beginning there are
applications that are already out there
ones that are being updated and some
that are about to be released that are
beautiful for Android tablets that are
underrated so if we missed one be sure
