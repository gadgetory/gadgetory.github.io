by the same company go toe-to-toe I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the Droid ultra versus the
Moto X since being acquired by Google
last May Motorola Mobility has been
mostly coasting sure it's released the
HD updates to the Droid Razr line only
for the hubub to die weeks later in July
however Motorola announced three new
phones for Verizon the Droid ultra wide
max Android Mini and at the beginning of
this month the Moto X was unveiled in
our laps we currently have the Moto X
and the Droid ultra and we put them
head-to-head which one comes out on top
let's find out the biggest difference
between all of Motorola's latest
smartphones oddly enough is appearance
and design the Droid mini as the name
alludes is the smallest of the quartet
the Droid ultra and the Droid Maxx with
5-inch displays are the largest and the
4.7 inch Moto X rests perfectly in the
middle and on the outside the Moto X has
very little in common with its next of
kin the Droid ultra is squared and
industrial the glossy plastic bag makes
it feel more like a samsung galaxy
handset than something we've come to
expect from Motorola and it's button
controls along the side protrude with a
harsh grooved aluminum that's impossible
to miss the power and volume rocker on
the Moto X are a smooth finish and
barely there yet they're very firm and
tactile that takes your buttons on the
ultra or mushy yet grippy tiny
differences like this extend throughout
the hardware the headphone jacks are on
the top edge but the ultras is to the
right and the Moto X's is in the middle
of a nice rounded bevel that blends into
the back edge the backside of the ultra
is flat and sort of bubbles on top to
accommodate for the camera which sits in
the middle of a speaker grille and the
LED flash sits to the left instead of
beneath like on the Moto X and of course
the Moto X is rounded on the Mac and
slips right into the palm of your hand
the Motorola emblem on the Moto X is
integrated inside a dimple that your
index finger naturally slips into for
additional grip the ultra zim logo is
again a brushed aluminum that clashes
with its glossy surroundings and the
navigation buttons on the Moto X are on
screen the ultra and it's droid brethren
feature capacitive navigation buttons o
unless we forget the Droid ultra has a
neat trick of a
if you look around the edges you will
not find a slot for the nano-sim the
Moto X is is quite obviously located on
the left edge but the ultra SIM tray is
hidden within the volume rocker use your
fingernail to snag the notch and gently
pull outwards clever indeed and their
dimensions differ as well the Moto X
measure is one hundred and twenty nine
point three millimeters tall sixty five
point three millimeters wide ten point
four millimeters thick and it hits the
scales at a fair a hundred and thirty
grams it's eight point two millimeters
shorter five point nine millimeters
narrower three point two millimeters
thicker and seven grams lighter than its
larger compatriot their outsides are
clearly quite different the ultra is
definitely more reminiscent of an older
Motorola while the Moto X is fresh and
symbolic of starting anew internally
however these two smartphones are nearly
indistinguishable they both come with 10
megapixel clear pixel cameras the x8
mobile computing system which consists
of a 1.7 gigahertz dual-core Krait CPU
quad-core Adreno 320 GPU a low-power CPU
dedicated to contextual computing and a
final low-power core dedicated to
natural language processing they both
have two gigabytes of RAM 720p Super
AMOLED displays Wi-Fi b/g/n AC NFC LTE
Bluetooth 4.0 etc the main differences
in specifications are that the Moto X
comes in either 16 or 32 gigabyte models
while the ultra is confined to only 16
gigabytes the Moto X has a 22 hundred
million power battery to the ultras 2130
million powers if you want more capacity
or a larger battery in your Verizon
troy'd you will need to opt for the
virtually identical Droid Maxx and
clearly the display sizes are different
while we're on the topic of displays
both the Droid ultra and Moto X use 720p
Super AMOLED displays at 4.7 diagonal
inches the Moto X has a slight advantage
in pixel density 312 pixels per inch to
294 pixels per inch on the ultras 5-inch
display as you would expect they're neck
and neck on brightness contrast black
levels viewing angle saturation etc
really the only difference between them
is their size and likewise density but
only marginally so there's also the hot
topic of on-screen buttons taking up
precious pixels and real estate it's
purely a preference thing we like on
screen buttons but we don't knock the
altar for having capacitive buttons
either in the end we give the edge in
hardware to the motox the glossy
fingerprint magnet backside of the droid
ultra is slightly disappointing despite
the fact that we preferred the extra
size of the Droid ultra the Moto X
caters to the shape of our hands more
nicely and although the ability to
customize the colors is limited for AT&amp;amp;T
right now the ability to do so is
certainly worth noting honestly we'd
love nothing more than to have the Moto
X in the size of the Droid ultra you
would think coming from Motorola and
both being touted as flagship esque
devices that the only major difference
between the Moto X Android ultra would
be included blue air right that
assumption isn't entirely wrong but
strangely enough both have unique
Motorola features they share some the
Droid ultra has some too itself and the
Moto X has some of its own it's just odd
and the only logical reason for that is
Verizon having its hand in the software
cookie jar both run Android 4.2.2 and
both have touchless control assist
migrate motorola connect and active
notifications the Droid ultra comes with
droid zap the ability to share photos
from within the Photos app for the
two-finger swipe up and some of
Motorola's order touches like the Droid
command center widget and the Moto X has
skipped the NFC unlock feature which no
longer says it's compatible with the
ultra and Google Play and trusted
devices aside from those inconsistencies
there's nothing between the software on
these two they're both very nearly stock
Android experiences and the Moto X fills
just a tiny bit more vanilla than the
Droid ultra with the same unique chipset
under their hoods performance is exactly
what you would expect from the two any
differences are indistinguishable
they're both buttery smooth and average
performance switching between apps
opening and closing apps etc
multitasking and intensive gaming are
great on both devices as well naturally
their performance and benchmarks is also
similar one of the more significant
differences we've come across with these
two devices is speaker quality the rear
loud speaker will know Ultra is
significantly and noticeably louder and
more crisp than the speaker on the Moto
X it's also much more difficult to cover
up we've been using the Moto X on AT&amp;amp;T
LTE network in the Charlotte metro area
and the Droid ultra is obviously a
Verizon only device data speeds and
network performance is dependent upon
many different factors but we will note
that we've averaged higher speeds with
the Moto X
on ATT thus far and battery life we
haven't had the ultra long enough to
fully test its battery efficiency so far
the two seem to be discharging at
approximately the same rate taking into
consideration that we've put the Droid
ultra through quite a bit more abuse
today as far as capacity goes the Moto X
has a slight advantage with a 2200
milliamp hour battery to the ultras 2130
million power battery for more on
battery life and network performance
keep an eye out for the full review
finally camera quality both feature the
same camera sensors 10 megapixel clear
pixel sensors that utilize an additional
clear pixel in the sub pixel arrangement
on the sensor to take in more light the
easy way to put it is its no optical
image stabilization low-light pictures
are very muddy and like lots of detail
and even in bright conditions there
seems to be some higher-level
compression at play edges are soft and
there just isn't the same level of
detail we've seen from other smartphone
cameras 8 or 13 megapixels comparatively
neither camera is amazing and truthfully
they're on par with one another but it's
worth noting that the droid ultra
perform better in most situations the
Moto X had trouble with colour
reproduction the ultra produced fairly
accurate shots while the Moto X took
images that sometimes looked milky
underexposed or over this is a perfect
testament to how important camera
software optimization truly is at the
end of the day there is no clear winner
there's hardly anything between them at
all we're one fall short the other
shines so we ask you which of these two
devices would you declare the winner
it's a tough decision for sure we like
the size of the Droid ultra better but
the build and design of the Moto X the
software on the Moto X is more useful
and practical but the ultras camera and
loudspeaker are better if we had to pick
a winner we'd give it to the Moto X but
only by the skin of its teeth and for
good reason availability and finish the
Moto X will launch on all four major US
carriers as well as US Cellular the
Droid ultra is destined to remain on
Verizon shelves forever and come
