new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it
let's take another look at the product
that tried to change the face of Windows
tablets I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow this is Microsoft Surface RT
and this is episode 22 of after the buzz
the surface RT was expected by some to
usher in a new era of Windows tablets
with its sleek and sturdy design useful
kickstand and innovative keyboard covers
it definitely made a splash when it
landed back in October but that splash
was short-lived just a week ago
Microsoft reported it took an almost 1
billion dollar adjustment entirely due
to unsold surface inventory inventory
it's now trying to unload at 349 a pop
that's a hundred and fifty dollar
discount over the devices original price
so should you consider snapping up a
marked down surface RT this
back-to-school season
let's find out it's important to
remember that the surface RT isn't just
Microsoft's first self-made tablet it's
the company's first self-made computer
period so it was genuinely surprising to
see such a well-built piece of hardware
emerge from the company's collaboration
with Pegatron and that hardware still
holds up in today's landscape now the
surface is big and at one-and-a-half
pounds it's also quite heavy but in
exchange you get a tablet that feels
more solid than almost any other device
out there with the magnesium casing that
holds up pretty well to abuse a full
size USB and video out ports a micro SD
card slot and an integrated kickstand
that's better than any
built-in component we've ever used
precisely because of that useful
kickstand combined with the surface
Artie's excessive width you find
yourself wanting to use it as a notebook
more often than a tablet and if you're
willing to throw another Benjamin at the
problem you can do that with either a
touch cover or a type cover smart and
sleek accessories that significantly
enhance the usefulness of this tablet
but at the cost of almost completely
eliminating the savings you'll get from
Microsoft's recent discount getting the
surface RT further away from your eyes
will also keep your mind off the fact
that the display while bright and
colorful isn't all that crisp at 147 PPI
but fortunately the screen is big enough
to make using it at a distance fairly
comfortable just make sure you keep it
on the table though as trying to use
this thing as a true laptop is basically
guaranteed to end in tears in all though
the surface Artie's hardware is an
unexpected success story even after ten
months it still stands out as a sharply
designed futuristic looking device and
it's tough build can definitely take an
impact or two without shattering the
things aren't so rosy on the software
front our most recent experience with
Windows 8 on the surface as rival the HP
Envy x2 saw the computer shut down in
the middle of recording a podcast
because it just had to install system
updates right then and there
and this was the full version of Windows
8 the real Windows if you will the
surface Arty's software build the aptly
named windows RT has taken a lot more
flak than the full version but that's a
whole big kerfuffle we won't get into
here suffice to say the windows 8
experience is at best inconsistent and
that definitely holds true on the
surface RT and by inconsistent we don't
mean it's all bad there's some really
good stuff here if you take the time to
customize the Start screen which you
should do because the legacy desktop
environment and windows RT is not where
you want to spend your time you'll want
to stay in the modern environment not
just because it's so much more touch
friendly but because the applications
can be truly beautiful if they're built
right just look at apps like Bing travel
which is stunning and it's gorgeous user
friendly simplicity or the news app with
its sprawling cover images and magazine
like layout even the ho-hum stuff like
the pictures gallery and the calendar
are done right
polished and responsive Microsoft
OneNote is a truly impressive
note-taking app that you might actually
prefer to cross-platform titles like
Evernote and if you need Microsoft's
word processing spreadsheet and
presentation software you've got it
l biet within the older desktop mode
office home in student 2013 is
pre-installed with a promise of future
free updates when more features become
available for Windows RT but there's a
flipside to inconsistent and it's app
availability remember how we said you'll
want to stay in the modern UI
environment as often as possible well
it's harder when the apps just aren't
there to support that Microsoft has done
a good job enticing some developers to
build apps for Windows but the big names
are few and far between and the surfaces
performance just isn't fast enough to
make using them a good experience you're
often stuck waiting quite a while for
titles to load and even some programs
built to obviate the need for
third-party apps don't work right the
People Hub for example is beautifully
laid out but it takes forever to fetch
new notifications and events the same
with the messaging tile in fact most
actions on the surface RT keep you
waiting this is a pretty slow device
regardless of what the spec sheet says
and if you're about to say the browser
makes up for the app shortcomings you're
right in theory but not in practice
Internet Explorer 10 is wonderfully
touch optimized and quite simple to use
once you get the hang of Windows 8 swipe
in UI but it's also unpredictable big
pages sometimes stall when loading and
others won't load at all stutters and
jumps are common YouTube is hit-and-miss
streaming live audio requires you to
stay in the browser and is interrupted
if the display times out as it does
after one minute with default settings
and if you're wondering how to change
that timeout it's not in the quick
settings or anywhere in the own
most useless modern UI settings panel to
change the display timeout you need to
execute a six step process starting at
the Windows desktop as if the surface
were some kind of notebook from 10 years
ago see it's these little seemingly
unimportant things that Microsoft gets
wrong with the surface RT and modern
Windows in general and you'll have to
learn to either get around them get used
to them or just put up with it if you
buy one oh and thanks to Microsoft's
current spat with Google you can forget
about tight integration between the
surface and your software ecosystem if
you're a heavy gmail user thankfully
there's a web portal to Google's content
but obviously it's not ideal amid all
the shortcomings there's still a lot of
stuff the surface RT gets right that
full-size USB port means you can not
only transfer data using a USB dongle
but charge your phone as well then
thanks to the surfaces big battery it'll
probably still last all day
even if you're a heavy user if you're a
subscriber to Microsoft's live ecosystem
your email calendar and SkyDrive data
will sync very nicely to the surface and
you'll wonder why every tablet doesn't
come with a kickstand as useful as this
one but there's a reason Microsoft is
out nearly a billion dollars thanks to
this device
it's a boatload of compromise that was
initially priced way too high it's still
overpriced if you ask us the touch cover
or type cover is an integral part of the
Surface RT experience and buying one at
full retail basically wipes out the cost
savings if you're ok with the compromise
though the Surface RT does do quite a
few things well in exchange for all the
things that gets wrong and it brings a
few features to the table mainly on the
hardware side that you need to pay extra
for with other tablets that's why it's
being featured in an episode of after
the buzz and not pocket now is worst
gadgets ever seriously because if you're
a road warrior with a particular set of
windows centric needs the surface RT
serves them well enough if you're one of
the cash-strapped students Microsoft is
targeting with its back-to-school
advertising push the surface RT might
not be the first tablet we'd recommend
but after its discount it's at least
worth a look
that's gonna do it for this episode of
after the buzz folks if you're

other tablets smartphones and mobile
