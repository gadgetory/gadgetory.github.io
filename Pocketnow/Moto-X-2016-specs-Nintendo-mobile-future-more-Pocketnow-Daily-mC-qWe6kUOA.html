next generation Moto X by Lenovo until
no confirms that more games are coming
soon to mobile and we finally get
details on the launch times for the sony
xperia x I'm hi I'm Adam iveta and those
of you that want the pocket no daily
recap to return raise your hands I've
seen a ton of comments this is parking
out daily the official news today begin
with Sony at first we were kind of
confused with the xperia expedient nova
was the company's new flagship than we
learned that it was and now we're
waiting to actually get the phone amazon
UK has just begun pre-orders for sony
and it seems that they are coming from
sony and we might expect the phone to
launch on May twentieth so far the phone
is nice it's just the well we can't wait
to give it a try another company that
continues confusing as when it comes to
its mobile intense is Microsoft so far
the company explained that it's quarter
results that mobile wasn't really its
priority but now Terry Myerson comes on
record it says hey Mobile is important
Mobile is not going anywhere we should
expect more from Microsoft when it comes
to this division but we wonder if it
will be windows 10 mobile or the Lumia
brand as we also hear some separate
rumors of a service phone emerging on
April 2017 but we've been covering those
rumors of the surface phone since my son
was recently bought and how many of you
are mito mole users from Nintendo the
company is claiming that there are 10
million users out there I've seen some
people playing with it I just I don't
think I want to even give it a try
unless you guys convince me in the
comments down below but the company just
claimed that in addition to its 10
million users access if you call it that
way we should expect two more games to
come very soon let's hope that better
and even though the Samsung gear fit
wasn't really something to go crazy
about it's still rotting in my drawer of
the company is apparently working on a
gear for two in addition to some icon X
earbuds we get some leaked photos of
these products in the case of the gear
fit to it looks pretty much like the
gear fit just with a new arm band up and
hopefully this one will bring much
better functionality as yeah the gear s2
kind of nailed it right when it came
fitness it just needed more modes and
finally the hot news that they have to
do with the next generation Moto X from
Lenovo as we finally see some benchmarks
we see some results but we don't really
see many details on specifications just
that it has four gigs of ram and
Snapdragon processor but that Snapdragon
processor is not really detailed and
hopefully Motorola continues its trend
of bringing high-end specifications to
the Moto X and not just focusing on the
experience because we people in Android
actually care about that but it leads me
to the question of today what would you
like to see Motorola launched with this
new Moto X for you to be interested
because I will admit I hope they keep
their design language I hope they keep
moto maker I hope they bring good
specifications the only thing I'd really
want on that moto x is a fingerprint
scanner in addition to the return to mo
LED but that's my opinion leave us a
comment down below with yours friends
you know the way it goes if we want to
get these news earlier before the video
