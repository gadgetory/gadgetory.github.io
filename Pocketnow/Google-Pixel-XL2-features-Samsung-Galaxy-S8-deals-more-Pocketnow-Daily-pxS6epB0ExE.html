expect for the Google pixel - when it
comes to features the HTC u 11 joins the
crowd of providing another digital
assistant option and the plan with that
whole meizu dual display phone seems to
be about selfies I'm Hilah Rivera and as
it is custom let us prepare for Friday
as early as possible this is pocket out
daily the official loose today begin
with deals those of you in the market
for the galaxy s 8 or galaxy s 8 plus
this is probably the best plan to buy
there is a $150 discount from Groupon
and the link in the description you know
what I actually suggest you read the
whole article because there are more
deals even from Best Buy where you get
$20 back I believe again everything is
in the description now remember those
recent leaks of amazes seven Pro that
device that has a dual display this is
actually a co2 display at the back for
those of you wondering what the purpose
is apparently there's this video
suffering on the web right now that is
showing us that one of the major things
you can do with this phone is actually
take a selfie because that dual display
will actually show you what the camera
is portraying and probably you guys
don't remember but many years ago
smartphones included this like very
weird sort of like camera mirror
backwards selfie cameras weren't really
a thing yeah parent Lee that's going to
be one of the user scenarios we can't
wait to see what else and let's move the
spotlight over to HTC as the u11 just
got an update to edgesense and guess
what one of the major updates is the
inclusion of being able to toggle Amazon
Alexa from this I haven't really tried
it on my you 11 so I can't really tell
you number one of its good number two
you can actually summon Alexa from
everything other than just a squeeze to
the phone but yeah
Amazon Alexa is now a major deal on not
just the you 11 so let's see how that
makes this any better than the Google
assistance and if you haven't tested iOS
11 beta I actually suggest that you do
now it's currently in public beta 2 for
iPad and iPhone and one of the major
advantages is the bug fixes in the fact
that a lot of the things actually work a
lot better now than they did before I'm
currently still using the developer beta
and as it stands it
really works well when it comes to Apple
applications absolutely everything else
third party actually you depend on them
for example whatsapp is kind of trashy
right now and it's actually not behaving
well in conjunction with the Apple watch
but yeah beta-2 is a tea to learn more
about what changes in the description
and finally the very interesting news
today have to do with the Google pixel 2
we follow the renders that we saw
yesterday we discussed them on the news
so those of you that are wondering what
is this phone bringing to the table
there are some benchmarks to show as a
few things number one Snapdragon 835
number two the fact that the squeeze UI
is actually coming apparently and even
more interesting that this phone is
apparently not going to be made by HTC
these benchmarks confirm that it's made
by LG this is interesting and obviously
the other part is that we get a taller
AMOLED display that's six inches
diagonal all this is cool and all but
you know it leads me to the question
today is any of this something that you
want to see on the next Google pixel in
my face sadly I wish it had dual cameras
I don't see that I wish that it brought
something in this realm but leave us a
comment down below we got to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
if you want to get the news earlier
before the video was filmed what was up
I'm going to come and hit that subscribe
button down below for more videos like
this one and also follow me on Twitter
Jaime underscore David are on Instagram
at high many that please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am hiding that even I think so much for
watching we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
