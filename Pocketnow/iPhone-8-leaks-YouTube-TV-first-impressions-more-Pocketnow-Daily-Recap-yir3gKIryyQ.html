pronounce his name no only me my mother
too but why do you wear two watches I
know I must look like a douche I do it
because I prefer this one for sleep
tracking when you got an important test
tomorrow
it's 1 a.m. and you can't sleep because
you're reconsidering your existence you
go to hymen and then you find me posting
bar picks and drinks I'm such a bad
influence that's right it's that time of
the week I am hi Matt leave it at this
is PocketNow and this is the PocketNow
daily recap for last week so when Monday
the topic was Apple and the company
wanting to build more hardware
apparently wants to build its own GPUs
in the future it wants to get out of
imagination technologies in their
contract and I asked you do you think
that Apple wants to do this to try to
compete with portable game consoles like
in the case of switch we have 453
comments lol they may want to complete
but I'm really impressed with the switch
I don't see a comparison in the near
future oh my god I am so in love with
the switch I can not even begin to
express how much I agree with your
comment dude if Apple does it that
mobile gaming will finally take off well
bear in mind mobile gaming has happened
for years already pretty much almost
well less than a decade and it's always
been the reason why it's been mad for me
is because it's not really about the
experience or the graphics it's the
controls if you don't have controls at
least for people like me that are
Generation X the experience is just not
the same I think Apple is improving
graphics so that their next iPhone will
support a RvR in theory I believe that
their current hardware is already
capable of doing AR and VR to a certain
degree I do know that Apple is working
on that whole AR project and I hope it's
augmented reality and not VR because I
don't think VR is taking off anytime
soon at least with what I've seen so far
that on Tuesday the topic was the
Samsung Galaxy s8 and it's special
edition back then it was still just
being rumoured that there was a 60
goodbye variant and if you would be
willing to pay a thousand dollars for it
eventually Samsung announced it 619
comments for $1000 it better matched the
performance of the 3t and have a better
camera than the pixel and regular
software updates that is precisely my
point why would you pay so much money
when you could buy two one plus three
T's and you can even include a
SmartWatch in that bundle sure you don't
get the camera experience on the three T
but oh my god meanwhile the next one
plus device will come with eight
gigabytes of RAM
like seriously oneplus has been making
everybody look bad for the last couple
of years particularly this last
generation so yeah that's gonna be a
problem
I won't be paying extra for more RAM er
I doubt I'll see a difference in
performance they will still lag and heat
up like every other galaxy I mean that
is so true if Samsung is launching their
flagship with 4 gigabytes of RAM I would
assume that the company has tested
everything up to the point where it's
like you know what 4 gigabytes of RAM is
enough so why pay more for 6 seriously
then on Wednesday the topic was YouTube
TV I went crazy when I saw the
announcement I actually stopped the
recording of the daily and I started
over just the test YouTube TV and then
talk about it and I asked you what do
you think about the service we had 612
comments why is YouTube TV more
expensive than Netflix I'm responding to
this one because actually a lot of
people ask the same question in the
comments this is nothing to be compared
to Netflix I'm not saying that Netflix
is inferior total contraire I love
Netflix but if you want to watch TV and
you don't want to pay so much money for
cable in the United States this is an
insane alternative YouTube TV is
probably never coming to my country it's
probably gonna take a long time but I do
see this happening everywhere in the
future so long as companies are willing
to cooperate it really depends on that
mostly and I think that it's the
smartest way to go the more YouTube can
scale the less expensive the contract is
going to be or the more enticing it'll
be for TV operators so I don't see this
being a bad thing in the future or
something that's impossible actually $35
seems very good cable providers are dead
yeh at least in the United States I mean
and unload us for example I pay I think
$20 for cable then you come to the
United States and you pay $100 it's
insane so I do feel that unless cable
operators are smart about this it is the
future then on Thursday the topic was
the next generation iPhone we hear that
Apple is having yield issues
that apparently the company might find
some delays and being able to build the
next iPhone and I asked you with every
competitor that's come out this year do
you think that this will hinder the
iPhone xri phone eight
we had 621 comments ample saw the s8 and
delayed the iPhone eight so current
discern insider information that's
apparently not the case companies have
been working in the concept of
stretching bezels for a while it's just
the fact that LG was able to figure it
out first Samsung is next and Apple
always follow ship Apple is never first
and we know this I don't believe the
10th anniversary iPhone is gonna be
anything innovative every single year we
see the same kinds of rumors that we're
seeing now and they were never true oh
my god yes and no you are so right but
then again the thing about it is for
example the current design that we see
in the iPhone 6 6s and then the 7
actually was rumored nearly 2 years
before it happened
Apple is very common in prototyping and
I know common wasn't a word that I'm
just not gonna start this comet again
thing is Apple is very known for
prototyping they test things they try
things out and it's clear that this
could probably be another prototype or
it could be that this is a year in
progress I hope that's the case because
Apple really can't continue another year
with the same design I feel Apple is
slowly losing its immunity and I think
that's a good thing don't think that
they could get away with it in 2017 at
least I don't hope so this is a very
good point I do hope so as well I feel
that the only way innovation is going to
take a step further as if companies move
away from their comfort zones but it
also requires consumers to move away
from their comfort zones as well then
finally on Friday the topic was the next
generation iPhone again some leaked
schematics that we saw from Foxconn and
what you thought about these we had 944
comments these Chinese words in the
leaked image at 3 minutes mean this
picture is just made up I think I'm
gonna have to brush up on my Chinese why
do all I phones look the same to me hey
it's not just to you and speaking of the
topic of comfort zones that we talked
about on the last question that is the
main problem that a lot of people don't
like change and it's the main reason why
Apple can get away with the same design
for too
years where are so many people essing on
Apple for not changing the back design
when even Samsung haven't changed their
design since the s6 that is so true I
feel that a lot of people are extremely
critical of what Apple does in the tech
space and mostly it's oh the design
hasn't changed then people go out and
buy the phone um you know I wonder
exactly what is it about human behavior
that is just not happy with the way
things are but then still goes to buy
these things why not just you know prove
the comment and not buy them because I
feel that's the way consumers should
behave but then again I do feel that
there are so many ways you can design a
smart phone you can't really change it
much I mean even car companies do it
they don't change their designs for four
five years sometimes the design works if
it's functional and if people like it
then why change it good I do feel that
you could just use that same motto to
just improve everything internally the
problem is Apple hasn't really done much
of that that's it for the parking out
