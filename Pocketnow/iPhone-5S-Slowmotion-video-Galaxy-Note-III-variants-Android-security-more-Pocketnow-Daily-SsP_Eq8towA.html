recording to the next iPhone as annie
has a possible variants of the galaxy
note 3 get rumoured and Google fixes the
Android security bugs but are you
getting them I'm hi Mary betta and in a
perfect world we'd be discussing the
news over cold beer today this is
 out daily let's start the day
off with the product announcements as I
know many of you are waiting for the HTC
8xt and I don't blame you get stuck with
that name as much as I do but so the
carrier is finally announcing that the
phone will be available on July 19 then
you're paying 150 bucks then you get a
fifty-dollar mail-in rebate once you
send it in and it pretty much ends up
costing only hundred bucks not the best
pacific asians in the world but then
again you don't really need a Ferrari
engine for Windows Phone so stay tuned
for that Google is up next as many of us
were concerned about this new security
exploit that was happening in the google
play store that would allow hackers to
take control of almost every Android
phone out there interesting since Google
never really specified what the exploit
was but the company has now sent out a
patch to their partners to allow them to
deal with these issues on every phone
the question is if you're really getting
that software update as we know the way
Android rolls now let's talk about the
samsung galaxy note 3 as yesterday we
uncover that there were as many as three
variants out there being built for the
phone because it turns out it's actually
closer to eight eight different carrier
variants you're going to be available
for this phone and the question is why
why do we need a carrier variance with
different technologies are going to be
available in each of these different
phones that won't be available to each
of these different phones it's probably
something that worries us but anyway
stay tuned there's a lot of hardware
space in the galaxy note 3 because of
its size so I'm sure that they can
figure something out for that phone not
to be you know specific to one carrier
and then not offer hardware specifics to
another let's see how it goes up next
let's talk about the iphone we've
received a lot of tips a lot of photos
of possible designs of the new iphone 5s
along with the new cheap entry-level
iphone we've been very skeptical about
these because a lot of them just seem
fake a lot of
seem like cases that you can snap on the
current generation iphone 5 and in other
cases we've seen for example this
Chinese film that was running Android
that was using the design of the
possible chief generation iphone well as
it turns out we've run into some more
images apparently we do get five color
variants of this phone which look kind
of nice but still I take that with a
grain of salt we still don't know if
these are the real photos of what the
phone is going to look like especially
because we don't see a model number B
foot below that iphone name so stay
tuned for those rumors and finally for
the interesting news of the day one of
the cool features is were discovered in
iOS 7 beta 3 is something that allows
you to switch into mold ghoul mode and
that pretty much allows you to film
video at 120 frames per second and what
that does is allow you to film high
quality slow motion video but
interesting enough that feature was not
included in the beta or the iphone 5
that's pretty much a unique feature
that's coming to the iphone 5s or at
least so we assume but anyways that
leads you to the question of the day
wood high-quality slow motion video be a
cool feature that would make you buy an
iphone 5s i mean i know that the HTC one
in the galaxy s war you know these
companies are already looking for ways
to tweak software to allow you to do
this so i really don't know how hot and
deal-breaking that feature would be in
my particular case i would love to have
it but it really wouldn't make a
difference for me to buy iphone or not
so leave us a comment down below what
would you want and of course for an
earlier scope of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tougher
