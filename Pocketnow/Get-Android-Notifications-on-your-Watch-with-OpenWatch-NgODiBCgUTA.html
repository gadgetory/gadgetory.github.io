today i really wanted to show you about
a desktop app the ties in with your
Android phone called Android desktop
notifier it's kind of like Chrome to
Phone but in Reverse it lets your
Android phone send notifications about
phone calls text messages all kinds of
stuff to your desktop over your Wi-Fi
network or over Bluetooth after several
hours I couldn't get it to work so
instead I'm gonna show you what I think
is cooler which is sending those same
notifications to your watch let's go
take a look
okay on the Left I've got my Nexus One
and on the right I've got my Sony
Ericsson Bluetooth watch now through an
app called open watch which is available
free in the Android Market and is
actually available for other smartphone
platforms like blackberry and Windows
Mobile - I can pair this watch to this
phone and get notifications right to the
watch's LCD screen you can hook this up
to all kinds of different watches and
even some what they call bracelets but
don't want that turning off guys their
little metal bands that go around your
wrist has an LCD panel on it that isn't
a watch so what are you gonna call it
but it'll let you do that to those you
can get from places like thinkgeek these
you can find online they're really not
making them much anymore but they're
really super cool then with apps like
open watch you can do neat things with
them so first let me show you what a
standard message looks like let's go
ahead and send a test over and look at
the watch over here we'll send that and
immediately there you go it's got the
information that I'm running an open
watch version 1.1 zero if we wanted to
do some other information you can you
can go in and get information from the
watch itself like the firmware but let
me show you everything in here you can
send to the watch phone calls SMS MMS
Gmail k9 mail Google Talk calendar alarm
music external apps this has an API so
you can have an app that talks to this
app that talks to the watch so you don't
have to build all of the open watch
stuff into your app to be able to send
messages to the watch twitter twitter ID
mundu i am some other Iams just lots and
lots of stuff it's got support for
several Bluetooth watches and I'll just
let you take a look at that list and a
whole bunch of stuff that you can
configure in here so really quite cool
and I've got it set to auto start right
now you can even pull information from
the watch by doing a firmware check so
right now it's telling the watch hey I
want to know what firmware you're
running but watch this okay here you go
that's the firmware so two-way
communication on there it's pretty neat
and it doesn't interfere with being able
to use a head or hands-free headset or a
car kit or anything like that
so let's go ahead and start sending some
messages over so you can see what it
looks like okay off camera I have just
composed an email on my wife's Android
g1 and sent that over to my gmail
account and we should see it show up
here on the watch momentarily let's take
a little bit of time because I've got an
email forward in between so that routing
takes a minute but as you can see here
I've got a new email from my wife and
there's your email address if you want
to send her happy wishes and whatnot
remember be nice kind of cool let's go
ahead and look at some other stuff all
right for this test I've got the screen
of the Android turned off and I'm gonna
send a regular text message over to my
phone so we'll send that now and see
we've got the pulse indicator showing
that I've got new email and right there
it shows up as a new text message and
it'll show you the contents of the text
now another thing that it's doing is the
watch is vibrating while it's doing this
so it's letting you know hey you have a
new message and it didn't show you the
text of that text message but it lets me
see easily hey I've got a new text I
need to read this doesn't work presently
with Google Voice text messages so
that's something that I'd like them to
add it doesn't do it right now laughs
let's go in and show you what a phone
call looks like okay placing the phone
call right now that's going out over a
Google Voice so it's gonna take an extra
couple seconds while it negotiates for
that Google Voice line phone is ringing
on the sending end second ring and you
can see here move that off screen it
shows my wife's name Natalie Levi that
she's the one that's calling the phone
is vibrating the watch is vibrating it's
really quite cool to see that I've got
somebody calling right here and I can
send it to voice mass it's voicemail
just
really easy by touching one of these
buttons so you know it's not quite as
cool as what I'd intended to show you
or maybe it's cooler showing in these
same types of notifications going to the
screen on your computer yeah that's neat
but having them on your wrist right
there so you can see them at any time oh
and by the way it also tells time if you
couldn't tell because it is a watch I
mean that's just really cool you can
also tell when you're getting too far
away from your phone it'll tell you that
it's disconnected and of course if your
watch goes too far away from your phone
that will tell you on the phone as well
that your watch is disconnected if you
wanders away for whatever reason but
really cool I like it a lot and this is
what I use every day to help me be a
little bit more in touch and a little
bit more tech-savvy if you want to go
ahead and do this finding these watches
is kind of tough finding the Bluetooth
bracelets from ThinkGeek relatively easy
relatively inexpensive so go ahead and
give it a try if you want to keep up to
date with cool stuff like this I mean
this isn't just Android phones this is
stuff that makes using your phone better
to do that you've got to subscribe to
our YouTube channel we put all kinds of
cool stuff up there and we've just
passed a thousand videos so thank you
for watching and and tuning in if you
like this kind of video give it a thumbs
up if you've got any questions or
comments put those down in the comments
down below then as always I'm Joe for
