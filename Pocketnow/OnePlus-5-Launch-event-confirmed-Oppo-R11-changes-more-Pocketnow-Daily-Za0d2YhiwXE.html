flagship event official it seems that
the next Oppo smartphone is going to
take the jump in dual cameras and even
if quick charge for plus is already here
you might not get an adapter just yet
I'm hi Marietta and how about if we go
through everything other than Apple news
today we all deserve it this is
PocketNow daily the official loose today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for a Samsung gear s three or four some
of the offerings from Android wear I had
it's just you go to Best Buy
particularly because in the case of the
Samsung gear s three you get it for
fifty dollars off and then there's also
another fifty dollars in a coupon and
then there are some similar coupons that
you can find for some fossil Q
smartwatches you can learn one
description now let's talk about the ZTE
Nubia z17 we hadn't really mentioned
this phone on a daily it was really just
more of a showcase of the fact that this
is going to be the first smartphone with
quick charge for faster speeds etc the
problem is that even though this phone
is pretty much ready to ship and
everything those of you that are getting
that phone are actually getting quick
charge three adapters and the reason why
is because even though the technology is
there apparently
the adapters from Qualcomm are not there
yet the technology is apparently not
ready we'll keep you posted hopefully
you'll get a replacement now it's how
about Microsoft and it's Skype service
the longest time even though Skype
really started as more of a messaging
service that we really enjoyed for its
video calling capabilities at Microsoft
turned it into more of a corporate thing
as of now there is an update to Skype to
make it more of something that consumers
use where you actually can doodle on
images when you take photos and a lot of
the stuff that you can currently do with
iMessage and other messaging services
you can learn more about the update in
the description give it a try why not
now let's talk about Oppo we saw the
company innovate in providing us this
new optical zoom through this periscope
like design of a camera back at MWC that
was all great but dual cameras are
currently the way to go and the company
is joining the crowd with its are eleven
I've been a fan of the our lineup ever
since the r5 so I cannot wait to get my
hands on one of
smells good dual cameras a 20 megapixel
front facing shooter let's see when we
get the final launch and price tag and
finally the very hot news they have to
do with the 1 plus 5 that all of you are
waiting for this film as much as I am
June 20th set your calendars noon
Eastern Time there will be a virtual
event where the company will unveil its
new smartphone I can't wait to see what
we get one plis did an amazing job of
the one plus three one plus three T
obviously the phones weren't perfect and
for the price tag we weren't really
expecting them to be as good as they
were still they were and the one plus 5
is apparently going to be everything we
wanted starting with that whole thing of
DxO mark working together with oneplus
but anyways it leads me to the question
of the day what is your wish list for
the 1 + 5 what do you expect to see on
June 20th in my case hey if they gave me
the exact same one + 3 T with a better
camera I would be happy and a lot of
resistance why not and dual speakers why
not fine that's it
