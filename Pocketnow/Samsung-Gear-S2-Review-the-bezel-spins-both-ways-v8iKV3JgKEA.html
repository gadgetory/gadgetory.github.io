a step towards the conventional while
also keeping the complexity but that
convergence comes at several costs is
the gear s2 with all of them
I'm Jules along with pocket now we're
about to find out in our video review so
remember that gear s yeah that chunky
thing it was an amazing massive
capability the shape of the device drew
from Samsung's preferences for a band
form screen and you could surf the web
on all 2 inches of it simply put the
gear s2 went on a diet the fit and
finish well our unit sports a black
stainless steel case with Gorilla Glass
3 at the winning combination against
most bruises and bumps tack on a comfy
and well-made gray elastomer band
Samsung was cognizant enough to provide
two sizes plus ip68 rated protection
against dust and water and eva of a
petite elegant and yet fierce entry into
the 2015 wearables calendar on the watch
case you'll find three methods of
interaction with the device the buttons
back in home are for regressing through
the UI of course the glass covers up a
touch display Super AMOLED collectible
in bright conditions and well beautiful
you can tap on and swipe across it but
there is that rotating bezel at first I
wondered about the usefulness of
translating a classical pocket watch a
vestige into a part of a thing that you
put apps on but then I realized the
satisfaction I got when it spun the
wheel the assurance of a hardware click
that registers absolutely in the OS
something like klutzy fingers can easily
mess up with so little real estate
swipes are swipes not jitters this bezel
may be a believer the innards on our
standard Bluetooth model are relatively
modest though thorough while the engine
on this thing is pretty small it does
carry the typical slate of sensors that
are well rounded wearable at this price
should have and also has three
connectivity options including NFC
Samsung decided to use a Qi cradle
solution to charging some
we can appreciate one thing we have to
appreciate though is the to our zero to
fall wait a little longer than average
but for an overnight soaked or at work -
what's the difference really complete
Samsung exclusivity isn't the case
anymore for the gear s2 you can now pair
some Android phones that aren't galaxy
branded to the watch the barrier comes
when you try to install the necessary
gear manager app there's actually a
device compatibility document floating
around it's not an exclusive list of 34
though as my hallway p8 Lite can attest
but much more capable devices capable
beyond Samsung's RAM and software
requirements aren't compatible with that
we've been trying to get answers from
Samsung on this and we'll update when we
hear from them if we do but for this
video review we're focusing on our
experience with the device pair to a
Galaxy s6 edge+ owners have recently
released or recently updated galaxies
have the best bets for meeting - a gear
s2 if you're trying your luck however
keep your receipt you might need to make
a return the interface itself is fairly
simple if just a bit dense from the top
you have your vital stats and toggles
including for music do not disturb and
of brightness notifications go on the
left widgets like alarms
as health heart rates they go on right
you can add subtract or reorder them as
you please
though there aren't any third-party ones
the microphone on the s2 is designated
for s voice voice the dictation and
voice memos while you can connect a bt
headset to the watch the only calls
you'll make are on your phone looking at
pizza places scheduling meetings and
messaging your pals stuff like that
works about 90% of the time it's not the
best money but it works you can also
send canned or dictated SMS messages
through your watch
but the wow factor goes to the keyboards
either bezel rotation based or t9
GLaDOS back in some fashion right back
to more basic SmartWatch facets there
are 15 watch faces preset several of
them can be styled to your preference
two of them are from Bloomberg and CNN
the two also have dedicated apps on this
two if you want to consume your market
and international news rather
inconveniently you'll likely be thrown
at to your phone if you want to read an
entire story but if a 100 award summary
should suffice for you say for a coffee
break
it fits the bill it's especially great
to have the bezel for scrolling here
you'll definitely find yourself in SLO
Vil on heavier apps like maps or heaven
forbid love early bird but everywhere
else you go you'll get there in buttery
smooth fashion helping out in that
fashion is a double tap of the home
button you can assign it to whatever app
or function you want including the
recent apps screen to get back to say a
timer.you started which is better than
this you'll be three or four swipes away
from the timer when you want to check
how much time is left there's a good
variety of apps in the Gear App Store
however poorly organized it is beyond
the watch faces that saturate the
categories you'll find a small set of
apps with a good set of features you can
get away with navigation on here tick
off a few things on your to-do list and
even consume YouTube with squinty and
eyes in general Samsung has a ways to go
in getting its ecosystem game together
against Android wear and pebble it's a
good start but it's only a start from
third to first party several native app
features on this - like navigating on
maps or routing music controls to the
watch rely on auxiliary services you
have to install when you open them up
the first time a lot of the
notifications you choose to receive are
just as actionable on the watch as on
Android wear it'll receive the full text
of Gmail messages long as they may be to
scroll through but they only have an
archive button on the bottom extra
actions including reply and delete are
heading to the right and require a swipe
to acts
it's not exactly intuitive but all of
the Swiss Army knife is there another
basic aspect power with the battery
rated at 250 million hours the watch did
surprise us with its promised two days
of use minimum my daily routine
admittedly doesn't have me outside for
very long so the average two and a half
to three day life cycle I got might be a
result of my habits but that's with an
always-on watch face notifications a lot
of music switching and a good bit of
exercise tracking if you do find
yourself in dire straits
there is a power saving mode that swaps
all the functionality of the gear s2
except for notifications call directing
and messages two days is very attainable
if you're really going to town on this
thing
less so so will the gear s2 be the
SmartWatch you turn to well by itself if
there's a whole lot on the table but the
compatibility issues and some
overbearing cruft on the software might
tempt you to compare and contrast with
other platforms other watches for
cheaper or for more expensive still
durable wrist-worn granularity is one of
those rare things you think pretty cool
to have but when you find yourself
wanting it you do want it bad the one
thing I would drop to my knees a big for
at this point just to have this product
rise out of contention are cell antennas
it was one bulb Samsung major from the
gear s that said hey you don't need a
phone if you don't have one today go on
to the completeness of what content s2
can provide consumption is not ideal yet
it's good as gold
if you've left your daily driver at home
the extra fifty bucks for a device and
change per month for 40 service on a
gear s2 is definitely worth it in the
end for our 300 dollar Bluetooth only
model the gear s2 provides an adequate
SmartWatch experience in great form it
just would be our first choice

Rivera's logging of s health on the gear
