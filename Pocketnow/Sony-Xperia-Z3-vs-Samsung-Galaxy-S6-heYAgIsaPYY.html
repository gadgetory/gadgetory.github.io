they both look good though one is fresh
and the other one is a classic
and they both aren't their respective
manufacturers 2015 flag ships but
there's a lot more to comparing these
smartphones and that's exactly what
we're going to do in our Sony Xperia z3
plus vs. Samsung Galaxy s6 and edge
comparison will focus on hardware
software and user experience as well as
the camera let's dive in the 2015 Sony
flagship lost some weight at 144 grams
it is still a tad heavier than the 138
grams of the galaxy s6 and the 132 grams
of the galaxy s6 edge it is at the same
time larger in every metric from height
to width and thickness even if by just a
little and that added weight and
physical superiority is do you mostly to
the larger display larger battery
front-facing stereo speakers as well as
the water and dust proof construction
disclaimer while we are using the Galaxy
s6 edge in this particular video all
aspects are applicable to the galaxy s6
aside from the curved screen and
slightly different dimensions there's a
major difference when it comes to the
philosophy behind building these phones
Sony decided to keep the design of the
Xperia z3 plus untouched meaning that
this year's phone looks almost exactly
identical to last year's and previous
iterations that's not necessarily a bad
thing if you like Sony's elegant and
minimalistic design language however
there are voices that criticize the
decision
voices that call for a return to the
drawing board
which is exactly what Samsung did with
the s6 and the s6 edge the South Koreans
returned to the drawing board to release
an S device like no other before one
that looks fresh and feels premium
thanks to the choice of materials
aluminum and glass might be new to
Samsung owners but it's something Sony
fans were able to see and feel for a
long time on their experiences the
galaxy s6 and edge are not water nor
dust proof like their predecessor the
Galaxy s5 this is where the Sony Xperia
z3 plus has an advantage
the Japanese phone is rated
be 65 and 68 for water and dustproof
scenarios and it also manages to achieve
that with most of its ports open except
for the sim and microSD but where the
Samsung Galaxy s6 has an advantage is
the built-in wireless charging support
you might or might not use it or be a
fan of it but it's there should you ever
want to in terms of specs sony has the
larger display at 5.2 inches on the
Xperia z3 plus vs. 5.1 and the Galaxy s6
but Samsung has the resolution advantage
of quad HD 1440 by 2560 pixels versus
Full HD 1080p on the Xperia phone on
paper it matters and so does the IPS LCD
technology used on the sony versus the
Super AMOLED type screen on the Samsung
phone which frankly is probably the most
beautiful we've ever seen on a
smartphone in terms of horsepower Sony
decided to go with the highly criticized
Snapdragon 810 according to reports a
second version of it one that is said to
overheat beyond normal limits requiring
a reduction of speed in order to cool
down
Samsung decided to ditch this SOC and go
for its own octa-core exynos 7420
processor the RAM game is a tie at three
gigabytes for both models but while the
Xperia z3 has 32 gigs of expandable
storage the galaxy s6 comes in
variations of 16 32 and 64 gigs without
support for microSD card expansion 20.7
megapixels software stabilized camera on
the Xperia z3 plus tries to match the
quality of the 16 megapixel optically
stabilized shooter on the galaxy s6
while the front phasers are almost
equally matched at five point one and
five megapixels respectively a 2930
milliamp hour battery is at the core of
Sony Xperia z3 while the s6 has a 25 50
milliamp hour battery which is a 2600
milliamp hour battery on the edge the
Samsung Galaxy s6 also has an infrared
port for remote control operations as
well as a heart rate sensor monitor on
the back in addition to added security
features of the fingerprint scanner
embedded in the
home-button these are all speaking in
favor of the galaxy s6 when it comes
down to specks on paper pour that Oda 2
is running on both the Xperia z3 plus
and the galaxy s6 at the time of this
comparison however both pounds are
offering a slightly tweet user
experience with their own custom user
interface on top of Google's own OS
we're happy to report that on this
iteration neither Sony's nor Samsung's
own custom user interfaces are intrusive
heavy or slow of course there are
manufacturers specific tweaks and
changes but these are understandable and
part of the company's design and UX
philosophy just like hardware design
among the two sony stake is probably the
one that feels closer to stock Android
and that's visible not so much in the
iconography but in places like the
lockscreen notification shade and
somewhat in the app drawer on the
opposite side Samsung is using its own
approach to the aforementioned
to a degree where neither the
notification shade nor the Settings
section is anywhere close to stock
however both phones are offering a solid
and fluid user experience gone are the
days of lag within the OS itself even if
the Sony Xperia z3 plus occasionally
stutters for a fraction of a second
every now and then this is also
something which we have seen on the
galaxy s6 both devices also allow you to
further customize the look and feel of
the UI by applying themes that you can
download in this particular department
Samsung is the clear winner with an
exhaustive collection of themes that you
can use depending on your tastes and
preference home screens widgets folders
and other basic UI elements are in line
with what you'd expect and as far as the
camera is concerned both Sony and
Samsung are employing their own
applications in order to bring the best
out of their shooters both have their
specific settings and both offer a
cornucopia of adjustments and shooting
modes in order to unleash your
creativity it is really hard to decide
which one is the best shooter among the
two both the Xperia z3 plus and the
galaxy s6 our exceptional cameras and
offer a great user experience while
snapping pictures or shooting video on
paper the galaxy s6 appears to be the
better choice thanks to its optical
image stabilizer
but the Sony Xperia z3 plus not only has
a larger sensor but it's software
stabilization is doing a great job in
studying the scene both for Stills and
video in bright outdoors they both
perform exceptionally well and you won't
be disappointed regardless of which one
you choose the pictures net with the z3
plus appeared to be a bit more saturated
and sharp but that's only visible upon
close side-by-side inspection in
low-light the situation is comparable
the Xperia z3 plus has an aperture of
f28 Oh while the galaxy s6 has one of
1.9 meaning that the letter should allow
more light in couple that with optical
image stabilization and the results
should be far superior on the galaxy s6
that is not always the case and in most
situations the results from the Xperia
z3 plus are superior to those of the s6
with brighter scenes and a lot less
noise because of the water and dust
resistant build of the Xperia z3 plus
you can easily snap or shoot underwater
pictures or videos something you cannot
do with the s6 you can take the z3 plus
to the pool shove it in your shorts and
don't worry about it at all things are
somewhat similar while shooting videos
though the s6 has a slight edge here
over the Xperia z3 plus thanks to the
optical image stabilization performing
better than Sony's software
stabilization video results are sharper
on the Samsung phone but color
reproduction is more accurate on the
Xperia z3 plus both cameras are capable
of 4k or Ultra HD recording and 60
frames per second full HD capture adding
to the user experience is the quick
launch of the camera on both models the
z3 plus has a dedicated shutter button
which helps in underwater and not only
scenarios long pressing the button puts
the device in camera mode regardless of
its state and the galaxy s6 is home
button acts as a camera shortcut upon
double pressing both cameras launch
quickly and the pocket to picture times
are very short overall in terms of the
camera you can't go wrong with any of
the two if however waterproofing is a
must-have then the choice is a
no-brainer we need to also address the
overheating reports which are
circulating regarding the
three plus the camera did not shut down
on us under regular circumstances while
the device gets warm the camera had only
closed due to high temperatures after
recording eight full minutes of 4k video
overall both devices offer a great user
experience our great performers and
attractive phones while the s6 has a
fingerprint scanner heart rate monitor
higher resolution AMOLED panel optical
image stabilization and wireless
charging the Xperia c3 plus is water and
dust proof with two front firing
speakers that generate a more pleasant
not necessarily louder output and a
larger battery that lasts a lot longer
than the one on the galaxy s6 you can
squeeze out one and a half days maybe
even two days on medium usage something
that you can say for the Galaxy s6 which
needs a charge at the end of each day at
best you pay an extra for the s6 and
even more for es6 edge though the Xperia
z3 plus is not achieved device leader
however regardless of your choice you
won't be disappointed with any of the
tube with the Xperia z3 plus you get a
beautiful finish minimalistic design
snappy performance great camera water
and dust proof build front firing stereo
speakers expandable storage and a great
battery life with the galaxy s6 you get
probably the most beautiful screen on a
phone to date fingerprint scanner heart
rate monitor wireless charging and
stellar performance all the way
throughout which one you choose is up to
