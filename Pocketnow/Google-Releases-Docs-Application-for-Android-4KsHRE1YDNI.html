pocketnow com google has finally
released an app for google docs in this
video we're going to tell you if it's
any good or not let's get to it okay so
let's take a look at google docs as it
exists in the browser i've already got
it loaded up here this is what it looks
like you can see your presentations your
documents or your spreadsheets listed in
a nice view you can also edit documents
which is great so there's an edit button
here's a little document that i made i
can click edit it works very very well
in the mobile browser and so if we go
back we can take a look at a spreadsheet
let's look at this one right here if we
look at a spreadsheet it's not only view
but you can also edit so there's an edit
button on the end of every column you
click edit you can go across and change
the fields however you want and it works
it works pretty well and let's go back
but the functionality is generally
limited and it still exists in the
browser one of the great things about
Google Docs of course is that it's
available in the browser to begin with
that you can get your documents wherever
you are as long as you have to go look
at and an internet connection so they're
really extending the functionality to an
app to allow you to do a little bit more
than you would get in just the browser
alone so here we've got the little
widget here we can tap the button on the
right to add a new document spreadsheet
or photo we're going to talk about that
in a sec here we can take a picture of a
new document and again we're going to
talk about that part in a sec because
that's one of the more interesting bits
about the application we can enter our
starred items those that are noteworthy
or even just jump right into Google Docs
here's the application this is what it
looks like and this is where we're going
to we're just going to go right into all
items and you're going to see basically
the same view that you saw in the
browser now we can do certain things on
the right side we can share a certain
document rename it or start where we can
open up documents certainly and here's
pretty much the same view as we had
before when we were looking at this in
the web browser here's the test document
we can click edit the same edit view
comes up in fact it even looks like a
browser it has a status bar loading at
the top so we'll go back and let's check
out a spreadsheet see what that's like
and no surprise it's going to look exact
like it does in the browser in fact this
is probably a browser inside of a nap so
we can click the edit button we can move
around on the screen pinch to zoom to
get a zoomed out view of the app which
is quite nice now one of the more
interesting bits about this application
is that it can use OCR which is optical
character recognition to convert text on
a page to a document I've already done
one it doesn't work so well it's mrs.
formatting completely and oftentimes the
the words aren't right but for example
here is a little here's a picture I took
of the top portion of a little report
and down here it's got some of the
attempt to convert into text and it
takes about five minutes to do so you so
you'll take a picture you'll open up the
camera functionality here and you'll get
the camera and then you will you know
the clear you can make the picture and
the bigger the font this is obviously a
bad example because it's cutting off
halfway through the word the better it's
going to be so you have to be really
careful if you want anything even close
to a good match and then right here it
says you can import it you can check off
this option here convert file to a
Google document which will allow you to
do the OCR which is probably one of the
coolest parts of the program other
things you can do you can take a look at
all your star documents you can filter
by text spreadsheets or presentations
and you can also go to collections which
is of course folders or Google Docs is
version of folders so overall you get a
little bit more functionality in the
mobile app than you do in the web
application but they're both so similar
there's nothing to lose to try google
docs it's a free application takes a
couple of minutes to set up and it works
really well it hooks up into multiple
Google accounts and it will sense the
Google accounts later on your device so
if you've got a gmail account and a
different android market account you can
switch between the two very easily to
access all of your documents right on
your android phone so not too bad the
browser version is almost as good but
hey it's free so give it a try if you
like this video please give it a thumbs
up and let us know what you think about
the google docs mobile application that
just came out thanks for watching that's
it for
