acer is just getting into the android
business which is kind of cool but
they've done something that well
honestly a lot of manufacturers are
doing and that's customizing the device
with their own UI with android that's
really really easy because all you have
to do is replace the launch your app so
let's go take a look and see what acer's
done with their launcher app alright
first off this isn't an acer device this
is a nexus one running android 2.2 but
it's got the acer launcher on it now
some of our good friends over at XDA
developers have gone through and ripped
the launcher out of one of the acer
devices and have made that available for
download so please go over to
pocketnow.com and check the article that
this video is going to be posted on and
i'll give you that link or at least the
link that was working when i tried it so
let's get into the good stuff first of
all you're going to notice that this is
a very very clean UI up at the top here
you've got your time and date with kind
of a neat bar subdivision I've got my
time set to 24-hour time so it says that
it's 0 7 44 hours if you've got just a
regular 12-hour clock it's just going to
say 744 so that's kind of neat one thing
that you'll notice up in the top there
is no traditional notification bar I
don't know how many bars I have I don't
know how much battery life I have I
don't have any of that information I
don't know if bluetooths on I don't know
if wifis on which really i think is kind
of a little bit it'll take some getting
used to but for a nice clean screen it
does a really good job next thing i want
to show you is down here you've got come
back to that in a minute down here
you've got a little tray if you will
vikon's and these icons are what you
think are the most frequently used apps
and they're customizable to get to your
app drawer it's really simple you just
drag this up nice and fluid with some
semi-transparent see up at the top as
soon as you get up to the top now you
have little text icons or
little text underneath your icons rather
to show you what they are so again down
here they're kind of compact with a
little reflection the last touch there
and then over here no more reflection
instead they've got the word underneath
it describing what it is if you want to
toggle this out really quick let's say
that I don't use market all the time and
I want to use feeder I tap and hold drag
up drop it's just that simple now when I
look at it feeders right there position
prominently now obviously this isn't all
the apps that i have installed on my
device so let's go ahead and take a look
how you do this you'll notice down here
on the bottom there's a little paginator
this is I'm on page 2 of 5 so I can go
over here that's my first page of apps
second page third page fourth page you
get the idea so kind of cool and then of
course back to the home screen one thing
you'll notice is there are really no
there's no room for widgets on here you
can tap and hold and get into this
control panel that lets you change your
wallpaper and some other stuff but every
time i've done that it's forced closed
that's probably because i don't have
another APK installed something that I
need to have but it's one of those
things that when you're installing stuff
that's been ripped out of other roms you
kind of have to get used to okay so back
to the home screen a couple things
you'll notice is I've got these little
grip ease over here on the side and they
really don't look like the traditional
Android grips over on that the sides of
the screen can you see those we see if
we can zoom in a little bit just this
little gray bar area here and then
another one right here so let me show
you what those do because it's really
kind of cool first of all let's go over
to the side and this has three different
options pictures music and videos and
you've got kind of a little carousel
scroller here to show you all of the
folders that you have pictures inside
that's kind of neat let's go over to
music and it's just just add it's your
music and then last is your videos so
there's my daughter playing the piano
and they're all in this nice carousel
tap this little arrow which i believe is
pointing the wrong way but that's just
me and it will take you back to the home
screen use the grippy on the other side
which after i force closed it got rid of
all my history I had all this set ups
for you so you're going to have to bear
with me as I go in and do some stuff so
let's go into the browser app and you'll
notice it had kind of a neat fly in
effect I really really like that it's
not your typical just kind of zoom pop
whatever you want to call it that that
expands your app to feel full screen
it's kind of an elect elastic effect so
let's launch something else and I'll
show you it also does that same
minimizing and it minimizes over here
which we'll get to so let's now go into
feeder again that animation will go back
home and let's go into the phone dialer
so here's my dialer go back home same
animation and let's do one more for good
measure let's see I wanted to do that up
and down scrolling to the side to side
so it's going to take a little bit ago
you used to so there's the market and
we'll go back now you'll notice all of
these have kind of been minimizing off
to the side over here and now I've got
that grippy so let's open it up and look
and sure enough I now have a history
carousel of the apps that I've just
recently run the browser feeder the
phone dialer and the market if I tap it
again it takes me right back into it
really kind of a cool UI it looks really
neat I wish we could do more stuff with
with customizing it but maybe one of you
guys out there reading or watching this
video can get in there and figure out
why it's doing that force close and help
the others of us to fix it I certainly
hope we can but hey you know it's really
cool what Acer's done here the only
things that I could recommend for them
in the future would be to put that
notification bar back or give us some
way to put it back and maybe you can
through the settings that we can't get
to because it was force closing I just
don't know but overall very cool very
impressive it's Android but it's a sir
it looks very sleek and smooth but don't
take my word for it what do you think
leave comments down underneath the video
of course if you like seeing this kind
of stuff give it a thumbs up if you
haven't already subscribed to the pocket
now video channel now is the time to do
that and as always for pocket now I'm
