been using shutterstock for a couple of
our video projects here too so from that
first-person account of what they bring
to the table it's always nice to have a
catalogue of stuff to kind of help flesh
out your video creation but that's
enough rambling that's enough preface
and that's enough housekeeping I'm
stoked this week to have the talented
the amazing MS Jaclyn Dallas to have you
on absolutely definitely talking about
some news this week talking about some
tech and and also is just some youtubing
you have a story that I kind of want to
share as we're looking at sort of the
future of user-generated content and
then how people can collaborate and so
just to kick things off if you wouldn't
mind terribly because you operate your
own YouTube channel as what it's an
impeachable user-generated content and
then how people can collaborate is that
so that the channel that you're you're
currently producing for oh can you
repeat that one more time sorry just
like glitched out no worries I was like
I heard myself start broadcasting on
yeah I don't know no worries again we'll
track that one up to the dumpster fire
that is Google Hangouts giving us
something to kind of help break the ice
with our guests but no I wanted to start
off just as an introduced introduction
for people who might not be aware of
your work you operate your own channel
its MBT e88
nothing but tech yeah nothing but taking
it so how did you get started in
producing technology videos for YouTube
especially doing reviews yeah so I got
started with tutorials when I first
started like two years ago mainly
because I didn't have like enough money
to devote to like buying tech products
and then I started like running my
audience a little bit and from there I
then transitioned into reviews so now
I'm making reviews on like a weekly or
bi-weekly basis on that channel and then
as I'm sure you're gonna mention also on
Android Central Channel but yeah it
started out about two years ago in
February and so what kind of response
did you did you find initial I mean you
you know everyone has those questions
they want to start producing their own
content or they want
are interacting with an audience what
was what was sort of the motivating
factor was at that there was a need that
you saw that was lacking you were
looking for a tutorial couldn't find it
or was it just like hey this looks like
fun I want to give it a shot and it kind
of built from there yeah so I was
constantly sending like phone tutorials
and how to do stuff to my friends and
people that weren't as like tech savvy
and I felt like if there was a market
for with like this many people then
there had to be a market also online if
people I could help so it kind of
started out of me wanting to help people
but then of course I was watching pocket
now and Marquez and a bunch of other
channels and I was like oh like reviews
are also pretty cool so then I
transitioned into reviews also and I've
kind of stayed more in reviews and
tutorials now so what was the first what
was the first phone you reviewed on your
channel first phone I reviewed was the
LG g4 it was like the first product for
review that I ever got and it was
actually like a great phone I think
that's like one of my more popular
videos also surprisingly g4 had a pretty
good run I liked the g4
I mean fruity boot loops notwithstanding
it was it was definitely a popular
handset so your producing your own
content you're you're starting to build
up your own audience what did it look
like when you started having
conversations with Android Central there
they're pretty heavy heading outlet for
for tech content yeah so I think it was
like three months ago or two months ago
that Daniel who's like that mannequin
person at Android Central by hiring new
people and that an editor there he
followed me on Twitter so then I kind of
DM Tim and was like I'd be really
interested in working for you guys
here's my content on my own channel and
then being one of opportunity to
diversify who they were having on their
channel so we started talking we worked
on my first video for them was on the
blackberry q10 and we just like started
creating weekly videos now so that's
what we've been up to my last video went
up like two days ago for them oh right
on so you made the first move
Android Central was like nervous around
girls is that what you're saying no I
just don't think I just don't think that
they knew of my channel because I'm kind
of a small channel in comparison I only
have like twenty six thousand people so
I don't
they necessarily knew who I was but he
did follow me and then from there I am
Tim and we started talking we did a
video call and I think it's going well
hopefully if you wouldn't mind terribly
what it's in if you do you drink enjoy
survive yeah what's going on don't get
me wrong I love the sound of my own
voice Oh cute I don't know what's going
on is it all there it's off now
all right that is so weird I'm sorry
about that I don't know if it's on my
end well we'll keep running with some
Google ghosts it's fun you know it's
like time travel we get to go where we
heard minutes ago so I you're doing some
work with Android Central you get to
jump in on something like the key one
well first up first of all like what
were your thoughts on the key one if you
wouldn't mind kind of summing them up or
sharing right now so I think for me as
someone that used blackberry a lot as
one of like the first smartphones that I
was using I think it was very like
nostalgic for me I know that Michael
Fisher who was on last week I think he
is still using Nick you want us as daily
driver just because of the like
nostalgic feeling that you've got one
using it there's something about that
tactile feel so I think that it's a
great smartphone for people that are
still stuck in that era of wanting a
physical keyboard and I did show it to a
lot of people that had used blackberries
and they all were like oh my gosh like
this is gonna be my next phone so I
think for devan's great I'm using the 1
plus 5 right now and I just love the 1
plus 5 in a lot of ways more than I like
the key one so I used it for a week but
I haven't picked it up since I think
it's a great smartphone but I'm not like
the key demographic for it now what it
would have been some of your experiences
because you know you were you were
saying there aren't as obviously there
aren't as many female tech reviewers
that are kind of tackling this beat
right now and I'm sure you've probably
had some unique experiences trying to
walk into or walking into not trying to
you're here walking into this this
ecosystem what was that like as your
audience started building up what did
you find that if you were able to have
the same kind of conversation was it
that because
do you feel like people maybe thought
you were a novelty what did that feel
like or what did that resemble is as you
started building building your video
views I mean I think that the one thing
that is a little bit different than the
common channel that's run by a male host
is that I actually have like a larger
percentage of females on my channel than
a lot of other channels run by males do
so I guess that that's something unique
I think I had like a 20% amount of
females which is a lot for like the tech
space unfortunately like that's low but
SLI at this time so I think that that
helps and I also think that it's just
like refreshing to see a different
perspective sometimes so I think that
that also helped me like gain my
audience because people wanted like that
different perspective so I think that I
mean it has been mostly positive I know
there's like a lot of females that are
like scared to get into the community
because I feel like it's so like male
oriented but I think that it's actually
like really welcoming everyone that I've
talked to in this community has been
nice so yeah it's been a great
experience so far I mean for myself
personally and again I'm speaking from
the perspective of being a dude so I'm
not having quite the same hurdle to get
over in terms of commentary but I really
do feel that once we get out of that
initial periphery of just sort of toxic
YouTube comments like not not just on
tech channels but just like typically
kind of toxic yeah once once you kind of
cut through that initial that initial
phase I've really found some great
experiences in the tech community as
long as someone has done their homework
and they bring an honest perspective to
the table that this has been one of the
more welcoming audiences that I think
I've ever produced content for so I'm
hoping that that's been so maybe this
somewhere has yeah for sure I mean
everyone's like there's are some mean
comments but you have to like learn to
look past them and a lot of them
actually help you then better your
content I feel like if they give you
constructive criticism so I feel like it
I mean I could be jinxing myself but I
feel like so far it's been like a really
positive experience for me I bet you
agree with talking now especially well
and again for for pocket now is you know
my first month was like who's this guy
why is he wearing
I see question I guess I guess we're
gonna I guess we're gonna be that guy
awesome so I just kept wearing hats
because I like it so um what do you have
what you have coming up next on on
Android Central you're you're reviewing
the 1+5 do you you recently spent some
time with a moto is that one of the
phones that you just recently reviewed
yeah so the 1+5 is actually going on my
personal channel I'm doing like three
week later of you but for Android
Central my video like daga or two days
ago was the Moto G 5 compared to the
Moto e 4 and I know that the Moto G 5
isn't covered as much because it's not
available in the US but I actually
really enjoyed my time and it's an
awesome budget phone so that that was
kind of surprising to me we actually
didn't get to spend any time with any of
the Moto G's this year I was kind of
bummed because like I did a lot of
content on the G fours last year so the
United States is only getting the g5
plus what were some of the differences
on the g5 versus the g5 plus and why do
you think it maybe didn't get that push
in the United States so I also tried out
the g5 plus and I think that the g5 plus
is a lot better feeling in hand it's a
lot thinner and it's also a little bit
bigger it's a 5.2 inch screen versus a
5-inch screen so it definitely is a
better phone in that field hand but it's
also more expensive moto normally
releases um one phone and then a plus
version of that phone which is always a
little bit better but a little bit more
expensive so I think that the g5 plus is
still a good enough phone and it still
is a low enough price that moto probably
didn't feel the need to release the g5
also I bet that they probably just want
to just like have more people buy the
more expensive one but the g5 is like
$200 in Amazon right now and for that
price it's really really impressive it
has like a 1080p screen has a
fingerprint sensor it has a decent
camera not ideal and then the speaker
said I've been surprisingly really good
it's like even better than like the LG G
6 which is like saying a lot considering
how expensive the G 6 is now it's been
partly my hypothesis that
a lot of manufacturers will skip over
the United States with some of these
these more entry-level options like you
were saying it's it's more likely that
if Motorola puts out a g5 and a g5 plus
only the plus will come to the United
States now I wonder is there may be like
a first world idea that manufacturers
might be overlooking I think that
there's an audience for 150 to 200
dollar phone in the United States an ear
burner phone yeah I agree you're in the
USA but it seems that manufacturers are
reluctant to court that that market here
yeah I mean you see while I also is like
a really big player overseas but then
here we don't really they're not as
well-known to like the general public so
yeah it is interesting a lot of the
budget phones don't really get released
here right away or if they do they're
not necessarily made for the US like
they have a lot of really heavy
bloatware that you don't necessarily
find in like other US phones so
definitely is interesting but Motorola
did release efore here which is 130
dollars or 70 with Verizon so that one
definitely is a budget phone and a
burner phone replacement but um
literally a burner phone replacement
with the Moto e so we've got a we've got
a question here from the p-n weekly hash
tag from gadget Devo and this one this
one is tagged to you uh curious on your
thoughts on the oneplus 5 versus the
negativity of some of the coverage
surrounding the 1+5 and you seem to be
pretty positive on it I mean you're
wrong but um I mean I look at this phone
it literally looks like an R 11 or an
iPhone 7 plus so I do mention that in my
review it is kind of disappointing that
oneplus didn't try to innovate with the
design that kind of just took what was
already working so one and I'm
disappointed in them but on the other
hand it actually has kind of worked to
one pluses benefit because for the
general public they see a phone like
this which looks like an iPhone 7 plus
has the same camera setup as an iPhone 7
plus for the most part and is a lot
cheaper so I think even though they
weren't really that creative and they
copy a lot of things from Apple I do
think that for its price point I
actually think it's a better phone than
the iPhone 7 plus like just if you think
of like performance - the price ratio
but I know a lot of people don't
actually like it they're worth you
issues with it like the jelly screen
effect or the fact that they treated in
the benchmarks which is a whole other
thing but yeah I don't know I there's
some things I love about and then some
things I definitely don't but yeah I
guess you find out more of my review
what do you think oh I feel so bad for
my audience I've prattled on so much
about the 1 + 5 uh yeah you know what in
in not sort of beating a dead horse I
would say my biggest disappointments
with oneplus in this generation are
largely in line with what you just
criticized a derivative design but I had
it this really great commenter on one of
my reviews who was like I never look at
the back of my phone so why should I
care and you're like you know what fair
point yeah feels good in the hand and
you like it then I guess that's fine but
the but but I think maybe the biggest
missteps were more company focused less
device focused so the goodwill that this
this brand has built up with tech
enthusiasts because so few brands are
really courting the Android enthusiasts
so many companies are trying to pivot to
a more mass-market audience but I kind
of felt this generation sort of um not
not soured the milk but maybe maybe did
a disservice with some of that Android
enthusiasts audience yeah what you're
saying benchmark cheating you know
rigging benchmarks that that it's not a
huge deal no one's really buying phones
based on benchmarks anymore but it's
still a data point say like well why why
would you do that when this phone is
already a screamer and now it just makes
me feel like this company is doing
something again to try and force a
narrative in in a really ham-fisted way
and that makes me a little less trusting
of this brand yeah very that complaints
with the actual device it really did
feel more like this company kind of got
away from the media and the messaging
that worked
so well last year for the one plus three
and the three t and that felt like a
minor stumble like this this this whole
year talking to this audience it didn't
feel like they were firing on all
cylinders
yeah I agree and also just like simple
things like when they always like try to
portray themself as a small company when
we all know that like they have a lot of
money to spend like when they were
commenting and like the Verge's
exclusive video they said they didn't
have the money to spend out like a bezel
list or like an ear bezel of screen and
I see how that could be true but I feel
like they really could have pushed it a
little bit more the bezels are
definitely huge like if you put this
phone next to an essay it just looks so
ancient I don't know I mean like we have
literally two phones that are pushing or
I guess three if you can't like the me
mix but that's not really a North
American release yeah I guess that's
true but you know I just think it's
funny like how quickly I mean think
about how viscerally fast that change
happened from really trying to maximize
a sixteen by nine screen device with the
front home button or front fingerprint
sensor to the LGG six comes out then the
galaxy s 8 comes out two phones come out
and they've completely wrecked
I mean fundamental shift where now it's
like I don't even want to look at it
unless it's like an 85 percent zoom when
the iPhone comes out it's just gonna be
like even worse because in like every
general consumer would normally buy
Apple is now gonna like see that yeah
well and that's why I make actually
excited I'm I just I just finished
cutting an iPhone 7 after the buzz you
know like our revisit outcome long term
we revisit two phones after we're done
doing the main review and it wasn't one
it was just kind of crazy like it's a
sixteen by nine 720p display it's it's
old and we're all really looking forward
to seeing apples shift up something
major but there's something that I think
a lot of people might miss and just the
consistency of the iPhone like you could
give if you were to transplant someone
from 10 years ago using the original
iPhone and you
to give them an iPhone 7 I don't think
there would be a huge learning curve for
that person to get so this major
shake-up in hardware I bet there will be
some people are like oh you know I kind
of missed the home button you know I
just kind of miss like this thing that I
used to really like about my phone and
you know the new screen is super sexy
this new design is awesome it's finally
something ultra fresh from Apple but as
a victim of their own success I wonder
if there will be some people who won't
be like oh well yeah I mean it's like
it's new and it's fresh and it's
different and it's better but I kind of
miss my old iPhone 5 yeah I mean the
thing is like especially a lot of things
in iOS are centralized around that home
button like the multitasking or Siri
like all of its kind of centralized
around it so I definitely think it's
gonna be more of a learning curve then
past years like 3d touch shave and you
didn't need it to use your phone so a
lot of people don't ever use it so I
think yeah people are like especially
the older generations like people's
grandparents have gotten so used to that
hold on I think it's gonna be a learning
curve for sure we have a we have a
couple of comments here just circling
back to to our conversation about the
Moto e from Andrew Wallace hashtag P and
weekly super budget devices are very
popular here in the Midwest so he
doesn't understand moto strategy from
Peter hatin I just wonder how much how
how much true budget phones really would
sell in places like the US but
apparently we're seeing some traction
especially on unlocked handsets being
sold through retailers like Amazon I'll
be really curious to see you know
especially with these new like instead
of making their own fire phone it's they
released a low cost phone and then put
ads on it to cut the price even yeah and
then following up from Peter Hayden some
want and need affordability but they
don't always get this from these from
these mid rangers offer better but for
not much less and I guess maybe that's
that's one of the things that some III
think one of the difficult ideas to
overcome so you're using a 1 plus a 1
plus 5 and you recently were using a
moto G now if you were sort of a regular
consumer looking at
picking up the phone how does the money
make sense you have to pay $200 upfront
for an entry-level phone but then you
can go to any carrier and on a no
interest loan with zero down if you've
got decent credit go and get an $800
phone and just make monthly payments do
you think Americans are kind of doing
the math on that or do you think that
there's a wedge that we can start better
educating people as to where they can
save money I mean I think that
especially if it's someone's second
phone I think that it doesn't really
make sense to have two premium
smartphones like I know a lot of people
when I was asking I did like a periscope
when I asked like who do you think this
phone is for and a lot of people were
saying that they would get it as like a
backup phone so I think for that you're
not gonna want to spend like $40 a month
to get like a 7 plus or an S 8 if you
can get a backup phone for 200 down
because even though it's over a bunch of
months eventually you are spending a lot
of money so I think right for a backup
phone it's actually a really good
alternative but then someone brought up
to me what about is getting a flagship
from last year and that's a good point
also because flagships normally even if
they're like the last year's flagships
like the s8 edge are still really great
phones and there are similar prices like
used on eBay - the newer budget phones
that are coming out so I think that's a
good point
no but do you think that because I agree
and actually this is a this is a
question we got earlier in the day from
Andrew Wallace also how would a 2015
flagship compared to a 2016 mid ranger
curious on what on the parity of
features when comparing them so you know
it's been part of the the big debate how
would you rank a last year flagship
against some of these mid rangers do we
think that the two to three hundred
dollar budget section of the smartphone
world has caught up enough to a phone
from last year or do you think that the
we're even going to get the same kind of
software support like they might only
get a year of updates where that
flagship still might get a year of
updates um I think that let's just say
that s7 edge which is a really popular
phone I think in camera performance
it wins out above everybody phone the
main issue that I always find when
testing our budget phones is a camera
quality is really not there so I think
that in camera performance but
especially with Motorola I actually
prefer their self we're immensely over
Samsung's it's so much more stock and
clean so I think that in terms of self
or you do get a better experience unlike
the two to $300 phones if you're buying
it from Motorola but in terms of
hardware looks and the camera
performance I think last year flagships
always went out because they're still
really good looking and comparisons like
a beefy really thick phone the s7 edge
is still like if you compare that to you
next to each other I think most people
would say the s7 edge is better looking
I don't think anyone would disagree I'm
so cranky I'm not the biggest fan of
glass back phones but I think the work
that Samsung has been doing in terms of
design like every time a new from the
galaxy s6 on every one of their phones I
think has been a marvel of design and
engineering but it makes me want to set
it up on like on a little pedestal with
a glass case under museum wide Inc it's
very rarely the device that I want to
take with me outside is why I've been
anxious like we've been seeing rumors
and we've been hearing you know like III
think we did see something go through
the FCC but we're really late in the
summer now for a galaxy s 8 active you
know a ruggedized version yeah of the SA
so I'm like that used to be like my
summer fix you know like I'm judging you
over the summer and it always used to be
the active I want to shift topics real
quick this is a new story that a bunch
of people sent in unfortunately I only
have the tweet from Andrew but I know a
number of other people have sent this in
and and we did talk about it I think we
did post a news piece on it on PocketNow
but a phone manufacturer a luxury phone
manufacturer virtu is going out of
business they're liquidating jobs and
even in trying to get communication from
PR teams there they've already shut down
payments BBC asked an external spokesman
for Khan for for comment well it's gone
into liquidation and I'm not being paid
by them anymore that's all I have this
that fell apart fast no
the suasion so obviously when you talk
about phones all you talk about are how
pretty and shiny they are virtue was
totally a company right up your alley
right yes is a F that's how the kids are
saying it these days for sure I don't
actually like like the matte black more
subdued phones I think that those like
look better over time and they don't
attract as much attention so I actually
wasn't a fan of their phone design but I
know a lot of people who her so I guess
it's sad for people that like them I was
obviously not the luxury market going
III wonder is this a data point that
maybe the idea of a smartphone as any
kind of status symbol is maybe a waning
idea do you think that we've kind of
arrived at the at enough saturation that
no one's really impressed you you could
walk in with a $2,000 smartphone and
people are not going to be impressed by
that like they were in the early days of
the iPhone um I mean I forgot there's a
really a luxury car company that still
produces phones I forget which one it is
um I know like there's there's like
Porsche design
yeah okay they still influence other
manufacturers but um it's usually their
spin on a phone usually not their own
yeah so I know that um a few years ago
they made a luxury car company made a
phone and I think it really did not do
well sales wise it was selling for like
two to three thousand dollars and I
think it really plummeted because
because I guess a ton of money and I
remember this fax inside of it were
actually last year aspects like the year
before was relief so it was really just
like a fashion symbol but read just came
out with a phone and a lot of people put
money down on it just because of who red
is but they saw one photo of it and like
one page respect so I definitely still
think that there's a marketplace for
buying phones from companies that have a
name for themselves without much
knowledge of it but I don't know the
$1500 red phone is definitely gonna have
to do something uh pretty amazing to be
worth that and we're not gonna see it
until quarter 1 of 2018 which is crazy
well but I I think that's actually a
really great point to bring up because I
feel like no one is really gonna be
looking at a phone from red and like I
spent $1,500 because it's got a
Halloween leather back studded with
diamonds there's they're spending you
know 1,500 bucks on hopefully what will
be one of the best mobile camera
experiences yeah he's ever seen and to
your point I mean obviously I often when
we would look at virtue I've never held
a revert to phone I'm actually just
because it's so audacious to charge that
much money for often you know older
specs and you're like I remember virtue
phones being launched not even a year
out of date but sometimes two years
software just ridiculously outpaced by
what was current no sense of updates but
they were early in using synthetic
sapphire for this screen so it was an
expensive front glass that was hard to
scratch but you were on a
three-generation yeah I mean I the
people that are buying that phone I
don't think are buying it as a Android
fanatics like oh I need the most recent
software I think that they're buying it
more is like a symbol of kind of who
they are and they like the looks at the
phone so I don't think that necessarily
it's for the people that want like the
latest Snapdragon chips and the latest
software I don't think that the buyers
of that phone like the niche actually
cared that much about that I could be
wrong I don't think you are but that's
what I think is so interesting again
we're watching the premium market sort
of plateau this is something that I
think Apple is is trying to address
right there there they become more of a
lifestyle brand than I think a tech
enthusiasts brand yeah I gave that whole
sport that Apple logo in a way that I
think is more lifestyle defining you
know this is this is this speaks to like
sort of my personality and this speaks
to the other brands that I like to
interact with like my favorite pair of
jeans are yeah my favorite sneakers
I kind of feel like outside of a company
like Samsung or outside of a company
like Apple the conversation has walked
completely away from
a mobile device being any kind of status
you know I I you know you can look at
someone walking around with an iPhone 7
and I don't think there's any general
perception around that individual that
they've got something special not like a
really expensive watch or a
multi-thousand dollar purse or handbag
or yeah especially since you can sorry
you can get no no please please God
especially since you can get it like $40
a month now it's not like you need like
a ton of money to buy it where as like
with the Apple watch edition or
something that was definitely like a
fashion symbol like you're spending 10
grand on a watch it's gonna be out
getting a year you obviously are like
buying it for the fashion State so I
think that yeah I don't really think
that you're like oh my gosh this person
has so much money when like you see them
with an iPhone 7 now whereas maybe in
the past like the really a lot older I
thought I think that people would have
been like more impressed now I mean just
to kind of put a put a pin in virtue I
think one of the things that is kind of
III guess surprising was a couple weeks
ago we were hearing word that virtue was
gonna be working with a manufacturer TCL
the maker of the new BlackBerry key one
they asked the Alcatel the idol line and
I guess that's what's maybe kind of
surprising is just how abrupt the end of
this company was they had plans to be
working on a next generation of devices
with a manufacturer that's bringing a
lot of credit
credibility to the table um what do you
think this might mean for other
companies trying to get into this space
I kind of feel like unless you're an
Andy Rubin on the essential phone no one
seems to be particularly interested in a
new player entering the market without
some serious backing yeah I think that
as we already mentioned like right I
think if you already have like a past
history I they're in a different market
or in Android as the central phone does
I think that it's still there's still
like an opportunity for it to come into
the market but I really think that the
only opening for someone brand new is
going to be in the super budget game
people are always looking for like the
new one plus one so I think that there's
still opportunity but I don't think that
there's opportunity for someone to come
in and be like
here's our $800 phone I think that you
need it bring something unique and you
need to bring it at like a low price
point in order to actually be heard I I
completely agree well and and also I
think that's where some of the more
exciting work has been lately you you
see you know the fact that I'm talking
about is ete I'm anxious to see what the
next axon is gonna bring to the table
yes something two years ago I never
would have imagined that these players
would be as as aggressive as they they
are for for these markets um let me get
a already lost we had a comment replying
to the difference between older
flagships versus newer mid Rangers from
random P after cracking my 18 TS 7 edge
I bought a used Exynos model off of ebay
I loved it
last year's flagships are still great
yeah and then we have a question here Oh
ed maudlin had a comment on the active
hey guys except for the fingerprint
sensor the s8 plus carries it but don't
let the active be ugly
I think that's kind of the point I still
think the s6 active is the best that
phone has ever looked I think it got a
little just Bulbasaur a little chunky
chunky on the s7 active but I don't know
maybe the the skinnier screen might help
minimize so I mean it's fake Emily how
great are you gonna make it like the s6
I have an s6 active somewhere in my
terrible shelf of devices and it's that
blue fake but the blue is kind of cool
you know you were saying like you like
matte finished phones because they they
held up hold up longer over time
something about blue I have only not the
company but the color yeah I have only
been asked out in public about blue
phones it was the honoré the pixel and
now oh the Huawei p10 and those are the
only phones like were people and not
like a person like a checkout line in a
grocery store but multiple
people have asked me usually it's what
kind of case do you have on your iPhone
that looks really great but they're
they're drawn to something kind of like
shiny and blue that when phones were
yellow or red or green like all of my
old Lumias but blue blue seems to catch
the eye and blue seems to catch the
imagination I think the new honor phone
is like this really shiny shiny blue and
that looks great like that gets your
attention right away no I and I really
dig that honor glass look again I want
to put it on a pedestal so you can see
all of the really fancy light reflecting
effect it's a fingerprint like I need
gotta throw that class that plastic I
tried to say clear plastic garden I
failed three times that clear plastic
snap-on case or a bumper case and that
kind of diminishes what I think is
aesthetically pleasing about that about
that look I mean and the only other time
I've actually been asked out in public
is if I have like a D brown skin or
color or skin people like no two seconds
if you apply them right they actually
look pretty good so if I have like some
I was rocking at the hot pink carbon
fiber and I was asked a ton about that
but other than that the only times I've
ever been asked it's like what the blue
pixel as you said you never get asked
otherwise yeah I don't know again I I
wonder what what that might speak to um
in terms of just aesthetic and design I
do have a question here just kind of
shift shift gears and talk about some
more industry stuff put you on the spot
because okay from from Dennis Kapoor saw
cockapoos ax I've butchered your name
and I apologize his Twitter profile pic
is in lg g5 with 5g right around the
corner when can we expect devices with
it does that mean new 4G phones will
suddenly have a shorter lifespan what do
you think I mean we've been starting to
flirt with 5g networks here in the
United States 18 t Verizon they're all
making noise about their future rollout
plans for what future data might look
like but do you think that this is some
people should be worried about now when
making a purchasing decision since we
like to hold on to our phones longer
than than we used to
um I I don't think so I think that if
you could buy phone I are probably
keeping it for two years I think is like
what most people do um if you buy a
condo
I think the average is now somewhere
close for like twenty six months I mean
like oh wow we're starting to really
stretch how long we're keeping a phone
and I think a part of that is because
we're not we're making monthly payments
on it you know when you see your bill
cut by thirty bucks a month you know I
can kick this for a little while longer
yeah I don't necessarily think that
that's gonna I think it's definitely
gonna change in the market I there's
definitely still coverage issues with
certain carriers I know that key movil
always pushes cheaper prices but their
coverage is really not great in my
experience so I think that there's still
a long way to go for 4G coverage to get
better before we have to start worrying
about 5g coverage and our phones being
obsolete from that I think that people
they buy phone a blue still be fine in a
few years do you agree that well III
think no I do I I do it's um it's one of
those things like for example t-mobile
just opened up some new spectrum and we
had some people asking about that and it
was gonna be at a lower frequency for
better building penetration but it there
is sort of a little bit of a chicken and
an egg you know once you have that
network up and running what phones are
compatible do you try and future-proof
with the purchase does that mean waiting
another year before you might want to
buy a phone and I'm kind of of the mind
like I think for me the commentary is
like I I really want people to be
holding onto these as long as they can
and and I don't mean that like you
should hold on to a phone that's dying
past the time where it's really
serviceable or reliable but you know
we've got a lot of concerns coming up in
technology in general even just outside
of the mobile space
I think battery markets are gonna get
very cutthroat and very competitive and
pricing is going to fluctuate once more
electric vehicles are hitting the roads
once more home batteries you know
Tesla's Tesla won't be the only company
offering some kind of giant home battery
yeah
these materials are you know our
precious materials to be throwing around
and especially for how much of this
stuff ends up is a waste yeah I think
that's gonna be a concern in general so
I really hope that we see better
longer-term support I think 18 months is
becoming inadequate in Android land for
software support if someone's holding on
for 24 to 28 months 18 months of
software support bug fixed bug fixes
security updates is inadequate and so my
my horse in this race is can we find a
way to legitimately improve quality of
life later into a phone supply cycle to
kind of help minimize the impact on some
of these issues so I think it's precious
I think it's important that people are
looking at the future of 5g in spectrum
and things like that but I think that'll
go hand-in-hand with the data center the
data center and backhaul improvements
that will also improve LTE over that
transitionary generation so let's say
you bought a phone right before an
explosion of 5g stuff was was launched
and you're now that that schmuck who's
an old crappy device I think a lot of
the stuff that's gonna make 5g Bible
will help improve the 4G situation Tran
Tran transition so I don't know that
again I want to preface this I think
people should be aware especially US
techies that have to make they have to
help family members and friends but I
don't think it's gonna be critical just
yet I think we're gonna be looking into
next year before I would start saying
hold off on making a purchase let's wait
to see what happens and then we'll go
from there I think this year and into
next year we're pretty safe still on LTE
and I mean even the other main issue
with phones like I can't believe it some
people are keeping them for like twenty
eight months because of battery
technology like how long the phone
actually last really takes a hit
especially I'm you
and iPhone 7 plus is like a co daily
driver to get iOS and Android and the
battery life on it is terrible now I am
have trouble making it through a day and
in the beginning I was getting like a
day and a half or two days so I think
that keeping your phone's for a long
time solver should be you mentioned but
I think we also really need to focus on
improving batteries and making them last
for how long were to keep them now which
is like two years they're a little bit
longer because right now they just don't
last yeah I think you know I would love
to see a concerted effort from a
manufacturer to really engage in better
battery recycling you know if you're
gonna build the battery in because you
want to improve things like durability
or water resistance I would love to see
a Samsung or an LG make this process
really easy for me to do a two year
refresh where I send my phone into them
maybe I get a loaner device or I have a
backup phone or something and they can
safely open up the phone swap out the
battery return the phone to me I know
that that battery is not ending up in a
landfill that they can do whatever they
can to recycle what might be recyclable
from that battery and I get a device
that has day one brand new device
battery again that used to be my
favorite thing to do back in the day
when all phones had a removable backs is
after a year I would buy an extra
internal battery and then I would have
two batteries and one of them was brand
spanking new so it was like I had a
fresh device all over again and that has
been I think one of the saddest things
about watching these things get sealed
up yeah I think that we definitely I
think Apple actually makes like a effort
to try to recycle stuff and they're
making more of an effort now but no
manufacturer is really putting the time
into it I think they like to say that
they are for like show but I definitely
think that has to be more of a thing
because if people keep upgrading their
smartphones every two years or even a
little bit longer there's still tons of
smart phones that are just like wasting
and hurting the environment so yeah I
would love to see a manufacturer like
actually devote some time to that well
and I I wonder if maybe there's not a
market for paying for support or
something I mean just kind of
spitballing when we see that there like
galaxy s4 is like our president I think
is still using a galaxy right you know
he's not rocking of her too
using like an old busted galaxy to do
all of his late-night tweeting I would
feel better if our commander in chief
had up-to-date security software just
know he's not gonna get the newest
version of the Android operating system
but for for bug fixes for malicious
software for security issues yeah what
is this through running it's got to be
what did it Scotty really old software
now yeah I mean like even if did it did
it did it make them move to the lollipop
know if it's nothing if it's not a
lollipop that's sad he's dead I can't
okay Gordon good $40 a month come on you
know you don't get to you don't get to
stay rich by just throwing money don't
want to get into politics no fire way to
fire up chattin conversation that
probably won't be fun and well yeah it
probably won't end well um I do want to
shift gears here real quick um let me
get this out of like sorry I've got some
other show notes up here
Jules mentioned we were talking about
some of some of the background on you
doing our dossier that you had also done
some some some personal work for for
charity work or for t-shirt designer
yeah something I was hoping you could
you could kind of talk us through that
explain what it was that you were doing
because it sounded pretty cool
thank you uh so I make t-shirt designs
like tech designs on t-shirts that go
along with my channel but you don't have
to be a subscriber to my channel or like
my channel to wear them and they're
kinda just like cool tech based designs
so I've done five of them now so for
every single design I'm giving 10% of
the profit to a nonprofit organization
so the way I'm trying to involve my
viewers in it is I have you or Sammy
like which ones they want me to do and
why so for the fifth one and now every
5th generation like every five I'm gonna
give a hundred percent of the profit to
it so I'm on the fifth generation right
now so we're giving a hundred percent to
the st. Jude's Children's Research
which was recommended by one of my
viewers so I decided to do that one and
we had like Jonathan Morrison support it
which was pretty cool so it actually
sold really well also which is great
because now we get to give back so
that's what I've been trying to do if
you want to check them out you can just
look up MDT's in line they are all based
around tech Android phones and stuff
like that and the fifth one is ending in
a day or so so yeah trying to give back
I guess I don't know so get them all
they're high cuz you yeah a day yeah and
then you stop watching this podcast and
then the next one is coming out like
next week right now is it gonna be the
same the same structure the same charity
I think a different charity I'm waiting
on which one I'm gonna do I'm gonna do a
poll on Twitter and see which one people
want to give back to you a lot of people
have like personal stories with them
like for a cancer hospital pediatric
cancer was one people someone had
experienced something with that so they
wanted me to get back to it so I'll do
it like for that it's not I just go
through and pick like which one I'm most
passionate about but yeah it's it's been
like a really fun thing to be able to
create what I personally think coal
designs and then also give back at the
same time so yeah it's been cool right
on III would you know let me know when
the poll is out and I'll help give it a
I'll give it a tweet I'll give it okay
you can get some more input
I would I would humbly maybe ask on the
pole for the JDRF okay I'm gonna write
that down that's that sort of art in
house I'm so it was like for all my
hardware I donate like all of our old
phones to cell phones for soldiers
because I'm a military brat but then for
all of our financial contributions we go
we go JDRF
that everyone who's watching this or
listening to this podcast should all
vote for the JDRF a real quick uh ed
maudlin at tech files did get he's he's
one of my best go two's whenever we're
doing one of these live he looks up
stuff away faster than lollipop was the
last official release for the for the
guy
yes so unless unless our
commander-in-chief is really up on his
custom I'm sure you know the secret
services it would be thrilled and our
security agencies would be with love to
have a president using you know a
smartphone with custom community built
software yeah lollipop wow that feels
like such a long time ago well it was I
mean you know this stuff cycles so
quickly and again we got a number of
people talking 24 months seems to be
like what should be mandatory even
though that's not really what we get for
for smartphone support it's you know we
have this idea of planned obsolescence
and commercialism and and and how these
products are sort of they sort of
encourage people to buy new stuff it's
more an emotional purchase than it is or
what yeah but I really do think that
even if the industry itself doesn't
motivate this change that consumers are
gonna start realizing some of the
limitations of how we're currently doing
business or some of some of the
downsides of how we're currently doing
business and and I think the the
industry will sort of chain the
consumers will sort of change the
industry around so hopefully yeah 18
months is really not a long time for an
$800 phone they should be supported I
feel like they should be supporting that
for at least like two and a half to
three years and again I don't think
anyone would would expect you know three
major number versions of Android as
updates yeah but when we see how many
devices are out in the ecosystem you
know again running lollipop and KitKat
and just just really really old gear
especially around the world this isn't
necessarily even like the first world
issue yeah helped developed issue I just
the notion that those phones are not
getting security updates I think is a
Windows XP zombie problem ready waiting
to happen um when we see the Internet of
Things
you know IOT devices getting hacked to
become bought armies I don't think it's
necessarily out of the realm of
imagination that that could start
happening to older phones - I mean I
hope it does I think that Apple is
actually one of the best in supporting
all their phones all right like I think
that they still support the iPhone 5
with I think and I think yeah the iPhone
5 has still been getting again more like
patches and bug fixes I do think the
iPhone 5
I don't know someone's someone's gonna
correct me because I'm probably wrong
because I don't spend a lot of time on
iPhones I don't know did the iPhone 5
get an official iOS 10 I'm not positive
I know that the six did but I'm not all
right hopefully someone teases us if not
I can look it up online but yeah I mean
notoriously though Apple is always like
actually done a good job supporting I
think that oneplus has not done a great
job supporting software I think that
they I don't think that they support did
they support the oneplus 2 still so
here's the problem
oneplus I you know if I were to try and
anticipate the response that we would
get in comments on one place it would be
that one plus past tense did a good job
of supporting me yes but the oneplus 2
is officially off the reservation
yeah unless - will not be getting a new
kit update and I think again that was
just a little uncertainty to throw into
that that enthusiast community you like
if I spend $500 on this phone am i only
going to get one major Android update
and it's impossible to predict
and that that make someone feel a little
shaky about a purchase of that magnitude
yes that's right that it's not on like a
monthly plan I think that I could be
wrong here but I think one plus you pay
full and you can't like you monthly
right I don't think they have any kind
of payment plan like I don't
yeah their own financing I mean and they
are cheaper than other Android phones
but the oneplus 2 I know a lot of people
still actually using it wasn't that long
ago no it really wasn't especially in
the grand scheme of
again it would be coming up on end of
life just in time for one last big
developer push to support it so that it
can go out gracefully but it doesn't
seem like that's gonna be the case we
did get replies from Renato Laporte and
Edie maudlin the iPhone 5 is apparently
up-to-date that it's not only on iOS you
can get the iOS 11 beta wow 5s that's
actually impressive props to them
especially because the I think the
iPhone 5 is still the best-looking
iPhone that Apple has ever created yeah
and I thought yeah the iPhone se also
looks like it and that's a lot newer but
she's obviously still supported but
hopefully we see a refresh of that soon
I don't think we will but Abby I don't
think we will I'll be curious to see I
wonder if the iphone 7 design will
become the the SE e oh yeah probably
know what I mean like so we'll get the
the iPhone 6 will be the sort of budget
phone the iPhone 7 will become the
mid-range price point iPhone 8 will be
$1000 plus yeah price of the iPhone 8
crazy you know it's making me nervous we
had someone else I I lost I lost the
tweet sorry but someone else was asking
about galaxy note the note 8 iPhone
$8,000 phones and I really want to see
what we can what we can expect in terms
of that consumer experience and how many
people are still likely to gravitate
towards a purchase that big on a mobile
device I just I have fears just you know
it's this lifestyle durability thing
like spending a thousand dollars on
something that's gonna be in my pocket
that's gonna get thrown around that's
gonna get messed up it's gonna get
scratched or dropped or kicked or you
know my daughter's gonna use it as a
freebie yeah I freaked out about like
what what does that mean for for the
future of premium high-end smartphones
especially if Apple releases the edition
and then a regular phone
as some people are kind of speculating I
think that they're gonna actually lose a
lot of people like I don't think a lot
of people are gonna buy like the flashy
good-looking phone I think a lot of
people can't really afford to do that
reasonably because to buy a
thousand-dollar phone and an upgrade in
two years or three years even it's a ton
of money to spend and even with the note
aid that's there'd be a ton of money and
it's gonna be hard I think especially
with the note Fe coming out I think it's
gonna be hard for people to justify the
note 8 over that well I mean the one
thing Samsung has going for them there
is like how few places have really
locked in on the fe you know like enough
enough sort of interstate commerce and
regulators or like it's an oak side and
nothing used to blow up yeah I mean I
don't I don't understand releasing that
again but you know if they've got the
shelves for it and they can make some
money on it I mean I get it
but for me I really think like it would
have just been best to kind of move on
yeah well Josh let it let it I mean
literally yeah let it die and focus on
theirs their recent successes with this
new s8 form factor and what that can
mean for the note but I've we've we've
been chatting for a little while here
we're getting close to that hour mark so
I kind of want to wrap this up but I
want to use you joining the show to do a
little bit of an experiment and
something that I want to play around
with more future tech tech reviewers
join the show so I want to put you on
the spot things we didn't prep prep you
for uh and rapid-fire three main
questions just to close out the show and
you got to give me your sort of like
knee-jerk reactions there question
number one what is the first app you
always install on all of your smart
phones ways ways question number two out
of all of the current phones that are
currently available for consumers to
purchase at the time this video was shot
if you had to spend three years with
only that phone what fun would it be I
say I say it I don't know software
support though it's a little bit I'll
accept
I'll answer and question over three what
is your favorite Italian dish pasta
