protruding camera lens rumors merge the
latest batch of smartphone surveillance
has a look at your gyroscope and sprint
and sharpen veil a true smartphone
without bezels I'm hi melody that I and
you know what they say if you can't beat
them grab a stick and try again this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
what's official is Sanjay and sharp and
I know it's hard to hear sharp in the
United States but they're big in Japan
and what company has of jeff's denounced
the aquos crystal and even though this
is a mid-range smartphone what makes
this device cool is that this is the
first device we've ever seen with no
bezels are on display it's actually a
very hot design for it to be a mid-tier
25 and 720p phone but don't let me boy
with specification looks in the
description watch michael fisher full
video coverage on what to expect from
this phone it's actually quite cool i'll
talk about skype that service that was
purchased but microsoft and hasn't
really gotten any better but the company
seems to have figured out something
right this time notifications on skype
have always been annoying because you
get calls on one phone and then it
brings on the other and then you've
already picked up but it's still ringing
on the other and it's just completely
convoluted and the company seems to have
figured out a way for the device to know
that it's being used for skype and
therefore you will only be notified on
that product or it'll figure something I
you should give it a try make sure you
update skype on all your devices and
give us a try leave us a comment down
below it says your experience and if you
thought security issues have ended with
the black phone trust me things are just
beginning there seems to be this new
report that apparently companies that
are interested in tracking what you do
can actually use the gyroscope as
apparently it is sensitive enough to
pull sound from ambience and know
exactly what you're doing by that now we
don't really know what companies do this
or what smartphones can actually do it
apparently all modern smartphones with a
gyroscope can but links inscription
reads steven's full article on this as
it is very interesting to see that your
microphone is not the only thing these
companies can use and currently you're
only being asked about the microphone
let's talk about motorola we know that
the company is planning to launch the
successor to the Moto X to the next
couple of weeks there is an event that's
already planned will see a new Moto G
the 360 and a pair
least something that has to do with
sound but even more interesting we've
got these rumors of the motorola quark
verizon and yeah sure it's a verizon
phone but what makes this device
interesting is that it's got much better
specifications than the successor to the
Moto X I mean the successor is planned
to bring up 1080p display Snapdragon 801
this device will bring a 2k display with
a Snapdragon 805 among other
specifications that are really hot so
could it be that this droid ultra
successor which could be the droid turbo
is what we should expect or could it be
that there is an even better Moto X plus
something and finally for the
interesting and sort of disappointing
news of the day we have to rumors of the
iphone 6 number one the hot one which
apparently there will be a protruding
camera lens on the iphone 6 which could
probably not be nice for a lot of people
but if you think about the recent pense
that Apple has where this protruding
camera lens could be used for
interchangeable lenses then the rumors
become hot though we don't know about
that that's just the rumor and then the
second rumor claims that there are two
display resolutions for the iphone 6
being tested with a microscope and
apparently both these displays could
apply to both different iPhone 6 models
the 5.5 into the 4.7 inch and with this
would lead to is similar pixel per inch
density than what we currently have with
the bread the display on the iphone 5s
meaning is around 3 and 55 to 360 pixels
per inch on each device which makes you
wonder exactly what Apple is doing at a
time when other companies are bringing
2k displays and that really leads me to
the question of the day and what do you
think about apples plans to continue
with its retina display again to play
display resolution is the thing right
now and you have a 5.5 inch huge iPhone
what you want is better media
consumption but leave us a comment down
below what do you think and please do
