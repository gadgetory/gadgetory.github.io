manager to help you recover your lost
phone the samsung galaxy note 3 gets
leaked in some odd photos and blackberry
seems to think that you want to porsche
a design on their next flagship I'm high
Meadow iveta and about the only thing
that I'm interested on with a Porche
design is my car for the weekend this is
parking out daily listeners day off with
some late product announcements as
Google has finally announced their
Android device manager you know an
application you can use to track your
phone if it gets lost or stolen it also
works on tablets from froyo on just
which to wonder what took Google so long
I mean apples been doing this with my my
iphone for the longest time windows
phone as well and even some third-party
applications for Android as well they
have to pay for in some cases and
anyways it's great that it's finally
here sadly you have to wait a couple of
weeks to get now let's talk about
blackberry as well some recent leaks
show is a blackberry z30 and as it turns
out it seems that this new phablet is
apparently going to be their next
flagship for some time in the holiday
season hopefully though we can
understand what's the difference between
that and the z10 aside from the size of
it then aside from that apparently there
are some leaked photographs of a
blackberry z10 porche design it's going
to have a different number obviously but
it's the z10 and just about everything
except the chassis so just wait for it I
mean porche design they're going to want
to charge you a lot of money nobody's
gonna buy it and for all seven of you
that were excited yesterday about the
Moto X well some new rumors have it that
the company is working on bringing a
google edition of this phone which I
can't understand since the google owns
motorola so isn't this a google edition
i mean this looks pretty much like stock
android except for the added features of
the wake up the phone with the ok Google
now command which imagine that I mean
you'll pay six hundred and something
dollars for a google phone google
edition and then you're going to be
losing all those features anyways now
let's talk about Apple as the new thing
in the rumors is that the next iPhone is
getting fingerprint scanning for some
reason we can't really understand that
as it turns out even though the rumors
have it that it's coming in the home
button the leak parts that we just got
today don't include any fingerprint
scanner and
where it's just the typical home button
but we all know that Apple has filed for
this pattern where the display the full
display is a fingerprint scanner and the
question is is that's what we're getting
and I still ask myself why and finally
for the hot and odd news of the day
we've got some leaked photographs of the
Galaxy Note 3 and they are kind of odd
because this device has squared edges
and we were expecting a galaxy s4 with a
much bigger size and an S Pen and that's
what we were expecting to be the Galaxy
Note 3 and we're kind of out trying to
understand this is a prototype or if
this is really the phone that's coming
squared edges on such a big phone
probably not the best combination but
etha and Berlin is coming in just one
month so stay tuned that is when the
Galaxy Note 3 will get launched but
anyways that leaves you third question
of the day are you waiting for the
galaxy note 3 is that a phone that you
want in the future in my particular case
the Galaxy Note 2 is one of my favorite
films of all time so obviously i am
waiting for it but leave us a comment
down below there's no what you think of
course as always for an early or scruple
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and top row be sure you
