Apple has taken the wraps off of the
iPhone 8 and the iPhone 10 juan carlos
paganella here for pocket now and let's
talk about the future of smartphones
this was the first Apple special event
held at their new camp is this beautiful
spaceship of a building and they had
numerous products to talk about the new
Apple watch series 3 the Apple TV 4k HDR
but we we want to talk about the phones
all of the rumors all the leaks
confirmed we will be getting a trio of
iPhones this year starting off with the
iPhone 8 if you were hoping for a more
progressive design over the iphone 6
iphone 7 iphone 7 plus you're probably
going to be a little disappointed the
general layout and form factor are going
to be very similar to the current iPhone
7 and iPhone 7 plus where the iPhone 8
will be a bit more progressive is in the
materials the phone's going to be made
out of losing the aluminum back panel
Apple's going to return to glass to
facilitate wireless charging on their
new phones Apple will be supporting the
Qi standard already being used on a
number of Android phones but of course I
had to put their own fresh new spin on
it with air power a special mat that can
detect different Apple devices to help
you wirelessly charge an Apple watch
three edition or your air pods in a
special new optional case while the
iPhone 8 design is starting to feel a
little long in the tooth there are some
new technologies packed into this phone
that we're gonna be really excited to
play with in the coming weeks a series
chipsets have always delivered
phenomenal competitive performance but
this new a 11 Bionic chip that's going
to be in the iPhone 8 sounds like it's
not only going to be a nice step up over
performance from the current generation
of iPhones but also help address some of
the power management issues we've been
having on the 7 and 7 plus 6 cores more
power but also a bit more battery
efficient of course putting lifestyle
durability front and center water
resistance will be returning and this
glass manufacturing process Apple touts
as being some of the most durable
material that they've made a phone out
of yet reinforced by a steel frame to
potentially head off any flexibility
issues on these new phones retina HD
displays are going to be getting a tweak
with this true tone color system where
it will sense the ambient lighting
around you and better adjust colors on
your display for a more accurate
representation
of your images and of course there was
plenty of hype surrounding the cameras
apparently the iPhone eights gonna be
getting new camera sensors larger
sensors but with the same resolution
similar to what we saw Samsung do with
the galaxy s7 and they're claiming that
this will allow the iPhone 8 to capture
up to 30% more light per exposure there
will still be the camera division
between the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8
plus the latter getting the dual camera
system which is not only going to
provide the portrait mode that Apple
helped pioneer but also a new portrait
lighting system those two cameras
working in tandem not just for depth and
background blur but also using really
intelligent algorithms to scan the
subject and use lighting to help further
separate your subject from the
background of course the big news the
big hype for this event
iPhone X actually being called iPhone 10
Apple's aggressive take on an all screen
phone - a little cut out for some
front-facing cameras
touch ID and the home button are gone
replaced by gestures any new face
scanning system off of a front camera
system housed in that black bar at the
top of the screen what this system is
going to do is create a series of
somewhere around 30,000 dots on your
face to really contour map and make sure
the phone can recognize you evil twins
might be a problem but Apple claims that
the false positive rate is significantly
higher than on a fingerprint sensor
somewhere around one in a million out in
the population the rest of the iPhone 10
front face dominated by a 5.8 inch OLED
display that Apple is dubbing the super
Retina display a non-standard resolution
of 24 36 by 1125 not quite the quad HD
that we're seeing on competitors but a
pixel density that I don't think many
people are going to complain about the
front camera and the surrounding sensors
dubbed the troop depth system will aid
in your selfie shooting by also
providing the same portrait mode and
portrait lighting found on the rear
cameras and by capturing that kind of
face tracking data natively on the phone
we get to play with some fun things like
an emojis animated emojis that map the
muscles of your face on to cute adorable
little animated creatures and a major
talking point for Apple this keynote
augmented reality the dual camera
systems on the iPhone 8 plus and the
iPhone
10 providing you real-world interaction
with data and services of course I had a
couple gaming demos on display some cool
ways to interact with characters on flat
tabletop services especially when played
against other human beings but one of
the more interesting demos focusing on
sports the ability to pull player
information while pointing your camera
out at a ball field or at a TV screen
showing a baseball game apples
aggressive developer support for
augmented reality and putting this as a
primary feature in a consumer ready
device as mass-market as the iPhone
makes it a really compelling option to
watch once we finally start reviewing
these phones iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 will
come in 64 and 256 gigabyte options the
smaller iPhone 8 starting at $6.99 the
iPhone 8 plus moving up to $7.99 and the
rumors were true
iPhone 10 is going to start you off at
$9.99 the era of the thousand dollar
iPhone is here the iPhone 8 will be
available for pre-order September 15
shipping out September 22nd where iPhone
10 is going to be available for
pre-order at the end of October shipping
out the beginning of November and we
have so many questions if face ID will
really unseat touch ideas the more
convenient and more secure biometric
security platform can Apple really move
the needle on bringing consumers into
augmented reality and are people gonna
complain about that cut out at the top
of the screen like they did for the
essential phone so I want to leave this
video off asking you all a question did
this event really capture the majesty of
the 10 year anniversary of the iPhone we
had a lot of callbacks to Apple
innovations of iPhones past and of
course the presence of Steve Jobs in
this new amphitheater I think was felt
by everyone watching the event you think
these phones would have made Steve Jobs
