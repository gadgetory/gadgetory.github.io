and we're going to look at a little tour
of the web browsing capabilities on the
t-mobile g1 so I go to the browser
whoops track bomb
a little sensitive sometimes
and hearing on the google homepage i'm
going to search for something local
and that didn't change much so we're
just type in
what I want
so say you get a text message someone
asking a question now where are we
meeting tonight or what time's the movie
start where do we get all that kind
stuff on Windows Mobile usually I just
do a search for the location and copy
the address into a text message to send
it right back to them so if I do that on
google android we get the address and
you can't there's no tap and hold menu
you can't select it you can click on it
and it brings you a map but there's no
way to copy the address into a text
message back to that person if you're in
a text field you can tap and hold select
all that too
anyway there is copy and paste
capabilities only if you're in a text
field press it back here and it doesn't
seem to want to go back
we also have multiple windows capability
was great so I can do a new window and I
can get back to google the back button
wasn't working over there and I'll go to
local again I pan something
that seemed to be doing anything
fairness
now we also have a express our menu
button at bookmarks
you can save our favorites
and we are connected to tmobile 3g which
is pretty fast that's good load the New
York Times
now you see scroll bars over there
indicators very thin at the side and
bottom so if you touch you can move it
and you see mankind glasses up here here
after you touch a move so say I moved it
right over there and I want to maybe
look at that once it goes away you
really can't zoom in anymore you have to
touch it again and then hitting a link
to touch and pan and then it goes back
and then you can zoom
but I already click on something so it's
going to a different age
so it's a little bit difficult as I do
now
still loading
if I press menu there's no button
presuming so I can't I can't access that
zoom capability with the keyboard which
is unfortunate you have to actually
touch the screen and get grease on it
I use the trackball I can scroll two
different links for some reason the
trackball is much more sensitive in the
browser than it is elsewhere the
slightest little movement moves it
further than you expect if I touch and
move again we got icons back there's
another one over here that's basically a
zoomed out view and you have a little
man find box right there if you tap on
the madman box you can move it around
this doesn't really work very well since
my finger covers up the whole magnifying
glass box I can't really see what's
under there what I'm looking for once
you're like oh it was a min
okay zooms been pretty good web pages
look good it's no double tap and it
doesn't fit to the width of the screen
automatically sometimes those are met
there's also a search bar really quickly
you can move ever get the search from
google more button now back and forward
menu buttons are buried however there
are shortcut keys as you can see they're
listed
and there's writing them that's how we
access it from the keyboard look at that
just what I was looking for 30
this is much easier with trackball now I
can see what it's looking at
so there's our web browser on the
t-mobile g1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
