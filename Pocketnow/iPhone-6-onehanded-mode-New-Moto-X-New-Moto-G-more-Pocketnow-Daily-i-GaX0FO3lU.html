have some sort of one-handed usability
Motorola unwraps its Moto X and moto G
for the love of the masses and Motorola
also takes its time to officially launch
the Moto 360 I'm high meddling that I
and don't forget that the first link in
the description leads to our full Aoife
2014 coverage this is parking out daily
yes Aoife time is official news time
let's begin with the moto 360 Motorola
just had its event in Chicago our own
Adam down was there and the Moto 360 is
out but the not necessarily right now
only the leather strap option is
available for 250 dollars which is a
great price tag and if you're interested
in the stainless steel variant you're
gonna have to wait until later this fall
and neither pay 80 bucks have you buy
the leather one or buy the stainless
steel variant later this fall for 299
and as it turns out it is almost
everything we expected metallic design
we have wireless charging it has a heart
rate sensor among other things and the
only problem is that Motorola tease the
better battery life and it turns out
that you're only getting 24 hours of
battery life which is terrible for
Android wear but so far this is pretty
much the best option for Android wear so
let us know what you think if you're
getting one now the only rumors we have
for today are Apple because obviously
their event is until September nine men
speaking of September 9 the rumors are
that apparently the ipad air 2 or the
next generation ipad and the next
generation ipad mini with retina display
will be announced on September nights as
well now this is the first time that
this would happen Apple has historically
launched its iPads and either februari
March or the fall in October and the
reports claim that apparently everything
will be announced on September nine so
there probably will be a lot to cover on
that date stay tuned we will keep you
covered and speaking of apple rumors one
of the biggest questions that a lot of
people are asking is how is Apple going
to retain its a famous one hand that
usability with a 4.7 inch iphone and
with a 5.5 inch iphone and reports
claimed that apple will give you this
optional one-handed mode for you to be
able to use your phone with one hand and
this is really interesting as Apple is
not doing this for the first time
Samsung has already done it it hasn't
been really
popular on the Galaxy Note wine and a
lot of people just you know given up
with the fact that if they want to buy a
phablet this is the compromise but it
seems that Apple wants to continue to
push this bar so stay tuned as we're
really curious as to how Apple plans to
innovate in that department now let's
talk about the Moto G and yes this is
just the Moto G no name change we have a
very interesting smartphone here
particularly because first of all the
price tag is retained and we have a 720p
display which is also retained but now
we have front firing speakers we have
options for 18 and 16 gigs of storage we
have an 8 megapixel camera which is
hopefully better than anything Motorola
ever done where you have to test that
but so far I mean this is a very awesome
way to start for anybody the Moto G is
probably one of those affordable good
smart phones in the market it doesn't
have meant to your specifications if you
judge it by whatever else you find in
the market for Android right now so stay
tuned as it should be launching very
soon and finally for the very hot news
of the day we have a new Moto X and this
is pretty much almost the same Moto X if
you look at it but then again it's not
there are a lot of enhancements here
first of all moto maker continues we
have front firing speakers we have a
Snapdragon 801 processor that still
allows for touchless controls and these
touchless controls will actually bring
you controls for whatsapp and Facebook
which is new in addition to other
changes like for example options for 16
and 32 gigs that are not expandable
sadly and then again we do have a 13
megapixel camera the back hopefully
better we have yet to test that our
review unit is already in though this
doesn't bring that optical zoom that was
rumored this is pretty much just the
same thing and we do have leather
options in moto maker as well apparently
the phone will be pressed for a hundred
dollars plus a two-year contract in
whatever carrier or five hundred dollars
up front but that leads you to the
question of the day is this the motorola
phone that you want the Moto X is the
phone that you are getting because in my
case you know I think I might take the
plunge for the Moto X's time especially
if they eventually figure out expandable
storage not not going to happen but then
again leave us a comment down below tell
us what you think I actually would
consider a Moto X now runs es you know
the drill if you want to get that was
earlier before this video was filming
follow us on Park
common strap trying to channel as well
it also follow me on Twitter hi
underscoring theta let's give this video
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I am
hi Mary better thank you very much for
