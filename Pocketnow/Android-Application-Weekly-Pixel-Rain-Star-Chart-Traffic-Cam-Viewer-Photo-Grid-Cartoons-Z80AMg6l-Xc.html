parking calm and this is another episode
the android application weekly in which
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get to it pixel rain is a
pre-application avail in the android
market so the option of the game is to
use these various items over here and
what you want to do is trap the money or
jewels so let me position one of the
monies over here so we'll slide that
money so it's able to go over there and
hopefully we can i get this one to go
over here and now i want to do is to
block in here so it doesn't get hit by
any of the pixels and hopefully were
able to do that and let's see oh it
wasn't able to do that exactly correctly
so we can always be try it okay so that
time i was able to block in the little
money so now i can move on to the next
level star chart is a paid for
application of ill in the android market
it will help you find which
constellations are in the night sky and
also which stars and planets are up
there so let's see if i want to zoom
into Saturn i can do that so it will
show me a little bit information about
saturn and if I like I can also zoom it
even further and if I use the
accelerometer in the night sky will show
me exactly where the planets stars and
constellations are so in the settings I
can change the display to have many
different views and I can also go down
here to the menu as well and also share
this constellation what I'm looking at
traffic cam viewer is a paper
application to build in the android
market they'll let you view traffic cams
at live feeds directly onto your android
device so here we can view some of these
live feeds and some of them update more
frequently than others so as you can see
this one's updating much more frequently
than the other ones here so if i go down
here and you also add no more cameras of
all you can manage my cameras and i can
add another one so if we want to add
this camera i can change the name of i
like it can also go down here and view
the camera live feed and also save it to
my current cameras photo grid is a free
application to fill in the aftermarket
but allows you to turn your photos into
a grid style collage so here if i want
to go to grid i can select how large I
want my grades let me just choose 6 and
I'm go to my downloaded photos so i'll
pick 6 photos here and i can just create
and now it will automatically create the
great photos and i can also shake the
device to have it rearranged na
their way so their sofa like this
arrangement I can save it directly to my
advice or you can also share with my
friends car change is a free application
available after market but allows you to
watch thousands of old cartoons directly
on your Android device so let's say once
you watch something let me search up
here for be here isn't like that so here
