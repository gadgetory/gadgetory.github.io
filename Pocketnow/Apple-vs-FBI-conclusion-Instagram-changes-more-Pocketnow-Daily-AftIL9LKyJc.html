to leave Apple off the hook with the
iphone 5c case instagram users freak out
so much what changes that the company
decides to pull back you might be
looking for some jail time if you're
glancing at your phone while you're
walking I'm hi meri behna and if this
video goes up early that's because I'm
walking like a maniac in Manhattan this
is parking out daily the official news
today are a major win to both encryption
and Apple as the Justice Department is
just decided to pull the company off the
hook Apple is no longer responsible for
figuring out a way to hack into the
iphone 5c in this case the FBI is
apparently going to figure out its own
way which in his way could mean good
news if stay tuned this the drama
continues to unfold and speaking of
Apple other official news have to do
with iOS 9.3 as the company has now
decided to roll it back out it's the
same number though the build is
different and it brings the fixes for
whatever you were dealing with some
customers were complaining that iPads
weren't able to activate themselves and
others had a brick because somehow the
whole night shift mode then really work
links to the description for more
details on what you're getting with this
update up so far hopefully this will not
bring more trouble now as an avid
Instagram user I am just shocked at how
much drama has been brought over the
whole concept of Instagram changing the
way the feed works now instead of
getting a chronological feed you would
get a feed designed by Facebook meaning
you know hey they figure out what you
like to see most and that's what they
throw first up to the point where users
began complaining and Instagram decided
to react apparently the changes will not
take effect tomorrow though apparently
they still will let's see how Instagram
plans to fix this or Facebook the new
owner now is t-mobile continues to be
disruptive we learned some very
interesting rumors apparently the
company is planning to launch a data and
text only service as of March 30th this
got leaked I'm not sure if this is a
control leaked or not but apparently hey
you could pay as little as 30 bucks for
only data and
SMS messages that's pretty much what
you're paying for apparently that's for
five gigs or four gigs I believe which
is not necessarily a bad deal if it's
prepaid stay tuned we should learn more
as this unfolds and finally a very
interesting news today have to do with a
bill that is currently passing in New
Jersey which if approved will bring some
consequences for all of us geeks who use
our smartphones on the streets
apparently if you are caught jaywalking
because you were looking at your phone
you could get fined up to 50 bucks which
is okay that's fine but you could also
be looking into 15 days in jail yeah I
think that's a little drastic I don't
think that the finest bad some people
could really get injured because they're
not looking to where they're going but
hey it leads me to the question of the
day what do you think about this whole
new jersey bill do you think that it's
fair for you to get fined or not in my
case I don't necessarily think that it
is mainly because hey I use navigation
all the time while I'm walking just to
find my way around here but I know that
for some people that's not necessarily a
good thing if they get affected by you
walking the wrong way but leave us a
comment down below what do you think
