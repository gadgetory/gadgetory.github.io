Xperia 10 no X included it seems and
well it's a breath of fresh air
new renders of the LGG eight think you
have emerged from have been blast
showing off the device in its full glory
and oboe just release a teaser saying
that they're releasing a phone with a 48
megapixel camera soon hopefully I'm hey
metal yvette up a happy valentine's day
for those of you celebrating for the
rest of us we're just gonna go party
single people
this is parking out daily the official
loose today begin with deals those of
you in the market to for pixel's
Google Phi has a couple of deals where
you can get even the pixel three and
three Excel for $150 off there is a
catch obviously you have to activate
them there's no such thing as a free
lunch in this life and well after you
activate them the problem the other
problem is the fact that there are
limited supplies so learn more in the
description and I'd get on it that pixel
for that price is not bad now let's talk
about Xiaomi as the company has just
released a teaser in the teaser we see
three camera lenses and we're assuming
that this is following up on the rumors
of the benign looks rather interesting
the specifications being rumored for
this device include a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 855 so it should be hot but
we'll see if we get into them WC as well
now let's talk about Oppo as let's
continue talking about teasers the
company has pretty much just shown that
we should expect the phone with 48
megapixels in the camera primary and if
I got this right it seems that the
selfie camera would be of 32 megapixels
all those huge on selfies they get that
really well so yeah it seems that that's
going to be the approach I'm really
looking forward to seeing what Oppo
brings as a hopefully that mechanical
camera also makes it now let's talk
about the LG g 8 thank you for those of
you wondering exactly how this phone is
going to look Evan Blass is at it again
we've got some leaked renders of the
phone it actually looks good it looks
like an LG phone I don't notice much of
a difference I thought I would see
triple cameras I'm well I guess we're
not getting them or this is just the
pre-render or whatever the case may be
now an interesting part is that the
company has teased that the display on
this phone is going to be the speaker
that's gonna be interesting we'll see
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with Sony I mean we were expecting
to see experienced new experience their
mid-range lineup usually gets announced
at CES it did not and now we've got some
leaked renders and they look like press
renders pretty much of a new experience
it's called the Xperia Ten it seems not
ex a which was the lineups name it's not
an egg's either dual cameras at the back
the display looks large it looks tall
really tall you remember there were
rumors of a 21 by 9 or probably
somewhere around there and the display
and you notice if there is a top bezel
but then there is none at the bottom it
looks rather interesting and the reason
why I chose to leave this as the hottest
news is because in today's question let
me know what do you think I mean there's
no notch here but you still have pretty
much no bezels at the bottom and looks
rather interesting to me and if that's I
don't know if it's a flagship or not
whatever the case may be I'm just saying
no X A's and CES so this is probably the
successor let us know what you think in
the comments down below do you like it
or not because I actually do friends
