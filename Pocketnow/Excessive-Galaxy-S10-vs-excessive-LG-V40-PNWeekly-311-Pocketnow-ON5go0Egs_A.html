alright we are here and it is live five
cameras on the LGV 43 phones with up to
three cameras on the galaxy s 10 has
progress in the mobile technology
industry just become a very simple
numbers game we don't have any idea what
to look forward to anymore as we head
into the fall and into next year with
the two tables but we'll talk it out
plus Apple is fluttering like a
butterfly over its MacBook keyboards and
hey can someone and I teach check out
what's wrong with a Seuss's website here
thanks that and all the news from this
week in mobile technology on this
episode 300 of the pocket now weekly
recorded live at June 29 at noon Eastern
this is the podcast that talks about
everything in mobile technology from
smartphones to tablets to smartwatches
and everything in between it's all the
stuff that you wished for as a kid
my name is Jules Wong news editor here
at PocketNow and I'm joined by our very
own editor-in-chief
Anton T Raj what's it going they're in
Romania Tony Thank You Jules good
morning good afternoon good evening
everybody it's been a while since I've
been here and it's good to be here
everything is fine and dandy and I can't
wait to share some some thoughts on
those cameras because they're quite a
few cameras too many maybe know we had
that light l16 once that had like 16 of
those things on the back it was very
weird but yeah this is going to be the
most that a major OEMs short minutes
time we won't like you there are social
medias you can put your comments through
with the hashtag P and weekly on Twitter
and we'll give attractive slide we've
got bones over here ready and go to read
out your areas and in the off times
between now and maybe the next show
we'll be answering your emails too if we
can get to them and that podcast at
pocketnow.com
again if you can't stay live on the show
for now then you can just put those
questions in later and we'll be able to
answer them hopefully get them in I
would like start off this week with the
Galaxy S ten I know that we've been
talking about the note 9 how there's
gonna be an event on August 9th we're
gonna be there but until there's
actually more news to report on that
because just having an event is it
really enough for us to talk about it in
death I want to talk about 2019 that's
again but before you do do you mind
telling our readers how they can win an
HP and the x2 yeah that's right freaking
like I should know better anyways we
have an HP Envy x2 to giveaway it's why
the always connected pcs that Qualcomm
and Microsoft will not to give and all
and I'm gonna have to add this the post
on the rundown here in just after the
show yes but I'm going to put in a link
for you to participate in this giveaway
it runs through July 4 11:59 59
eastern time and all you have to do is
comment on I believe it's Adams the
lanes review of the HP Envy x2 has some
flaw has some advantages we want you to
talk about how you know which featured
like you like and also we're in perhaps
you came from and if you heard about
this giveaway on the podcast will just
say you heard it from the part
and we we apologize for our
international readers or listeners this
is going to be a us only giveaway it's
it's beyond our control this is how we
can do it this is how we will do it but
we will have some other giveaways coming
really really soon to market now which
hopefully will be international so
apologies if you are outside of the US
and you cannot participant participate
but you will be disqualified sadly yeah
and I mean we handshake are in the
agreement we have to honor them and but
hopefully we will be able to marry you
so back to you the guts guest 10
apparently we're gonna get three of
these things not two three and kind of
be about two five point eight inch sizes
and then six point two very few million
your sizes if you're if you know but
another one saying oh it's gonna be five
inches here five maybe six inches here
and six and a half inches there I don't
know oh yeah why not just have the it
was gonna be one camera there's gonna be
a mid-level with two cameras and then
three cameras for the pro and I'm
wondering what this one in terms of
consumer choice in terms of what Samsung
wants to achieve in terms of just being
able to you know joke those demand in
terms of okay let's forecast which ones
should get the most supply I think we're
talking about a flagship and since we're
going to talk about a 2019 flagship I
think that the market is pretty much set
in terms of what we should expect what
the expectations are this year we'll go
with the Huawei P 20 and a B 20 Pro with
the LG v 35 with the q7 and he even with
the upcoming note 9 I mean for a 2019
flagship I'm not saying it doesn't make
sense to have three Galaxy S nines
because it really doesn't it will be
basically cannibalizing each other but I
really do think that a single camera
galaxy s 9 would make little to no sense
most of the flagships out there all of
the flagships out there have at least
two cameras going three makes sense if
that third camera is not a gimmick and
is actually useful and we can go into
details out how who always doing things
but I don't think that having a galaxy s
9 even if it's a 0 or a budget version
with a single camera would make sense
for Samsung as a business since we are
going to talk about a flagship phone
which defines the entire strategy for
Samsung all the way through the end of
2019 and the Galaxy Note 10
that budget particular budget of Orion
will end up being either a galaxy a
galaxy Y or galaxy something else and
the S will be as we know it today a 2
phone version e tufa move with the basic
galaxy s 9 having a jewel camera setup
and maybe the s9 + trying to tackle or
to beat the standard which Huawei set
back in March I think it was in March in
Paris with the p20 pro so that long
story short I think that it's going to
be a 2 version thing and that third
lower option single camera Bryant will
end up being some sort of other galaxy
that's that's what those are my two
cents I think that's definitely a fair
assessment of this will seem how a brand
can spread its flagship brand and we saw
that 2012 HTC One series it was the
it'll spread there with the wide-ass 1x
there were three yeah yeah but there
were three of them and it was kind of
weird to see all that and no one really
knew what was going on with those I
think maybe with Samsung where it has
more of that presence all around the
world at the carriers to that you know
you get the hands-on time maybe they
might they think they might be able to
convert more people with three options
that are under that very well mount
galaxy
s-line again I'm not sure maybe it's
gonna be another one of those J things
exactly my thoughts because the galaxy
Brandon ever since Samsung has started
pushing the galaxy brand real hard three
four years ago
the galaxy brand has has become very
much diluted there's galaxy s which is
the flagship there's the Galaxy Note
which is the full flagship and the niche
product and then there's a ton of other
galaxies from the a to the Y you name
them I can't keep condom
I think introducing more fragmentation
within the segment within the galaxy s
segment will hurt the business probably
not immediately because let's be honest
whatever Samsung is going to put out
there it's gonna sell like hotcakes like
millions just like with Apple and it's
good that they have such a good brand
recognition and brand loyalty but I
don't think that this is really what
they want to do they want to keep up
with the competition if if possible they
can or they can try at least leapfrog
them and right now we have 200 AP 20s we
will have two iPhones or maybe even
three who knows but those don't compete
with the Galaxy S line up so it in my
mind it just makes sense to be to go
with the tradition of having two s
phones and that's it I think we have
your coverage on pocket now already of
what the p20 offered for you but just
you know go for what you thought of that
triple camera thing was all about for
you I am surely you know that Adam Lane
has his thoughts on it yeah I even
before I actually published my review so
from the minute I laid my hands on the
the Huawei P 20 Pro I was in love not
with the phone per se but with its
multimedia capabilities when I'm not
managing the team I'm gonna have a
multimedia consumer I watch a lot of
movies Ellison's a lot of music and
they're not even going to talk about the
speakers which i think they're they're
really good the camera on the p20 pro is
so good in my opinion it could be worse
in your opinion it could be worse in
some other people's opinions I've heard
them go both ways some people praise it
something
we'll say it's not a huge thing for my
personal needs for what I used my camera
on my smartphone for the b20 Pro offers
me something that I haven't had had the
chance of using since the Lumia 1020 or
in general since since the good old
Nokia Lumia lineup I think that
regardless of the scenarios in which I'm
shooting it let it be handheld let it be
low light let it be portrait let it be
food or anything else it just delivers
the type of results that I expect from a
smartphone on which I know I can depend
before that I was a huge fan of the
Apple iPhone 10 because of the same
reasons I know the Google pixel is way
beyond the iPhone I I can say yes you
are right but I haven't had had the
chance of using the Google pixel because
here in my region it's not available so
it's safe to say that the p20 pro became
and it's right here with us let me take
off the the case which is really ugly
and I wouldn't be using a case if it
weren't this option this version but I
have to just make it uglier it became my
go-to phone and I haven't put it down
ever since yeah yeah we're down in the
port with the hashtag P and weekly well
far away slash honor knows everything
about fragmentation would you believe it
and it seems to work for them I mean I
guess they're coming from a different
culture Chinese is more spectrum and
they're more kind of a mob kind of yes
but but still translates worldwide
though still if you come to look at it
if you take a step back I'm not sure who
comment is who I'm sorry for not
shouting out your name if you take a
step back and you look at the big
picture
WOWY is just as fragmented as Samsung is
when it comes to spreading out the
number number of models that they have
they have low-end they have mid-range
they have high-end phones just like
Samsung has the galaxy ace and the Y's
and the rest who are we has the light
has the regular and has the pro so
within the family of the products there
is no fragmentation you will not see
three flat ships you will
probably to flagships the p20 and a p20
Pro the p10 and a p10 and the mate empro
and it can go long for a long time the
storytelling but what I'm saying is
there are models which are low-end there
are models which are mid-range and there
are flagship phones and that I think is
what Samsung base is going to do with
that particular zero level low-end
galaxy yeah that's my two cents in terms
of flagship kind of fragmentation you
know maybe that will be the case and
hopefully we'll get a cleaner look to
all this again months to go on this
story so we'll keep track of it because
you know we can I want to transition
here with this tweet from Andrew Wallace
greetings hashtag pen weekly I am
excited to see if LG basically combines
all the major implementations of second
cameras from wide angle to monochrome
depth info telephoto large sensor all
the stuff so that gives us chance to
talk about the LG v 40 where sources are
talking about this monster of a fall
time phone with five cameras and I feel
like the whole five cameras headline has
been kind of overplayed a little bit
because we've seen dual front-facing
cameras before it's mostly from LG
actually and we've also seen well--we're
it's kind of we're talking about it I
guess
triple camera setups at the back so I
mean that kind of sort of makes sense if
you want to drive home a very premium
product in terms of the Front's we got
what supposedly might be a stereoscopic
facial recognition feature where the two
cameras are just taking different images
and basically matching that to and if
the data they stored within and then
it's also the second the second aspect
to that which is the back LG is known
for its wide angle take on the second
camera we don't know what I'll do for
the third one so I guess first of all
what do you think Tony of that third
sensor maybe
just free blowing in the wind go ahead
so first of all let me try to take a
bird's-eye view on this entire thing I'm
okay with having multiple cameras I'm
okay with having four or five cameras on
a smartphone if the added number of
cameras is beyond a gimmick if it's
actually useful there's a very thin line
which manufacturers have to play or obey
or there's a red line if you will which
they cannot cross the more cameras you
add the more expensive your phone will
be but still if you are willing to take
that bet and release a flagship phone
which will be more expensive because of
the added one or two cameras you better
make sure that those cameras are
bringing value to your customers
you better make sure that people will
find the Edit camera useful beyond
bragging rights beyond the fact that you
will probably use them once or twice in
your lifetime and then just show it off
at the bar or at a birthday party so if
they're useful I'm okay with that
and now going into specifics yes LG can
have the liberty of attacking or
tackling the face recognition topic the
way they want to I mean apples kicked
this off in their own way and then
Samsung is going to follow suit and of
course LG needs to follow suit if that
means it's the risk of a camera for
better 3d mapping I'm fine with it but
the question is about that third camera
and we've recently had an advertorial on
pocket now which which pretty much
discussed and outline LG's mobile
strategy for this year and moving
forward to next year Jules maybe you can
drop a link in in yeah yeah definitely
gray no actually its I'm going to drop
your link so we'll have a link in the
rundown and you can see I really think
that LG is very much invested in AI you
can see most of their phones or the
least all of the flagship phones for the
best 12 months have the brand they think
you and I don't need to think about it
but yeah they're there they're going
all-in
in this AI / connected / / marketing
thing which is beyond marketing just
just don't think about the name thank
you it's a brand name which they came up
with think about the concept they are
willing to bet a lot on a time moving
forward and they are willing to bet a
lot on all of their LG consumer
electronics if you will from TVs to
refrigerators and washing machines to be
connected so with a third camera tackles
or answers an AI question an IOT
question in a meaningful way then I'm
totally fine with this because this is
where we are headed eventually if it's
going to be just another camera now that
LG has a telephoto lens that maybe they
will add a zoom lens it still will
answer some questions but I don't think
that that is that is something which LG
is looking for at the moment I mean to
be fair to every manufacturer all of
them are using 2017 hot buzzword of the
Year artificial intelligence to juice up
you know this aspect of the phone maybe
it's to get more services or to the tech
scenes on a camera like there they're
using it and they're I mean to the point
of abusing and it's kind of insane how
that has gone and no wondering when or
where this will go to next but I'm you
know I'm having a hard time trying to
figure out what the actual
differentiator is here in terms of how
LG uses artificial intelligence what if
there there will come and there's no
doubt about it there will come a
manufacturer there's just a question of
who and when who will manage to bridge
the gap between AI and a are a her I
know it's another buzzword everybody's
using it Apple has been embracing it for
the past 12 months now but there's
nothing meaningful nothing nothing
useful at least to me and maybe to you
it's another thing to show off but if
somebody can manage to bridge the gap
between AR AI and IOT in a way which
enhances my life everyday beyond the
fact that I'm pointing my camera towards
my food and it says food or portrait
something
is really really meaningful don't ask me
what because if I knew I would be a
billionaire now I think that that's
that's gonna be a win for the company
and I think that I think personally that
this is where LG might be headed with
the three camera set up on the back on
the front is pretty clear LG a are a IOT
by the way this podcast is not sponsored
by Campbell's alphabet soup could you
say hi to me for a sec I know that you
just hide to a Peter for a second happy
didn't because he says Peter hatin I'm
with Anton on lg cameras more cameras
need to make a nice product but we need
value could this become like maybe the
HTC One m8 which we all kind of feel
like didn't really provide value if that
DLO camera or do you worry that there is
a potential for all of these additional
cameras to remove focus away from key
areas such as battery line because
everyone's if you can't get the
fundamentals of a freakin smartphone
right and what right do you have of
giving us of promoting of driving all
this R&amp;amp;D and like shown to those as a
you know actual advantages actual
differentiators III agree with Peter and
I will go even beyond what he said I
think that we are right now in a stage
work in the industry regardless if
you're talking Samsung Huawei is Sony
HTC you name the manufacturer and even
beyond that Apple we've reached a point
where where smartphones are more or less
equally fast processors are fast enough
even even last year's 835 or 840 is fast
enough last year's Exynos is fast enough
we have four six or even eight gigs of
ram and thanks to Android and its
implementation battery life is good now
of course it's not multiple day battery
life but but most of the phones will
probably give you a full day battery
life having an extra camera will impact
little on battery life because let's be
honest the camera application you're
spending the least amount of time you're
probably spending time in a chat
application on your web browser whatsapp
is the messaging email and so on you
only you
the camera when the camera only uses
battery when you're inside a camera
application having said that if the
third camera with its aia our iot
implementation is something which is
always on which could be something
interesting if it brings value to your
life again it's also something which
they need to solve on a battery training
side of things so the peter agreement
yes so good value for the user hopefully
what has proven to be a very bad value
for us some users of their MacBooks and
not book pros is the butterfly keyboard
no mention so we've talked about a
little bit about this before but it's
just now this week it's come to a
combination so apple's finally they're
not in many anything they're just
offering up a out of warranty free
repair program for every MacBook and
MacBook Pro model that has this keyboard
with the butterfly switches which are
very thin scissor switches that are not
used very it's like like insect legs of
plastic basically I guess you know that
mechanism which goes like this
yeah yeah great for the great for the
listeners to do but it's guys you know
scissors imagine scissors but very very
you know thinned out and like we've seen
a lots of reporting I mean Casey
Johnston of the outline has been a great
sounding board on this in terms of her
editorial and her kind of just you know
keeping the story the spotlight on Apple
on this just going through have even as
a little speck of dust and it's you know
you would think that it's hard to get
dust or crumbs or anything into very
tightly compacted spaces but
unfortunately this has disabled many
keyboards and people have been
complaining and it looks like Apple is
listening but not really apologizing for
all right so well I went and I know that
you're actually looking for a MacBook or
at least I'm not computer right now Tony
and you actually
have experience with them while these
tell me about that let me try to play at
least for for a couple of seconds the
devil's advocate because again as a
hardware manufacturer just like with any
other manufacturer Apple is facing a
real dilemma which is to thin down to
improve to to make something better
thinner faster and so on everything
comes at a cost
slimming down laptops means not only
slimming down key components but
slimming down input devices as well that
being said let me ask you something back
in the day when we had those those
keyboards which had a key travel of at
least half an inch you could ruin even
those if you say you spilled some coffee
on it or stuff gets behind the keys so I
think there's a valid question here
which goes it could go both ways both in
Apple's favor and in against Apple
what's what's the line between a
manufacturing / designer fault and where
is the user at fault for something going
wrong or for something breaking because
if if you look at things in a bubble
that keyboard will probably last you for
10 years if you don't spill something on
it if you don't drop stuff in it
but on the other hand Apple for at least
a price that the premium price tag that
they are putting on these products they
should ensure I'm not saying idiot-proof
because that's that that would be that
will be too much they should ensure that
at least on a day-to-day usage on a
regular scenario their hardware stands
the test of time because things happen
you and I are basically media attack
bloggers I've seen most of tech loggers
working from trains from from parties
from phone booths from parts from
restaurants from coffee shops accidents
happen and to ruin something which costs
two thousand dollars just because a
bread crumb ended up in the wrong place
is I think a deal breaker for most and I
think that this is something which Apple
is really trying to address right now
they're trying to save the not
necessarily the product line but the
perception about this product
because if if things are indeed as as
the report claims and we've seen reports
usually exaggerated I'm not saying it's
exaggerated I'm seeing I'm saying that
there might be an upper tier for it to
be so but if it's true I'm saying that
word of mouth is marketing and bad
marketing hurts products so yeah there
has to be a minimum acceptable life
cycle for yes of the products and it
just I don't see under normal user
scenarios yeah yeah and you know being
fair to the consumer also is that dust
kind of you know is naturally occurring
it's one of those things that you know
it just happens to you know float on by
sometimes of course and what kind of
dist are we talking about because if
you're going to use your laptop in a
coalmine
he'll probably render it useless but the
regular house list or the regular city
dust I don't think that that should be
ever a problem and I don't think it is a
problem you're probably talking about
those foreign parts which are rather
sizable which which you can actually see
which end up being there as you said
breadcrumbs or or anything else I don't
have any experience with the butterfly
keyboard I'm wondering how you know that
gap is but you know it's it has it had
enough complete consumer against it to
have triggered some sort of reaction
from Apple's I'm not sure whether this
one I'm holding here is a butterfly
keyboard but this is the latest Apple
keyboard I don't see any way and I now
also I don't have the latest generation
MacBook so if somebody has it and has
this problem please drop us a comment
and let us know but I don't see any way
bigger parts ending anywhere in there
because there's no space you can't get
anything under education yeah so this
goes from the early 2015 MacBook 12 inch
models all the way through but on
everything at this point in terms of
nuts and that pros so definitely write
us in if you got any comments on this
and we'll move on to one of our kind of
night caps for
now recurring topics least as many years
past 10 years it feels like the past
forever in mobile technology Apple
versus Samsung is settled okay well yeah
but I feel I mean this I think this it
this is it they've settled it in terms
it's not another verdict that can be
appealed it's not something that has to
go under a jury again like freakin
Samsung made an appeal on its $539
million dollar damages verdict just last
week and this all stems from phones you
know Apple says that Samsung violated
infringed upon design patents that
related all the way back to new what I
phone the first galaxy s2 like it's kind
of amazing that that we're still looking
at this so um I want any quick eulogy on
this because we don't know the terms of
the settlement but we know that it's
over back when I when I was a news
editor I wrote at least one story a week
about the Samsung vs. Apple Apple versus
Samsung and with the risk of repeating
myself even though I will try not to do
so I would ask you just one question how
many ways are there to design a phone
nowadays and a follow-up question or
even a question which is going to try to
help you in answering that no you know
what actually I'm not going to help you
I'm really curious about your your your
response how many ways can you design a
smart phone say your Samsung is there
any way you can design a phone which
Apple at one point can say you're copied
it from me I mean we're going back to
2011 2010 it doesn't matter the old
phones had buttons back then on the
front and they had a scream they had an
earpiece they had a lead stair case you
could have a like a circle screen like
dream
you know there's a whole whole bunch of
ways I'm not sure like they had it with
freaking design time that cover it was
just art like every descriptive piece of
it and text it just referred to the art
it was self evidence that you know this
was what an eye friend looks like this
is what a colorful grid of icons looks
like this is what freaking you know
slide John Locke looks like which got
thrown out and you know there's a hope
that we found out a whole bunch of stuff
along the way here over the past seven
years but like it's I don't think I I
know think it was an argument worth
having I think in the end what we got
down to was you know the Supreme Court
he got all the way up to the Supreme
Court and then the Supreme Court tossed
it back and said okay so what is the
article of manufacturer that this patent
applies to the parts of the product or
the whole of the product and you know
that's rate determined damages now you
go and figure that out you know so I
mean I think I was the biggest question
that we were left with I am an Apple fan
but I'm not a fanatic Apple fan I use an
Apple computer I used an iPhone now I'm
using Android so I'm trying to say this
as gently as I can I think that this is
a non-issue I think that Apple
exaggerated with this lawsuit and they
dragged it along just enough for it to
make enough buzz they didn't do it for
the money they didn't do it for for
anything which is measurable and money I
think that this was a branding /
marketing campaign which was dragged out
for years and years and years trying to
generate trying to create a certain
mindset whether this was addressing
current Apple users that hey that we are
so much better than Samsung / Android
because they're copying us or they were
trying to address future Apple owners
that hey regardless of your middle of
Samsung they copied from us it doesn't
really matter
the fact that Samsung would tell you
that is just is just normal it's it's
common sense when you're being dragged
I'm not I'm not siding with samsung here
nor am i siding with Apple and trying to
explain that this was maybe in my
opinion a move from which both companies
benefited because of the entire media
talked about this and nothing else for
the past five or six years and beyond
the fact that they spent millions and
millions of dollars in in taxes in legal
fees and attorney fees those those those
are just pocket change when you come to
look at the grand scheme of things it
was a huge and long marketing campaign
on both sides and I'm just glad to say
it's it's over at least for now
and on this particular lawsuit because
there's plenty other lawsuits and there
can always be another one a cynical but
fair take on this I mean you're talking
about Samsung world number one in
smartphones in Apple world number two so
I mean they I'm not sure if they wanted
that and when they went into this
lawsuit but they got it so they played
along alright we'll take a quick break
and we'll come right back with more news
of the week they did introducing huawei

a Microsoft store near you today and we
are back with some more news of the week
just wanted to cover a couple comments
regarding the the keyboard issue the
butterfly keyboard on the Mac books sure
you're hatin that keyboard is indeed
butterfly switching keyboard the one
that you held up Tony
and does it have a lightning point for
what I yeah we're charging yes it does
it's MacBook has even less ki travel
than that keyboard so I mean it does use
the so let me just hold it back up cuz I
was holding the phone
hold on Twitter it's so thin that you
got to just gentle with it yeah because
from what he says from what Peter says
is that there's even less travel on the
MacBook so I mean there's more room for
more room for error more room for a
disaster and it's just yeah I mean it's
not good yeah so we have that and also
kind of another take on this word
without a report consumer electronics
giving up usability durability and
repair ability for the sake of design
true I nobody has ever ever set a bigger
truth than this who who was this
commenter reports which is from the
netherlands mister Laporte you are
spot-on
there's a saying if it never breaks
you're never gonna get a new one I mean
no company has whether they're making
smartphones computers even car
manufacturers if it never breaks if
something never goes wrong you will
never get a new one
their intention is not to build a
product which lasts your entire lifetime
their intention is to build a product
which fits the usual usage cycle which
could be one year two year four years
five years but then again something will
eventually break and Murphy said if
something can break it will eventually
break so they're just giving it that's
not that law is pretty peculiar Murphy's
Law yeah we shall move on and we're
going to talk about totally Google and
the choices that you made and have to
make come as far when we expect the
pixel three and pixel three Excel to
arrive and I want you to take a look at
the rundown link for this story take a
look at the video or not the video well
you can if you want but the
more importantly the pictures the
picture you have to see because these
are renders from on leaks Steve Harris
Topher from about the pixel 3 and pixel
3 Excel and they show both 2x1 displays
or extra tall displays but the XL is the
one as well the pixel 3 standard one
just sacrifices a little bit of bezel
room for just a plain old display clean
got nothing really happen over there
both of them have dual cameras and the
single camera at back which we have you
know Google has a magic into
computational photography for them going
but that dual camera system that front
were still kind of deciding what that is
so in all of that what do you think this
choice often if it's true before we go
into that conversation I'm looking at
the renders and on leaks is usually
spot-on of course
evan blesses is more spot-on but alex is
spot-on as well if these it's because
you don't want the beef to be coming
over here okay beef on Twitter
quite a lot okay I should I should be on
Twitter more so I apologize if I
offended anybody what I'm saying is if
the phones which Google is going to put
out on a market will be anything like
these two I'm looking at right now
they're both really really ugly and this
is this is just my personal assessment
let me tell you why I'm a huge fan of
minimizing bezels not going to
ridiculous about the lack of bezels but
minimizing them to a point where it not
it does not impede normal usage I'm not
okay I'm probably not going to be okay
with a full screen phone given that the
entire reason behind the notch and this
is one of the things I criticized huawei
for a p20 proform the reason behind the
notch is to minimize or kill the top
bezel or to give you the most amount of
screen real-estate possible now if you
look at the pictures that I'm looking at
right now you have a minimal bezel at
the top and you have a huge bezel on the
bottom I'm trying to zoom into the
picture I can see a line there it might
be a front facing speaker it might be
something else I'm not saying it's it's
not okay to have a button or it's not
okay to have a front facing speaker I'm
saying
it kills symmetry now in the case of the
smaller pixel which doesn't have the
notch it it has huge bezels top bottom
but at least it's symmetrical but in the
case of the pixel free Excel it's
asymmetrical and hopefully they will
come with an option to just conceal the
knob somehow and now after this long
intro which for which I apologize for
back to your question I think that via
the entire topic in the entire debate
behind the knotch is an on topic it's a
non-issue the notch is a non-issue you
get used to it eventually and it'll it
won't even take you that long to get
used to it
aside from Apple most manufacturers are
giving you options to conceal the knotch
if you don't like to have those Devil's
horns on the right and left side of your
display you can just conceal them with a
black band which comes optional if
within your settings and you only have
flowing text on a black bar on top which
is perfectly fine again the reason
behind the knotch is to give you the
most amount of screen real estate and
even if it's 40 or 50 or whatever pixels
wide it still gives you more real estate
for the applications to stretch the
cameras as much as possible so in my
personal opinion the notch is an on
topic it's a non-issue and the
conversation about the notch has to go
away because they're not just here to
stay yeah and oh I guess I'll play the
devil's advocate this time because if
you're watching movies and you're kind
of you're given the option to either
crop or zoom in or maybe just you know
view it as it is like I don't want to be
seeing all those blacks but I already
have to deal with the freaking a little
boxing just from the 2 by a-1 content
that has been well not 2x1 content but
16 by 9 in a 2 by 1 screen or whatever
the aspect ratio and the problem is is
that there's more black space and it's
growing and it you know if I really want
to you know have an unobstructed view of
whatever I'm dealing regardless of you
know it being an app for pictures or
just reading space like there's just a
whole bunch of odd you know like odd
crevices that I feel like don't offer me
anything in terms of the experience let
me counter that let me counter that and
I'm glad to say that finally Android is
is one step ahead of Apple when it comes
to this it's only on the iPhone 10 where
a full screen YouTube video has the cut
out if you look at it landscape because
of the notch because in the case of the
be pony bro
or in the case of the g7 thank you when
you do conceal the knotch and the
software applies a black or transparent
PNG on the top of the screen that is
basically your canvas and if you flip it
landscape it won't have the cutout for
the knotch
the content will stop where the not stop
so that will give you a rather
symmetrical fullscreen landscape view
with the bottom notch on the bottom on
the right side and when the cutout being
completely ignored on the left side
I mean you tell that to our super
enthusiasts that they're in our audience
here and it's kind of its kind of yeah
the same like I don't really you know as
long as I'm able to see it and with a
very decent amount of you know
resolution and size like I am perfectly
fine for it but it's just you know
sometimes you want to be able to they
want to push the the whole you know
illusion of like oh this is a window on
the world to something that you can't
reach but it's like it's I don't know
well I mean it's like it's your choice
your opinions so in hashed IP and weekly
on Twitter and we'll try and see if we
can answer it can we can we just
like five minutes or two minute brain
exercise like if you were to design or
any of our listeners were to design a
smartphone which would eliminate the
knotch but still maximize the entire
display and I'm specifically referring
to the top how would it be because there
are physical constraints
yes virtually display connector at the
bottom that that is the necessity for
the chin it has to connect back to the
motherboard so it has to fold I'm not
even going to go that far I'm going to
just stop at the top where you have an
earpiece which you have to have you have
a webcam which you have to have and you
will probably have a light sensor
proximity sensor and in some models
you'll also have an LED flash now where
do you put these five pieces of hardware
in order to eliminate the knotch
and still maximize the real estate
putting them on the bottom people try to
it didn't work so is there any other
option or at least I don't see any other
option until technology gets that far or
that good where you can just simply put
a webcam or an earpiece behind your
screen and then there's no problem
they put fingerprint scanners behind the
screen why couldn't they just put the
webcam or the earpiece even the earpiece
was completely eliminated by showing you
some connection yeah exactly you know I
mean they're they're getting their way
there but it's like they're imperfect
some some of them were in perfect
solutions because you know I've
experienced a boom kadesha where it's
like Oh some people can actually hear my
call from my vibrating cheaters I know
but I want to move on because otherwise
would be again we'd be sucked into
talking about this all day if you're
commenting please print out a
certificate and of your hardware
engineering degree move on with 30
xperia x ZT premium going up for
pre-orders July 9th I'm talking to Tony
here a falling away
Sony fan who again you know loves Apple
now or I guess there's always left Apple
but you know has all
have a spot I love I love both phones
what are you saying aye aye I mean using
a Hawaii p20 Pro as my daily driver
all right fair but you know we always
cast you as that Sony kind of yeah all
days when it was very underappreciated
and you know then I don't think it's
pretty underappreciated we saw we heard
that news this week of Sony bubble
falling out of maybe Turkey Africa and
Middle East markets do you think they'll
be generating more losses this time
around because this is the first I hate
like to think about it like this but
this is the first price increase for its
characteristic 4k phone in like the so
did the premium line has always been you
know there's been two previous ones and
z5 and then the x/z premium and but you
know we got 4k HDR on eggsy pre now it's
basically remained the same and then the
rest of the phone is kind of like well
we're gonna upgrade that with this you
know cameras slow motion or whatever the
heck and it's gonna be $1,000 that's a
25% increase from previous models what's
up what's going on so there's two ways
we can tackle this the difference
between the z5 premium and the XZ 2 is
$200 the question is is a faster
processor is a secondary camera and a
back mounted fingerprint scanner worth
$200 I don't think so but at the same
time we've been knowing Sony and I've
been as you said a Sony fan and I've
been following Sony since the early days
you'll have to take over just work up
definitely in terms of talking about a
whole bunch of improvements that we saw
the xperia x z2 we're talking about 960
Full HD slow motion ISO 50 1200 for
photo taking which you know
amazing of course you know there's
always that Snapdragon upgrade that you
have to consider because that's one of
the bigger cost ran apps in terms of
that but I think mmm perhaps this may
prove out true but the display because
we've seen kind of this pricing war this
cold war of displays of OLED and LCD and
you know just being able to get up to
quad-hd levels without having it break
the bank and there is some competition
in an OLED market right now but in terms
of that 4k not very very nice area for
Sony alright there hasn't been much too
many waves to talk about there so
they're kind of left alone and having to
support that but for that to justify a
$200 price increase I I don't know if
it's fair to compare that to the iPhone
10 we're dealing with a lot of the same
prestige modeling going on here but
you're getting face ID you're getting a
much more robust system of apps and how
much more robust system features that go
along with the hardware provided and
it's just well I don't know Sony is kind
of you know getting their stuff together
they're kind of mounting their stands
but they don't have it i define II don't
have a castle yet for that sad you're a
hero Jules and I I apologize this is
what happens when you broadcast at 8
p.m. from your home office and there's
speeds a delivery at your door so I
apologize coming back to you - what what
I was saying I've been following Sony
since since the really early date and
Sony has always been a company just like
Apple which was not afraid to charge a
premium just because of its branch is
because it has Sony honor the same way
Apple charges for the Apple logo Sony is
charging for the sony logo and it would
be an understatement to say that the two
companies are not doing the same thing
because we know that Apple and Sony were
I'm not seeing really close but Steve
Jobs who
always finding inspiration from Sony
products so there's that Sony can charge
whatever they want for a premium
smartphone does that smartphone deliver
does the smartphone the differentiate
itself enough to justify that $1,000
price point to some it might to some I
mean if there's the iPhone 10 let's be
honest the iPhone 10 is not worth its
price that so we are in an era where
smartphone manufacturers create niche
products which become status quos which
because comes status symbols if you
don't want to have a $1000 phone to show
off we have cheaper phones as well but
if you afford it or if you want to be
able to show off that you are rocking a
1000 plus dollar phone we have that
option as well if it's aspirational
product exactly it's something which you
you are not afraid to pull out in public
workplace on your table and people will
immediately know that you're a huge snob
and if you're all right the fact that
now you can go ahead and continue eating
that caviar right there absolutely but
nonetheless sony sony flagships were
always were always great exceptional
phones I always held so many close to my
heart despite of all all their efforts
in in trying to shoot themselves in the
foot starting from the lack of us
availability to us availability without
the fingerprint scanner and all the
other problems which they faced during
the years especially the headphone
volume and other multimedia stuff Sony
phones are solid phones so if I win the
lottery and Sony doesn't send me the
next e24 review I will probably buy that
phone because because what I'm a Sony
fan to it looks good and three it's a
Sony brother so sony brother I'm not
saying Samsung or hua we are less
premium products when it comes to build
when it comes to quality when it comes
to performance I'm saying that having
the Sony phone a Sony flagship in my
book at least for me personally means
something to me
totally fair I agree in terms of the
whole
a evaluation of how Sony has tripped
over itself over time but you know
recently they've rebuilt themselves
they've gotten focused with that X or X
Z whatever they want to do with that
brand yeah and you know kind of built it
up and involve their design it's
something that need to be done I feel
like they're following a trend whether
it's ill-advised or not of you know
prestige pricing but I feel like you
know if they don't follow then it's kind
of I mean just I'm looking at the render
from the article you learned it's
beautiful I was there in Barcelona this
year I saw the presentation Isis I saw
the phone but just looking at it it is
beautiful now you can of course argue
about the huge bezels which is a
signature of Sony and they should ditch
it then you can argue that the Samsung
the Huawei the HTC the you name it looks
better but but it is a really nice
looking phone at least to me a couple
more stories here as we wrap up the show
talking about oneplus perhaps coming to
the u.s. with carriers we already know
that they sell unlocked to 133 ish
markets around the world and they've
recently started moving into Europe Oh -
in the in the UK has been a partner for
a couple of years but more that seems to
be happening there's some momentum going
on in peat now in a recent interview
says that he might be able to bring
something to US carriers by next year
when 5g rolls around and of course
they're on the Qualcomm train so you
gotta say they obviously have the inside
track on this but whether or not they're
able to pull off all they want all what
pete lau wants is a question here
because he says that they're gonna be
there's going to be no bloatware and if
there's anything that's a small brand
we'd like to push and if there's
anything that a carrier can hold over
that brands head it's gonna be
pre-loaded software whatever out doing
whatever services they have read it ATT
directivity now
or whatever the heck their plan is these
days because they keep updating in like
five times a week or Verizon which has
its you know which recently actually
announced its shutting down go 90 its
own streaming services it but they still
have a whole bunch of these stupid like
a GPS navigation services they still do
it's kind of weird but I'm wondering how
realistic you think Liao's goals are
here being in this business for more
than 10 years in in the tech journalism
sphere gives also gives me also the
opportunity to be some sort of analyst
even though I hate that word but I have
an analytical view of what what is
happening in the industry and I've
learned to see beyond what companies are
trying to say behind the words to be
honest I don't think that oneplus really
stands a chance unless they managed to
get some carrier back up bear with me
correct me if I'm wrong but as of the 1
plus 5 so three generations ago we are
at 6 now it was the 5 T and then back
starting from the 5 it was no longer
about giving you a flagship killer at an
affordable price the prices of these
phones went higher and higher with every
iteration up to a point where yes you
get more bang for your buck but that
buck is still going to burn a hole in
your pocket now I'm not saying that
oneplus is suffering in terms of revenue
income turnover or units sold
they are steadily growing but name one
company which doesn't want to grow even
more and with the prices of their phones
going higher and higher which is both
the trend in the market and also because
of the prices of the components it
doesn't really matter why a more
expensive phone will probably sell less
units but even if it sells the same
amount of units or somewhat more units
your revenues will be higher but why not
sell twice or three times as much by
having a carrier subsidize your phone
and we know very well that in the
it states if you are not a carrier if
you're not the manufacturer which has a
deal with a carrier you basically are
going to fail to succeed Apple is always
releasing its phones on carriers and
only then two or three or four months
down the road offering you an unlocked
option so who all we have real huge
problems even before the ban because no
carriers weren't there to support it now
oneplus might sell millions of
smartphones in the US for those who are
willing to pay outright five six seven
hundred dollars with what if you could
pay those six seven hundred dollars in
12 or 24 months installments or why
wouldn't your carrier subsidize half of
it which automatically makes your phone
more accessible to the masses and I
think that this is going to be the name
of the game for oneplus moving forward
they proved themselves they we know they
can make exceptional smartphones sadly
it comes with a cost like I said every
smartphone in the past three years or
two years from one plus is getting more
and more expensive they're trying to
counter this by concealing some of the
costs which you will be paying for of
course but you will be paying for it in
installments to your carrier it'll be
cheaper on a big per month basis so it
means it will be more accessible to
people that's what I think that's what
I'm taking out a little is totally and
he also mentions that you know hopefully
that he is able to get more hands-on
experiences at the carrier stores
absolutely a lot of people our families
go over still go over to the carrier
store to feel out what they want for
their next upgrade so having a very or
store or a pop-up store and even within
within a carrier store the placement of
your products and the dedication of the
sales crew of the sales team everyone
main tell matter can make or break skip
yeah and I just you know I mean one plus
the latest carrier to not carry om -
it's like the Chinese OEMs are feeling
like they there's an added sense of
urgency to move to the US to grow and
you know hit the when the most valuable
markets and smartphones because Xiaomi
is
talking about it they have they're
saying that again 2019 ish is what
they're saying Huawei and it tried and
it can't because CTE as well CT as well
the government Donald Trump doesn't
really like them they sort of like them
they don't like I don't know what's
going you know without going into
politics because because I hate politics
and you don't have to be from Romania
Hungary Europe the u.s. to hate politics
we all hate politics but here's here's a
question how will this new
administration's policy affect other
Chinese manufacturers I mean you cannot
or at least in my book of common sense
you cannot discriminate between one
Chinese manufacturer or two Huawei and
ZTE and another Chinese manufacturer the
1 plus or or Xiaomi of course you can
because you're a politician but but
judging by common sense either you are
going to say the same speech and you're
going to apply the same measure to all
players in the market or you you're
going to differentiate and you're going
to introduce some sort of arbitrary
decisions this is just a rhetorical
question I'm saying that the oneplus
might or might not have the same
problems Huawei and ZTE have been facing
in the past 12 months I mean it's all
but tactical in the trade you know I
guess we could call it the trade war in
terms of China and the United States
yeah yeah exactly steel agriculture
smartphones and you know they're
actually talkin tariffs application from
the US well the US side talks about PCBs
and whatnot so and that's in pretty much
every single electronic so including
apples we're paying for it that's yeah
that's politics okay
that's way to take the wind out of that
one but anyways let's bring ourselves
back up and we find him that we can
laugh and point out I don't want to live
I want to spend I want to spend $2,000
on this phone
really want to spend more than I would
spend on a niche force design smartphone
$2,000 for a snapdragon 845 phone and
it's not even that's but it's the Asus
zenfone 5 Z it was kind of like that one
of the first like big announcements that
Qualcomm wanted to make saying that in
oh it's the first one
and yeah $1,999 this starting price says
and that you should subscribe now in
order to get notified of when it's gonna
watch the problem is and then you find
stuff here I think Asus zenfone 3 looks
and feels twice its price Asus zenfone 3
crammed plenty of great features into a
new glass clad chassis these are all
reviews they're videos links to videos
in the thumbnails of those videos are
showing off zenfone 3 material which
launched back in 2016 so man I mean if
this is a mistake if this isn't like
someone that was like too lazy to like
cut from their copy paste file like I'm
looking I'm looking at the official
issues page which is sourced in in our
article which seems yeah it seems nice
and it seems finally finished I'm okay
with companies doing minor mistakes if
they're innocent mistakes somebody
somewhere didn't do their job they
probably I don't know got fired or not I
don't think this is such a huge issue
these and the seuss in general and the
zenfone 5 is an awesome phone is it a
$2,000 phone
of course not did somebody make a
mistake was somebody lazy did somebody
not push the update or publish button
absolutely but I think that the entire
media us included up to this point we're
making too too big of a deal out of this
yeah totally and you know maybe it's
gonna be like between 650 and $800
something like that let's like that's
beyond the point out you and I you what
I were in Barcelona when when they
launched this phone yep yep and
it was I don't know if they give it your
value for it I don't think so I don't
remember yeah but it's talking to the
fact that it's a great phone it's not a
$2,000 phone but it's right there in the
six to seven hundred dollar price tag I
guess you know if you're gonna go if
you're gonna you know support your
device you guys support it in marketing
you don't promote the zenfone 3 when
you're trying to promote the zenfone 5
Rosie and you you got to make sure that
this kind of stuff because if anything
if you're a smartphone if you're a tech
company you have a web presence and
that's the most important to maintain so
come on do better bases next tools and
the best let's say only three years how
many press releases slash launches /
official wordings
with mistakes honest or not planned or
not have you seen on average I don't
know too many to count on my hands so I
say it's it's an honest mistake and we
shouldn't move on without trying to cut
this hangout short this is totally just
a couple more P and weekly uh talkers
here from Hollywood yeah totally
do we even really care about having
absolutely no bezel the asinine looked
perfectly fine to me just move the
fingerprints under through the middle of
the back and we're good
we Tony and I I would say are in
agreement with you Mike and I guess
there's there definitely some
complications as to where that
fingerprint sensor could be placed
there's a jigsaw puzzling components
yeah behind behind the screen yes Andrew
Wallace Sony should honestly bring
on-the-go streaming of PlayStation
content to their device word yes yes
Steven steam link is not enough I love
you valve but more please and also fix
your freaking cross-play issues man I
know II didn't Microsoft had the same
problem with the Xbox and Windows Phone
yeah and but like I get like fortnight I
don't know if you've heard about this
this online game called fortnight but
now I've been living in a bubble well
okay it's the biggest thing to blow up
since I don't know pub G or whatever my
kids oh c'mon
yes yes and like they like the Microsoft
Xbox account was like tweeting at the
Nintendo's twitch account because
Nintendo's which recently announced that
that frickin fortnight was available to
play for free online right now and they
were like oh the wonderful things we can
build together because they're able to
cross play with each other but not Sony
I don't know what's up with that
um so damn it do better and a couple
more two more the problem with one plus
we ran out a report says is that every
phone with the exception of the pic
though an iPhone will drop prices like
crazy after a few months of release here
in the Netherlands you can buy already a
oneplus with three of the four major
carriers but still a huge device which
again goes to how much progress they've
made but it's still kind of the your
point about emphasis about you know
staffers and and placement and whatnot
just getting into how much encouragement
you know there's there's a love and hate
there's I'm not sure let me let me check
who who was this person who commented
this it was uh it was renato yeah so
there's a love and hate relationship
with with with commenters which which
are smart and i love them because they
not only think the same way we do they
are unbiased and and well-rounded enough
to draw the same conclusions but when a
commenter states an absolute truth you
as a podcast host or guests or co-hosts
bow down yes and it's checkmate you have
nothing to say like you're right that's
it done and one more from peter hatin do
you think that there could be more
benefit from the growth of one-plus
pop-up stores where other than expanding
in the carrier store because if people
see something different in their city
might they not be better reminded of
this new brain
what they lost a lot they cost a lot
you know stir Xiaomi has been very crazy
in terms that they opened a 24-hour
store in Moscow so and that is not a you
know no small change unless you're
Samsung and you can buy rent or lease
real estate right across the street from
every or most major Apple store for your
own pop-up store unless you have
billions of dollars or you and sorry go
ahead
well I was just about to say they only
have like the two like two or three
stores that are like major experiences
around the u.s. and again they are you
know the number three or number one name
the Pentagon who you ask in terms of
smart phones you're it's it's dissonance
your best bet is to strike the deal with
a carrier and that carrier already has
brick-and-mortar stores that carrier
always has phones on display because
it's a carrier and you want to sell you
the phone so that you can use their
services so if you strike the deal your
best bet is to strike a deal with a
carrier and have a small corner or a big
corner depending on how how much you're
willing to cut their check just for for
them to display and promote your product
but that is the cheapest and most
effective option whether it's in the
states in the U a show or anywhere else
