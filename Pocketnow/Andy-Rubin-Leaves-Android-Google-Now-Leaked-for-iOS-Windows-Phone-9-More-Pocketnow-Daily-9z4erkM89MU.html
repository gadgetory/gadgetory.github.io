Andy Rubin moves on we've got Microsoft
already bringing Windows Phone 9 testing
and Google now makes its purse lead
appearance on iOS I'm Raymond Rivera if
you're wondering why beer is not free
well it's kind of cheap in my country
this is out daily well that's
the normal thing for operating systems
to be tested a long time before they
actually get launched and such as the
case of Windows Phone 9 is apparently it
is being tested at the moment on current
generation hardware obviously in
preparation for newer generation
hardware in the future and it's kind of
interesting since Microsoft usually
announces everything first and then
actually works on it but this time
they're doing things right so go to see
you Microsoft let's hope we will see
Windows Phone armed with something
really compelling by the end of the year
speaking of Windows Phone for those of
you that were left curious about the
Nokia Lumia 928 that was leaked
yesterday the first metallic Lumia to
reach the Verizon network well we have
the first photograph of this phone and
it does look very crisp a la Nokia Lumia
920 so we are expecting a flagship to
make it to Verizon very soon though
obviously we don't have any dates so far
sadly the photo was pulled but we have
it for you obviously so stay tuned on
more rumors now let's move over to
Google glass we know that that's either
the best thing to happen to tech in the
next couple of years or the biggest and
most expensive gimmick we've ever seen
and as it stands well we have seen a
presentation in South by Southwest of
Google glass actually integrating with
Android applications an example is you
take a photo and then you do the simple
things on blast but then you do the more
complex things on your phone like
editing the photo on Android it's
actually a really compelling feature but
we do hope that they figure out that
$1,500 price tag in the future now let's
go through some more Google s Google now
the crown jewel of jellybean has
apparently leaked for iOS yes there was
a YouTube video recently showing off how
it works on the iPhone and iPad and even
desktop computers so it does make you
wonder I mean it's actually cool to have
Google now on iOS devices though it's
going to be kind of awkward to actually
have to launch an application for that
to work but still what can we expect
from Android
five at the crown jewel of jellybean is
going to iOS it's got to be something
awesome and it's gotta be better or at
least cheaper than Google glass and
finally to be oh wow news of the day
there has been a big shake-up and
leadership and Android in Google
obviously where Andy Rubin which was not
only the VP but actually the founder
designer and pretty much maker and
father of Android is now moving on to
another department within Google and
well the Google Chrome VP is now going
to take over as the head of Android and
it makes you wonder I mean Chrome OS
hasn't really take off as well as
Android and then we have the Chromebook
pixel which is actually the most
expensive gimmick in history after
obviously Google glass you'd wonder
what's going to go on with Android and
that leads me to the question of the day
are you happy or sad about this move
from Andy Rubin historically it has
never worked
meaning when Steve Jobs got fired from
Apple it went downhill and then when
that cool again from Palm was either
fired or moved on well the palm actually
went dead and we've historically known
of different cases where when the father
of any project moves on nothing actually
works but hey we could see an exception
for the first time even though the
Chromebook pixel doesn't really give me
a good vibe so leave us a comment down
below what do you think of course for an
earlier school if everything is
happening in the smartphone and tablet

smartphones of the year and it's also

Thursday March 14th at 7 p.m. Eastern
