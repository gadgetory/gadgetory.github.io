Samsung's unpacked press conference for
the Galaxy S a was a little light on the
tech specs the phone will use an unnamed
10 nanometer chipset for example and the
main focus was of course on this big
bold new display but you know I'm a big
old camera snob and not a lot was
mentioned about this hardware
maybe because not a lot seems to have
changed this wouldn't be the worst news
in the world as the galaxy s7 remains
one of the most formidable mobile camera
players on the market today taking a
look at the Galaxy s8 we're looking at
the same snappy software paired up with
a four by three aspect ratio sensor now
this looks a bit strange on such a wide
screen lots of empty space around these
controls and sliding menus in landscape
mode is a bit of a reach the collection
of installed camera modules is the same
to a pro mode select a focus panorama
slo-mo etc the pro mode still provides a
nearly complete collection of photo and
video settings though this is a perfect
example of how Samsung could have
utilized space better shifting these
sliders off of your viewfinder digging
into menus these still remove you
completely from your composition window
this is still my most common usability
gripe with Samsung software I'd still
like to have a sense of what my cameras
being pointed at even when I make these
adjustments and also while looking at
video there's no option to create a
cinema wide which would use the full
length of the screen we have the same
video options for 16 by 9 HD and UHD the
newest additions for the s 8 are fun
features like slapping snapchat style
animal faces on your videos it's a fun
add-on very well implemented but does
little to change or improve the core
photo or video experience maybe the
biggest positive change has little to do
with image creation and more to do with
aesthetics as we're very happy to see a
nearly flush housing on the rear of the
phone maybe not a terrible idea to
include this lip around the camera to
prevent any scratches from that rear
housing hey did you know that the
average cloud weighs 1.1 million pounds
we'd like to thank our sponsor D brand
for reminding us that if all the fluffy
looking clouds in the world fell on us
at once we probably wouldn't have a
society and we certainly wouldn't
have the Galaxy s8 I'm pretty sure it's
not rated for that kind of water
resistance this bizarre ad and our
Samsung unpacked event coverage is
brought to you by V brand check them out
in the link below will of course be
running the Galaxy S a to our full real
camera review but our early prediction
we're expecting photo and video
performance fairly similar to what we
saw from last year's phone this tour was
done on a pre-release device so we might
see a few of the software issues
addressed for the actual release and of
course we want to hear from you what are
you hoping to see from Samsung's camera
this year are there any features you'd
like us to take a closer look at drop us

coverage including reviews and
