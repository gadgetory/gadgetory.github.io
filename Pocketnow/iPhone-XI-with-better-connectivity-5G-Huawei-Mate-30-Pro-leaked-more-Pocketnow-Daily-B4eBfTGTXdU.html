give you better reception while indoors
and how it should work we have an
alleged spec sheet of the Huawei make 30
pro and it looks like it'll be 5g
capable and there's a huge list of new
features that might be announced at WWDC
I'm Hema Rivera and I have no clue why
Google wants us here so early there's
only one way to find out
this is pocket out daily brought to you
by the oneplus 7 pro the official news
today I begin with deals if I'm not
mistaken Best Buy Amazon have events for
Apple deals even be an HS some I hear
$50 off Apple watch series for which I
do recommend I hear that the nine point
seven inch iPad is pretty much ship for
$250 then we have $250 off MacBook Pros
it's a long list you can learn more in
the description now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy Note intended to hear
leaks as to what to expect for this
phone one of the things that we hear is
going to change is fast charging
capabilities for the longest time I
believe that Samsung remains locked at
quit charge too for reasons we don't
understand because the Qualcomm chips
they have are capable but then the other
processors the Exynos processors are not
I believe so it seems that the note
whatever the name is going to be is
going to bring 55 watt charging
capabilities I'm not sure if it's gonna
come in the box but finally Samsung
welcome to 2016 now let's start about
WWDC we've got mark Germann making
predictions over what to expect for the
event we hear significant changes to iOS
particularly a dark mode a sleep mode a
separate app store for the Apple watch
we hear that there's gonna be a full
read m2 messaging to make it look more
like whatsapp that there will be
significant changes in to how the
operating system works with like for
example a monitor for iPads a ton of
things there's a long list I'm not gonna
bore you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about the
huawei mate 30 probe rumors have already
begun and it seems that this phone is
going to be the beast that's expected 50
to 55 watt charging and I just talked
about this for the Galaxy Note 10
but in addition to that the quad camera
array that we see for the p30 Pro in
addition to a new display by BOE we hear
that this phone is going to be 5g
capable or at least one of the variants
we're not exactly sure which one
obviously we expect this phone to launch
in the fall so it does make all the
sense in the world for it to be the 5g
phone for Huawei whatever the case may
be we'll keep you posted
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with the iPhone 11 I guess and
predictions from Ming Chi quo as to what
we can expect for connectivity obviously
one of the biggest deals right now is
the whole fact that Qualcomm and Apple
are now getting along but now we also
hear the we'll be you breathe them to
the antenna system and the whole purpose
is for the phone to actually perform
better indoors because I don't know if
you've noticed but iPhones aren't
necessarily the best phones when it
comes to signal reception indoors so
yeah apparently there's a full revamp to
this in addition to other changes and
how the spectrum is going to work for
this phone to perform better let us know
in the comments down below iPhone users

performs when connected to the network
