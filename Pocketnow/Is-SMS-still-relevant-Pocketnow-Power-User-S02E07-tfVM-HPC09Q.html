communicate with one another using our
smartphones today many of those use text
I'm Joe Levi with pocket now today we're
going to talk about whether SMS is still
even relevant SMS or short messaging
service grew out of the GSM standard the
global standard for mobile
communications now of course that's not
the actual acronym but that's
essentially what it means in addition to
these voice packets there are other
kinds of data packets that fly across
this network as well there's internet of
course and then there's overhead now
this overhead is essentially your phone
talking to the towers around it and
saying hi Here I am here's my imei
number and just let me know hello how
you doing the towers then respond with
kind of the same thing but they include
some information back like signal
strength directionality kinda sorta and
other things that are necessary for your
device to be able to connect to the
network these towers then communicate
with one another and one tower says to
another tower this guy needs to talk to
you now I'm going to hand him off and
there you go so that way when you're
driving a car riding a train whatever
the case may be your call doesn't drop
when you go from one tower to another it
facilitates that handoff those packets
have a secret little hidden spot at the
end that's 128 bytes long and for the
most part empty okay it's not much of a
secret that's where all of our text
messages go but 128 bytes isn't all that
big but when you think about it if
you're not sending a text message it's
wasted space it's just empty but it has
to be sent back and forth so why not put
it to use text messages do that like I
was saying 128 bytes isn't a lot but if
you use a special alphabet that has
seven bike characters you can fit up to
a hundred and sixty characters into that
message that 7-bit alphabet is the GSM
standard for texting it's not enough to
accommodate all languages some languages
require 8-bit character
in which case your message is reduced to
140 characters other languages require
16-bit characters in which case their
text messages are only 70 characters
long that sure seems like an awful lot
of complication just to get a short
message across and really since we've
got the internet now with a whole bunch
of other services that we can use to
send and receive messages using text why
do we still have it around it's a great
question and one that pocket now reader
Alex s brings to us he says my question
came to me the other day when my friend
texted me and later got mad at me for
not writing back i was using facebook
Messenger and Google Hangouts that day
question I have for you guys is SMS
still relevant it's tedious using the
service from our carriers when these
other services exist sounds terrible but
I for one think those are way better
option Alex you're right all of those
services require that you're signed up
for those services and they're not
available in all countries and in all
places so that's kind of the first
reason why we might want to keep text
messaging around second is there are
some services that don't work on other
platforms leaving friends that use those
well unable to communicate with you SMS
is the lowest common denominator it
works with anyone that has a GSM
compatible phone and many people that
don't have gsm compatible phones that
are still on cdma and other technologies
so there is that to keep in mind but the
biggest is the advantages that you get
because those packets their overhead
there are two reasons why that's really
important the first reason is when it
comes to crowds when you're in a very
crowded area whether that's a big game
or whether it's just you know an event
or whatnot you might not have enough
bandwidth to make a phone call or to get
any data through on the internet but
you're still talking to that tower and
that towers coming back and saying sorry
all circuits are busy sending a text
message using your carrier's texting
service can get that bit of information
out to the tower and because it's so
small when
ever there's a gap it can send that
message on through it's a very very good
thing because not only do you have that
ability but the tower is also going to
queue it until it has that space you can
send it and forget it and it might take
five minutes before that text gets out
but you don't have to keep trying for
that whole five minutes you're going to
be doing something else the tower is
going to take care of it for you we're
texting really shines is in case of
emergencies you can have a natural
disaster where everyone is trying to
locate their loved ones or tell their
loved ones that they're okay that clogs
up all of the bandwidth that that
cellular network has especially if any
of the towers were damaged for the same
reason that we just mentioned texting
can come in really handy to get a
message out there's another reason
however if you're in the middle of
nowhere and you look at your phone and
it has no bars that doesn't mean that
your phone's not connected to a tower or
talking to a tower it could mean that
that tower acknowledges that you're
there but it also acknowledges that your
signal is too low to get any kind of
data or any kind of voice communication
through it's not going to show you any
bars but it's still talking so send a
text message using your carrier's stock
text messaging app whatever is the stock
app so you make sure that doesn't go
through the internet like google voice
does it will then try and send that out
to the tower and as soon as the strength
is high enough that it can get it
through it will send that text message
whether that's right now an hour from
now or in the middle of the night it'll
send that message to the tower the tower
is then going to pick it up and it's
going to send it on so even if you can't
talk to anyone on the phone you might be
able to get a text message through to
someone asking for help Alex thank you
very much for writing in and I'm glad
that I was able to feel that question
for you of course I hope I answered it

questions or want to see other stuff
