common we've talked quite a bit about
the t-mobile mytouch 4G one thing that
we haven't done yet is really gone into
software and that's what I'd like to do
today so what comes pretty packaged with
the t-mobile mytouch 4G and what's the
little secret that they threw in there
that might make migrating from your old
Android phone to your new mytouch 4G
just a little bit simpler and you didn't
even know what was happening let's go
take a look alright so this is the
t-mobile mytouch 4G it is an HTC device
like we've already talked about and what
I've done is a factory to reset and boot
it up and just buzz right through all of
the setup and I haven't configured
anything I haven't done anything at all
to the phone except for turning the
automatic brightness off because this
phone has kind of a hyper brightness if
you will and it'll fade in and out which
you don't see too much in person but you
do see an awful lot on camera so I've
gone ahead and turned it up to full
brightness and I turn the the screen off
from 30 seconds to 10 minutes so that it
doesn't keep turning off while I'm
filming obviously so other than that
this is as stock as you're gonna get
right out of the box with your mytouch
4G so let's go through software now
obviously it comes with HTC Sense and it
asks you which scene you want to pick in
the first place I've picked this zebra
theme which was the default one which
has kind of a blocky looking launcher
tray icon set whatever you want to call
it got your app door in the middle of
course you've got your dialer over on
the side you've got your contacts over
on the side and this is really kind of
cool
nice little 3d looking thing which for
some reasons not animating probably
because I only have the one person in
there but what I want to show you is
what comes with this first of all we've
got kik video chat now kick is something
we're gonna cover in an upcoming video
where we can actually show some some
video chatting or video calling using
the front-facing camera which is right
here and we'll try doing that with
another
phone over on the side we've got faves
now faves are your favorite people and
it for some reason has remembered this
probably stored that information on the
SD card which I did not wipe but this
would be a collection of your favorite
people unfortunately it's not the start
people meaning the people that you star
in your contacts on say Google Voice or
on Gmail that doesn't translate across
this is just your favorite people that
you've set up with HTC the Sense UI next
we've got your power which it which is
the the stock power widget you've come
to know and love of course you've got
your Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS whether you
want to sync with your various services
and then of course your brightness which
I have turned to full up and not
automatic just for the purposes of this
video of course this also has kind of
entertainment it's got the t-mobile TV
app it's got something called media room
rock band yes rock band and asphalt five
so before we go too much further let's
look at each one of these media room is
just kind of that this is your
collection of music videos it's got your
FM radio and that even has slacker radio
right there so you can listen to all of
your music even the stuff that's online
you can listen to FM radio as long as
you have your headset plugged in and you
can watch whatever videos you have on
the phone so kind of cool to put all of
that in one place next we've got
t-mobile TV which is basically just mobi
TV it comes with a 30 day free
subscription which you'll see right here
go ahead and accept that the first time
you use it you do have to be over
t-mobile's network you can see here I've
been trying it for a few days now you
have to be all over a t-mobile network
rather than over Wi-Fi the first time
you use it to make sure that your device
is indeed a t-mobile phone and that you
are authorized to use it now it comes
with a 30 day subscription and I'll show
you in here you go to help view
subscriptions and right there to mobile
TV it shows you how many days are
remaining simply uncheck that and you
won't be billed $9.99 a month for
everything but the first month so there
is all that of course we can go back
here we've got live TV and all the
stations that are broadcasting what they
call live TV you can see over here a
little dollar symbol to let you know
that that's an additional subscription
on demand same problem with TV comm
there are some full episodes but there's
an awful lot of clips teasers trailers
and whatnot so it still hasn't made it
quite to where I would say it's going to
replace your cable TV box or even just
casual watching I have to go through and
hunt around to be able to find something
that I'm interested in which is kind of
a shame because my my tastes are
relatively broad but it's neat that
they're starting to include that on the
phone just right out of the gate and
there is a little bit more full episode
content with t-mobile TV than there is
with TV com
so let's go back over here where we were
before
asphalt 5 asphalt 5 is a racing game
it's very entertaining and it makes you
rotate your phone and then not this is
basically demo where you can play the
demo which has a level or two but if you
want to buy the full thing at seven
bucks go ahead and play the demo and it
says yep there you go one race or ten
minutes max that's all you get okay you
know the first ones free but the next
one's going to cost you kind of a slow
loading splash screen a loading screen
don't remove your SD card during the
loading touch the screen to continue
pick your car and we're just gonna go
through and do defaults here and wait
for loading loading loading loading this
is the thing that I hate about
everything the old console games and
whatnot
it takes way too long to load but once
you get in the game is really kind of
fun it's not something that I would pay
money for but my kids sure would tap the
streams to continue we can skip that if
we want it's just showing an overview of
the course and you can see here the
graphics are really pretty good
so not mad at all we'll go ahead and
cancel out of that because that kind of
showed you what we're going to expect
and we'll go back to our game screen now
this is the one that really gets me and
it's rock band and sure enough it's just
like the real rock band on your console
it's it's awesome I mean there are
differences obviously you don't have the
Foulois catalog that you do online I
really wish that it would sink your
progress and whatnot up between the two
so this was just like a mobile version
of the console game kind of like what
Windows Phone 7 is doing but in any
event it's kind of neat let me just show
you the controls in here a little bit
we'll go ahead and do all the small
things my blink-182 as these are phones
and they are after all small things I
can do any one of these bass guitar
guitar drums or even vocals now I
haven't tried vocals on this honestly I
think it'd be kind of weird to see
somebody singing to their phone out in
public so I've been sticking with drums
which is odd enough since this is on
camera we're gonna do easy although
normally I do medium I'm not bragging
they're not at all and it says make sure
you use both thumbs I can't do that on
screen so we're just gonna do one finger
here just as a demo but same UI that
you'd expect same rimshot when you miss
a note and it's a lot harder on camera
so just as you'd expect you go through
you hit the notes in time with with the
notes they're flying down at you you get
the full music right there so really
kind of cool when you miss a whole bunch
of notes your fret board I don't know
why they use fret boards for the drums
but they do it's kind of their unifying
US user interface element your fret
board turns red and lets you know that
you got a problem you've got your
indicator over here and of course if
somebody needs to talk to you you can
pause it and then quickly resume just
like that and it'll bring you right back
into the song hopefully right where you
left off
then it does nice fade in effect and
everything when you loose and I'm trying
to get it to lose here really quick by
not drumming anything there you go
comes up and it should tell me that I
only got about 25% but I failed it and
now I can go ahead and leave and we'll
go back and see what else is available
here and of course that's just a demo it
comes with two songs you can play both
guitars the drum and the vocals on on
both of those songs but it's just the
two which you know obviously you want a
bigger collection than just that so I
would recommend if you if you play this
and like it go ahead and buy it it's
it's pretty fun so moving right along
let's go to the other side now and see
what we've got we've got the demo video
which I showed you in the first boot
screen basically a commercial about why
you should buy the phone after you've
already bought the phone kind of awkward
there male maps gallery camcorder
nothing different there of course we've
got a link to the Android Market and a
Google search bar on the top this is
your weather widget which it doesn't
really know where I am so it's showing
me the weather in New York I can set
that of course to my location and get
the not only the four-day forecast but
also the current conditions so really
cool that's one of the things that I
like on my phone whether or not I have
HTC Sense or not also comes prepackaged
with Amazon mp3 the t-mobile app pack
we're a shortcut to it we already talked
about asphalt 5 it comes prepackaged
with barcode scanner which is really
cool more and more people are putting
barcodes on stuff you even seen in some
of the pocket now articles that we have
a QR or a quick response code that is
right there that you can hold your phone
up to your computer screen snap it in
your barcode scanner software and it
will take you right to the market where
you can download that app no more typing
no more searching you don't have to
worry about you know typing something in
and getting 10,000 responses I'm not
knowing which is which the next rows
basically stock stuff your calculated
calendar camcorder camera car dock clock
contacts demo video that we already
talked about now these contacts are the
HTC contacts it's not the Android
contacts which some of you will like
some of you will not got a desk clock
which is just that basically car dock
and desk dock are what we saw in the
Nexus
where if you docked it into a car dock
or a desktop dock it would switch the
phone into a different display mode
obviously that was appropriate for the
context that it was it would switch over
into car mode where you had a limited
number of options that were all relating
to to navigation and finding stuff on
the road your desk dock is basically a
clock and weather and and shortcuts and
whatnot so kind of neat I hope that
those three little gold dots right there
I mean that we are going to have a Nexus
One style docking solution in the future
I haven't seen one yet if you have
please leave us a link to that in the
comments down below
flashlights obviously we got to have a
flashlight it's got a push button to
turn it on and that's your LED
flashlight right there it's very bright
it does a really good job at being an
impromptu flashlight make sure you turn
it off when you're done with it the
other feature that I wanted to show you
I don't really know where it comes from
I don't know if it's something that
t-mobile is doing I don't know if it's
something HTC is doing I don't know if
something that Google is doing with
Android 2.2 point one what it is when I
came in here and I set up my device to
connect to the market I had to supply my
my Google credentials and by doing that
it lets me see you know some stuff like
what I've already purchased Twitter
premium rom manager eight pen you know a
whole bunch of stuff and I've shown you
these before so it keeps track of that
and lets me download and install them
again now something that is unusual that
I haven't noticed before is once I set
that up even though I was only over HSPA
wasn't over Wi-Fi
I started getting applications showing
up in my app drawer that I hadn't
installed on this phone now this isn't
just updates like Google Maps a Flash
Player and whatnot this was my full set
of apps
this was count'em 74 apps that I had
previously downloaded and installed
automatically got pushed to this device
now in my opinion that's just that's
very very cool I'd like to know where it
came from so if you know please let us
no in the comments I'm sure there are
lots of other people who are interested
in that do you have this feature on your
phone and if so what phone is it and
what version of Android are you running
but it was very cool all I had to do was
configure my my Google account go to the
market and then it just went and did its
thing in fact you can see up here it's
got that little synchronizing arrows
they did it in the background I didn't
even know it was happening until it was
all done it didn't affect my browsing
speed noticeably it didn't affect the
performance of the device noticeably it
was just a really really cool feature so
thumbs up to you Google so with an
overview of the apps that come
pre-loaded on the t-mobile mytouch 4G
and for Pocket mail I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
