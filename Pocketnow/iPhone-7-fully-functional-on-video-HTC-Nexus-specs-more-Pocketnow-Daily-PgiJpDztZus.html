a fully working iphone 7 LG makes its
v20 event official and boy that that
date come off complicated in Samson
confirms that we can expect a lot from
iris scanners in the future I'm hi Mary
vera and who would have ever thought
that simba would become Black Panther at
some point this is parking out daily the
official loose today begin with Apple
music for Android the service now ended
beta you can now access it and well it's
pretty much the typical same thing that
we get on iOS the only difference is
that Apple managed to clear out all the
bugs in addition to allow you to store
your music on an SD card which makes you
wonder when is Apple going to bring this
to the iphone but anyways you can learn
more in the leg of the description as
will the spotlight over to the HTC nexus
codename sailfish we've got some
interesting benchmarks that reveal that
this phone kind of reminds us of a one
plus three we've got a 1080p display for
gigs of ram 32 gigs of on-board storage
yeah I know the storage is not the same
thing but 12 finger pixel camera it
seems that this is going to be a
competitor to flagship killers and that
is actually a very good idea let's see
what we get from the other unit if it
happens now Samsung just came on record
to tell us a lot more about what to
expect from iris scanners particularly
that we should expect the future galaxy
lineup to include it in addition to
other smartphones and tablets because
Samsung wants to make this a big deal
mainly with banking mainly with security
apparently the company is up to many
partnerships in addition to providing an
API for third-party developers to use
this service so get used to it again you
don't need to use the iris scanner but
it makes things a little more convenient
nice to have I'll talk about the
company's main competitor LG in Korea
the company has just announced that we
should expect its latest flagship the
b20 listen to the date September six
guess what we're going to be on
September 6 we're gonna be an ephah in
Berlin and this event is in San
Francisco set your calendars we'll
figure out a way to cover it this is
definitely one phone we are anticipating
LG is anticipating a to given its
quarter results lately it should be the
premium black
that we expect and finally the very hot
news today have to do with the iphone 7
the regular iphone 7 as we've got some
leaked videos that show us what to
expect from this phone and this is it
actually a functioning phone and we can
notice a couple of things number one the
back changes as we've seen on leaks the
front doesn't change at all but we can't
really make if the home button is
actually a typical push button or if
we're getting a forced touch home button
which is what we are expecting and well
it just proves to the fact that at least
the iphone 7 or iphone 6s see whatever
the name is going to be is mainly going
to be just an update and we should
expect something broader next year so it
leads me to the question of the day
particularly with the front do you think
that it should change I mean Apple has
been bringing this iphone front ever
since the first generation model in my
case I do believe that it should but we
would love to know your opinion in the
