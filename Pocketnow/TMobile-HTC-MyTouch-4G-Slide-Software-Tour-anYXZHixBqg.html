pocketnow.com and we are going to take a
quick software tour of the new htc
mytouch 4G slide now on t-mobile let's
take a look so first off here is your
lockscreen and there's a couple special
features when you get notifications it's
going to show up right here and
sometimes you have little button so you
can drag into this circle right now I
have a new voicemail but this is
actually seems like a bug
because I don't really have a new
voicemail no matter how many times I go
here and now call voicemail it will say
no new messages I go here to the visual
voicemail
I got no voicemails but the notification
is always there not sure what's going on
with that anyway this is Android 2.3.3
so that's a good gingerbread version and
it's got HTC Sense on it but it's kind
of a slightly different version of sense
without some icons down here that you
can you know customize you can put
different apps down there if you want
there's your personalization and we have
themes we can choose from all your HTC
themes and here's some wallpapers we
have a couple of HTC wallpapers there's
a slide show there's the weather which I
have right now streak and some Android
default wallpapers we have now back on
the home screen we can swipe and you see
the little indicators up there and it
goes all the way around so it goes all
the way around in a circle so we can
keep going in one direction and get to
all the different home screens double
tapping the home button will give us our
five home screens and but tapping and
holding on them I cannot remove
them so we can't do much customization
they're pressing the Menu key doesn't
give us any options for rearranging
these either it's just really a quick
way to get to different ones so kind of
a crippled version of sense a little bit
down here we can tap and hold and I can
move these icons so that's good
now let's look at what kind of programs
come with this device start from the top
we get bejeweled - that comes on it we
get calculator kind of big buttons there
pretty cool
calendar of course car dock some other
thing that we've seen before container
directions really see should go to
landscape mode as well and we have some
of these things I've already installed
that doubleTwist sync flashlight is good
to have so that's as your flashlight
turns on the LED lights in the back next
we have friend stream which is cool this
kind of combines Facebook and Twitter
updates and we have a lot of options
down here you can see statuses photos
that people are posting so there's some
from Facebook here's links that people
are posting
as you listen there's a locations that
people are visiting and here's the
notifications for Twitter and Facebook
all in one place that's really nice to
have got the gallery same as usual this
is one thing that I find kind of
annoying
I can only I can't scroll like one row
see it bounces to per pages but anyway
we also have highlight this special
program from t-mobile wait for it to
load so we have little things that
t-mobile is trying to sell you or news
items a little bit slow sometimes let's
go back okay
let's go there what's next
kids on this is a new thing so what this
does is kind of puts your phone into a
kid-friendly mode and so you only have
access to these these apps you know
bejeweled YouTube t-mobile TV and the
web browser or emergency call and
nothing else happens so if you give this
to a kid they can't screw it up and go
start calling people or doing crazy
things you don't want them to do and
then you know if you want to get out of
that you have to unlock it and this will
use your normal whatever kind of
password you choose Maps is as usual
immediate room is something cool so this
gives you some big buttons to a music
video t-mobile TV FM radio screen share
slicker Slacker Radio screen shares the
DLNA support so this is pretty cool you
can pretty easily share your music your
photos or your videos to DLNA compatible
devices of course we got my account this
is for managing your t-mobile account
information I don't really need to load
that you have some of my device help you
got navigation from Gmail we have
Netflix is pre-installed that's a good
thing to have
clears office for opening office files
and here's one that comes with how to
USB tethering device to computer so
there are some instructions
we have a cool setup program this will
help you get everything going I had some
issues with setting up the video chat it
was requiring an upgrade and eventually
I got to work but it was kind of
difficult
there's your t-mobile TV this is pretty
much the same as all the other t-mobile
TV apps we have to disable Wi-Fi have to
do the thing and we also have a task
manager which is important to have so we
can see how much memory is being used
and which applications are using how
much memory and we can close them pretty
easily from there you also have the
kill-all button also comes with till now
GPS and there's kik video chat
so I can choose people to video chat
with that's pretty cool feature to have
you also got the video mail here's our
weather it's cool
HTC weather animation get some
information there too pretty nice little
app also have Wi-Fi calling this is
great fav if you don't have very good
reception see my my bars are very low up
there you can just connect to a Wi-Fi
network and use your voice calls over
the Wi-Fi network here's your Wi-Fi
hotspot if you want to share your
internet connection
with a laptop or whatever just turn it
on there that's pretty good you also get
YouTube and Zinio reader so that's about
it for the programs that are included
one last thing the notifications bar has
some interesting features you get
recently used applications right here so
you can very easily switch to them and
we have our notifications of course down
here and we also have the quick settings
tab so this is a really easy place to go
and turn on GPS or Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
even mobile hotspot and you also get
some task management information it's
kind of unintuitive to have this
information here in the notifications
bar which was supposed to be like your
central area for notifications but we
got settings and we got applications
here now so that's kind of a silly
workaround but there we have it that's
the software included on the htc mytouch
4G slide I hope you enjoyed this video
it was a thumbs up if you did and that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
