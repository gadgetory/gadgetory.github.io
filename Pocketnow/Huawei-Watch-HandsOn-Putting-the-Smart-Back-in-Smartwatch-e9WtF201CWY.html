Huawei looks to put the smart back into
SmartWatch in the fancy sense does it
have what it takes to make a splash in a
crowded market i'm michael fisher with
pocket now and this is a pre-release
hands-on with the Huawei watch now if
you're familiar with this device there's
a reason we played with it very briefly
after its unveiling in Barcelona last
spring but at that point it only ran
demo software on non-final hardware
today we get the opportunity to try it
out in a much more finished State and
there's a lot to like here that starts
with a 42 millimeter casing built from
316l stainless steel rated to ip67 for
water and dust resistance it's available
in three finishes silver rose gold and
dlc black and the bands are swappable as
well they'll be offered for sale
separately in both 21 millimeter and 18
millimeter sizes around back is the
typical heart rate sensor qua way does
say its fitness tracking capabilities
are more accurate than its competitors
but we're still waiting for details on
exactly how upfront a two-layer sapphire
crystal protects the 1.4 inch display
like on earlier watches from LG and
Samsung it's an AMOLED screen but it
brings a pixel density 16% sharper than
the LG watch urbane it resembles in
person it's certainly a sharp display
and a sharp watch for that matter
Huawei seems to have tweaked its
hardware since the spring is everything
from the casing itself to the various
band designs feels nicer more premium
the company is positioning this as a
device to appeal to watch lovers not
just SmartWatch geeks and while it's a
little thicker than I'd like it to be it
absolutely gives the impression of being
an expensive piece of kit it also comes
loaded with over 40 watch faces out of
the box with more available on the
Android wear store of course and the
AMOLED display means those watch faces
can be left in ambient mode all the time
and the watch will still last two days
on a charge unlike some other wearables
on the market it doesn't skimp on the
packaging either the Huawei watch comes
in a big beefy jewelry box worthy of
something much higher end
but you're going to have to shell out
for that high-end experience the Huawei
watch will be one of the most expensive
Android wear devices around when it
launches this month the stainless steel
models start things off at 349 and 399
with the black Sport trim coming in at
449 and the gold editions scraping the
ceiling around $800 now we've seen
smartwatches as expensive as this before
and it does align with huawei's focus on
the mid to high end and its mobile
products plus at first wearing the watch
certainly seems to earn its price tag
again it's quite a beautiful piece but
for that kind of money it would have
been nice to see a better thought out
charging solution a magnetic disc is
fine but Motorola bundles are really
convenient pedestal with it's cheaper
moto 360 more importantly underneath the
Huawei watch is fancy casing is a pretty
typical Android wear device and despite
Huawei's assurances that the watch is
built to last it's anyone's guess how
well this Hardware will age when an if
Google starts building more capabilities
like NFC into the wear platform the
Huawei watch will be available in the US
starting September 17th with pre-orders
opening an Amazon Best Buy the Google
store and get Huawei comm on September
2nd we'll be given the Huawei watch a
proper review shortly after release
folks stay tuned for that and check out
our other Android wear coverage both
here on YouTube and at pocketnow.com
