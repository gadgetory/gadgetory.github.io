big brother for the surface 2 there are
a few similarities and a lot of
differences this is Adam Lane from
pocket I'll keep watching for our
comparison of these surface pro 3 versus
the surface 2 since the previous surface
pros were shaped about the same as the
surface RT devices except for the
increased thickness and heft we kind of
expected that from the surface pro 3
surprisingly that is not the case the
surface pro 3 running full high-end
64-bit Windows 8 hardware feels just as
light as the surface to rein the ARM
processor and the limited Windows RT the
specification differences are monumental
though the surface pro 3 is available in
configurations with a top-of-the-line
core i7 processor 512 gates of
solid-state drive storage and 8 gigs of
ram while the surface twos maximum
configuration is an NVIDIA Tegra 4
processor with 64 gigs of storage and
only 2 gigs of RAM both devices still
get about 9 to 10 hours of battery life
though both also have 5 megapixel
cameras on the back while the surface 2
has a 3.5 megapixel front facing camera
the surface pro 3 has another 5
megapixel camera on the front the most
obvious difference is the screen size
the surface 2 has a ten point six inch
1080p HD screen while the surface pro 3
has a 12 inch screen with a 2160 by 1440
pixels resolution that extra resolution
gives you a lot more room for those
great desktop programs that won't run on
the surface 2 another big difference is
the kickstand the surface 2 has a two
step kickstand so that you can set it up
on table at two different viewing angles
the surface pro 3 steps it up big time
with a fully adjustable kickstand that
supports a much wider range of viewing
angles
honestly when comparing the surface pro
3 with a surface to the most impressive
difference is the thickness and weight
the surface 2 is 8.9 millimeters thick
while the surface pro 3 is 9 point 1
millimeters thick that's two tenths of a
millimeter difference it's kind of
amazing that Microsoft packed so much
more horse power into such a thin body
it's light too
the surface pro 3 weighs 800 grams
versus the surface twos 676 grams it's
pretty impressive this such a small 124
gram difference makes such a huge
difference in performance and
capabilities sure to follow pocket now
in all the usual places and definitely
give this video a thumbs up
oh and thanks my friend Brent Strether
for loaning us his surface 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
