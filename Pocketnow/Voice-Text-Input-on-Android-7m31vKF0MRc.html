yesterday we showed you how to search
for stuff on your Android and on the
internet using your voice instead of
your keyboard well today it's text input
using just your voice let's go take a
look alright so this is my g2 by
t-mobile
it is running a CyanogenMod nightly so
this is actually running Gingerbread but
you can do this on just about every
version of Android that I've seen
including the old old old ones and it
has to do with this little teeny
microphone icon down on the keyboard now
this is the swipe keyboard and your
swipe keyboard may or may not have a
microphone this is the latest beta and
it does but if you if you don't have
that in your swipe go back to a stock
keyboard something that came stock with
Android and it should have that
microphone right there it's generally
overlooked and I really don't understand
why because it's really powerful and
it's getting more and more easy to use
it's getting more stuff that you can do
with it
and it's starting to learn your
individual voice so that's really kind
of neat now first of all I want to tell
you that using voice recognition in this
kind of setup where the phone is flat on
that table isn't that great holding it
up to your ear like you're making a
phone call
works best holding it out in front of
you in a quiet room also works really
well but if we have some mistakes here
to us some transcription mistakes it's
most likely due to sitting it on this
keyboard which means we don't have this
rear microphone so if I can get that on
camera for you we don't have that rear
microphone they're assisting with the
front microphone but we're going to go
ahead and give this a try and see if we
can recognize a shopping list all right
so I've fired up Evernote which is my
favorite notetaking application not only
does it let you store notes locally on
the device it also syncs them up to the
cloud so you can take notes on your
laptop on your desktop on your
smartphone and they all sync together
into one unified notebook on the web but
you can still use it disconnected which
very nice so what we're going to do
we're going to fire up a new note we're
going to come down here into the text
input box and this tip is going to work
in any text input box out there any
standard text input box let's put it
that way and the tip is to use your
microphone icon down here not to be
confused with this microphone icon up
here you see in Evernote you can take a
voice note that is actually recorded
recorded to audio which can come in
really handy well today what I want to
do is show you how to use this
microphone which is the voice to text so
let's go ahead and create a shopping
list pick up milk eggs bread and cereal
as soon as it detects silence it's going
to recognize it and you can see here it
says pick up milk eggs bread and cereal
just like I said now the more I use this
the more accurate it's going to get
because it starts to learn my voice in
particular now you could think that
that's really neat and really helpful or
you could put on your aluminum hat and
think that this is kind of scary because
you're sending Google all of your voice
patterns whichever way you want to think
about it that's up to you just know that
if you have that option turned on it is
going to be creating a voice profile for
you but really neat now like I said we
can do this in any textbox that we want
to including the title which we can come
up in here shopping list and just as
easy as that we've got our shopping list
in our Evernote it could just as easily
have been an email and I can really
record a lot of stuff so let me come
back down in here and I'm just going to
set this to record while I'm summing up
just so you can see that you can record
an awful lot of text in here and send
that off to Google and have Google
recognize it for you now this does
require that you have an internet
connection because it's not your phone
that's doing the recognition it's the
Google servers we'll let that recognize
and the longer it is generally the less
accurate it is but you can see it did
pretty good the second season recording
of a lot of text in here and
and off to Google so you see it doesn't
get it exactly right the shorter more
succinct sentences you can record the
better but even still if I had this to
look at I could probably figure out what
I meant
relatively easily it's kind of like
texts or handwriting recognition on the
old windows see II Pocket PC phones
before it became windows mobile but
still kind of cool
there's your Android quick tip for the
day if you've done something like this
or have a novel ingenuitive way to use
this sun voice input the voice
recognition stuff built into Android
please let us know in the comments down
below thumbs up this video so that we
know that you guys like seeing this kind
of stuff and want to see more of it in
the future
we still have those voice intents or
voice actions coming up which is going
to be really really powerful so make
sure you subscribe to our video channel
so you don't miss out on that if you
haven't done so already or pocket now
I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
