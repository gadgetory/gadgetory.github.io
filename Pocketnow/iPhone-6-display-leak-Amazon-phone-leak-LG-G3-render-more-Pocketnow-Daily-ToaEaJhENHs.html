iphone 6 display panel amazon smartphone
apparently gets caught on camera and
leaked photos point to what to expect
for the LG g3 i'm high netting that and
if my calculations are correct we're
just four days away from starting the
weekend which i can't wait for but this
is pocket out daily let's begin today
with what's official even though that's
kind of lacking lately but first of all
we have google finally providing more
integration between gmail and google+
that's even possible a lot of people
don't like the social network but you
have the advantage now that if you're
using gmail natively on your browser on
your computer you can now access all the
photos that you've directly uploaded to
google plus meaning if you have a backup
through Google+ or whatever these are
now accessible the gmail so that you can
now send these photos on emails without
the need of attaching them again it's a
really cool service it's great to see
that google finally brings more support
to their services which sadly will not
make google+ any more popular but you
tell me do you like it now let's talk
about LG is we got some leaked photos of
a phone that's not the LG g3 but this is
actually leaks of the LG Sifl the reason
why this is important is because the
east side from last year was the basis
for the LG g2 it was pretty much the
same phone though these are exclusive to
japan and one of the most interesting
parts of this phone is that you know the
buttons at the back are flat and it just
seems flat all around and the bezels
keep disappearing more and more i
wouldn't have any more details on what
to expect hopefully the LG g3 will be a
full revamp and design and still provide
us that great battery life now it's talk
about ambolyn it's very interesting
carplay service and i know you notice
the sarcasm in my face and that's mainly
because uh we didn't get a ferrari with
the service and there is really no
vehicle out there that supports it right
now so it's kind of pointless to have it
now seems more like a marketing gimmick
but pioneer will be supporting this on
some of its in decibel car stereos very
soon apparently in the summer links in
description for full details on which
models will be supporting this they're
kind of limited right now we get no
details on when we will get the service
provided for newer car stereos or
something you just buy out there and
then adapt to your carpet
anyway stay tuned let's see how that
goes now let's talk about apple and its
iPhone 6 is we get the first league
photographs of the display panel for the
device apparently this is the 4.7 inch
model being compared to the iphone 5s
and this means either one of two things
number one because the photos show that
this pretty much just a bloated display
which is the bezels are the same so it
could be that this is just a fake
display that was made from the
schematics that were leaked recently
because that's very often and common
free to find a you know displays out
there from the black market for you to
replace on your phone or it could mean
that Apple really is advanced with the
4.7 inch model we could probably see it
at WWDC not sure about that but we'll
see how that goes and finally for the
very very interesting news of the day we
apparently get the first leaked
photographs of the first amazon
smartphone and the reason why we assume
this is amazon smartphone is because the
leaker confirms it one and number two
because if you remember there were some
patterns of the stone bringing four
cameras in the front and even though we
still don't know exactly what they plan
to do with these cameras this stone
actually has the four cameras though
they're kind of covered in the casing
it's a very ugly phone so far the UI
looks very interesting and you know that
leads you to the question of the day
what exactly do you think these four
cameras are for first of all and second
do you like the design of what you see
in this league photo in my particular
case I'll be honest with you the only
thing that I could think of is the fact
that this piece camera served for motion
detection or something let us know in
the comments when you think but do you
like what you see do you believe that
this is a good phone or not when you buy
it leave us a comment down below because
honestly aside from the fact that I
don't know what the cameras are for I
don't find it compelling at all and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video was filmed tree follow us on
 out comment subscribe to our
YouTube channel as well it also follow
me on Twitter highlanders quarter iveta
