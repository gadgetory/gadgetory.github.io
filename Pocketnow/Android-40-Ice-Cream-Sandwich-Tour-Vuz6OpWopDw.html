pocketnow.com in this video we're going
to give you a tour of Google's Android
4.3 and 'which let's get to it so if you
want to run this on your own computer
will link to a video that shows you how
to run the emulator on your own computer
and a little bit of a preface when you
run the emulator it will be slow so that
obviously doesn't represent the speed of
ice cream sandwich it's just the fact
that you're running an emulator on your
computer so let's get started you might
be wondering where are those virtual
buttons that are present on the Galaxy
Nexus well in the emulator you don't get
those virtual buttons we have buttons
off to the right you can't see them in
this frame but what's going to happen is
when ice cream sandwich comes on to
legacy hardware hardware that's already
out there the home button tap and hold
of the home button will bring up the
multitask you I because you might have
seen that the Galaxy Nexus has its own
multitask button so that is a bit of
explanation so here we have the home
screen you I for ice cream sandwich and
we can swipe to the left I'm not
actually going to swipe I'm going to
just click on the left button here on
the on the d-pad or on the keyboard
whichever is easier for you and just
like standard Android but there's a lot
different for example let's move this
email shortcut over here you'll notice a
lot of things are taken right out of the
honeycomb holographic you I so if we tap
and hold on this bookmark with widget
which looks exactly the same as
honeycomb we can resize it just like
honeycomb and just like honeycomb we can
resize it here we can scroll through
this widget kind of like a mini
application very nice so let's go into
the application list and actually let's
go into the notification tray first
they've redone the notification tray now
with the notifications you can swipe
notifications individual ones off of the
screen if you want to deal with them
later so if I swipe that it's gone
imagine having having 10 notifications I
need five of them you want to deal with
five of them you don't care about with
the swipe it really helps you sort of
hone in on the notifications that you
want to action on later now I've
actually set up my email my personal
email with this device
so it's got my contacts has calendar and
email so everything's working it's
pretty cool I can actually show you
everything or most of the functionality
so let's go into the application tray
first before we talk about email
contacts and calendar here's what it
looks like when you want to pick a nap
if you want to put it on your home
screen just like gingerbread you tap and
hold and boom you can drop it on home
screen or you can put it on another home
screen kind of like in honeycomb so
let's go back to the previous home
screen the main home screen here let's
go back into the app tray now we have
widgets up here and it does crash from
time to time because you know it doesn't
work perfectly so we're going to go back
into the app tray here and go to widgets
one more time should work there we go so
here are the widgets now they are stored
within the app tray rather than within
the within another menu system on the
home screen so we can scroll through our
widgets tap and drag them to the home
screen just like you can do with
individual apps now I mentioned the
multitask you I if you tap and hold the
home button or if it's a device like the
Galaxy Nexus you will have its own
button so if I tap and hold the home
button you'll see up comes a task
switcher that looks just like honeycomb
in fact it's the same one you're
supposed to get little previews of the
programs here but in this case you don't
probably because it's kind of buggy here
but you can flick through with your
finger the recent most applications that
you've used pretty cool way to flip
through your applications it's going to
be great if we hit the menu button on
the home screen we will get these three
items kind of a consolidated list we've
get we have wallpaper manage apps and
system settings and here's a very
familiar wallpaper picker that we've
seen from other versions of Android and
let's jump in to settings now and I
should mention that settings is now a
shortcut in the notification tray so I
click on settings up there and boom here
we are scroll to the top and see what we
have we've got this really cool data
usage area and didn't want to go there
so we can actually see which program
us are using which data usage super cool
especially for people that aren't on
unlimited data plans you can also
specify to get an alarm where to shut
off your data completely if you reach a
certain threshold of data use and we
really can't do much here with that it's
not set up obviously we're not connected
to a real network here so let's go back
and all of the other settings just look
different they're basically the same so
if you go into sound it's just a
beautiful interface here using the new
Ice Cream Sandwich system font Korean
checks kind of inherited from honeycomb
going to display same kind of options
that you would get in Gingerbread and
it's starting to get a little bit slow
here so let's go down to battery see if
we have anything there same kind of
thing with battery so again a lot of the
same settings just a different look and
feel let's jump into the calendar now
and see what that looks like where the
calendar preferences okay so here is
what agenda view looks like and it
should actually be I guess color-coded
here on the left if you have multiple
calendars but I only have one so it's
gray what we can do is we can change to
month view week view Dave you kind of
like any standard calendar and it shows
you with little little gray bars whether
you're busy that day what time of the
day you're busy and so on and so forth
so much improved you I there let's jump
into email and hopefully there's nothing
crazy in there okay so here we are in
email and it's just an improved email
interface again it comes right out of
honey cone when you check a certain item
you will get these buttons along the
bottom here and they're pretty
self-explanatory so I'm going to trash
this item and it says message deleted it
goes away if we click the menu button
will get some settings let's take a look
at the email settings get the general
email settings message text size let's
see what it looks like on tiny auto
advanced choose which screen is show
after you delete a message simple simple
things here and if we go back it should
change this text size or not
so let's go back to the home screen and
check out a little bit more of the
features here so we've got a doc along
the bottom which contains the phone by
default here's the new phone dial pad
let's see what it looks like when you
call someone so let's call one eight
hundred collect Co ll e SI t give them a
call and take a look at the new phone UI
and here here it goes being huge picture
if you've got a picture caller ID
associated with this person a big red
end call button and your typical options
in here as well dial pad speakerphone
mute hold and add another caller and so
go back to the home screen here and
let's go into contacts real quick now
contacts like a lot of honeycomb like a
lot of ice cream sandwich apps has this
sort of pivot like thing which kind of
reminds us of Windows Phone 7 so if we
swipe to the right we can see favorites
and we we have this kind of tabbed
interface along the top and we can
either get to those tabs by tapping
individually on the tabs or we can do
that swipe to the right and if you had
pictures associated with these contacts
they would come up with beautiful
pictures and there are some pretty cool
stuff that has happened in Ice Cream
Sandwich to contacts will have a full
rundown of that we actually get a device
in here with ice cream sandwich that is
a lot smoother in operation than this
emulator so again that was a look at Ice
Cream Sandwich google has gone a long
way to improve Android to make it look a
lot nicer more elegant again we'll post
a link on the video here on how to run
the emulator on your own it's the kind
of thing you could spend 20-30 minutes
messing around with you'll find all
kinds of cool stuff in there so if you
like this video please give it a thumbs
up and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
