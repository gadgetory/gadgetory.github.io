no excuse for not listening again now if

episode seems to our device now as far
as android is concerned that you haven't
you don't have the option of subscribing
to either zoom nor itunes so you have to
install an application and to subscribe
to the RSS feed that we're back if you
have a google android powered smartphone
there is no way for you to subscribe to
either zune or itunes so you will have
to go into the market and look for the
application
called Google listen you find it by
searching for Google listen and it
should come up as a free application
from google and install that one except
the grander permissions it says the item
will be downloaded and it should be
downloading but it's not yes it is it's
installing and it's been successfully
installed once you've installed the

application menu launch that one it will
bring up a six step introductory
introduction short tutorial at the end
of which will ask you for your account
there we go and this is the home screen

have to tap on that and input the
following address into the dialog box

the home screen for the pocket guest
with the newest episodes on the top
tapping on that one will bring you the
description and tapping on listen now
we'll start streaming buffering directly
to your phone now make sure you have an
unlimited data or you are running on
wireless because this will be streaming
some 50 or 60 megabytes
your phone maker one sand it slow I get
of course you can of course run it in
the background so you can do whatever
else you wish to do and you'll have an
icon at the top showing you that you are
a playing pocket guest episode 6 getting
