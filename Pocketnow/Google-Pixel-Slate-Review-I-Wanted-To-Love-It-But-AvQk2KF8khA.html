replacement I've come across an
interesting approach this is the pixel
slate Google's first attempt at bringing
Chrome OS to a tablet and frankly what I
feel should be the future of this form
factor with huge quotes in the word
future I mean factus I really want to
love this tablet but there are things in
the implementation that keep me from it
I'm high literally better with pocket
now and let's go through our full review
to tell you why
I am a huge tablet user you guys know
this they are the digital notepad that
assists my work routine and also my
fallback device for scripting whenever I
don't want to burn unnecessary battery
for my video editing laptop if only
Apple gave us an iPad OS to make it more
useful I'd love it even more and I feel
that Google noticed that they notice if
there's a niche where we need a more pro
tablet and this is the solution that
Google is bringing think about it is
this is my second experience using
Chrome OS so let me start by telling you
what's good about this tablet first
every good tablet should never cheap out
on content consumption and this one
excels this is Google's twelve point
three inch molecular display at three
thousand by two thousand pixels with
fantastic color reproduction great
viewing angles and enough brightness for
any scenario we've got two dual firing
speakers exactly where every tablet
should have them facing the user
telephoto in one module I would be sold
and they get plenty loud and crisp
though you might notice some distortion
if you keep them maxed out also any pro
tablet requires good specifications in
IO and this tablet has all the goods
depending on which very you pick as
reviewed this model has the eighth
generation Intel Core i5 eight gigs of
ram 128 gigs of storage that's not
expandable and yes there are two USB C
ports here that support 4k display
output and an accessory connector for
the optional keyboard that we'll discuss
later this tablet also nails another key
essential which is endurance I mean the
48 watt hour battery was able to get me
through the day every single time that I
used it and then the 45 watt charger
included in the box is plenty fast to
top it off really quick Google also
claims this tablet is secure there's the
pixel imprint fingerprint sensor that's
plenty fast along with the Titan C
security chip that keeps all your data
secure within the device but now let me
continue the video by telling you where
I'm mixed about this tablet and it
begins with Chrome OS I mean I feel
tablet does solve my main complaint with
an iPad this is no baby browser this is
the full desktop Chrome browser on a
tablet from bank transactions absolutely
anything you want to do on the web this
tablet can do it the F gap has also been
solved with Chrome OS running Android
applications and heck you can even open
zip files without much extra drama here
we're on iOS that's kind of a nightmare
the problem is the implementation you
have to look out for the little chrome
icons to know which ones are chrome tabs
and which ones are Android applications
and even if it's cool that in desktop
mode you can use the Android
applications like small phone windows
they suddenly become bloated blocks of
space and tablet mode and worst of all
moving windows around is really choppy
and I really wish there was multiple
desktop options here for better
multitasking and then some Android
applications work in a weird way like
for example my favorite which is
Microsoft OneNote or you can't select
text using the keyboard or you can't use
italics or bold easily through keyboard
shortcuts and then there's the other
problem which is the way multiple
accounts work on this tablet which is
not the same as having multiple accounts
it's different chrome windows on the
desktop and to continue let's talk about
this design I like the tablet visually
but it's quite unfortunate that there's
only one size and one color option the
tablet is light on its own and if this
is your only computer then the size is
fine but I still need a video editing
rig with me so I would've loved that
this tablet were smaller like 9 or 10
inches and then you've got the issues
that this color option is a true
fingerprint and smudge magnet and then
there's the pixel book pen which I love
for highlighting and for my notes I love
that there's no latency but I hate the
fact that I can't really attach it
easily to either the tablet or the
keyboard so I can't tell you how many
times I've dropped this thing I feel
Microsoft s is really spoiled with how
you can attach the pen to the tablet but
of course there is no such thing as a
perfect device so let me talk to you
about this pixel a keyboard do not pay
$200 for this thing
it is seriously on the verge of being
terrible I mean sure the keys are
backlit and they're round which is quite
unique and they feel great while typing
but the problem is really this portion
in between where the tablet sits and the
keyboard if you're using for example a
Microsoft Surface pro this portion
attaches magnetically to the tablets but
on this one it doesn't so this keyboard
wobbles for absolutely everything you
can think of this means that unless you
have a hard surface typing on this thing
can be a true flimsy nightmare and then
the size of the keyboard also doesn't
help when on your lap as you'll need to
adopt a very uncomfortable position for
the tablet not to drift back on your
legs and obviously all the while
wobbling as you type I highly recommend
that you consider the bridge G type
keyboard which I believe is $50 less
expensive and turns this tablet more
into a laptop that I think will be more
useful to you last but not least this
the price tag and what you're getting
for it I know this tablet starts at
$5.99 but the problem is that that's for
a lesser spec model this one is $9.99
and it doesn't handle Android apps and
windows really well so I doubt that that
other one will do a better job and then
if you consider the $200 keyboard plus
the pen I mean it hikes up so much that
I don't know if it's worth it to
consider this tablet over other options
like a Microsoft Surface pro for example
to conclude I think you understand why I
really want to love this tablet
I feel Chrome OS is approach is the
perfect solution to make tablets more
powerful and less restrictive and I also
feel that this design and form factor is
the best way to go I don't like fans on
my tablets Google just needs to work on
the implementation I feel that Chrome OS
does need Android apps but if these
didn't work well on Android tablets
don't expect them to do a better job
here and then the second thing is
definitely the hardware I feel that
Google could have done a better job with
certain elements of this design it's a
great tablet don't get me wrong I just
find it really hard to recommend over
other options for its same price point
