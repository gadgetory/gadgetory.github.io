we've had quite a few discussions on
batteries over at the android guy weekly
if you've missed those make sure you hit
the link at the end of this video so you
can go back and catch up we've talked
about how to keep your batteries more
healthy and how to get more run time out
of them but we've always talked about
what you and I the end user can do to
make our batteries last longer well what
are the OEMs doing to get you better
battery life so we're going to talk
about in this week's episode of the
android guy weekly so let's get the
easiest one out of the way just put in a
bigger battery now a lot of
manufacturers are doing that but there's
a race to have the thinnest device out
there the thicker the battery is the
thicker the device is going to be and
you'd be amazed just how much of that
devices thickness is the battery itself
in fact a lot of manufacturers are
building the entire circuit board around
the battery to make up for it helps you
keep things a little bit slimmer but you
still have that bulky thick battery to
make up for well the only way to make it
thinner without a radical jump in
battery technology is essentially to to
scale back the capacity of the battery
to make it thinner that works great
except now your battery doesn't last as
long and you're losing those milliamp
hours left and right just so you can say
hey I've got the thinnest smartphone on
the planet for the next two weeks yay
and then the newest finist one will be
out so what are they doing well let's
look at the droid razr motorola said hey
this device is great but it eats battery
life for lunch so what are we going to
do they released a new SKU they released
the droid razr maxx and it's amazing I
go to lunch with a buddy all the time
who's got a razr maxx he says his
fabulous he listens to his streaming
audio on it on the way to and from work
while he's at lunch while he's in the
server room makes phone calls on it all
kinds of stuff and lunchtime he's barely
barely dipped into the battery just
hardly anything at all it lasts him
easily through the entire day why don't
more manufacturers do
that well for part of them they just
want to have a thin device for another
part of them that they want to have an
accessory that they can sell you for
example the Galaxy Nexus comes with a
1750 milliamp hour battery it's decent
it'll get most people through the day
and that's about it you've got a charge
either on the way to work or from work
or you're going to be out of battery
life by the time your nightlife gets
around so what can you do go out and buy
I think it's about 40 bucks a little bit
less the accessory battery to take you
all the way up to 2,000 milliamp hours
doesn't have that much bulk to the phone
in fact if you just got the phone with
the 2009 battery and the replacement
back cover which you will need by the
way they come together in a kit when you
buy them from Samsung or from an
authorized distributor by the way
essentially what you're doing is you're
not even going to notice you won't
notice that your phone is a little bit
thicker but you will notice that it's
got a lot more run time the second way
manufacturers are trying to reduce the
battery use is to turn it off when you
don't need it now I'm not talking about
the whole device I'm talking about
adding either a nap or a control paddle
setting that lets you basically tell it
what you want to turn off when your
battery is getting low so this is what
Samsung has done with the galaxy tab 7 7
i'm in these settings and this is the
battery saving mode over on the the
right hand side that's my right not this
side you've got all these different
things that it does so when the when the
power gets low you can turn off your
Wi-Fi unless you're connected to an
access point which is good if you're
connected stay connected if you're not
connected stop looking essentially it'll
save quite a bit of battery life and
extend that small amount that you have
left even longer might be something that
you want to do regularly through some
other means and we'll cover those in
upcoming articles and upcoming episodes
of the android guy so make sure you
subscribe to the YouTube channel if you
haven't done so already we'll have a
link at the end so we'll make it real
easy for you the second thing this does
is bluetooth turn off the blue
tooth it's a radio it's broadcasting
it's receiving it's looking for
something to pair to even when it's not
paired yes it's in low-power mode but
low power still isn't no power it can
automatically turn off bluetooth gps I
don't need GPS unless i'm driving
someplace or looking for something be
perfectly frank I don't care if my
facebook posts and my twitter tweets
know where I am I want to save battery
life more than that so you can turn that
off entirely through a setting like this
data synchronization I don't care about
a new calendar update or a new gmail if
I've only got three percent battery life
left I'm probably not going to be able
to read it or reply to it anyway so just
don't tell me about them I won't miss
them you might not want to do that or
you might it's up to you you've also got
brightness now this is a big deal we're
going to come back to it okay hang on to
that and then it's cetera etc it's kind
of everything else where they put
everything that doesn't fit in and it's
just kind of more of the same so that's
what a lot of manufacturers are doing
some manufacturers are trying to reduce
battery use by including pre installing
and turning on a task killer now these
types of apps are kind of controversial
i'll let you have your own opinion of
that i don't particularly like them i
don't think they work all that well
they're trying to do something that the
operating system is already trying to
manage they're trying to do it better
now I don't know about you but I kind of
think that Google has a lot more people
working on android than some guy who has
some task killer in the market that's
just me but you see what I'm saying if
you've got a task killer that works
great fabulous let us know in the
comments what is it and doesn't help you
with your battery life that's what we're
after here in this in this video do you
have one that came pre-installed on your
phone from motorola samsung HTC LG
whoever it may be that does that and did
it help extend your battery life I'm
interested to find out I really haven't
seen anything one way or another the
last thing we're going to talk about is
the biggest thing and that's hardware we
talked about brightness any time you go
into your settings you're going to find
out that the biggest
consumer of all of the power is your
screen you'd be amazed how long these
things will last when you don't turn on
the screen if you don't believe me open
up Pandora fire up a station listen to
it I can listen all day long and just
take a little bit of a dent out of my
battery as long as I don't turn on that
screen so that's the biggest thing of
course you've got processors you've got
motherboards you've got all of these
other things that they're putting in
there they have to to make the phone
work but they're putting in things that
are doing more on one or two chips
rather than half a dozen ships that
saves power they're also doing things
with smaller chips with more efficient
chips they run cooler they run at lower
voltages they they consume less power to
do what they need you to do some
manufacturers most anymore i believe are
using the scalability properties that
are built into modern-day cpus so if
you're running something very very
computationally intensive should we put
it that way it's going to chew up a lot
of power because it's running full bore
if you've got a 1.5 quad-core its run
all four cores got confused because
there's one quad core that has five
course seems odd doesn't it anyway so
it's running off one of those cars at
1.5 gigahertz that's a lot of power I
don't need that when I'm just checking
my email so hey why don't we just run it
say 350 megahertz kind of interesting
you can run utilities on a lot of phones
that will tell you how fast the CPU is
running and it will scale up and down
based on what you're doing so very nice
I don't know of any of any manufacturers
that aren't doing that anymore so hey
kudos to you but we're still coming back
to screen what are they doing there
screen technology has to improve screen
lighting has to improve now does that
mean that we're going to light it with a
backlight and if so is that going to be
you know a fluorescent bulb is that
going to be LEDs is that going to be
OLED what's that going to be or are we
going to try and harvest some of the
ambient life around us and reflect it
back can we do that and still maintain
good crisp clear colors and deep deep
blacks see that's what they're doing and
it's hard for
them to do different screens have
different properties to them some take
more power than others pentile I know
you guys hate it but it's one of the
better out there as far as power
consumption goes sure there are others
that are better than that that's not the
only reason that manufactures choose
pentile displays but it is one of the
reasons so they're doing a lot to try
and extend battery life and it's really
a team effort it's not just the OEM it's
not just the manufacturer it's the chip
provider it's google who's making the OS
it's the customizations to that OS it's
the right drivers it's everything
working in concert but let's not forget
you really can't be the nice extended
battery so let us know what did what I
miss what do you guys see manufacturers
doing currently that we didn't talk
about what would you like to see them do
in the future to help them extend our
battery life is that bigger capacity
batteries and are you willing to
sacrifice some thickness and some weight
to get a bigger battery or do you want
to see them improve technologically by
improving the operating system or the
hardware that goes into the devices so
they take less power comment right down
there below will cover each one of these
topics in brief over at the website
pocketnow.com and of course we want all
the comments that you can to be over at
pocket now so we can aggregate everybody
all together in one place that's where
I'm going to be to answer all of your
questions for pocket now talking
batteries and manufacturers for the
android guy weekly i'm joe levi
well a big battery these days is around
300 mil amp hours 3,000 milliamp hours
hundred case there's some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
