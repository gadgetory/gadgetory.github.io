good good yeah mine too look at mine
so Huawei just brought us to experience
the porsche design mate 20 RS and we're
gonna test drive one of these that's
part of the show this is gonna be
fantastic I'm happy that I was pocket
now let's do this
really to do that safely to help you do
that we have two main elements the first
one is your Porsche diamond consultant
at all times when you're driving out the
facility you've got one of our driving
to you now we like to think we've got
the most highly qualified and highly
experienced team of instructors within
the UK three liter Biturbo so you can
see this one's got yeah that's the
standard steel breakers as well yes
again 911 Jen - this is insane I don't
know if I'm more excited about the track
than anything so which is your favorite
car
yeah
come on get out of the way
everyone meet cat she's crazy enough to
dry with me today and we're gonna
experience what a new gt3 so I know one
generation - yes so it's a four liter
naturally aspirated 500 brake cooling
rack up or you can see with ceramic
brakes as well yeah
so cat is gonna do the driving now
because one of the major issues with
previous Huawei devices with
civilization and 4k so I've asked cat to
drive the way she drives and I am
literally gonna strap myself really hard
so we're doing manual
of course
yes
seeing cat here making me feel so bad
about my driving right now
god I Drive so terribly I feel so
embarrassed right now
yes oh this is good do it
see the launch control mm-hmm okay so
you're just got to go into a PD case for
just a bit and then what we do is we
switch our feet round so you probably
can't see it the lever go left foot on
the brake and then you're gonna go full
power whilst you're on the braking and
then just drop the brake and then it's
gonna try and get off the line as
quickly as it can with minimal
Louisville okay show me how I was
supposed to do it and I sucked
this is great
[Laughter]
it's great
they're tzu they Meyer behind they know
you're better than them
they're not giving you a turn signal
everyone she's okay she's alive and in
one piece cat I'm so sorry I apologize
for my driving even even my bag didn't
like it this is great this was fantastic
and now for the reason we're really here
meet the new porsche design huawei mate
20 RS at a time when luxury phones are
either extinct or well dated and their
spec sheets this one is not it's
actually the first time that i've truly
felt inclined to even consider a luxury
focused special edition smartphone poor
design has spent decades garnering lots
of fame for making truly timeless
products in the may 20 RS
is no exception this would be the fourth
collaboration between companies with
this one being probably the most iconic
in my opinion the unboxing experience is
as porsche design as it gets it's a far
larger box for a couple of key elements
that are now colored in black instead of
the standard white inside we've got the
phone front and center and the card at
the top to confirm authenticity below
we've gotten more than your standard
phone we've got 240 watt fast charging
wall adapters one of UK and the other of
EU configurations two USB a two USB C
tables a pair of headphones with USB C
connection protective case that's
designed to blend with the phone and
then the essentials like literature sim
ejector tool and you guessed it the 3.5
millimeter headphone dongle the device
is simply gorgeous
there's an interesting finish that
blends leather with glass with the
leather being of genuine newest couch ID
which according to the company takes
four weeks to produce it comes in two
finishes black and red with the latter
being exclusive to China sadly it's
actually my favorite one one of its key
differentiating elements is that well
notice there is no camera hump porsche
design claims that they worked hard on
achieving this level of symmetry it's
actually really difficult to tell that
the make 20 RS is slightly thicker than
the made 20 pro in order to make this
possible internally the made 20 RS is
pretty much almost the same made 20 pro
well but some key additions we've got
the same Karen 987 nanometer processor
the same 4200 milliamp hour battery same
idly 68 water indus resistance and same
cameras what changes is that there's
only an a gigabyte of RAM option with
tears that go from 256 or 512 gigs of
storage the device also has its own
flavor of software essentials like
Porsche wallpapers audio tones the my
compact etc and you also guess that the
price is porsche design and before you
gag on those numbers just remember this
is a limited edition phone it's not
gonna be easy to find then it's
definitely not for everyone and yes is
it gorgeous oh my god it is probably the
phone that I would totally want to have
this year now I'm not gonna bore you on
the rest of the features given its
similarities to the made 20 pro so just
remember that our hands-on video is
