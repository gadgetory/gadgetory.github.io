things we kind of don't really have much
official information of what to exert
for the Samsung Galaxy s8 we aren't
expecting much of a showcase over what
this phone will be like at MWC but
here's a little round of the things that
we would like to see I'm hi I'm going to
be better with pocket now and this is
our wish list for the Samsung Galaxy s8
in addition to some detail starting off
with the rumors of the Samsung Galaxy s8
most of it is really a very similar
design but with some significant
differences first of all if you're
expecting anything other than glass or
glass that's not going to be the case so
the rumours show us that we are going to
have that same design but then a couple
of elements are rather significantly
different first of all the fingerprint
scanner is moving to the back and the
oddest placement that we have ever seen
mainly because there are two variants of
regular size variant and a plus variant
so imagine what it would be like to try
to touch that fingerprint scanner all
the way at the top right beside the
camera or the biggest problem which
would be that you'll most likely be
smudging the camera because you're
looking for the fingerprint scanner in
addition to that we also notice that
there will be different color options
apparently we have black gold and some
sort of orchid gray that we don't know
about but mostly what we do like is what
we see at the front we're noticing the
same curve display that we've seen in
the past but my god the bezels have
totally died in this new design which is
not sure if we are getting that Samsung
logo at the front but my god like if
Samsung does pull this design off that
thing is going to be beautiful
obviously the hardware buttons are
moving away something that we have been
waiting for for the longest time if you
think about specifications we really
haven't heard much we probably will be
getting a snapdragon 835 what we do know
is that there will be a new Exynos
processor starting with a nine and
probably two major concerns come when it
comes to specifications starting with
the battery apparently it will be the
same size of the galaxy note 7 at 3,500
milliamp hours and then the other
concern will be lamb apparently we're
not growing into six gigs of ram we're
staying at four if there's something
that Samsung needs in its phones its RAM
but by moving away from the roundup of
rumors if we had a choice right now
what would we
to see in the Samsung Galaxy s8 believe
it or not at least for me I think the
design is great as it is as we are
seeing in the rumors but what we would
like to see changes the user experience
Samson really needs to work on a couple
of things that are just basic but the
company hasn't really dealt with in the
past starting with number one software
the company wants to continue pushing
its UI and that's great the promise how
long the company takes to update the
software number two whenever it does it
is extremely buggy or makes the phone
even slower or three the biggest problem
is it really hits battery life
I even had cases in the Samsung Galaxy
s7 edge after using it for the last
couple of weeks where even the camera
wasn't performing the same but going
back to the battery probably the second
thing would be Samsung either figure out
battery life or do something that will
completely put all the Galaxy Note 7
problems to rest which would be Givens a
replaceable battery not expecting this
to happen mainly because Sam's and
continues to want to push its design
envelope and that's great probably the
third thing again focused on the fact
that we want to improve user experiences
if we're going to get phones that have
edge displays both variants then could
we please work on improving palm
rejection it was done good to a certain
degree on the galaxy note 7 but the
Galaxy s7 edge is terrible even on the
new new good update that I finally
received over the weekend even their
palm rejection is terrible these are
things that hinder the user experience
and make it uncomfortable for you want
to pick up the phone or to do basic
tasks there are times where I want to
take a photograph and I struggle because
I'm touching some part of the display
and it completely inhibits the phone
from detecting whenever I press the
shutter button for example these are
things that Samsung you really could
improve and I am sure that the company
will probably consider them but anyways
it leads me to the question of this
video if you have to change anything or
and prove anything from this Galaxy s8
that's coming what would it be
