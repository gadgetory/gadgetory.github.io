pocket now still at the ZTE booth at CES
2014 I bet you didn't expect to see as
much as you are from ZTE but they have a
lot to show up this year and this is the
sequel to last year's grand s the grand
s too let's check it out so as you might
have noticed on the intro when I said
grand s the device woke up of course not
going to do it now because demo gods but
the halo feature of the grand s2 when
you say hello grandes where you say
other type things there we go of course
the internet connection doesn't really
work in here but voice control is what
we're talking about and we're used to
seeing things like hi galaxy hello moto
X ok Google now blah blah blah blah blah
but there is a distinctive feature of
the voice control on this device if you
have in the settings menu and go on down
to security you're able to use as a
screen lock option sound unlock and the
phone will learn a particular phrase in
your voice only and will allow you to
use your voice to unlock the phone guys
we're not even going to try it in here
it is loud at CES you know how it is
it's not going to work and bless my
geeky phrase wouldn't be nearly
entertaining enough so we'll just tell
you about the rest of the device
split-screen multitasking is available
on this 5.5 inch 1090 20 x 1080 display
16 million color fhd around back on the
red back here there can be different
colors on this units may be specific to
different markets 13 megapixel camera 2
megapixels around front backed up by a
3000 milliamp hour battery and 16 gigs
of storage it's 150 grams in the hand
and that that metal on the hand feels
feels quite good trim on the chrome
there is a little glitzy for my taste
but I like on the screen rounds down
into the bezel there it's a little on
the thick side point 36 inches
underneath there Snapdragon 800
processor two point three gigahertz and
I just said Snapdragon 800 and and the
grandes woke up again and just to close
things out on the hardware side this is
of course the that's enough that's
enough now this is the driving mode that
CTE has built in which allows you to
control certain phone features there's a
lot here that we've seen on other
devices before but importantly a lot
that was not on last year's grand s good
to see improvement on this line will be
interesting to see these devices come to
different markets in the different
colors they will check out our other ZT
coverage from CES 2014 books we're
seeing a lot of stuff from this company
wishing a lot of stuff from every
company in fact Michael Fisher Tony
behind the camera CES 2014 stay tuned
for a lot more
