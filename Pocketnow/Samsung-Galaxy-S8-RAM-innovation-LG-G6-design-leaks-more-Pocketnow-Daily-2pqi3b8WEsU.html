will be faster than any other phone at
least in paper leak schematics of the LG
G six shows a very familiar design and
it seems that Nokia phones are actually
going to take longer than expected I'm
hi Mary that I and can you believe I
learned until today that I wasn't
supposed to work yesterday anyways this
is pocket out daily if I should lose
today begin with deals those of you that
want you to get yourself a very
affordable smartphone that was actually
very good last year the Moto G
third-generation again last year's Moto
G is currently ninety dollars on B&amp;amp;H and
I am not forgetting any digits that's
actually a very good option and for
those of you that are waiting for the
next generation Nokia's it seems that we
are going to have to wait a lot we were
expecting these to be announced at mwc
and that is a possibility they could be
announced at mwc the problem is that
according to trusted sources hnd is not
going to launch the first ones to the
market until q3 2017 yeah long wait and
even though most of us are extremely
happy with the whole move of blackberry
into TC LT sales design being part of
the new BlackBerry smartphones are great
and all apparently there is still one
last blackberry made design and it is
going to make its way to verizon it's
being codenamed the blackberry mercury
we're not exactly sure when we're
getting it but we do know that it would
be the last phone design in house from
Waterloo it could also mean that even
though TCL will build it again brings
legacy blackberry design we will see and
speaking of designs uh I really like the
design of the LG g5 even though it flop
because of its issues apparently we've
got some leaked schematics of the phone
at least the g6 what we're expecting to
be it successor and for those of you
that really didn't wanted that design to
change just wanted it to be refined the
schematics pretty much pull things that
direction not even sure if this phone's
going to be modular and if it does I do
hope that they figure this one out as
well obviously what LG needed was just
more time apparently that's what they've
been taking lately and finally the very
hot nurses they have to do with the
samsung galaxy s 8 and it's insane speed
according to his trusted source
apparently this will be not only the
first phone with 8 gigabytes of ram in
tow
but also we've got Universal flash
storage 2.1 currently it's 2 point 0 so
we will even be getting faster storage
speeds this could be the fastest phone
in the world when it launches and
according to the source it will be at
least in paper obviously it depends on
if Android is able to take advantage of
all this we assume it is but it leads me
to the question of the day do you think
that Sampson should bring us a very
powerful samsung galaxy s 8 more
powerful than anything and charge what
they currently charged for the Samsung
Galaxy s7 do you think that they should
just give comparable specs to everybody
else and price it a little more
aggressively in my case I think that the
company should innovate bring the fast
as the best in charge but that's just me
leave us a comment down below we'd like
to know your opinion friends you know
