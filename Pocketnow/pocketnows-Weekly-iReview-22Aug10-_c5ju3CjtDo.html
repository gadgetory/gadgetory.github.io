iOS 4.1 very soon Apple's new Panthers
your iDevice into a police officer in
iOS 4.2 gets jailbroken for the iphone
3gs sort of all this and more coming up
right now hello everybody I'm hi Nevada
and welcome to the pocket nail I review
the show we go through all the week's
cool and not-so-cool inside the world of
apples I devices let's start off with
the cool hot rumors think that iOS 4.1
is already rocking its third beta and
then it finally brings Game Center to
iOS devices now what is game center or
game centers what we've been expecting
for xbox live on Windows Phone 7 only
the with an iPhone kick now on the other
positive side is the fact that it
probably also brings the proximity
sensor fix that we've been expecting for
iphone 4 devices and even though there
are no mentions on the fact that it will
bring finally any sort of incentive
fixes we at least know the beta so far
from being launched because it's still
bad with tons of bugs so let's see what
happens speaking of iOS 4.1 rumors are
that there are test units out there
already that are not iphone 4 devices
these are the ipod touch for the ipad 2
we've been expecting and some sort of
mystery I device we have no idea about
now what can we expect well it could be
a smaller iPad it could be a larger
iPhone it could be a verizon iphone or
it could probably be the app-based ITV
that's been mentioned all around
whatever comes out anything's positive
let's just hope we see some sort of new
devices come out next month with the
Apple Keynote on the ipod devices on
other positive news iOS 4.0 point2 has
finally been jailbroken for iphone 3gs
devices sorry iphone 4 owners this is
not applicable to you now the problem
with this update is that it sadly is not
available for all iphone 3gs devices out
there it all depends on what bootrom
you're rocking so to know if the bootrom
you have is the one applicable follow
the link we're posting up right now for
you to have the tutorial to see if the
bootrom is applicable and then second if
you're still interested in jail broken
word of advice is sadly this jailbreak
is not as jailbreakme.com that we posted
earlier sadly you are going to have to
require a PC to have this jailbreak work
and obviously it's the old kamikaze way
of having your device being able to be
if you don't follow the right procedure
so proceed with caution if you're
interested on my advice is if you can
wait then probably just wait because I
know the dev team is working hard on
getting us the iOS 4.2 jailbreakme.com
feature as soon as they can so let's see
what it comes up first you know actually
debated whether to make this part of the
positive section but here it goes
Facebook has finally updated their iOS
application to bring their new places
features to iOS devices now the problem
of the feature is that yeah it's cool
you can share your location and it's
cool that if we go to the Eiffel Tower
you could actually take pictures and
share your thoughts and your friends can
actually you know get your thoughts
eventually whenever they go there now
the problem with this is that you know
friends could actually also know when
they're close to you and you know there
are friends you would like to share your
location with and there are friends you
don't so just proceed with caution with
this application you know I could
actually see the facebook developers
having a lot of time in front of the
computer and actually finding
serendipitous meetings to be cool but
that's not the case for everybody so
just watch your privacy and you know
just decide whether you want the
spacebook places application to work
with you or not now onto the bed so
Apple visited the patent office this
week and filed a really weird and long
name patent called system and methods
for identifying and authorized users of
an electronic device okay now that
sounds cool if somebody steals your
device but in plain English this means
that Apple can actually use the phone's
camera gps and features to actually
figure out who stole your device or who
is holding a device now the problem with
this update is we actually don't know if
Apple plans to use this on people that
have actually jailbroken the device
because the problem is it actually even
mentions that it could actually use your
heartbeats voice prints and any sort of
means possible to actually know who you
are so I mean the problem with the
update is Apple I actually only bought a
phone I'm not interested in a police
officer if that's actually going to be
the case then just let me know so that I
can move on to another platform now
let's go from the uncool to the terrible
everybody remember those really
ridiculous fart apps that would make the
apps
well it was actually developed by a
company named I was which was actually
owned by a guy named Phillip shoemaker
and the problem with Phil shoemaker is
aside from his bad taste for app the
fact that Apple has just hired him as
the new app store director so there goes
the neighborhood I mean this guy was
only interested in bringing for naps of
the app store what can we expect him to
ask from now I mean what's the next few
gaps I'll pass on to other news it seems
Sony's new PSP advertisement actually
takes a direct blow to I devices by
saying you can't play good games you can
only text your grandma and I'll say
right it seems over there the marketing
guys at Sony only have to rock sony
ericsson devices and they actually have
to carry a PSP around so I can
understand you guys now the only
positive note about this post is the
fact that yes PSP games are going down
and that's only because I devices came
to change the way things were done so
Sony guys PSP guys and marketing dudes
up get your act up I guess this wraps it
up for the week thank you very much for
watching any questions or comments you
have about this video let's know it
twitter.com slash pocket now tweets or
youtube.com slash pocket now video
that's it for now
