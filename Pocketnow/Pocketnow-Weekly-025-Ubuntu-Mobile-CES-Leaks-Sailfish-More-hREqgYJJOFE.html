weekly hello and welcome to episode 02
five of the pocket now weekly the first
podcast of 2013 in a series from
pocketnow.com where we discussed the
awesome and the awful in the world of
mobile technology from windows to
android iphone and everything in between
I'm your host Michael Fisher senior
editor at pocket now and I'm joined by
the man with the bronze ipad mini as
will become your new title I think
Brandon minimun good day to you sir good
day and by the man from Utah Joe Levi
the android guy how are you today
absolutely fantastic I am pleased to
hear that we had a very very minimum
amount of pre podcast chatter today so I
actually know nothing about how you guys
are standing in in the world and I would
love to know Joe how your uh how your
new year's was New Year's was fantastic
i actually made it up past midnight this
year yes playing Settlers of Catan oh
that's awesome that's such a fun game
did you have some people over the over
the householder was their family only
affair no we went over to our friend and
neighbors house our kids and their kids
spent all evening watching just horribly
terrible kid shows most of them had
Barbie princesses of some sort in them
as they should and the grown-ups tried
to keep ourselves caffeinated so we
could stay awake and not make stupid
mistakes lang road on settlers first
door that game and I think that's an
awesome thing to do and I receive and
second of all I I used to make fun of my
parents something fierce when they
couldn't make it to midnight on New
Year's Eve I was just so I was so
outraged that anyone would would not
want to see the actual thing do you
remember you like the you know the New
York City ball drop did you watch that
this year either of you oh yeah
absolutely that's what we do all the
time but remember i'm in utah so we
watch it at ten o'clock and that's good
enough we can go to bed after that ha
lucky you that's a good point i used to
think when i was a kid when I
like heard about the ball dropping I
used to think it was like they would and
I'm being sir I'm not being funny this
is what I thought I thought they would
get a really strong baseball pitcher to
like grab the to grab a baseball and
there was like a big ceremony at a
baseball stadium he would throw the ball
into the air and he was so strong that
it would take a year to come down that's
how I thought the new year was rung in
like legitimately when I was like four
did you not have television no i don't i
guess i didn't watch it enough i was
busy getting all the wrong messages from
Sesame Street I was busy like telling
people off and oscar the grouch quotes
so i don't know it's just amazing i even
watched the ball drop in new york city
in years now because I've been too busy
where we've just haven't planned the
evening right what did you do brand it I
didn't do that much I lost I watched a
lot of movies in the last week or two
one of which was pitch perfect have you
guys seen that know what's good about
it's about acha acapella groups oh yeah
glee the movie that's right is that what
it is I would people got yeah it's uh
it's such an awesome flick if you like
music at all and it's got some pretty
good actors in it it's just a really
good movie I feel like you told me about
that before and I need to put that aside
I need to put that on my watch list you
want to watch that in Vegas uh I don't
think long time and it's like we won't
have time and I just saw it four days
ago you're you're high um yeah I wish if
there's any video watching it's going to
be us editing our coverage and it's
arriving at ease that's right and we're
gonna have Jaime Rivera with us so we're
not gonna be able to watch the pocket
now daily like Tony and I did in Berlin
yeah yeah we will just incidentally
since CES is coming up next week we will
be podcasting live from CES I believe
just once but it's going to be a lot of
fun and we'll be in the same hotel room
and it'll be it'll be nice so that'll be
look forward to that yeah and and this
year we aim to be I mean in every trade
show we attend we try to be video heavy
so we can actually show you stuff and do
comparisons but this year we're taking
it up a notch we've got three people on
the ground which is more than we've ever
had and we're gonna have a lot of
comparisons a lot of hands-on out of
Michael a lot of me
a lot of high may and so the best thing
you could do actually subscribe to our
YouTube channel because there's going to
be a delay from when we upload the
videos to when they hit pocket now
because we own pocket now we have to
write them up put a nice image and so
forth on YouTube is just boom it's there
and ready to go Oh mm-hmm go light on my
content until then so you don't get
tired of me but that won't be too hard
because I feel like we've been in kind
of a this this post holiday content
trough for a minute like it's amazing to
see how slow the news feeds have been
have been moving in comparison to how
they were before the holidays I feel
like I feel like like y2k happened you
know and this is kind of like desolate
landscape with the occasional like leak
and so there's a couple things going on
but it's the incubation period this is
when all the good ideas happen because
everybody's at home with their family
back in the real life and I get to see
how the product X Y or Z could make this
better and then they go back with a
renewed fervor you know it's so true I
actually there there are at least two
editorial ideas that I've one of which
I've already written and the second one
is coming up tomorrow that yeah that
sprung directly from my time with the
family over the holiday and watching
kind of normal people interact with
technology and not just normal people
but older normal people I feel like
those are some of my favorite pieces to
write because they re ground me back in
this back in the real world instead of
this world where all s geeks know all
the gestures and why are you know why
don't normal people know this you know
so it's it's good to get out there for
some perspective in fact yesterday what
some don't know is that back in college
I had this sort of side job business
thing where I would help senior citizens
with their computers and those and and I
still have a couple of remaining clients
and I saw one yesterday she got a new
imac one of those really thin ones and
it was amazing to you know that it's
amazing hardware um but something
strange happened she needed Microsoft
Word and she didn't want PowerPoint or
Excel so every few years I think I do
the same search on Google how to buy
just a word you you can't so you have to
pay a hundred and twenty dollars for for
for Excel PowerPoint and word and then
I'm looking in the mac app store where
pages or yeah pages is nineteen dollars
I don't understand how Microsoft could
still have this motto I guess because
Bobo net is like me still cough up 120
bucks for one piece of software right
but it's just such a broken model that
Microsoft has it's unbelievable yeah I
don't know fortunately I don't have to
deal with much on device word processing
cuz my needs are not that great but I do
I did have an app purchase experience
though recently as a result of some
advice my roommate gave me and you guys
may have heard of this before and I'm
sure tons of listeners have but i am not
much of an iphone or ipad gamer I'm not
much of a mobile gamer at all but I was
faced with glowing reviews from my
roommate and friend Bob who informed me
that I absolutely must buy this game
called the room have you guys heard
that's so funny i just finished the room
a few weeks ago really but it's it's uh
it's it's ios-only right i I can't
confirm that but I do i do think it's
it's the truth and I don't generally
like puzzle games you know I'm not
really a big puzzle guy but this is so
well done and it's so creepy the
atmosphere is so unique and the graphics
are just so beautiful and it's so nice
and it's challenging in just the right
way without being frustrating and
there's enough hints if you get stuck
it's it's really what was it brenda was
at 499 or something like that yeah it
was around there did you find yourself
using the hints often or did you get by
without them I started off with this
really noble idea that i wouldn't use
any hints and bad i think about 45
minutes into the game i was like you
know what these are actually quite
helpful and i'm just gonna get
frustrated without them so i don't think
anyone could actually play the game
without the hints and did you get to the
end I have not I'm actually not even
probably halfway through how long did it
take you to play all the way through
this awesome meets puzzle it's really
not that long you know there's a box
within a box within a box and then
there's another box there's there's like
three boxes maybe four right and it
doesn't take that long probably about
five hours of gameplay oh it's you know
that I'm gonna save it and listeners I
mean I don't often advocate games but
you just need to look at the reviews for
this one I think there's something like
45,000 reviews and it's almost a perfect
five-star rating and a little hint
if you can play it on if they have an
iphone version and then the ipad version
played on the ipad 3 i put it on the
ipad mini and if there's two minutes
there were too many jagged edges and
then i went and played it on the ipad 3
i'm like wow this is unbelievable for
that Retina Display yeah yeah so let's
see if we can let's see how Joe Levi's
doing it was still absent Joe I little
patches of silence but that point I can
pick a most okay he is switched to a.m.
sound I decided 802 11 n was just too
much so I'm going back to 802 11 be that
way you sound like you're calling from a
cell phone somewhere in the in the in
the Sahara okay can you hear me now mmm
there we go now it's clear that's much
better it's bizarre it's a Bermuda
Triangle of Utah today ah ok so we've
got we've got Joe Levi back after a
little bit of a audio issue and we need
to jump into news and surprisingly
incredibly um there's a lot of new
platform news out this week like I guess
this holiday season was the season for
all these nascent platforms to come out
of the woodwork and say hey we've been
working for a while and we've got
something beautiful to show you so we've
got what you bun to Ubuntu sailfish and
open webOS and they're all three of them
have have big news this week so Brandon
and I were talking about this pre show
and I think Brandon you've got probably
more organized thoughts than I do
because I've just watched all three of
these I've just gotten caught up on all
three of these just before the show so
let's let's talk about it i mean what
excites us most and Joe I didn't mean to
exclude you anybody what excites us most
about this what always excites me about
a new mobile operating system is that
someone someone that had to be pretty
smarter a group of people had to sit
down and create new paradigms new way of
doing things a new wave new ways of
thinking about things and it's it's very
unnatural for us because we know the
Windows Phone way we know the Android
way we know the iphone way but to have
to like learn something new um you know
it's it's a little bit of a challenge
which is why you know there's this you
bunt to for smartphone video out there
that that is about its pretty long as 20
minutes only
half of which is actually the phone and
you gotta kind of watch it a few times
to get it or else at first you're gonna
say this is two different I can't I
can't imagine how I'd ever want to use
this what what I think is most
interesting about you bun to is the way
that you switch apps like in in all
their operating systems do you guys use
fast app switching a lot or do you just
kind of stay in the same map and go back
to your home screen oh I never go back
to the home screen know if there's a
multitasking functionality built into
the OS I will use it like I will try and
get that cards modality back that I
appreciate it from webos he had and and
have you ever met somebody who doesn't
know that they can they can use fast app
switching and they always go back to the
home screen like mom or dad totally
totally absolutely and and then you show
them and you're like look you just
double tap the home button or you just
tap and hold the home button and look
you get out you can see all your
programs and there and they look at you
like why would I ever want this like oh
why wouldn't you ever want this this is
the like this is this is the best way to
be productive a smartphone so anyway the
problem with all the idea all operating
systems right now is that to get to the
fast app switcher it's behind an action
wall so on the iphone i think it's the
probably the fastest double tap and
android is a tap and hold of the home
button or if it's a Nexus device with
on-screen buttons you just tap one
button which is probably the best and
then a Windows Phone it's a tap and all
of the back button in an ubuntu it's a
swipe from the right edge of the screen
which which makes it real easy to go
back to the previous appt the problem is
the reverse doesn't work if you swipe
from the left edge you get a list of
programs instead of going back to the
previous app if they were to fix that I
think it would be a not a revolutionary
way too fast apps which book one of the
most fluid efficient ways to do so so
that I completely agreed that I was
going to say the same exact thing Ubuntu
uses the mobile app excuse me the mobile
platform of you want to uses all four
corners or all four edges of the screen
for specific gestures it's a lot like
Windows 8 in my experience on the
surface but it also has the same
intuitiveness problems where eight and
that's exactly one of them you swipe in
from the left and you get your your
recently used apps and stuff and I like
that that agric
recent stuff into a list but you swipe
from the right and it goes back to the
previous app which is wonderful but then
when you try and duplicate that
functionality by going over to the other
side of the screen is saying ok so I
want to go back to the one I was at
before I switch oh wait no now I'm in
the recent list so it's but you know
it's something that you have to that I
think you could get used to pretty
easily but like you say it would just
take time it would take a learning
process I wasn't turned on as much by
their whole philosophical the
philosophical talk of like we don't want
to lock screen to like to keep you from
your apps because we think it's wrong to
keep you from your apps it's like no
right you just I mean you know you're
doing something different and I
appreciate that but lock screens have a
real utility and that's to prevent your
apps from going free in your pockets you
know yeah and then and then so they
don't have a lock screen yet there's
this like way you can unlock the lock
screens yeah you like swipe something
and then it like on lok SI right so they
really do have a lock screen they just
think they don't like using that term
because you know it's 22 comments to
yeah yeah good i thought there was
instead of having a lock screen that has
specific apps that you can get into that
have to be specially coded for the the
lock screen to be able to work or
widgets on the lock screen or whatever
their lock screen is kind of there but
you can get into other apps it is a
quick launch basically i want to launch
this particular app in it launches and
unlocks at the same time the curity on
that I don't know there bhuntu so their
security heavy and we'll see how that
works I I'm not sure I do like how the
lock screen are them the front screen
whatever they call it the facing screen
has this kind of there's an there's a
kind of circular animated pulsating
light show that is it's not necessarily
subtle but it's not too flashy but
apparently it changes over the course of
your use of the phone so it evolves to
to kind of reflect you there was a big
push on the video the guy was like it's
like a fingerprint it's like and by the
way I'm sorry I don't mean to keep
calling him the guy who did who did the
video I feel underprepared do you know
who was on who was the host of that
video it's that that british guy oh oh
right okay well i was right then
anyway it you know they say it's like
this very unique signature it makes the
phone yours and that's you know it's
cool they've obviously made some really
big strides toward making a unique and
cool UI they've brought back this kind
of the just type experience from webos a
little bit where there's a persistent
search bar near the top of the screen
like on Android but you know and you can
search the device and the web at the
same time which is nice but there's
there's a lot of new UI paradigms at
work between the recently aggregator
stuff commit I'd imagine the physical
thing that you're talking about where it
can show you a variety of notifications
they have it showing how many tweets you
have how many messages you have what
your how many how much talk time you
have left I imagine they're not going to
keep that because usually you want to
see more than just one piece of
information and I guess it's going to
learn that like first thing you do when
you turn on your phone as you go to
Twitter so it's gonna always show you
tweets or your battery is getting low so
it's gonna show you how much talk time
you have left but like what if you want
to see your messages and how much talk
time you have left I I think that that's
going to be changed you know what and
maybe it'll be flippable like that
Motorola circles widget that I love that
would be neat or you can like take your
finger and rotate it around the die
exactly and that's what it looks like
you can do that it mean it it looks like
that that functionality is if it's not
built in already it will be but there's
a I want did you see the part in the
video about the apps I was it was about
to to kind of talk about that today no
apps are our first-class citizens yeah
well html5 apps are first-class citizens
web apps are first-class citizens that's
that's the breaking point so yeah so
there's another thing with as far as
absco there's web apps which are you
know prioritized on the new view bun to
mobile it seems but there have tie-ins
to the Notification Center so as a
result they can control things like
little envelopes and the status bar and
stuff like that which i think is unique
right I've never met a web app that can
can do that I guess it's just a generic
like notification service thing that
should work on multiple phones and I've
never heard of any web app doing that
natively on the phone so I guess it's a
new kind of API that developers would
have to tap into right and you know I I
think that was cool and I
so that got me pretty excited for a
second where I was like oh wow this is
something new what are they going to do
because the whole question in my mind
and I think the whole question in
anybody's mind when they're watching a
new platform a video of a new platform
is well what are you going to do about
the app situation cuz that's that's the
question you know blackberry is gonna do
their thing where they run android apps
and that's that's a really cool you know
idea do we know if this can run android
app since it's based on android right
you and I don't maybe when we get Joe
Levi back in the air he'll be able to
weigh in on that yeah so the other thing
about having web apps as first-class
citizens is for example I I know there's
a wikipedia app but I don't want to
download it for some reason I guess I I
don't want to be that smart so what I do
is I have a Wikipedia bookmark and I go
there often I'll and they're off and on
Google if if Wikipedia on my phone was
treated like an app that would mean a
few things one I would see it uh with
its nice little Wikipedia icon in the
app switcher so I could switch more
quickly to and from it to its state
would but we may be safe eight so
whereas if I enter it from the browser
it's got to reload the page and if
enough time has gone by maybe it's been
kicked out by other browser tabs if it's
a first-class app it never gets kicked
out and three I can manipulate it more I
can put it into in the case of you bump
to it hangs out in that little side
thing in your favorite apps you can link
it in various parts of the operating
system on your launcher if this were
Android that we were talking about so
there's a lot of really interesting
advantages of having web apps as as
treated like applications there are and
it goes beyond notifications and it's
really exciting to do that and I was
really excited because that's you know
how I'm like okay this is how they're
going to overcome not having an
installed you know not having a pool of
hundreds of thousands of apps to draw on
but then there was this part in a video
that I think they did their best to
gloss over it was like but web apps
can't do everything and sometimes you
want to natively code adapt their
beautiful and their performance is great
and they're great for games he's
basically running down the whole list of
everything we already know about why
apps are important and then he's like
and we've got a great SDK for that and
then they kind of move on and I'm like
wow really ok so fruit for legit stuff
that needs an
app you still are going to happen
developers are still gonna have to code
for now a fourth platform that's the
proposition here I will shave my head
the day when a new platform within the
next five years comes around with an SDK
and there are enough apps to cover all
of your needs after a period of time in
other words I don't think that even with
this SDK even with you know the openness
of you bunk do in the name recognition I
don't think this thing will ever have
enough apps to where we can call it a
home you know what I mean right and I
think it's so it's early to make any of
those kind of calls but I mean that's my
gut feeling as well because I walk
around with my windows phone and I think
about this this dev thing all the time
and even windows phone which is you know
getting close to 200,000 app so if it's
not there already I still get this
impression that when a developer and Joe
you can tell me if I'm right or wrong
here when a developer is like coding
absence like okay I got the iOS one I
got to the Android one at some point and
then there's this kind of like there's
this deep breath and it's like oh jeez
and I gotta do windows phone to Mike do
I have to do windows phone can I get out
of that may wait until Microsoft throws
me some money you know I feel like that
will only be exacerbated with a fourth
platform you know as a web for that's
kind of the all-in-one flying language
and unifying source information even the
apps that we run on our phones are their
web fed instead of everything for the
app you know that you face and whatnot
from the web they're getting all data
from the web and that's not going to go
away we found and this is kind of
telling and I think it I think it
doesn't bode well for the web app as a
first class citizen model Facebook made
their entire app in html5 it essentially
was just a container that was a inandhra
that app that consumed the ha5 special
mobile version of Facebook for the
device they abandoned it I wonder if and
and I I wonder why you know the in the
Facebook situation where they used in
html5 web site the performance wasn't
good as a native app was that beak was
it because the browser doesn't have good
enough performance or as
because native apps just have much much
better performance potential because
they can tap into the hardware in a
better way well the reason is when
you're talking about a native app
consuming data all you're doing is
asking for that data and the app itself
controls the the user interface it
controls the animations it controls all
of the all of the pretty is that we
think a native app should have with it
when you're using html5 still that
limitation where it just doesn't look as
good it doesn't function as well because
it's its lowest common denominator it's
got a working for every day you're
essentially running an app within an app
and that alone kind of makes impossible
I've I mean I wonder if when we have
octa core phones with seven you know 75
gigabytes of RAM if we go back to
Facebook touch web app if it would match
the performance I guess I guess it would
whenever because it you know that the
native app is still using those you know
eight cores and seventy five gigabytes
of RAM so okay so let's let's let's jump
this dive into that real quick before we
move on to another platform I want I
want to ask I want to just get that app
question cleared up I mean Joe we didn't
get a really high level view of your
opinion on this on the Ubuntu situation
because we're having technical
difficulties so from a UI standpoint and
from a nap development standpoint what
do you think the future of this platform
is well they're putting in a lot a lot
of eggs in the html5 app basket if you
will and that's that's not a good thing
we were talking about how Facebook
abandoned the html5 tech that they had
inside their android app and went with a
native Android app and the reason behind
that is when you're sending data to an
app on any platform you have a data feed
and that data feed is relatively
lightweight it's usually JSON JavaScript
object notation which is it's
lightweight it's fast it contains the
critical data and it pushes that down to
the device or gets pulled down to the
device depending on the perspective and
it's just quick everything that happens
with that data feed is all controlled on
the device
in the app and it's its native it's
quick its responsive it's pretty it's
fluid when you try and do that with
html5 you can accomplish many of the
same things but because it is html5 and
because you've got all of those web
technologies involved instead of just
pushing the content down to the page
you're also pushing it all of the the
user interface all of the the libraries
the JavaScript libraries that everything
to make the appt look and behave like
you want it to and that's never going to
be as fast as a native app you're not
using native libraries you're using this
other JavaScript library and you're
running it through a browser so like
Brendan was saying it's like running a
nap inside a nap and yes it works but
it's kind of like working for the lowest
common denominator it's something that
you do to make your your product or
service look okay until you can do it
right by creating a native app for it
which and that makes a lot of sense of
what you say looking okay I mean like
you if you capture a screenshot of a web
app or if you do a render of your new
smartphone running up like say the
Facebook web app it actually looks
really great it's not until you start
interacting with it and you start seeing
that lag and you know that the like the
page moving from side to side in the
browser that you really realize it like
well i would really prefer a native app
and i'm on your the difference between
native app and html5 app and it's
unfortunate that the experience isn't
yet to the point where you can't tell
the difference and not know what it is
you know where i'm going with that if
you can get to a point where you don't
know if it's a native app or an html5
app it doesn't matter anymore and what
kind of it kind of happened happened
backwards with facebook i mean if they
did this and you know five years when
phone phones had 10 cores and you know
120 gigabytes of ram you know i think it
would have been a different story and
this html5 thing is awesome because they
don't have to go through any of the app
stores to update their apps they just
push it live and and this it's the same
exact experience across every device
it's great but that you know I think
that a lot of you know I want to say
that a lot of the hardware out there had
trouble with the the Facebook touch
experience in the in the browser but
like you take a modern phone like the
iPhone 5 or Lumia 920 you go to touch
doubt facebook.com it's always slower
than the native app yeah I think that
there are ways to fix some of that just
through you I and I don't mean fix web
app performance because we've just
covered why that's kind of going to be
destined to be inferior for a little
while but you can I think people will
put up with that to a certain extent not
much but if you have a beautiful not
just you i not just a pretty you I but a
useful you I that actually does make up
for your lost lost time and web apps
with saving your time in other areas I
think that's really important and I
think you want to looks like it'll do
some of that particularly with its
search bar and it's it's almost kindle
like obsession with what's recent
because you can just swipe off insight
what did I recently do and whether
you're talking about a book a web page
of some music you were listening to a
person you were texting like it
organizes everything chronologically in
in one part of the UI and i think that's
that's that's compelling that's
something we haven't seen outside of a
tablet I don't think and if we have I
forgot it so it wasn't that great so I
don't know I think this is this is
exciting i'm a little more excited than
I than I was when it when it dropped I
think you mostest you go ahead brain I
said I think that one of the most
exciting things is that within just I
think a few weeks this is gonna be
available on the Galaxy here available
to install the Galaxy Nexus the
performance will be poor but like that'd
be fun you know uh ya know and but
unfortunately the downside is that a
hardware won't be available officially
running it until what early 2014 um x
moco and that's really frustrating
because uh you know we have no idea
we'll have octa-core then right two gigs
ram soda little run fine any guesses on
what company would say yeah I want to
make an ubuntu phone HTC tte while we I
I would I did the agency's an
interesting thought because what these
deese company you know Samsung HTC LG
they all need to start thinking about
diversifying because all of their eggs
are an Android when some of them have a
little
in Windows Phone which I don't think is
doing much for them at this point and
you know III could see a company like
HTC investing in ubuntu I don't know how
that how it's setup if it's you know if
it's even a for-profit entity but um I
could be it an oem getting an exclusive
on you bunt to and really pushing it
hard and offering something different
although I don't know what like the
headline feature would be like what
would the marketing message be right
because windows phone is already doing
the whole beautifully different thing
they're already pushing the angle of you
know you've never used anything like
this an ubuntu would have to do
something similar because i think that's
their big value proposition it's like
yeah you know if it were me and if it
were just me off the top of my head i
would probably say something like you
know they have to push it as not just
different better different you know like
nonce is different for the sake of being
different this actually helps you out
they could probably make a series of
commercials just on that lack of a
lockscreen thing you know I mean it
would be that certainly companies have
done worse well it's in their video they
were talking about hey this is the same
operating system that you run on your
desktop that you run on your laptop that
you run on your super computer in your
home from the video right and now it's
running on your phone so I'm just
wondering how many people out there
first of all are running linux on their
desktop computer yes and knowing it
really is it is but then again of those
how many are using Ubuntu and of those
how many are then going to say I want
that on my phone we're talking a very
very small percentage of the field if we
go with the marketing message that was
presented in that keynote video that
we've got up there which is they should
do yes it's a cop-out though it but it's
a clever cop out because you bunt to on
the phone is definitely different than
you bunt to on the desktop they've had
to introduce all these new gesture
paradigms and the way things are
organized it's not this it's not like
you're taking out a little mouse and a
little keyboard but they they really
they really spoke to me when they you
know had a bunch they had like I'm a
macbook pro on the screen and an ipad
and iphone said these aren't you know
it's not the same experience and they
had you know a windows computer and then
a windows friend said it's not same
experience but you bunt to is like the
same
thing on a phone but then once they got
into it you know it sounded like the
same thing that Apple did when they said
we made this new operating system it's
based on OS 10 but it's made for touch
and and it's like great it's based on it
but it's incredible entirely different
there's nothing to do with one another
except for maybe the core yeah what job
actually let's do an interesting
exercise let's think of we're never
gonna get out of the third race oh
that's good well let's think of
characteristics words that can define a
mobile operating system like different
like Windows Phone or beautiful like
Windows Phone or or or flexible like an
with Android or more easy like iOS yeah
and it well it used to be stable like
iOS but now I think that that can be
applied across all three yeah yeah not
like regimented like iOS but are we are
we sticking to positive ones or we just
positive ones like when I was thinking
is natural like it figures out how you
want to you know interact I mean windows
one does that to an extent but more
intelligently like you know yes yet you
this would be I mean intuitive is really
overused as far as UI design goes but
that would be a good a good adjective
for this once you get to know their
gestures so they haven't talked about
this yet but they have to because it's
Ubuntu Ubuntu literally means community
not just the own community in open
source and in working together but as a
whole working together for for the
betterment and I know I've got boo boo
fanboys are going to flame me because
that's that's a dump down simplification
of translating what it's supposed to
mean but stick with me it's it's about
making a product better together the
doing it yes quite often and just
continual improvement for the betterment
of everybody not just the betterment of
you or them or developers or users but
for everyone working together that's
that interesting stew sell this platform
that's so interesting because a lot of
consumers have this this like this
dislike grunge this no no no this this
anger I think towards all
the software companies who promised
these updates don't especially in
android but kind of an iOS because in
iOS you really don't get software
updates that are major but once a year
but maybe you bunt to could be the phone
where you get you know monthly updates
your phone is constantly getting better
because of this community aspect I think
that could be a very interesting selling
point oh yeah but with the community
working on it i could see how that kind
of pace would be sustainable but how can
quality control be accomplished in that
amount of time a minute you know i feel
like it takes forever for updates to
come out for a reason and then even when
they do come out after waiting for six
months it's like the first day there's
like a forum thread that starts up
somewhere where it's like list your bugs
with the galaxy s3 software update here
it's like it's already up to page 19 you
know so I i would get frightened about
that and I feel like I feel like even a
common user the minute that that starts
happening they're like all right peace
out well maybe maybe that's the that
would be the trade-off I mean I'm sure I
don't know how you bun to works now but
I'm sure they have systems in place for
quality control so when a new update is
pushed through and I don't know how
often the updates are pushed it when
it's pushed through it it's it's stable
and and working pretty well but you know
there might be bugs and people that use
you bunt you are totally used to that
and they're happy and fine with that
because that means they get you know
constantly improving software so maybe
maybe you want to / phones will be four
different counties are that wouldn't
mind that stuff but would want to
constantly profile you know what has to
happen what has to happen with all these
new platforms coming out is the that
needs to stop being the attitude and
Brennan I agree with I'm not saying I
disagree with your view but we are
reaching a point where we can no longer
say I think this new phone is going to
be for a totally different kind of user
because we're running out of kinds of
users and it's gonna I think that the
question is going to have to become is
this new phone for for somebody's second
phone because I think that's that's
going to become even more common than it
is right now because my Twitter handles
captain two phones because I'm an idiot
and I've always done it just as a hobby
I've always had kind of two phones
because I like different UI interaction
but people carry two phones all the time
for work and for personal I mean that's
the most commonly cited situation where
people carry two phones
and I think that maybe if this hasn't
happened in a year or two there's going
to be a real missed opportunity on
marketing and advertising departments be
like you already carry two phones why
not make your second phone one you
really like using I don't know I don't
totally especially as landlines go away
you don't think that that'll be the case
I don't think I think the a tiny little
minut fraction of the population carried
to phone and two funds in fact there's a
recent movement to move away from that
when the whole enterprise was doing
blackberry and the personalized iphone
and now enterprises are allowing you to
carry an iphone i think the more
relevant question the more relevant
point is what's going to be your next
phone that's what's going to be your
second phone and and don't forget most
people i think it's you know if you have
two phones you're paying for two data
plans and two phone lines and that's how
could you ridiculous not if one of them
is work supplied cuz yeah i mean of
course work is allowing iphones in there
allowing android phones and what about
the people who don't like iphone
whatever the people who don't like
android you know I mean they want their
personal phone to be something else but
I feel like I feel like that's easier to
do it's easier if you have a house that
you live in that you know you're not
going to have to move out of when you
also rent an apartment on the side for
whatever nefarious purposes you need
it's a lot easier to change your your
side apartment it's a lot easier to move
out of your side apartment into another
side apartment than it is to move from
your your main house because I mean like
I just I just think that when you're
asking someone to change the only phone
they use you're asking them to do the
ecosystem jump and all that kind of
stuff but there's there's there's Roman
therefore for a second phone pitch I
think you want here's here's where that
are going to win ubuntu is about
community and it's about people who want
to do things their way it's also about
people who want privacy and people who
want security now take android take iOS
take windows phone and try and write an
S mime encrypted email now a lot of you
just glazed over said what is that I do
that for fun man I I know you do
Emmanuel's I'm it has manual control so
so for those of you who don't know s my
email really fast whenever you send an
email you're sending a postcard across
the internet that is the literal
paradigm it's not when you send a letter
to Mom a handwritten letter or a typed
letter whatever if you do that anymore
you take that you write it you put it in
a security envelope that has the
security printing on the inside so you
can't hold it up to the light and look
through it you you lick that seal you
seal it shut and as soon as that letter
is sealed it's a felony for anyone to
try and open that and get at it other
than the intended addressee if you have
a postcard that you're sending from Cabo
that just goes through in anybody along
the line who's in the postal service or
the delivery chain can look at your
picture look at your message and okay
that's neat you know Brandon's in Cabo
for the holidays and send it along the
line they can read that emails are the
same way any email today that you send
goes out across the internet and anyone
in the middle can read that it's a
postcard s/mime lets you encrypt that
and essentially lock it up inside that
sealed envelope and send it along the
way I can do that on my desktop computer
somewhat easily because I know how but
on mobile devices I can't do that I
can't encrypt stuff I can't keep things
private as they go to and from
especially with gmail I can't do that
lubuntu especially for phones that's
their selling point you want privacy you
know what security this is your phone
nobody else does it well that's that's
all the other point yeah i never knew
that at all huh well and all of a sudden
the little different well i think
i think that's that's good to know and i
think we should we should move on from
ubuntu i think this is our first podcast
talking about anything you Monty related
is it the liquid you or is it not is it
ubuntu or is it you bun to or what i've
heard it pronounced ubuntu i think
that's right and I apologize for calling
something platinum well I do not stand
behind firmly behind my must pronounce
EA shin as I will later when i
mispronounced three out of four listener
mail
names just up into and everybody's be
gonna be happy yeah they do you OS well
I think it was good that we covered it
rather exhaustively but we do with there
are other platforms that also have been
in the news this week and we need to
move on and I know less about this but
the OS from I'm going to say it right
yola is how you pronounce it not jolla
as i think i said a few times and other
podcasts is sail fish has had a little
bit of a hands-on treatment from
engadget from miram shah and it also
looks compelling as a new OS now correct
me if i'm wrong guys these are the guys
that split off from nokia and took kind
of what they've been working on with me
go to make a new OS right yeah yeah it's
it's it's a similar and a lot of ways to
me go but I I think it looks it's it's
more easy to understand and then ubuntu
how do we decide that you boot into
ubuntu ubuntu a lot of double o's i
think in and then we're going to hold it
on pole yes so so what I like about
sailfish is that the way that it your
home screen are apps but it's kind of a
combination between they can be icons
they can be widgets or they can be kind
of like a frozen state of your app like
the last screen that you were looking on
and I think that's a really cool way
because you know you usually deal with
you know you're pretty much focused on
apps when you're using a phone another
cool thing that it does is this top menu
system with the gesture where you pull
down from the top and you don't even
have to select the item at the top the
magnitude that you pull down the
distance that you pulled down determines
which menu item is selected so you can
access these menus so fast by pulling
down and then it's gotten this idea just
to kind of go through one two three then
it's got this idea where you can take an
image and turn it into your system theme
where it changes the colors of the UI it
applies a background and most screens
and blurs the background just the right
amount so you can still see your content
I think it's so much better thought out
than Ubuntu and you know I i I'd much
rather spend some time with that based
on when I saw in this video correct me
if I'm wrong but I'm looking at the the
wiki article out at sailfish OS org and
the SDK makes it look like it's a very
much linux based OS in the true
linux-based not the android linux based
am I reading that right no no you maybe
I'm not entirely sure okay so if that is
right i'm looking at you know all of
this crossover between what we just
talked about native apps and SDKs for a
mobile linux that would be synonymous
here so there's a potential that we
could have cross platform between at
least these two apps and maybe even work
together you know you write one app and
run it in multiple places well that's
that's the dream right I mean like that
that would be incredible if that were
theoretically possible I just want a
phone that runs every app from every
operating system and it's sooner why so
do so badly you know I would probably
pay as much as I would like fruit feel
like I'm not like a car but like a used
car I'd probably pick a couple thousand
dollars i'd probably save up for a
little while for a phone that could run
any app so you're talking about the the
vm alas the the vphone what the v phone
OS a vm phone OS lens it runs virtual
machines so you you'd run everything on
it so it just a is it does it do it well
I mean that sounds tough a part where it
have to yeah it's good to say does this
does this exist is this from the 24th
century no it doesn't exist but I also
want it in a tricorder buddy yeah what's
exciting to me about selfish is that and
I we can't talk about this as long
because I think none of us are as
familiar with it as we were the the you
word is is that it's based on a UI that
looks certainly maybe not better thought
out but you know just different is
it's still different but it looks a
little bit more simple it looks a little
simplified and it's still really focused
on being beautiful the fonts choices are
really awesome Brandon like you said you
can take an image and use that images
color palette to modify your UI palette
I mean like you know it's got some cool
stuff and it's got that fun stuff we
liked for me go with the notification
panel off to the side and you know
pulling down on the stuff and it looks
great but I think this one this is
certainly closer to launch isn't it I'm
kind of like mining the fact file right
now to look forward it's like final
product sometime in the first quarter of
this year yes so it could be any day now
I know right i I don't know these guys
going to be at at CES did we find that
out they will be there and we're trying
to see what we can do about getting a
meeting yes so another CES plug for for
next week if you've forgotten since the
beginning of this podcast so I and it
finally just to close out the new
platform discussion open webOS has it
continues to improve and it has been
ported now to the nexus 7 which is kind
of this giant this culmination of an
awesome desire on the part of the webos
community for a 7-inch tablet which was
going to be realized by the touchpad go
back in the day that the miniature
version of the HP touchpad which was
cancelled literally I think days before
its full production was to was to begin
and the Nexus 7 is much sleeker much
smaller device than the touchpad go was
going to be and it's really really going
to be cool to see webOS on a 7-inch
display unfortunately it's still in
alpha state so we've had this thought I
have I have this ready and everyone on
Twitter thank you so much for telling me
repeatedly about this because you know
that i love webOS and the minute that
this exit its alpha state I i have a
Galaxy Nexus thanks to Jaime Rivera here
in the Boston office i also have a nexus
7 i will i will load that as soon as
there's legit hardware acceleration and
as soon as it's actually you know usable
and the guys that the open webOS
projects are doing a great job and there
making a lot of fun project I think my
favorite part about this whole thing
excuse me fun progress my favorite part
about the open webOS to Nexus 7
port was that it was apparently done
largely by many people were involved it
seems but it was spearheaded by a kid
who was excuse me a guy who was home
from college on his holiday break so the
point is I really didn't take that long
yeah or maybe he's just a genius oh it
may you know maybe both of those things
are true um yeah I'm thinking both of
those are true we've got a lot of really
smart people in the community yes
speaking of the nexus 7 a little thought
and maybe this is a nice segue into
Android um yeah we saw in the news good
I am amazed by how people love the Nexus
7 unlike any other product I think I've
ever seen released I mean people have
put away their iPads they've put away
their 10-inch tablets and they have with
open arms except the nexus 7 as their
favorite device and they use a constant
both of you guys use a nexus ntment
probably constantly right absolutely I
love it yeah it's it's my daily tablet
yeah and and you know it would have been
mine if I could get past the color
saturation issue but the point the point
is that this has been a very very
popular device for for google + 44 asus
and they're still sold out last i
checked or maybe just a few days ago
there they finally have some inventory i
can't wait for the next one because
they're obviously going to fix the
screen problem that's that's my best
guess and it's it's not too far off now
this you know summer last year is when
we got the nexus 7 and like I'm just
trying I'm sort of fantasizing about the
ways that then the new Nexus 7 could be
better it's going to be thinner and a
better battery life have a better screen
probably a higher resolution screen and
of course it's going to have that
awesome form factor so i can't forget
away i can't wait either but you know i
am a little scared and i'll tell you why
every time there is an improvement to a
product that is like the Nexus 7 which
is kind of built like a tank and it's
got soft touch and it's like you can
kind of throw it around without feeling
too much guilt because it's hard to
scratch it because it's built like a
like a running shoe or something any
time there's an move made to improve a
product like that it usually results in
something that is yes thinner but also
agile dainty r yes it
more agile and here's a think prettier
and you feel like you you you are going
to be breaking it or you're going to be
scratching it you're going to be and I
don't want to feel that way I want to be
able to throw the thing around let me
let me sort of put your fears to rest
maybe one of the reasons the nexus 7
feels so good in the hand and is so
durable and built like a tank is because
it's made out of plastic which is cheap
they did that to keep the price low that
and all Nexus devices going into the
future are going to be more affordable
than not and so it's you know that that
bodes well if you want a device that
feels about the same these is that you
know soft touch plastic on the back and
the the plastic instructions so I think
they're going to stay with plastic
construction I hope so yeah I mean I
guess the only substitute material that
i think i would be happy with would be
would be polycarbonate and not you know
not with the glossy finish on it but
something like HTC did with the 1x I
think that would be fun but it would
also be more slippery so maybe I just
maybe just will we'll see I can't wait
until the rumors start rolling in either
but we have a lot of a lot of leaks on
smartphone lineups in the Android
section and if we can let's just power
through these because these are all is
all kind of the same story right it's
right before CES some companies are
getting ready to present and we have
leaks from three different companies
from HTC from LG and from Huawei I think
for the record none of these are from us
these we're not our exclusives around
like that we were just reposting leaks
from other sites and HTC has this list
of like what is it is 19 devices I think
it's as massive bulleted list of code
names and I love hardware code names
their stuff in here like Apollo of
course deluxe aveda impression night
like a knight in shining armor monaco
opera there there there on quattro HTC's
code names are especially fun because
they get reused a lot in the developer
community people refer to their hd2 for
the rest of time as the OSB I don't know
I'm remember I don't have one I believe
that was the Leo was it yeah so it's you
know I think and
I think HTC sort of continues to do that
not only because it helps them
internally but it helps them in the
enthusiast community because people kind
of like feeling like they're on the
inside you know totally yeah it's it's
just it's exciting to see a whole array
of secret names like occasionally you
get you no one will pop out and it's
like you know oh did you know the
Samsung spheroid is coming out and
what's that you know they're like the
Galaxy frame you know but like look at
like these are this is quite a list but
I got very nervous when I first heard
about it because I was like HTC is
prepping how many handsets didn't they
do this in 2011 and they saturate the
market with a bunch of phones and wasn't
it a big disaster but these appear to be
variants we've seen them do this before
in the beginning of the year we see like
40 phones and they only release like a
third of them right and maybe you know
that's probably standard procedure to to
an extent but a lot of these are
variants like four five six there's at
least six or seven of these on the list
rm7 variants and and some of them I
think are contingent on the success of a
different device released for example
I've seen the Quattro show up in HTC
weeks for several years now and I bet
that is their bigger tablet that they
think well they did the jet stream but
maybe a better bigger tablet that they
were going to make if if the jet stream
was popular or the or the what's thought
the flyer was popular they just never
got around to it so now it's just was
bumped read the code name was reused
right yeah it's gonna be fun to see what
they what they bring out at mwc which i
think is going to be it's going to be
there Big Show and I feel like we always
talk about HTC in these kind of glowing
terms but we've also got LG which has I
think more interesting rumors because we
kind of don't know what to think about
HTC's lineup right now with the
exception of the m7 maybe and the and
the deluxe but LG is is rumored to be
prepping a phone with a 4.7 inch screen
with such a thin bezel according to a
story that Anton wrote here at around 1
millimeter that we can basically call it
a bezel list of ice that's pretty cool
that's pretty cool I was I was at the
AT&amp;amp;T store this weekend messing around
with the the LG optimus G
which I still think is the best phone on
the planet right now on interestingly
does not have the touch sensitivity
issues that the nexus 4 has and i was i
was about to buy one like buy a used one
from from swap ax because it's just such
an awesome phone but then i had to like
pinch myself and say no no no there's
going to be a 1080p version of this
maybe with a bezel lyst design very very
soon man to close my browser but iiii
think they're doing the the maybe yeah
this won't be branded as an optimus g2
or something but the you know LG's on a
little bit of a hot streak and I think
they can and well even if we look at the
Nexus 4 you've got those nice rolled
edges that it I if you haven't ever
picked up a nexus 4 I can't really
describe it it my description doesn't do
it justice the edges are rolled so it
makes swiping left and right very nice
fluid or beautiful it just feels so much
natural than on any other device I've
ever used can I ask you something like
that Joe absolutely is that really true
like if you take if you pick up your
Galaxy Nexus which doesn't have the
rolled edges and you swipe and then you
swipe on the Nexus 4 do you really think
that it feels that much more natural I'm
just asking your opinion I have just now
picked up my galaxy nexus in fact and my
nexus 4 I have them side-by-side for all
of you in radio land and yes having a
flat screen with there's kind of a bump
edge on the Galaxy Nexus all around the
bezel so you know where the edges it's
it's a rough start so when I swipe I
want to start swiping just just inside
that bezel so I don't feel that rough
edge but if I'm trying to swipe without
looking at the device I can't feel it
yeah I have to feel where that edge is
to know where the edge of the the device
is so i can start swiping with the nexus
4 I can feel that edge and it's nice and
it's curved and it's it's gentle it's
not as abrupt
and it just feels so much nicer guy I
found myself just unconsciously swiping
back back and forth on my screen at
times just because it feels nice just
treating it tenderly treating it it's a
it's like a woman it has to be caressed
and I I'm doing is mediated I've got the
I've got my neck sorry some men are into
caresses Joe let's let's let's let's
open it up to all humanity it's all
right that's that's true yeah you've
gotta you know kind of you gotta what I
don't know what you gotta do go ahead
Joe do you do you feel since you have
both devices in front of you is it me or
is the nexus 4 is glass a lot more
slippery smooth whatever you want to
save and the Galaxy Nexus oh good grief
yes has to end on the front of the
device I don't mind that but they have
the same slippery liciousness on the
back as well and it does the dance off
the table this is that I absolutely hey
the first thing that looked on my mind
when you brought up any any LG products
when you brought up the LG optimus and
it's not just LG because but when i had
the optimus G on AT&amp;amp;T that thing would
fall off tables I talked about a lot of
pockets document of the review the Lumia
920 does the exact same thing it's got
such low friction that if a table is
anywhere near away from level the Lumia
is like sailing off into the distance
just keep it away from tables it was
ridiculous I mean it's amazing there are
actually videos on YouTube of there was
an article I think wpcentral posted an
article headlined like does your Lumia
920 do the funky dance and like a video
of the phone just sliding around on this
table all on its on its own ex-players I
I think the next thing has to be in a
hardware design has to be something that
allows the phone to be glossy if
manufacturers wanted to be lousy but
that doesn't permit it to just slide all
over everything like a bar of soap in
the shower and row has that has the
bumper solve the problem oh absolutely
the bumper solves the problem except you
can't put the bumper in your you know
and your holster on your belt because
it's too big and do you Russell what I
rocket when i sent a belch oh I'm as I
do you do the holster thing I totally
have a holster thing yeah I am that much
of a geek love I used to do holsters of
it from like 2004 2008 like if you had a
nextel phone you had to do a holster
otherwise you'd nobody took you
seriously
yes so so you know it's only half as
geeky it's not this big you know
vertical one strap down my leg um okay
this is the only phone that I have ever
used that has spent even though I'm
wearing the holster on my belt that
spends at least half of its time in my
shirt pocket and whenever I'm wearing a
shirt that doesn't have a front pocket
like I am right now that I'm at a loss i
keep trying to put it in my front shirt
pocket and i don't like to do that
because whenever i bend down to pick
something up whatever i'm afraid that
this device is going to sprout wings and
jump and throw itself against the mill
it did absolutely will but i want to
talk we're on LG and before we move on
to 28 huawei there's another thing that
gets me more excited about all the lg's
rumors because a 5.5 inch LG phablet is
also in the report with a full HD screen
at 403 ppi and then there's a 7-inch
tablet mentioned as well and whatever
that maybe that'll be cool maybe it
won't but the LG like I think took the
most visible and painful leap into
phablet territory with the the view /
intuition and that's why this this
phablet is interesting to me because I
don't think they're going to do that
again I don't think this is going to be
the view to or if it is I don't think
it's going to be named the view too I
mean did you guys think that they're
going to go toward a more conventional
form factor with this or are we going to
see another almost perfectly square
piece of absurdity I think LG woke up
and I think they saw the sales numbers
from the view and the reviews from the
view and I think they're not gonna do
the view again yeah I completely agree
and that's why they think it's exciting
because we know LG can do awesome stuff
because you know arguably the nexus 4 is
awesome and I think the optimus G is
really awesome so that'll be exciting to
see and I feel like somebody just
assembled a dump truck really who did
you guys doing some file cabinet fun I
just decided to reorganize my desk yeah
just just hanging out that's cool she
was looking for all of his LG products
on the Shelf friend there right but I
was looking for I was looking for my
view so I could like you know use it as
a frisbee has no other
functional value and final is that
because it's the the screen orientation
is that why is the hell I'm Joe I
haven't seen a view before I given
you've I've seen it I haven't held it
before you even compare to the verizon
verizon wireless store and had a look at
the intuition I avoid verizon wireless
like the plague going to a verizon store
and look at the view it is like photos
and videos don't do it justice it is a
very good example of strong but wrong as
far as design choice goes i did its bold
but boy I mean Brandon of course you did
the unboxing so I should men talking
over you the views terrible doesn't stop
with you know a design that was too bold
and inappropriate but you know once you
turn all the device that's the screen
quality is integrating the device is
laggy and it's using LG's pre optimus g
UI which is different and it's terrible
and then it's so weird than the optimus
G came out and it's like I kind of and i
think i said i was on a previous podcast
i think i prefer LG optimus G interface
the skin whatever they have on it versus
stock Android cyanogenmod 10 whatever
else is just so good but the view is
like the ugly ugly duckling yeah it's so
if LG were to upgrade the OS running on
that and include the the version the
skin that's running on the optimus G
would that change your opinion would it
be enough to change your opinion it
wouldn't because the hardware is just so
incredibly cumbersome obviously they
imagined a world where people had hands
that are as as big as you know dinner
plates because you just you can't use it
it's like it's so bad I'm getting upset
can we move on yeah that's please let's
let's let's move on because we have
another company and finally the company
is well way um that was the sentence
that that should only that couldn't even
a mother couldn't love the last company
on the leak list was Huawei and it looks
like they're renders are out for their
their windows phone offering the w1
their windows phone 8 offering packing
at 2011 power
battery and it appears that it's going
to come in white cyan pink and black and
I really hope that these renders are or
photos are um like I hope somebody turn
down the saturation on these because the
cyan is kind of like it looks like what
would happen if if a budget crayon
company made scion and the pink is a lot
more like that awful carnation pink from
Crayola than anything magenta the colors
don't look very pronounced what article
are you looking at I see white blue red
and black that's not cyan and that's not
pink exactly exactly oakum pletely and
you know I think the black and white
ones look okay but those colors I don't
know what um I don't know we could we
spend a whole a whole podcast talking
about color I just wrote a piece on the
iPhones color and I just I'm out of
synonyms for color like when I got to
the point of saying spectrally diverse I
was like I'm done I'm I can't write
anymore so anyway these are the the
huawei windows phone 8 device and that
should be that should be fun to see I'm
interested to see what they'll do with
Windows Phone 8 but we also have to
Android devices the ascend d2 and the
something else I don't know I lost it
it's I guess it's just the ascend d2
with a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core CPU and a
13-megapixel camera which will excite
anyone who doesn't remember that it's
not about the sensor size as much as it
is about the lens optics so um you know
why wait I have I have this hope for
huawei every time a show is on the
horizon and we're going to see them
because I know they're kind of going to
blow it out with their booth design
which is usually like huge and massive
and they usually have really
knowledgeable people and there they tend
to be I think really / staff there's a
lot of people to help at huawei booths
and that's great so I mean they're
obviously serious about this and they're
getting the the rough treatment from the
US because of you know maybe maybe
legitimate intelligence concerns or you
know State Department concerns but we
always really trying and they really
really seem to be serious about building
their presence and i think i saw a spec
tweeted or something referenced where it
says that Huawei's self branded hardware
production is up like a ridiculous
percentage compared to last year like
last year only twenty percent of the
stuff they put out on the market was
branded by themselves like it was
otherwise they were didn't OD am or
whatever and this year eighty percent of
their mobile products were self branded
so it's cool it's cool to see a company
grow like that and I just hope some of
these products are good because my one
experience reviewing a huawei phone was
with the ascend p1 and it was okay but
it wasn't really you know memorable so
is huawei going to be the next HTC do
you think wow tip of my tongue Wow bold
bold words between that and the Brandon
saying before do you think that's really
true Joe I feel like I'm on 60 minutes
all of a sudden ah you guys are hard
hitters I don't know is it is why we're
gonna be the next dates you see I I mean
do I think that they will have a stellar
a meteoric rise followed by a lengthy
process of kind of increasingly
saddening financials no but I don't I
don't that's because I don't think that
they're going to launch a skyrocket
anytime soon that's going to be amazing
so the basis before my question was what
is you know HTC was the the secret power
house behind every cool device back in
the day oh I see what they're the ones
who designed it they're the ones who
made it you didn't know was HTC unless
you really started digging into it but
because they were bad name is not stuff
utstarcom or yeah yeah yeahs or compact
or HP yeah whatever right right and then
all of a sudden they shed the we're
making stuff for other people were
making our own and we're self branding
and look at this and they had just like
to use your words this meteoric rise
they wow they were great and then and I
don't know what happened and hey
something sad and it makes me want to
weep well that's so I see I see why we
kind of doing the same thing they've
made granted not as spectacular as
noteworthy devices for for OEMs for a
while and now they're going self branded
but are they going to face the same
challenges in the same
aim ultimate I don't want to say demise
but that's the only word I can think of
that's facing HTC decline yeah i mean i
don't i think the difference in Huawei's
case is that I've never seen and maybe
you guys can cite one I've never seen a
huawei product that's like like blown me
away and like knocked me over with its
with its awesomeness whether it's self
branded or whether it's branded by
another company any of you like nothing
comes to mind yet yeah I'm just
wondering if if this one could be it
yeah I don't think it is I it doesn't
look it doesn't know and and the other
thing like they're breaking like it
could be something special but right but
it looks like the LG l9 like it looks
just kind of like an unremarkable thing
to me to phone yeah it's me to phone and
and there's also a me two phablets which
is the last leak on this whole list is
this ascend mate with a 6.1 inch display
and this seems to me the epitome of this
kind of me to thing taken to the extreme
where it's like you know what yeah we
got a phablet also and look it's giant
like 6.1 inches is ridiculous and
Samsung's probably about to do that too
and yay whatever we'll see but that's
huge and it's 720p and the battery is
rumored to be 3,800 milliamp hours so
that's impressive it's impressive yeah I
mean it's cool but you know it's not
gonna it's not gonna get my flag waving
you know I mean it's like okay whatever
apparently neither is 13 megapixels but
no exactly things in ocean the ocean it
is d um now we got the leaks out of the
way I want to talk briefly I just kind
of want to this is slotted in the
rundown just so that I can give a little
bit of a punch in the arm and
encouraging punch in the arm pat on the
back to our friend Joe Levi who wrote a
sweet piece about called eight scenarios
where the NFC it would make sense yeah I
love this because everyone who is kind
of craps all over NFC and is like
whatever its use lessons you know they
can't make it work and whatever and it
has a lot of challenges thank you sure I
thought this is I love this piece
because you know I I'm like the grumpy
old man who thinks NFC is a waste of
time in
and you know thinking power but Joe
clearly outlined eight scenarios where I
cannot argue that NFC wouldn't make life
easier my whole premise was that this
whole idea of you know you get into your
you get it yet home and you tap your
phone to change your phone profile it's
missing the point of technology that
should happen automatically you can do
it with tasker and a lot of other
situations but all of these have
something in common I want to figure out
what that is it's like you you have a
piece of you have a credential that you
need to present to something and you
don't want to have to bear the
inconvenience of like keeping something
with you is does that make any sense
what do you guys what am I Shia yeah i
mean you're talking about access based
on you're talking about very very easy
access control and the thing that spoke
most specifically to me was something i
do literally every single day i go
underground i get on the train and to do
that i have to pull my wallet out of my
pocket and if i were a real square i
would have to take out my charlie card
of my wallet and put it on the card
reader so i could get access to the
train but i don't I just slapped by
wallet against the thing and the NFC or
the RFID works through the wallet
leather and it goes and that's what
everybody does but even that is so
inconvenient when I have a phone that
has NFC and the ability to store that
information and I'm just waiting on the
transit authority to adopt that
technology and that's I think about that
literally every day and I think about it
further when I'm I put my phone on top
of my wallet when I put it on the table
to protect the lens or to protect the
screen or whatever and anytime the phone
wakes up with a text message it starts
going crazy because the NFC element
starts trying to talk to my charlie card
in my wallet and I'm like gosh you guys
you guys are meant for each other please
just become one and when I saw that as i
think item number one or two on here on
Joe's are too close like yes absolutely
and but then there's more there's ticket
stubs there's business cards there's you
know obviously the dark angle wallet
when parking meters is a good one I
never would have thought of that
so how long did you do this looks like
something that you had to get off your
chest for a while Joe is this uh
something about well we wrote quite a
few articles about NFC and what you
could do with it we shot some videos we
did some stuff we got a pretty good
response but everything kept coming back
to what Brandon was saying yes you can
do all this stuff you know with with NFC
stickers that you can buy for a buck and
a half a piece yes you can do this with
key fobs but their NFC and it should
just know it and do it so how can we use
NFC that's actually really useful now
with technology that's available now
yeah we just have to roll it out and so
this was I Tony's probably upset with me
because it took me about twice or three
times as long as a normal editorial to
write and it came out a little bit later
in the day then I would have liked but
it I feel somewhat justified in spending
the time doing the research and coming
up with some more use case scenarios
that really aren't there shouldn't be
that difficult to comprehend and to put
into place and could simplify your life
I mean even the the calendar event and
map and navigation locations embedded in
your ticket stub I mean that would be so
much easier the business card that's a
no brainer let me tap a business card to
my phone so I don't have to type it all
in exactly and it just as a maybe a
little bright point one of your last
points is the bluetooth pairing NFC
initiated bluetooth pairing and we
already see that kind of an action here
and in my house it's takes place almost
every day when I tap my Lumia 920 to my
JBL powerup dock and tell it to pair and
it works very nicely so maybe maybe
we're closer to this bright new future
than than we think well let's hope and
in the the thing that I like from
brandons take away is most of these have
some kind of credentialing they all
focus around that and that's kind of the
point i was going to with the the
bluetooth pairing every single bluetooth
idevice shares one of like two or three
codes except for one and that's my car
my car
can put in any code you want and what do
i do well I've got an eight digit code
but that's still just eight digits it's
not letters numbers whatever it's that
should be pretty fast to hack in honesty
using NFC gives you the ability to use
much much stronger keys and yeah you
know you've got the people who are going
to say NFC is wireless technology so
attackable we've seen that happen before
and yes there is that potentiality but
based on what we have now which one is
easier to hack a four digit code that's
the same on every device or you know a
200 character good that rotates in his
random mmhmm yeah I'll go with more
security um I don't want to to talk
about this for more than 50 seconds but
for anyone who wants to read that piece
listeners you know where to go to read
the end of Joe's NFC piece and while
you're there you can have a click on one
of our more recent videos where I used
the the galaxy camera as a daily driver
for a weekend which was an absurd
experiment that was a lot of fun but
barring any any questions from you guys
we are butting up against a time
constraint here and fortunately there's
not much room there's not much news in
Windows Phone or an iOS so we can
actually jump in a listener mail but do
you guys have anything you want to close
out the Android section with before I go
I don't want I know we're kind of
suddenly pressed for time here I got
something small for windows phone and
then I actually have to go it's funny I
we do these podcasts wen Stephenson and
he he's you know he's waiting in the
other room oh I still all lonesome I
still have yet to see the office I would
love to I got to come visit the office
sometime yeah um okay let's then let's
get out of Android let's jump into
Windows Phone and the only thing that is
actually newsworthy from this past week
and I don't even know if it was very
news where there was an nokia set up a
Lumia 920 audio quality demo with this
kind of rock guitar challenge with the
guitarist from Billy Duffy no excuse me
name is Billy Duffy he's from the cult
and he played a guitar and he played
this really maybe a riff from one of the
one of their songs i don't know i don't
listen to the cult and it was very
marketing it was very p re it was very
advertising he it was I don't know it's
not a very interesting piece but
basically it just demonstrates that the
Lumia 920 is the phone to have with you
if you are video in a concert and please
just from me don't be one of those
people who videos concerts it's not fun
I don't like being behind you I don't I
don't like watching the video you're
capturing which is awful jumbly and full
of lens flares from the light action and
your speed you know your microphone is
going to be blown out unless you're
using the Lumia 920 but in which case
you know please still don't do it if
you're standing in front of me just just
don't just don't do it I did so if you
do use the 920 but but be careful
because Michaels behind you and let you
in space don't effort to it anyway that
was a lame video please Brandon you I
think had the opportunity to play with a
924 first time in a while recently right
yes first time in a while the last time
I played with one was in New York where
we really couldn't touch the phone right
and I've been so curious because you've
been speaking so highly about it and so
I had I had three observations the first
thing is the placement of the power
button I love how it's so center in a
centrist Oh sort centered in the phone
mm-hmm isn't that nice right below the
volume right below the volume keys it's
it's right where the thumb naturally
rest sitting in exactly the right spot
yes yes very very nice place on the
power button the second thing is I
thought that this what is that the true
motion trumotion hd+ yeah the high frame
rate thing mm-hmm that actually matters
and it you don't really realize it but
when you're on a regular kind of phone
you know your typical android phone or
Windows Phone you're flipping around and
you're moving icons quickly you can't
actually see the icons while they're
moving which isn't that big of a deal
because you're probably trying to flip
pass them to get to something else and
then the screen stop then you look at
them but but in case that does matter to
you
920 does a really good job of keeping
the the icons readable while you're
flake flicking them are on the screen
yeah I feel I was talking about this on
New Year's Day actually over breakfast
with a friend of mine and we were
talking about on sand that frame right
thing it's I think it's akin to watching
one of the new like The Hobbit in 48 fps
I was just gonna go there were you yeah
like I mean I but I feel like a lot of
people hate that because they're not
used to it and I don't think almost
anyone hates it on the Lumia because
it's like it's it's just so smooth and I
didn't even notice it i'll be honestly i
didn't notice it for the first couple
days it was only when i started using
the nokia lumia 98 10 to review it that
I was like why is this a little bit like
it's not jagged it's not bad it's just
it's a little worse though why is that
then I was like oh right because the
it's like almost half the frame rate of
what the Lumia 920 is giving me yeah so
yeah you do notice it so that is darn
interesting and then the third
observation is something I really didn't
pick out from the pictures I like help
the top bezel is thinner than average
and then the side bezels are about
average but then the bottom bezel is
just huge and I don't like that because
this the screen is not centered in the
face of the phone no it's not it's just
me no likey well you know what's nice
about it and I understand aesthetically
why you would make that complaint what's
nice about it is it gives additional
room below the display not only for the
buttons the capacitive keys below the
screen but you get like another almost
an inch of space below the buttons so
that if you're playing a horizontally
inclined game or if you're just browsing
something in landscape mode or whatever
you don't have to hit those damn buttons
all the time which is what I was doing I
think on the Lumia 900 though I could be
thinking wrong I was playing rise of
glory and I was flying around and I
would hit that damn home button every
time I'd jump out of the game and on
this that on the 920 it never happens so
it's nice to have a little a handle
there but that's interesting i mean the
nexus 4 is the same handle which i love
I guess the nexus 4 even with the handle
isn't as tall as the 920 m van anyway
interesting phone more at CES I want to
have somewhere fun time with that with
your 920 yeah absolutely yeah we're
gonna have a device exchange and maybe
I'll finally get my hands on a nexus 4
that'll be fun yeah I'll bring a nexus
for jen's I love to stay on the talk
more but I actually have to go now all
right well uh Brandon run it was lovely
having you on the air as always Brandon
tell everybody where they can reach you
on twitter at brandon minimun very very
easy to remember and the next time you
and I speak on the air will be at CES so
i will talk to you then yeah definitely
all right have a good my man say out of
Stephen for me all right thanks friend
well we just want to hit iOS real quick
and then I want to jump in a listener
mail we call that student the android
guy talking iOS what could go wrong
Apple is already apparently testing
iphone 6 and iphone 6 with iOS 7 this is
a story from january second this is just
yesterday yeah i mean i think this story
prompted the usual this came from cult
of mac or it came from tnw the next web
and then it was via cult of mac whatever
this prompted the usual backlash from
twitter full of people kind of snarkily
replying really apples testing the next
iPhone I'm so surprised the interesting
part is going to be the iOS 7 platform
which who knows if it'll launch with
this thing the main question i have for
the iphone next whatever they're gonna
number it is are they going to make it
more or less flexible because we've seen
the curved iphone displays already i
want to know are they gonna are they
going to go towards that are they gonna
ridgid it up so that it doesn't Bend
like we've seen oh I know what you're
talking about iphone 5 &amp;amp; a session you
know what's crazy is one of those
listeners if you don't know what's
happenin bend the iphone 5 really easily
apparently like without breaking the
screen which is crazy or anything it
looks like it's just this nice
ergonomically shaped device to your face
i'm talking to your face not to your
butt it's right no it actually doesn't
look bad first i thought no this is a
photoshop render somebody just bent an
image of the iphone 5 and this is
whatever but I mean if that is indeed
true
that looks like a viable design for an
iphone reminded me of what the HTC
chacha / um you know what was it called
in the US the HTC the facebook throne
you know yeah there was the cha chaan
then they had to change it to the cha
cha cha for spain or so that right yeah
yeah anyway it looked like an HTC chacha
except it was knife on five because
somebody sat on it with it in the back
pocket but whatever we'll see we'll see
if that's interesting I don't want to
talk anymore about it and and there was
an iOS bug that resulted in in do not
disturb being stuck on and I like apples
response to that because it was a
January first thing was a date fueled
bug and then Apple was like yeah that'll
fix itself in January seventh so sorry
oh yeah I will take care it reminds me
of the wasn't that the bug that they had
with the the date issue with the the old
zunes where they didn't play on on New
Year's Eve because it was a leap year
and there can't be more than 365 days in
a year so you just can't play anything
shot down yeah I think it's funny when
when bugs happened to smart phones
because they affect the clock
functionality pretty often and I got to
tell you I don't know how how hard it is
to code an alarm clock that works right
but it's probably more difficult than
most things you can do like you'd build
for a smartphone OS or for a computer
for that matter right now i have a
macbook air where I have a third-party
alarm that doesn't go off when the thing
is in standby so with the screen is off
the alarm doesn't go off i have a
microsoft surface with a third-party
alarm app that doesn't go off period and
i have i have a bevy of android phones
only half of which kind of reliably
sound sound the alarm so I'm like out
why is this so difficult I don't
understand how a clock that that that's
gets that goes off at a specific time is
a difficult thing to build okay so
you've got two things one is we're all
very very concerned with battery life
and various manufacturers are playing
around you mentioned it in your in your
camera phone video which by the way that
was epic
camera thank you oh that was so awesome
I thought it was just a gimmick but it's
not it was about if you going back to
that if you haven't watched the video
yet it's not a gimmick it's a legitimate
experiment and it you owe it to yourself
to watch the video i love you there's
even a little joe levi cameo in there i
saw thanks for that Michael so all these
different manufacturers are trying
different ways and with Android
especially it's not just google and
android OS it's people who are writing
drivers for the devices you know that
the chips and whatnot inside the device
as well as the device itself as well as
the overlay to the OS to try and bake
that sleep deeper the deeper the sleep
is the less or an hour yes it gonna be
consumed yeah exactly you get more
battery life but when you do that stuff
like the real time clock becomes less
real time and less clocky and you've
sometimes you got to turn on the device
and wait a second or two for it to
realize oh crap time is a nice time yeah
it's this time and at times I think that
even has to go out and negotiate with
the the cell phone tower to say said to
get anybody what time is it yeah you
know and just figure out and present it
so yeah there's there's something that
needs to be dealt with in and handled
there because the clock should be up to
date regardless it how much would it
take to just put a simple watch
technology in there you know it works
crystal just to keep much good yeah I
mean it shouldn't be too tough at all
we've got more high-end technology than
that the second issue is programming and
again speaking as a developer I'm less
concerned about the middle use cases as
I am concerned about the edge use cases
and for you non-programmers non-techie
guys out there listening when I was a
kid my mom had me sweep and mop the
kitchen floor that was one of my chores
and I noticed something interesting when
she came to check and make sure that the
job was done right she didn't look at
the middle of the floor she
always looked at the edges mm-hmm she
looked around the edges because if the
edges were clean the middle was clean
but if the edges weren't clean I had to
do the whole thing all over again the
same thing goes with programming find
your edges and there might not just be
two edges there might be several it
might be a polygon shape or whatever
theoretically metaphorically speaking
but you find those edges and then you
develop test cases to test those edges
and make sure that your code works all
the way to the edge because most of
these problems are one-off problems the
Android missing December bug was a
one-off problem do we start counting at
zero to 11 to get 12 months or do we
start counting at 12 12 to get 12 months
right is month 11 November or December
depends on where you start counting you
set up those you find the edges and you
set up those tests and solves a whole
bunch of problems but it takes more time
front to to find that out and when
you're under the gun to get something
out on a deadline you've got management
who says deadlines are more important
than quality and then you get into the
Oh we'll just fix it with a patch which
we've seen in Android is not the best
best way to go about doing things
because that patch so you never come so
you're saying that it's it is in fact
much more complicated than than we think
shifty reporting as simple as an alarm
clock fortunately I think the answer
that is probably yes but image you know
that that's a worthwhile reminder I mean
that is it is a worthwhile to remember
that we are all carrying very very
complex machines in our pockets even
though they are now ubiquitous in in the
first world in the first and second and
even parts of the third world so more so
just to tangent on that a little bit
herb world countries it's so much easier
to put up a cell phone tower running
with one back haul and then people can
get cellular data or cellular voice or
both for miles and miles and miles
around they don't even have to have
electricity at their house let alone a
phone line to their house to use their
cell phone charging it then becomes
interesting but right but
I think specifically are more helpful
and it should be more prevalent in third
world countries than we have them over
here there are much more value in
utility here for us they're just
secondary we've got everything else
right we don't need anything more right
good old copper anyway sorry about the
tangent let's all right that's all right
we can't this is where I would end the
podcast right normally but we absolutely
must look at some of this listener mail
because I want to start off 2013 with
you know right and listening lutra
listener mail so everyone who is asked
if we would do ever do a two hour
podcast the answer is yes just pray this
is your gift for the new year no we're
gonna actually I really want to blaze
through these not because they're bad
pieces of mail but because some of the
answers are great and if we don't get to
one of these Mabel get to one of them
next time but I want to ask because we
have Joe on the air we have a first time
right in from listener it's okay i know
it's i know it's my fault i know it's a
no it's because i have not studied
enough foreign pronunciation but i can
never pronounce names it's pronounced
pardon Oh Martin's not reminds number
two on the list too uh this is from I'm
just going to try my best dushyant
schrick handy I completely massacred
that but Dushyant thank you for writing
in thank you for letting us know on
Twitter that you had written and we
can't address all of your points i want
to reiterate for 2013 that when you
write in please do your best to keep
them brief but we will try and maybe get
to some of your additional points on a
future show but this is the most
interesting one particularly we have Joe
in the air Dushyant asks do you think
Google has just used or rather misused
the open source community for its own
profit as far as Android is concerned
I'm asking this because some people feel
that Google is simply use the developer
community and not given back to it so to
speak that's an awesome question I have
no idea how to answer it I can see the
basis for that question and I think
there's growing sentiment in the
developer community that that may in
fact be the case that having been said
google has
provided us with the platform they have
provided us with the user base they have
provided us with the market or the Play
Store now to to make that platform a
viable competitor you know definitely a
second place if not a first place
competitor to iOS so from a development
standpoint developers may be sitting
back saying I don't think google is
giving back as much to the google
project the code base as they would
otherwise have liked but when you step
back and look at the ecosystem as a
whole i think google has done
significantly more than their fair share
you know Google they're not a
development house first and foremost
they use development to accomplish their
ends whether that be distributed web
serving which believe it or not is a
bigger deal to Google then than just
search because without that distributed
computing set up and the custom
operating systems that they have to to
power that search your search experience
would not be at all what it is today so
first and foremost you know they're
they're doing distributed computing and
cloud based computing oh they're also a
search engine who has all this other
stuff without that framework without
that infrastructure in place we wouldn't
have the Google services that we have an
Android would be less less viable as an
alternative let alone arguably the
number one number two out there so look
at it from a stand back and see the
whole ecosystem standpoint rather than
are they just contributing enough code
and I think that the answer then becomes
evident that is a much better answer
than I could have given and I can do
nothing but say Joe I am compelled to
agree with you because it was very well
argued I'd like to bring up this
conversation again in the future because
I think it's a very interesting one and
thank you for bringing it up listener
but this ties in to the last piece of
listener mail that we're going to deal
with we have actually two more in the
buffer for next week because they were
great questions but Martin I'm
actually going to hold your peace and
also the gentleman from China who
encouraged me to just call him neo
because he knew I wouldn't be to be able
to pronounce his name neo and Morpheus
voice to read email right what if i told
you but Martin and neo we will get to
your mail pieces maybe not at the CES
email but in a podcast but in a future 1
i'm down to fifteen percent battery so
we have to wrap this up though and I
want to wrap it up on a tangentially
related piece of email from our old
friend Callie Dom's waya who asks he's
been wondering about the application of
the App Store Google Play like viber
whatsapp tango and Adobe Reader they
have no ads or any encouraging paid
services yet they're beautifully
designed and supported how do they get
the profit this is a question that I run
into kind of often and you know when
it's a service like Google which we were
just talking about yeah they can make it
they can write a google search app and
they're delivering they're serving ads
they're getting more eyeballs on their
content and whatever but how do some of
these companies that just seem to be ad
houses make a profit on like Kelly says
does Dropbox paid services pay up for
millions of free accounts of free
storage or is one dollar yearly enough
to keep whats app servers running
smoothly I'm yeah I don't understand how
some of these houses make make their
money you know I I don't either and I'm
afraid I'll go back to what I tell my
kids whenever you see something in the
market or the Play Store or iTunes or on
the web that is free it's probably too
expensive because free is seldom free it
it costs you something whether that's
money out of your pocket whether that is
time to complete surveys so you can
download something or whether that is
them collecting your demographics and
usage that then they can turn around and
sell to someone who then can market to
you or some combination of all of them
it usually is too much money to go with
free and I would much rather spend even
four bucks on an app to get an ad-free
version that doesn't do that stuff then
then I
an ant based version another thing is
they could just be trying to get their
name out there and right it could be a
bad building thing right exactly that
app itself is their ad and then down the
road they then either make a lite
version or turn that into a lite version
which is free and add extra bonus
features kind of like Evernote has done
yeah were cracked either the internet
comedy side cracked.com for windows
phone 8 just has a light app right now
or for a while they just had a light app
and then you know later on down the road
that roll out the paid version yes yeah
so that that's true that's true might be
multi stage saying but I like your broad
advice up front their Joe because it
it's like some advice that I got at my
college graduation party from an old
crotchety friend of my father's is like
hey you know Mike yeah well you know
there's no more free lunch I mean not
that you were getting a free lunch but
you know what I mean no I don't say it
what no I never mind it's good advice
it's good advice and um guys thank you
for writing and I'm sorry we couldn't
get to all to listen to me on this
episode we had some technical issues Joe
is broadcasting from the other side of a
subspace distortion today it's as are
even brandon is having some connectivity
issues so maybe there may have been pipe
problems on my on the tubes are all
fouled up today but we have to to wrap
it up so we're sorry for running a
little long before we go out and i know
we've got super time yes crunches I do
have some breaking news breakingnews
breaking news that by the time the
podcast is out it's going to be hours
old but I am a supporter of a
Kickstarter project for the pebble
epaper watch yes which was supposed to
be released in September and then we
were which by the way that was my
birthday present to myself and then it
happened so I'm a lousy gift giver for
myself it was supposed to be out for the
holidays but then they did the empty box
thing where they gave you a card to
print out and had a rhyme that says I
promise I got you a watch but it's not
here so sorry I email just came through
says project update number 27 it's all
red dozens almost time
it's one yeah yeah I did yeah listen I
wrestle o people at CES at CES they are
going to have a press conference January
9th at nine a.m. pacific time which i
bet will be the announcement of
availability of pebble yes that is
awesome news we've written about pebble
on the site as well I have two articles
focused on on the pebble project one on
the project product and one on the
project so look them up a kunai kaam if
you want to read more on those and Joe I
didn't know you were a backer too so
it's you me and a friend of mine named
chris is a great we're gonna be able to
pool our resources awesome yeah I wait
what color did you get I got black I
didn't you know it's such a what did you
get III did as well I was debating
between that or gray or orange they look
nice yeah but yeah it's just that
everything even though it's small it's
still a pretty high profiled about it's
not a pretty watch I mean it's it's
really it's really not very pretty um so
I wanted black to kind of minimize its
very pronounced bezel right right but
anyway we uh that's great news thank you
for bringing that in Joe and and thank
you for being on the podcast today I'm
always glad I could be here despite the
subspace distortions to PT and I think
with that we're gonna we're going to
close that listeners remember that next
week we will be broadcasting from CES
it'll be Brendan minimum Jaime Rivera
and myself maybe I will learn how to
roll my r's by then I doubt it behind me
of any better Savannah Rivera but that
wraps it up its first episode of 2013 on
the pocket now weekly involve us in your
conversations on the internets Brandon
minimun as he told you is that Brandon
minimun on Twitter Joe is at Joe Levi
and you can find me at captain two
phones you can also follow pocket now
officially at pocket now tweets on
Twitter pocket now on facebook and
google+ leave us a review on iTunes or
xbox music if you will because that
helps us out of it and if you have a
topic question or suggestion for the
podcast like the awesome questions we
had today or you just want to say hi
please email us podcast at pocketnow.com
thanks for listening
we'll see you later good day or 5s
whatever it's going to be I think les
plus exactly i think it's going to be a
rewarmed over five with new software
with new up uh uh uh hey talking
sometimes talking hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
