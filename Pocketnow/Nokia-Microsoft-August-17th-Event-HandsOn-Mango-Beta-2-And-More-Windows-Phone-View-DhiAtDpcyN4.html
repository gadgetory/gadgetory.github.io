for august seventeenth we go hands-on
mango beta 2 and show you how to get it
and one skype searches for a video
engineer for windows phone 7 you'd ask
where a skype anyways all this and more
coming up right now hello we r 1 i'm
high metairie better with pocketnow.com
and welcome to our first ever Windows
Phone view the show we wrap up all the
weeks good and bad inside the world of
Microsoft's Windows Phone platform let's
start this week off with the good roll
mango is in the air and we're on from
that means a lot if you were asking
yourself when will we be receiving more
windows phones the answer lies behind
the release of mango fujitsu an toshiba
joins together with japanese carrier
kddi and microsoft to prepare their au
is 12 t windows phone which is as of now
the first advice to rig mango out of the
box and also the first windows phone to
make it to Japan the first ad is already
live on YouTube and even though we're
not sure of it will cross the pond and
make it to our shores I gotta admit that
thing is gorgeous suddenly not
everything is cool in these new so stick
around for the bad section and we'll
tell you what's not good around there
I've got to admit mix nokia build
quality with mangle and you've got
yourself one hot combination still it
wasn't clear if the guys in finland
we're going to release a product this
year or not but after the toshiba and
Fujitsu announcement of their first
Windows Phone invitations of a microsoft
/ no give and were sent out for august
seventeenth and there's no doubt what we
were going to get there and think about
it I mean an N 9 device sporting a Mego
platform that soon to be ditched was
really sad and well our biggest guess is
that we will get the Windows Phone seer
a device that converted n9 that we saw
earlier but cross your fingers we're not
really sure we're going to get and
hopefully it's see ray along with other
really cool devices the great thing
about competition is everybody wants a
piece of the pie and well digitize is
reporting that industry sources are
confirming that aside from Toshiba
fujitsu and nokia devices HTC Samsung
and LG also plan on releasing mangal
devices for September so that could lead
to a possible mango bait release but
mango was already released the
manufacturers today so rumors do hold
water no word on when we'll get these
devices but it seems that HTC is going
to stick with some Qualcomm single core
1.5 megahertz devices instead of dual
core and that will be getting screened
ranges from 3.8 to 4.3 though we have
caught rumors of an HTC ignite and a
prime that will be released sometime
within the mid year but most likely will
get them with mango when it gets
released in September and most likely
these will be the first HTC devices to
be released aside from that we have been
receiving other images of an HTC omega
and eternity in cases all around so we
could see up to 4 H these devices being
released with mango really good news and
really good excitement about that
Windows Phone 7 mango beta to his life
for developers and it's worth every
penny for you to upgrade if you're like
us and you simply couldn't wait for the
release this fall head on over to
Anton's recent video where he shows all
of us mortals how to get our phones
upgraded to mango without the need of a
developer account the procedure is
pretty simple and straightforward and
Anton does a really great job of giving
us a step-by-step procedural video on
how to get it done make sure you also
visit Adam lanes recent comparison
videos between beta 1 and beta 2 to know
the differences and if you're wondering
if mangos worth the shot well head on
over to Adam lanes recent complete mango
preview where he shows us all the
differences in why mango matters and
well just to give you an idea my dell
venue pro is a whole different animal
after i upgraded i do recommend you do
the same and exclusively caught from an
anonymous tipster is that lately
microsoft has begun to pay developers
reporting their iOS and other platform
applications to Windows Phone after
years of seeing Microsoft ignore windows
mobile it's great to see that Microsoft
is finally bringing full support to
their new mobile platform we've heard of
Microsoft using different tools for
Android and iOS developers for it to
make them easy for them to pour their
applications to Windows Phone but
Microsoft has begun to approach things
differently according to the tipster
free phones and apparently a different
sort of secret company to pay these
developers is in the mix to make things
differently and asking developers not
necessarily to bring their
applications just ported to Windows
Phone but to use the full functionality
of the OS to bring applications from the
ground up to be working differently in
Windows Phone if you ask me it's a great
idea I mean Microsoft should have been
supporting developers from the start and
well it's great to see what this new
program could bring to the platform
there are a lot of applications really
key applications that haven't yet made
it to Windows Phone so I really can't
wait to see what's up next okay so that
doesn't for the good let's start off
with what's bad just when the release of
Windows Phones has been slow to none
toshiba and Fujitsu have announced
they'll be breaking up their joint
venture they haven't even begun selling
their au is 12t that we just mentioned
earlier and their relationship just got
complicated this makes us wonder if the
separation has anything to do with
Toshiba and it in the end it will end up
benefiting the platform because even
though toshiba had windows mobile
devices in the past some really good
ones the problem toshiba is it wasn't
really good in releasing enough phones I
mean HTC and Samsung did a really good
job in releasing phones and they wasn't
the same case for Toshiba so let's hope
that fujitsu sets her game up and brings
up more phones as of now because one is
not really enough guys okay so let's do
the math Microsoft by Skype for 8.5
billion in cash in May skype releases
versions of their application for the
iPad and other platforms and we have yet
to see a windows phone 7 version of
skype now they're searching for an
engineer to bring video to skype when it
releases with a mango in the fall and
well the good thing is that we are
seeing Microsoft building skype to be
the way that people will communicate
with video calls within windows phone 7
but what's bad is having to wait for an
unspecified date in the fall to get you
know the skype version for Windows Phone
7 mango I mean Microsoft is supposed to
be a software company Skype is also
supposed to be a software company how
about if you guys just step your game up
hurry up bring is a video not included
version format for this version and then
you bring up a video version for Mango
how difficult could that be
that's it for today show thank you very
much for watching I'm high minute ago
remember to give us a thumbs up if you
liked what you saw that's it for now
