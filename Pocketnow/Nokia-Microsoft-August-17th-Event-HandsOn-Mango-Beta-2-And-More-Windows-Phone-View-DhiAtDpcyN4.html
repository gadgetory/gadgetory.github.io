for August 17th we go hands-on mango
beta to and show you how to get it and
one Skype searches for a video engineer
for Windows Phone 7 you ask where a
Skype anyways
all this and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hime it'll be better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to our
first ever Windows Phone view the show
we wrap up all the week's good and bad
inside the world of Microsoft's Windows
Phone platform let's start this week off
with the good old mango is in the air
and we're on from that means a lot maybe
we're asking yourself when will we be
receiving more Windows Phones the answer
lies behind the release of mango Fujitsu
and Toshiba joins together with Japanese
carrier KDDI and Microsoft to prepare
their au is 1/2 T Windows Phone which is
as of now the first device to rig mango
out of the box and also the first
Windows Phone to make it to Japan
the first add is already live on YouTube
and even though we're not sure if it'll
cross the pond and make it to our shores
I gotta admit that thing is gorgeous
suddenly not everything is cool in these
news so stick around for the bad section
and we'll tell you what's not good
around there I've gotta admit mix Nokia
built quality with mangling you've got
yourself one hot combination still it
wasn't clear if the guys in Finland were
gonna release a product this year or not
but after the Toshiba and Fujitsu
announcement of their first Windows
Phone invitations of a Microsoft / nokia
band were sent out for August 17th and
there's no doubt what we were gonna get
there and think about it I mean an N 9
device sporting a media platform that's
soon to be ditched was really sad and
well our biggest guess is that we will
get the Windows Phone C R a device that
converted n9 that we saw earlier but
cross your fingers we're not really sure
we're gonna get and hopefully it's
searay along with other really cool
devices the great thing about
competition is everybody wants a piece
of the pie and well digit times is
reporting that industry sources are
confirming that aside from Toshiba
Fujitsu and Nokia devices HTC Samsung
and LG also plan on releasing mangal
devices for September so that could lead
to a possible mangos date release
but mango was already released to
manufacturers today so rumors do hold
water no word on when we'll get these
devices but it seems that HTC is going
to stick with some qualcomm single core
one point five megahertz devices instead
of dual core and that will be getting
screen ranges from 3.8 to 4.3 though we
have caught rumors of an HTC ignite and
a prime that will be released sometime
within the mid-year but most likely
we'll get them with mango when it gets
released in September and most likely
these will be the first HTC devices to
be released aside from that we have been
receiving other images of an HTC Omega
and Eternity in cases all around so we
could see up to four H these devices
being released with mango really good
news and really good excitement about
that Windows Phone 7 mango beta 2 is
live for developers and it's worth every
penny for you to upgrade if you're like
us and you simply couldn't wait for the
release this fall head on over to
Anton's recent video where he shows all
of us mortals how to get our phones
upgraded to mango without the need of a
developer account the procedure is
pretty simple and straightforward and
Anton does a really great job of giving
us a step-by-step procedural video on
how to get it done make sure you also
visit Adam lanes recent comparison
videos between beta 1 and beta 2 to know
the differences and if you're wondering
if mangos worth the shot well head on
over to Adam lanes recent complete mango
preview where he shows us all the
differences in why mango matters and
while just to give you an idea my Dell
Venue Pro is a whole different animal
after I upgrade it I do recommend you do
the same and exclusively cut from an
anonymous tipster is that lately
Microsoft has begun to pay developers
for porting their iOS and other platform
applications to Windows Phone after
years of seeing Microsoft ignore Windows
Mobile it's great to see that Microsoft
is finally bringing full supports to
their new mobile platform we've heard of
Microsoft using different tools for
Android and iOS developers for it to
make them easy for them support their
applications to Windows Phone but
Microsoft has begun to approach things
differently according to the tipster
free phones and apparently a different
sort of secret company to pay these
developers is in the mix to make
differently in asking developers not
necessarily to bring their applications
just ported to Windows Phone but to use
the full functionality of the OS to
bring applications from the ground up to
be working differently in Windows Phone
if you ask me it's a great idea I mean
Microsoft should have been supporting
developers from the start and well it's
great to see what this new program could
bring to the platform there are a lot of
applications really key applications
that haven't yet made it to Windows
Phone so I really can't wait to see
what's up next
ok so that does it for the good let's
start off with what's bad just when the
release of Windows Phones has been
slowed to none so Shiva and Fujitsu have
announced that they'll be breaking up
their joint venture they haven't even
begun selling their a UIs 12t that we
just mentioned earlier and their
relationship just got complicated this
makes us wonder if the separation has
anything to do with Toshiba and in the
end it'll end up benefiting the platform
because even though Toshiba had windows
mobile devices in the past some really
good ones the problem Toshiba is it
wasn't really good in releasing enough
phones I mean HTC and Samsung did a
really good job in releasing phones and
it wasn't the same case for Toshiba so
let's hope that Fujitsu sets their game
up and brings up more phones as of now
because one is not really enough guys ok
so let's do the math Microsoft by Skype
for 8.5 billion in cash in May Skype
releases versions of their application
for the iPad and other platforms and we
have yet to see a Windows Phone 7
version of Skype now they're searching
for an engineer to bring video to Skype
when it releases with the mango in the
fall and well the good thing is that we
are seeing Microsoft building Skype to
be the way that people will communicate
with video calls within Windows Phone 7
but what's bad is having to wait for an
unspecified date in the fall to get you
know the Skype version for Windows Phone
7 mango I mean Microsoft is supposed to
be a software company Skype is also
supposed to be a software company how
about if you guys just step your game up
hurry up bring is a video not included
version format for this version and then
you
bring up a video version for Mango how
difficult could that be that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm Hyneman remember to give us
a thumbs up if you like what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
