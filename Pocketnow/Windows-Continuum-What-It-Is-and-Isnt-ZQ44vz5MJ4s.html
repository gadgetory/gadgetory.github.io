than by now you've heard of continuum
the feature that lets you plug your
Windows Phone into a monitor and
keyboard to transform it into an
approximation of a desktop computer I
tried it for the first time last week
and was pretty blown away by its
potential but what exactly is continuum
then maybe more importantly what isn't
it I'm Michael Fisher with pocket now
let's find out let's start with what
continuum is keep in mind that we're
using it very soon after initial
availability with Illumina 950 made it
to a Philco magistead stealth keyboard
and a surface ark mouse your mileage
will vary with other devices and as
Windows receives updates going forward
first and foremost continuum is a really
good way to handle email and scheduling
if you don't want to be confined to a
phone's virtual keyboard the new outlook
client takes to a large display very
nicely with support for multiple panes
multiple accounts and a lot of
formatting options to choose from once
you actually get down to the business of
writing an email you can do that with
either a Bluetooth keyboard or a wired
one that plugs into the display dock and
you can get moving at a pretty good clip
once you actually get down to the typing
part when it's time to make an
appointment or check your schedule
there's a handy shortcut built right
into Outlook to let you jump over to the
calendar which benefits greatly from the
added space in a pinch continuum can
also be a really handy full-size browser
I say in a pinch because you're not
going to want to use this for anything
complicated or for a lot of tab juggling
more on this in a second but for simple
pages like mostly text-based sites it
works pretty well and if you're using it
to show off some vacation photos or
share a presentation in PowerPoint then
you're going to be right at home you can
do either of those through miracast as
well if instead you're looking for news
weather financial information or
something more specialized you're going
to get a better experience out of one of
Microsoft's preloaded apps which really
shine when they get too spread out over
a big display or TV and some third-party
apps like Tweety M have also jumped
aboard with more to come in the months
ahead
running a few apps at a time showcases
another continuum strength it really
does replicate the feel of a full PC you
can use keyboard shortcuts like alt f4
to close a program alt tab to jump back
to a previous app the windows key to
bring up the Start menu which is just
your phone's Start screen by the way and
if you're using a mouse you can use
right-click in most of the places you'd
expect
you can even browse some of the phone's
file system using File Explorer if
you've got your phone connected to a
Bluetooth speaker like I do continue
won't also functions as a surrogate
media player most media apps still only
run on the phone rather than in full
screen but there are workarounds like
running Netflix in the browser if you've
got the patience that patience is key to
making continuum work because as much as
it tries to be a Windows Phone running
continuum is not a full PC you'll notice
this if you try to download and run any
legacy Windows programs most of which
are built for x86 processors the
Snapdragon SOC and the Lumia phones is
ARM based and it can only run a smaller
subset of apps designed for that
architecture so you can forget your
dreams of downloading and running steam
for example it just won't work continuum
is also not a multitasking powerhouse it
can be easy to forget that everything
you see on the screen is being powered
by the phone but that's exactly what's
happening so you can't run apps side by
side nor can you even run them in
individual windows
it's fullscreen or nothing if you've
been watching for a while you know I'm a
long time Windows Phone fan but as a
Google user that also means I've spent a
long time chafing at the platform's
ecosystem disadvantage so the first
thing I did when I got continuum up and
running was try to have a Google
Hangouts conversation in the browser
loading the Gmail interface was enough
to crash Spotify which I'd been using to
play music in the background and then
Microsoft edge hung with me for one
hangouts message before the phone ran
out of memory and the whole browser
crashed this has happened repeatedly so
if you think you can use continuum to
graft a Google friendly experience onto
a Windows Phone well right now that's a
pipe dream
all that can be boiled down into a
pretty simple statement about what
continuum isn't it's not an escape from
the limitations of a smartphone if you
treat it like a PC you'll be let down
continuum is best enjoyed for what it is
an occasional larger workspace for your
smartphone for light work
keep that restriction in mind and you
might very well find it quite useful
assuming you've got the hardware lying
around to take advantage of it our full
Lumia 950 review lens later this week
folks watch out for it both here on
YouTube and at pocketnow.com
and be sure to subscribe so you don't
miss it till next time this has been
michael fisher captain two phones on
twitter reminding you to keep your
continuum quirky thanks for watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
