expensive than usual whatever it is that
will see them but sadhana for the galaxy
f8 might not be what we're expecting
it seems the Apple watch is actually
selling a little better again I'm Hina
Iveta and with all the notifications and
things that apps are suggesting for me
to buy
why aren't smartphones free already this
is parking out daily the official news
today begin with deals companies are
really trying to get rid of their
inventories for the galaxy s7 and galaxy
s7 edge in the case of t-mobile right
now as you go for the smartphones and
it's a limited time offer by the way you
get a full year of Netflix for free so
this is actually very compelling deal
and again if it wasn't for this little
sluggishness of the galaxy s7 I would
say this is a perfect buy regardless
though again the Galaxy s8 is just
around the corner and speaking of
Samsung it seems that our event
invitation for MWC is going to be
probably not about a smartphone at all
apparently the company is only going to
show is a one minute video teaser the
Galaxy s8 and that is going to be it
that could be either of two things I
don't think that the company is going to
have a full event with all the press for
no product launches I'm sure that there
will be something out there at that
event I will keep you posted as soon as
we learn more now let's talk about
smartwatches
yes the market has been very very slow
for the last couple quarters up to the
point where companies are actually
celebrating according to analytics it
seems that the SmartWatch market has
grown 2% maybe because the Apple watch
has grown in sales by 2% we're talking
about 5.2 million units when it comes to
the Apple watch moving the market to 8.3
million units for the quarter that is
actually not bad at all not saying it's
great but hey it's broke and one of the
major reasons why it's become so
difficult for smartwatches to actually
sell is the steep price tag obviously
there are some watches out there that do
something about it but it seems with the
new LG watch sports one of those
probable pixel or I don't know Nexus
smartwatches from LG is not going
to be one of them apparently you are
getting LTE connectivity in addition to
Android pay but the problem is you're
actually going to pay 350 dollars for
that and sure I know a lot of people pay
that for the Apple watch but then again
it is a steep price tag regardless
hopefully the product is actually worth
it and finally the very hot news that
they happen to with the LG G six num is
really in good news mainly because of
two things number one it seems that the
phone will not bring all of its services
coming on your region for example
apparently you'll get the new LG G pay
in Korea and then everybody else is
going to get NFC connectivity in
addition to wireless charging but
apparently you won't be able to get LG
pay or both it's really hard to confirm
right now the rumors are kind of shady
but another is very interesting part is
that apparently the phone is actually
going to become a little more expensive
we noticed that that happen with the
launch of the B 20 the B 10 was 50
dollars less expensive than the B 20 and
LG argued the premium build etc etc
apparently that's going to be the case
with the LG G 6 as well $50 more
expensive than the g5 it leads me to the
question of the day what would a company
need to do to actually make growing the
price tag of its product more compelling
particularly in the case of the g6
especially with what happened with the
g5 in my case that thing should probably
be amazing for me to consider it and
that's kind of the way I feel about the
b20 by the way so I'm actually confident
that it's going to be worth it but then
again that's how I felt about the g5
again anyway so it was a comment down
