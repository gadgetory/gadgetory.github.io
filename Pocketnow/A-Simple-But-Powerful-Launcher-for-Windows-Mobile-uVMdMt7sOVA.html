now calm and in this video I'm going to
show you a very simple but very useful
program launched are called launch
manager it's made by fantastic bites
software and the idea is that you map it
to a key on your device so right now I
haven't mapped to the call start button
and basically it's comprised of
different customizable panels so if you
swipe to the right here's favorites and
these are the people that I call on a
regular basis and if I want to add a
favorite I can tap on any of these
shortcut buttons and I can place a
different kind of shortcut so I can do a
program shortcut a quick phone call a
quick text message page shortcut setting
shortcut so you can have a turn on
Bluetooth or turn on Wi-Fi I'm going to
do a phone call contact since this is my
favorites tab and I'm going to click on
browse so I can get into my contacts I'm
going to find a contact that I want to
use and i'm going to use be minun myself
and i'm going to click ok and now we
will have a new button that says called
be minimun so if I swipe to the right I
will get the programs tab and again this
is all customizable if I swipe to the
right again I get other programs may be
secondary programs that you don't use as
often as the previous one and to the
right we have the quick quick SMS panel
which I've customized for the five
people that I SMS the most the idea here
is that you set this to a button on your
device and use your thumb to quickly
swipe between the different panels now
let me show you how you customize this
so if you go into settings and if we go
into pages you can set up the names of
the pages so perhaps you want one for
family and one for friends or 14 just
programs and one for the people that you
SMS the most it's very easy to add new
pages if we go over to shortcuts we can
specify which shortcuts are on which
panel and another great feature is that
you can actually set a custom icon to
any of these little tiles so if I go
back to the my favorites tab and I put
in a new quick phone call contact and I
find someone that I want to call I can
actually go over to icon and change the
icon so the
what I have then is a row of customize
icons with little pictures of the people
that I call one final note on settings
is that you can change the look of the
whole interface if you go into settings
and we go over to appearance we can
change it to the different skin so this
is the default skin and this just adds
to the number of icons that you get so
instead of a row of two by four now you
get a row of three by five so basically
this program will work on any windows
mobile touchscreen device vga resolution
qvj wvga pretty much everything
originally this program cost $15 and I
thought it was kind of outrageous so I
email the developer and the we're
willing to make the price five dollars
for pocket now readers so I'm going to
post a link on pocketnow.com on how to
get this for five dollars I think it's
actually worth it for that price because
it's a really powerful way to access
things that you use on your device a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
