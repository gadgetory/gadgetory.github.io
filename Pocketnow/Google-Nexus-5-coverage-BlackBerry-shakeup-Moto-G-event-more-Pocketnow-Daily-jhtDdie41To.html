doorsteps and there is a lot to talk
about blackberry just lost a buyer and
the CEO but they've got some funding and
the wooden Moto X still seems on plan
but for what date I'm hina Rivera and
man I want a wooden phone just as much
as I want plastic seeds on my next car
this is parking out daily let's thursday
off with some official news as there is
yet another shake-up at blackberry yes
the CEO thorsten heins has just been
fired they've got this new CEO called
John Shannon this is all part of a new
funding deal that blackberry just got 40
billion dollars and hopefully this will
allow the company to turn things around
even though they just confirmed they're
not leaving the handset business any
more stores than Hines was trying to
push things to go through and yet if you
want to ask me a ballistic I still has a
job I really don't know but let's see
how that goes now let's talk about
Samsung as we all remember last quarter
results the company made more money out
of the cheek galaxy phones than from the
high-end galaxy phones and no reports
have it that the company is focusing
2014 on cheap galaxy phones obviously to
make more profit than they will on the
high end galaxy phone so the question is
that this will affect their galaxy s4
and Galaxy Note 3 lineup or whatever
they're gonna call these phones next
year so stay tuned as they're investing
so much money on the galaxy round I
really don't know what the company is
doing anyways and if you thought that
the Nokia Lumia 2520 would be their only
tablet this year it turns out that the
company is working on another project
code-named dilution is for an eight inch
tablet and the idea is that you will get
a smaller form factor for a tablet
operating system though we're not really
sure windows RT will be your best choice
at times when the Dell Venue lineup of
tablets can offer you something better
with windows 8 the full thing so stay
tuned for that now let's talk about the
google nexus lineup as we get some
photos of a tablet and none no tablet in
the google website that is not the Nexus
7 but that has the 7-inch form factor so
you got rumor mill going crazy trying to
speculate over which tablet this is what
is on the display whether the display
say you know the way leaks go with
Google but anyways the Nexus 5 is
already arriving at doorsteps our own
review you and I just arrived so make
sure you watch our full unboxing and if
you haven't part
in our giveaway remember we're giving
away a nexus 5 on Wednesday in the
podcast so make sure you hit the links
in the description for full details on
how to participate and get a free Nexus
5 and finally for the interesting news
of the day we get to hear more about the
Moto G but this time by Motorola is the
company is already teasing that on
November 13th they will have an event or
an unveiling of the Moto G that's on the
hashtag at the bottom and everything and
we're expecting this to be a slim down
Moto X for the global market which is
kind of an oddity since we can't really
get the Moto X everywhere just yet and
still yes aside from the fact that we
are getting this moto G there are more
reports that the company is still
working on their wooden Moto X but that
leaves you to the question of the day
you know after all this time does any of
you either care of a wooden moto extra
wooden phone for that matter because in
my particular case honestly I'm okay
with plastic and aluminum I just cannot
imagine going for a wooden phone but he
