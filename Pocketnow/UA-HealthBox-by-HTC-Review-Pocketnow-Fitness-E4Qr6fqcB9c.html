every calorie every rep when you're
working hard
it all counts and everything has to be
accurate I'm I'm gonna be that I would
pocket now and this is PocketNow fitness
CES 2016 was proof that a lot of
companies are out there to build
wearables that do fitness to a certain
degree some of these are good enough to
solve some needs but the fact of the
matter is that most are still
experimenting serious Fitness requires a
little more of the things that are
already proven to work and never have we
seen a more holistic approach to fitness
than with the new Under Armour health
box made by HTC
see most trackers can do a decent job at
just that tracking but if you're the
type that's already invested in fitness
or even if you're starting out in the
fitness lifestyle you know that you'll
need more than just a step counter to do
things right the UA healthbox is
actually three products and once you get
to know what they do blend it together
you don't understand why it's worth
considering as your future fitness
solution the box is rather large and
there's a reason for that inside you'll
see the U a scale and yeah you heard
that right a scale and in addition to
that you also get the UA ban and the UA
heart rate strap the whole idea is that
these three products combined with the
you a record app will provide the most
demanding of users with accurate results
I personally never thought that I'd ever
be reviewing a scale but this product is
genius regularly you need two gauges to
measure your weight and body fat
percentage none of which are either
cheap or good-looking but here all you
have to do is step on the scale and it
calculates both and then sense the
results to the you a record application
through your Wi-Fi network the results
are obviously horrible if you review a
fitness product after eating and
drinking so much in Christmas but this
is the smartest way to fix that and we
all know that smart weight training is
more about your body fat percentage than
your actual weight the design and the
glass finish of the scale are very
futuristic and it's smart enough to
detect your profile from within eight
other is when you set it up for the
first time you can also control it from
the you a record application and believe
it or not it even has controls depending
on where you're stepping on it
my only problems were really that the
results were not always
the same when stepping on the scale
twice at the same time but that's mainly
because it inherits most of the problems
that most scales have meaning depending
on where you step on it or how you
balance yourself your results will
definitely vary another important thing
to point out is that it doesn't seem to
work well on a carpet floor so just
remember to keep it over a hardier tiled
surface like a bathroom floor for
example then there's the combo of the UA
band in the UA heart rate strap the
chest strap is optional as the UA band
has its own optical heart rate sensor
but if you want true accuracy in
measuring your calories burned in a
workout the chest strap is the way to go
it's also the funniest way to play
Ironman as well as the strap has a blue
indicator that lights up whenever it's
standing by to assist the UA band
as with all chest straps don't expect it
to be comfortable or even fashionable
with this protruding this design but
then again as with all chest straps it's
the price you pay for accurate
measurements the real story here is
mainly with the UA band HTC outdid
itself with this design mainly because
it looks like your average step canner
but it's far more than just that it
sports a one-point three inch PM OLED
display that lights up whenever you
press the button and pressing the right
arrow takes you to the basic controls of
the band that include battery
information music controls and even
silent vibrating alarms whenever you
sleep from the main clock screen sliding
to the left or right will take you to
your current activity sleep each per
minute and take you to different fitness
activities that you can track in real
time so far you can use the band for
running cycling weight training and
walking and this is where things get
cool see you can actively track these
without the need of the phone or their
heart rate strap making it convenient
for you to start your run without the
need of the phone and making use of the
built-in motion g-sensor or gyro to
calculate your run for you
actually measure the results against an
iPhone that wasn't connected to the band
the results were very close to accurate
the band was even smart enough to detect
my runs without me telling it that I was
doing so which is rather convenient if
you forget it as well and all this said
if you do want accuracy then yes you can
bring the phone along with you
to use its GPS or bring the chest strap
if you want accurate results when
compared to what the optical heart rate
sensor can do now matching the bandwidth
the heart rate strap is actually very
cool this is one of the few if not the
only vans out there that I've seen that
provides you with heart rate zone
information at a glance what's the band
of texts that you're wearing the chest
strap it'll provide you with a blue LED
indicator that tells you you're
connected and then the color changes to
green yellow orange or red depending on
the heart rate zone you're on the band
is actively calculating the calories
that you're burning but remember that
not all calorie burn is equal so this is
where using the band is actually smart
if you want to burn some body fat and
make sure you stay in either green or
yellow and if you want to improve your
physical condition then you have to go
to either orange or red there was
clearly a lot of thought put into how
the band works overall but this is just
one of the examples another is the fact
that it's extremely comfortable at
weight training no matter what you're
doing it's water resistant up to two atm
and it's even smart enough to detect
your sleep automatically even when you
don't tell it your doing so I also love
the fact that the 110 million power
battery can last up to a week which is
rather convenient for daily sleep
tracking and charging the band from zero
to full is sometimes achieved while
you're taking a shower which is even
better and then even more thought was
placed to this you a record application
all three products sync periodically and
it's pie chart approach allows you to
know how close you are to meeting your
goals and either steps fitness or sleep
in addition to helping you log the way
you felt during the day the application
also allows you to log nutritional
activity manually but you can also sync
with my fitness pal in addition to
connecting to other competing services
like Fitbit farming and others and also
updating your google fit information
automatically and to top it off the you
a record application is also a social
network so you can also challenge your
friends whenever you want to do any
particular fitness activity
overall these products do live up to
what we've come to expect from HTC yes
you can purchase these products
separately but I'd highly suggest you
buy them together see a true Fitness
lifestyle requires a holistic approach
and very few products out there do with
the job at working together have your
training happens in the kitchen and it's
just as important as what you do on the
road or at the gym at $400 which is the
average price tag for some smartwatches
that claim to do Fitness this is a far
better solution on my book I prefer to
spend that sum of money in three
products that are actually focused on
doing Fitness right then on another
halfway SmartWatch that can do fitness
to a certain degree I'm actually very
pleased with my experience testing these
Under Armour solutions I think it'll be
a smarter way for me to shave off all
the excess body fat I picked up in
Christmas and I'm sure it would be a
good solution for you too whether you're
a beginner or an expert that's looking
for smarter tools friends just like this
