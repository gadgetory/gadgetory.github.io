pocketnow.com we're taking an early look
at Android 4.1 jelly bean we're actually
looking at the emulator right now just
to get an early preview of course a lot
of this stuff doesn't work that you
would expect to work on a phone or
tablet but we're gonna give it our best
shot you're gonna kind of walk through
it with me for the first time here so
we're gonna slide to unlock and slightly
different animation here kind of this
little dotted pattern we're gonna point
out the little stuff to just along the
way so the first thing that they talked
about that you can change or that has
been changed is the way that widgets are
added to your homescreen so typical
scenario here we've got lots of icons on
our home screen and in fact let's add
some more just to crowd it up a little
bit so that the what I show you next
would make more sense so let's say we've
got a lot of icons here on the home
screen we want to add a widget so just
like an Ice Cream Sandwich we go over to
widgets and let's add bookmarks and I
should mention this is going to be slow
because it's the emulator emulators are
always slow one of the the cornerstone
features of ice of jellybean that is is
that performance should be better or at
least perceived performance should be
better through project butter to make
things quote buttery smooth so we're
excited to see how that works on an
actual phone I'm gonna pick up a widget
here but as you know if you've used the
bookmark widget it's huge
it really doesn't fit except for on its
own screen most of the time so as you
can see as I move it around the screen
it'll resize the bookmark widget too
however it will be required to fit so if
I go over here in the corner it'll be a
different size than if I put it down
here so if I release it it resizes it
dynamically and so I can actually fit it
on that home screen another cool feature
is once you have stuff on your home
screen let's say I want to move this
around but I've got icons in the way
watch the icons will move out of the way
so that I can properly place my widget
so that's a nice little feature of
jellybean certainly so let's move these
back around so they're not covering up
the Google search bar another new
feature of jellybean very small features
if you tap and hold on the background
you get a slightly different UI than
what you got in Ice Cream Sandwich kind
of this bigger in your
chooser thingy now the next thing we
want to talk about is a notification
tray because that has been revamped or
most importantly developers can tie into
the notification tray to do all kinds of
cool stuff with notifications they can
do play controls if it's a music player
they can put special buttons if maybe if
it's a Skype app turkey and you may have
a missed call there can be a call app
right in the notification tray and if I
open the notification tray now you won't
notice much of a difference except that
the clock and date are bigger kind of
kind of more beautiful I think and of
course we have got the button for
settings so let's try to put something
up in the notification tray gonna be
creative here and set an alarm because I
know that'll show up in the notification
tray under certain conditions so we will
set an alarm for one minute from now or
thereabout so we're gonna scroll up and
trust me using an emulator on a mouse
and keyboard configuration it's not the
easiest thing ever so please bear with
me as I flip through awkwardly to get to
21 I just went backwards I think and
hopefully the clock stays at 320 okay
done and done gravy one minute from now
that is going to be nice now one thing I
want to point out before the alarm goes
off and is really annoying if you go
into settings things look a little bit
different you'll notice right away that
the Bluetooth button the toggle switch
has been revamped a little bit just kind
of a small touch so if we turn it on
slides over to the side okay here's the
alarm so I'm going to pretend like I
don't hear it and let's see if I go into
notification tray I can do anything with
this okay good it's still up in the
notification tray now there's a gesture
that you do in order to get more
information and this this might not even
be activated for this program yet or for
the alarm app so you're supposed to do
two finger touch and obviously in the
emulator you really can't do that so if
I kind of clicked and tap on it app info
comes up that's actually kind of
different
but there's there's not much I can do I
can swipe it off the screen least I
think I can it doesn't want to swipe
because it's snoozed but anyhow a lot of
cool stuff coming with notifications and
notifications are a great way a great
place to come to kind of see all of this
stuff that needs your attention and and
in in a Android 4.1 it gets even better
so let's click around just a little bit
more see if we see any other changes
again a lot of the other changes we
really can't show you because this is an
emulator one of the biggest changes is
the addition of Google now which is an
interesting location-based app thing
that shows you tries to guess what kind
of information you would need based on
your calendar availability where you are
and other variables so for example if
you're at a restaurant it will suggest
certain entrees for you because I don't
know what restaurant you are where you
are and it will look up sort of top
dishes at that restaurant though way you
activate Google now is you take your
finger and you drag it up from the
bottom and if I do that with my mouse as
you can see nothing is happening another
change is with the keyboard and there's
really not a place that we can go to
show the keyboard and actually maybe a
message it would be a place to do it so
if I click new message and if I type
message now what it will do is as you're
typing it will suggest the next word
based on your usage or your history kind
of like swifty SwiftKey or really
exactly like Swift key so for example if
you type I am going and this might not
work because it doesn't have any
experience with how I type going to the
let's say that the Android 4.1 has
realized that I go to the gym a lot and
I type the message I'm going to the gym
supposedly it would show you the neck
the next word before you finish typing
the previous words so that's kind of a
cool feature so let's see if there's any
other things that we can show you before
cutting off this video again there's a
lot we can't show you just because it's
an emulator another new thing to Android
4.1 is that it's got a series like kind
of assistant which just
means that you can use the little voice
search button which actually isn't here
right now
to do things like ask for information or
do all those Siri type things but as you
can see it's not included in this
emulator I'm wondering if you can move
around this Google search bar or if it's
persistent like an Ice Cream Sandwich
and yeah it looks like it's persistent
it looks like you can't move it around
it's just there all the time whether you
like it or not but that's that's why
they have third-party launchers let's
jump on the camera app real quick and
see if we can notice any sort of changes
that looks really weird things look
pretty much the same camera does have
some new features in jellybean but
nothing we can't really show off here in
just an emulator and let's see if
there's anything interesting with the
multitask UI again hopefully this is a
place that has smoothed up a lot because
in the Android Ice Cream Sandwich it's
hit or miss whether that's going to be
smooth when you hit the multitask UI
usually it is miss so there's a there's
a lot to show you actually when we get a
device in and we can sit down to the
device and show you it will be a matter
of probably days until the development
communities get jellybean at least in a
rough form on some devices like the
Galaxy Nexus the gala the Nexus S
probably even the galaxy s2 a lot of the
popular phones so keep an eye out on
pocket now we're going to be keeping an
eye out for you and of course in
mid-july you'll get jellybean
over-the-air if you've got a Galaxy
Nexus and a Nexus S and devices in the
future we'll ship with jelly bean of
course as things tend to go now if you
like this video please give us a thumbs
up and we'll put some instructions in
the description on how to get this
working on your computer if you want to
mess around with the emulator thanks for
watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
