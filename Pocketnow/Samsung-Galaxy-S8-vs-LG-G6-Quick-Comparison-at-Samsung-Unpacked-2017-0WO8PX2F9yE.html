Juan Carlos Magna in New York City for
pocket now at Samsung unpacked 2017
checking out the new Galaxy s8 and it
wouldn't be a series of PocketNow videos
if we didn't compare it against another
phone at the dre Joe immediately the
first comparison we thought of for the
Galaxy s8 was checking it out alongside
the LG G 6 these the first two companies
to really radically change up screen
aspect ratio being called 18 by 9 of
course we like to reduce that fraction
this is a 2 by 1 aspect ratio display
and that it's twice as tall as it is
wide
we're looking at two phones that are
going to be really well matched in terms
of overall feature set you know when we
look at those specs on paper super pixel
dense displays that you know are really
tall and skinny and they look very
impressive I mean every time you show
someone the g6 they're very impressed by
what it looks like and what it feels
like in the hand and I'm sure that's
also going to go double for the Galaxy S
a this is going to be something that
people are wowed by when they first see
just how sleek and how seductive the
curves on this phone are and that is
actually been one of the major
differences in just holding these two
phones is how much more confident I am
in holding the g6 because it's kind of a
chunky bond in my hands especially from
having recently done the camera review
on the g6 I was a little less concerned
about dropping this and just how
precious and how pretty and how small
and thin this really does feel but that
does mean that I'm going to be a little
bit more concerned in handling it when
I'm out and about we still get headphone
jacks on both phones we did our real
audio review on the g6 Samsung did
promote their Harmon acquisition and
that we do know that the Galaxy s8 is
going to be coming with premium ear buds
from AKG which makes me squirrely
excited to hear although of course we
still want to see those improvements
internally on the phone great ear buds
need to be driven by a great stack and
amp
we're also going to be excited to put
these two through a camera showdown we
know the g6 has one of the most flexible
camera systems on any phone available
but we also know that Samsung dual pixel
sensor giving it super fast autofocus
and low-light capabilities are going to
be formidable again and how most people
are using their phone
these days extra features and
capabilities versus improving the core
photography experience that's going to
be a really hot video to put together
and lastly that software experience is
also going to be a crucial battle for
these two companies we're dealing with
taller and skinnier screens and that's
fine but we want to see that these
companies are really maximizing that
screen real estate Samsung's custom
interface solutions for shifting up
video playback and changing up how
split-screen is implemented in Android
natively is going to be a big benefit
but then we see LG coming out the gate
with a lot of features baked into their
apps for example the camera situation
with those square photos really helping
you line up your shots and create
content we don't see Samsung taking
advantage of the screen real estate in
quite the same way with some of those
fun features we get stickers and the
ability to you know have sort of
snapchat style doggy ears or antlers on
me and that's fun but that doesn't
really mean we're taking advantage of
what this screen has to offer now
happily we did get to see a demo with
some gaming where you can change up the
aspect ratio of games it's a little bit
of a beta situation it might not work
with all software titles once the phone
is launched but that does show that
Samsung is considering that people
probably don't want to be looking at
pillarboxing with their standard
widescreen video and widescreen gaming
which has been a little bit of a
criticism for the g6 on a lot of these
apps which are lacking native support
for this screen res enhanced water
resistance taller screens killer camera
features and a focus on improving some
of those lifestyle features like audio
this is going to be a fun battle back
and forth between these two smartphone
tightenings and of course we want to
hear from you are you learning a little
more team LG are you learning a little
more team Samsung but in the viewer
polled it just pops up on your screen
and drop us a comment down below now
that we have the full skinny on the
Galaxy s8 OSS feeling for your
perception of Samsung are you looking at
some of the competitors we know this
phone is going to be facing intense
competition
from a number of flagship manufacturers
this year but Samsung is delivering
something really special in this phone
did you know that every year more people
are killed by falling coconuts than by
sharks we'd like to thank our sponsor D
brand for reminding us that sharks
aren't the bloodthirsty human eating
machines they're made out to be or maybe
we want to thank them for reminding us
that coconuts aren't harmless
either way this bizarre add in our
Samsung unpacked event coverage is
brought to you by D brand check them out
in the link below as always thanks so
much for watching be sure to subscribe
to this channel for our full slate of
Galaxy s8 coverage from Samsung unpacked
2017 we've got videos from Jules and
Jaime doing comparisons and hands-on
Zand first impressions you definitely
want to check all that content now I'll
probably be trying to harass you guys
with some 360-degree video because that
was a fun surprise getting a gear 360
and you know you got to roll with it
we're pocket now I'm point Carlos back
now some gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next video look we're good as I
desire it's jaw high we're doing a
comparison who used to standing here
like I am not 18 by 9
