take a look at the AXA technologies p1
pico projector which is a small pocket
size projector that you can take with
you on the go or to a boardroom to make
presentations or watch movies while on
the go the p1 comes with its own one
gigabyte of storage and also has a slot
for a memory card so that you can plug
in a memory card from a video camera or
digital camera so that you can watch
movies directly off of the storage card
and don't need to connect your
peripherals if you do the p1 also comes
with its own composite cable it is rated
for brightness at 12 ansi lumens and
have a 30,000 our LED lamp life so that
you don't have to replace the lamp the
device could be powered off of its own
battery which is good for two to three
hours and can also be powered on through
a wall charger let's go ahead and do an
unboxing of the p1 and take a look at
what's in this box so let's go ahead and
remove the p1 pico projector from its
box go ahead and remove the sleeve in
here we have it looks like a user manual
and take this out you have the composite
cables and a wall charger and then this
is the pico projector itself which looks
like a standard projector but smaller
here is the model speaker at the top
here you have a focus so you can
manually adjust the focus and there is a
rubber flap that covers the lens on the
side of the device you have a volume
control which you can slide up and down
to adjust the volume you also have what
looks to be a mini USB port and then on
the back you have control so that you
can power the device on battery power
turn it off or use it with the wall
charger you also have in audio input to
the device
and an AV cable to connect the composite
cable right here so you can connect it
right there and then here would be the
power supplier where that would plug in
on this side you have a slot for the
micro USB memory card and at the top you
have controls for the projector itself
you have a menu control play and pause
forward and back and also the volume
control so you can adjust the volume
additionally if you need to connect the
projector to a VGA port on your computer
you can purchase the vga converter
harness which is a separate and optional
accessory which comes with its own vga
cable and you have a separate box which
serves to convert the signal here so
we're going to go ahead and set that
aside and the device also has a mini
tripod so you can mount it when you're
traveling to give a presentation in the
boardroom or on a hotel wall and it also
has its own bracket which attaches to
the top of the tripod so we're going to
go ahead and assemble the pico projector
onto its stand and then we're going to
go ahead and test it with the HTC touch
pro2 to test out the quality of playback
so we'll be back in a moment
so now that we have the p1 pico
projector from aaxa technologies
connected to our HTC touch pro2 with the
HTC TV out cable you see this nice video
out menu on the touch pro 2 which allows
you to quickly play PowerPoint
presentations view photos and videos
browse the internet or watch YouTube
content we're going to go ahead and
watch our video clip in just a second
the pico projector the p1 actually
displays images up to about 50 inches on
a wall without any lighting the
projector is relatively bright with its
12 and Z lumens and also it has a point
5 watt speak louder mono speaker on the
device so let's go ahead and play a
brief clip which is the new
pocketnow.com video introduction for our
YouTube videos
there's a bit of lag there because the
video isn't actually optimized for the
resolution on the touch pro 2 the p1
displays up to vga resolution and this
is a quick look of the aax a p1 pico
projector thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
