Windows 10 with this cake design of a
tablet that can replace your laptop and
then you place an S Pen at the cherry
topper
I'm hein everywhere we're talking now
and meet the Samsung Galaxy book
seven usually uses the spotlight of MWC
for two latest galaxy flagship but in
2017 the company made it clear that
tablets need to return to their
limelight but he's convicted by the
company claim that people don't just
want to have lips for content
consumption people actually want to get
things done and along with the Galaxy
Tab us three this is the new galaxy book
think of this as the surface pro floor
of the future mainly because they look
similar but the samsung galaxy book is
far more modern there are two models the
ten point six inch and a twelve inch the
differences are mainly that the twelve
inch has an extra USB C port and then if
you compare them in specifications the
smaller variant has just four gigs of
RAM and up to 128 gigs of storage versus
options to up to eight gigs of RAM and
256 gigs of storage on the larger model
there's a TFT display on the smaller
model versus a Super AMOLED panel on the
larger one and Samsung actually claims
that this is the largest Super AMOLED
panel out there there's also a 13
megapixel camera at the back of the
larger tablet compared to none on the
other and obviously the more powerful
processor if you compare the Intel Core
i5 KB Lake versus the core m3 on the
smaller variant both devices share this
really cool keyboard with pogo pins to
avoid the need for pairing each offering
different angles two proper tablets
addition to an amazing feel at the
moment you start typing yes there is a
full version of Windows 10 on each of
these tablets to get things done and
both devices have a 5 megapixel camera
at the front for video conferencing but
best of all if you go for the higher
trim you even get LTE connectivity and
yes that other slot that you see is for
microSD expansion as well and then there
is the cherry on top which is the new S
Pen which is independent of these
tablets it includes more than 4000
levels of sensitivity and even supports
tilt so it's currently limited to some
Adobe applications thanks to a
partnership and if you're wondering just
how powerful these new computers are
well have a look at how one of these is
able to power two 4k monitors
simultaneous
as it handles other tasks on its own
I've got to say I am really impressed by
this 12-inch model in particular for
those of you searching for a replacement
for the surface pro 4 this is a really
cool way to do it though pricing and
availability is still not confirmed make
