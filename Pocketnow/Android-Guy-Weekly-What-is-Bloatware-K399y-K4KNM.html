today's episode of the Android guy
weekly we're going to talk about
bloatware the good the bad and the ugly
at the end of every episode of the
Android guy weekly we always ask you to
comment to participate and then to send
in suggestions or questions that we can
cover in upcoming episodes well this one
and I apologize in advance I'm probably
gonna get your name wrong this question
comes from Lauren - and says what do you
think about built-in apps on Android
devices starting with launchers like
TouchWiz since etc daily apps like memo
takers voice recorders email clients
keys air and the corresponding widgets
for these applications many refer to
them as bloatware while I find them
useful and better integrated with the OS
than third-party apps so what is
bloatware bloatwares a term that carries
over from the pc days when manufacturers
will put the operating system on the
drivers on and then a whole bunch of
crap that they usually got paid by the
people who wrote the crap to put on and
i'm sorry if you're one of those people
who wrote the crap a lot of those
programs were pretty decent I just want
the opportunity to install them myself
and not have to live with them being
installed now why is that a problem well
it's not a problem per se but ok it is a
problem and here's why when you have a
desktop PC you've got a relatively large
hard drive you've got a relatively large
amount of RAM and a relatively powerful
processor and ideally a really hefty
video processor as well so when all
these programs are installed they're
occupying some of that space but hey
it's a big hard drive so it doesn't
matter that much if they're running in
the background well you've got a lot of
RAM so it doesn't matter that much
you've got you know fast processor so it
doesn't matter that much but when you
start adding them up and get 10 and 12
and 15 and who knows how many of these
apps running all the time well it starts
to become a problem and what's even a
bigger problem is when people are doing
that on mobile devices
your phone or your tablet you have
significantly less storage significantly
less RAM and significantly less
processor than you do on a desktop PC
but we're going kind of the same way
with having this bloatware installed on
our handheld devices and it's really not
cool because what slowed us down a lot
on the desktop slows us down a lot on
mobiles we don't like that at all
because we like quick fast Mobile's
all-in-all bloatware shouldn't be a
problem because in most cases going back
to desktops now you can just uninstall
it it might take a while and if you're
not a really savvy user you might not
know that you need to go in and clean up
when you get your brand-new computer and
that would be like getting a brand new
car and having to empty the truck from
with all the bricks that they load it in
there so you can get the the mileage
that was advertised it's just ridiculous
but you could still do it over on our
mobile devices most of the time those
apps are installed as system devices or
system apps rather so you can't
uninstall them because guess what
you don't have root they don't trust you
enough to take that stuff off so if
you've got a Verizon device and you
don't want NFL ticket do bad it's on
there and you've got to live with it and
it's gonna go out and try and update and
it might be running in the background it
gets you know scores and highlights and
whatnot and it might be telling you all
this even if you don't like it now I
don't know who doesn't like American
football but let's say you are that one
person out there that doesn't and you
want to get rid of it you can't because
it's bloatware
so let's go back to the question now
what about these other apps that come
pre-installed they're pretty good like
voice recorders like note-taking apps
hey some of them are very very nice and
really should be across the board every
device should have those but they're
useful so back to the PC metaphor
notepad calculator paint comes with
every version of Windows out there since
like version 2 and they're useful and
they're small and they don't get in the
way and when they do that and they they
serve one function and do it well I
still use notepad today if I need to
hurry and quick take a note
no problem start run notepad done got it
same thing with calc I need to calculate
something really quick start run count
done very easy start run paint I just
like saying it start red can you tell so
or start run pocketnow.com bam so what
about these on handhelds okay on
handhelds yes I can see that and I can
like that but I still want to be able to
remove them on a desktop I can't really
remove those because their system apps
same thing on handouts their system apps
I can't remove them but if they're
useful I don't mind as much I think most
of you probably wouldn't mind as much
where it gets problematic is when you
get all these branded apps and I'm
picking on Verizon because the Verizon
phones that I've reviewed recently have
had half a dozen or more Verizon branded
apps then a whole bunch of other apps
and it's really not cool to do that let
me uninstall those at the very least let
me remove them from my phone that I
bought let me take those off if I'm not
gonna use them I don't want it they're
taking up space even if I'm not running
and you know if it's not running in the
background I don't want it on the phone
just let me clean it off on a desktop PC
I could format the thing and reinstall
windows great now it's clean
woohoo I have a little bit of a problem
installing drivers and whatnot because
maybe they didn't ship a nice driver CD
with the computer but I can still do
that with my Android phone the only way
that I can do that is to route it
install a custom recovery and install a
custom ROM which I don't know if you
know me very well hi I'm Joe the Android
guy yeah that's what I do
primarily for that reason makes it go
fast cleans it up lets me do all kinds
of stuff so the last topic in that
question was launchers now the launcher
as we know is the app that launches your
apps
it holds the icons that holds the
widgets it holds the app drawer it's the
part that holds everything together and
once you launch stuff out but in most
cases the launcher also includes other
stuff as well or it's closely tied into
other apps for example on HTC Sense
you've got your contacts your dialer
your email you know stuff like that
your calendar that all look like since
so if you want to put in a new custom
launcher now you've got to find new
custom apps for those as well that look
more like stock and let's face it that's
relatively difficult to do and to do it
right you're gonna have to spend some
money sure it's only like 2 3 bucks per
app but you're still gonna have to spend
money to do it just so you can get rid
of the stuff that came with your device
that you didn't want because you wanted
stock or you wanted the freedom to have
something else can you do it yes is it
as fluid and as seamless no and that's
unfortunate unless you get a whole
launcher suite like SPB SPB has put
together a pretty good desktop and it
does a lot of stuff if you like it it's
great if you don't like it not so great
it does cost like 15 bucks to get so if
you want to try it
hopefully that 15 minute refund window
is long enough for you to install it and
set it as your default and configure it
and play with it and see it's not long
enough to do all that don't even try but
that's the point why can't I say you
know what I want to go 2 cents from my
stock android and buy it in the market
and it has all of this stuff in it and
if I want to switch to something else no
problem I go in the market and I I'm
sorry the Play Store that's gonna be a
hard habit to break
why can't i buy Motorola's from the Play
Store and put it on my device and run it
why can't I do that because it's
bloatware because it's too tightly
coupled in and because that's the
branding that differentiates everything
well I'd argue it would probably be good
if they let you buy stuff to customize
your phone how you want it I mean
wouldn't it be cool if you had a Samsung
phone running a Motorola Watcher I think
Motorola be all over that and Samsung
wouldn't be cool if your TouchWiz was
running on a Droid Maxx yeah so go ahead
and do this guy's
put your launchers the whole thing out
into the market the Play Store now doing
that is gonna do two things one it's
gonna let people choose what they want
to run two it's gonna let people remove
what they don't want to run and three
it's going to decouple the launchers
from the core operating system such that
well now if we want to upgrade to Ice
Cream Sandwich no problem we upgrade to
Ice Cream Sandwich and then all on that
launcher stuff is just an app that sits
on top of it that can be patched and
updated through the Play Store no
problem let's do that and then can we
start getting some updates to phones a
little bit faster
I hope okay so that was a topic for
today bloatware the good the bad and the
ugly and you know I'm a little bit
biased and think most of its ugly but
like the person who wrote in some of
it's not bad so I'd like to know what's
your favorite bloatware what comes
prepackaged on your phones that you like
and wouldn't know what you could do
without or would have a hard time doing
without if you switch to another phone
that didn't have that pre-installed let
us know that down in the comments of
