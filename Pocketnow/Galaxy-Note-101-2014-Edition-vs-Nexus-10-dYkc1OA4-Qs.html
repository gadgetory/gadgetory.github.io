10-inch tablets go head-to-head I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow
and this is the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
2014 edition versus the Nexus 10 of all
the Android tablet manufacturers Samsung
is unsurprisingly one of the most
prominent its Galaxy Tab and Galaxy Note
brands bring plenty of value adds to
what would otherwise be pretty standard
tablets and Samsung is also creator of
what many consider to be the best
Android tablet in the past 11 months the
Nexus 10 last month the Samsung
announced its latest addition to its
broad palette of tablets the Galaxy Note
10.1 2014 edition how does it compare
with Samsung's purest google tablet from
2012 that's what we're here to find out
although these tablets both come from
the same company they are distinctly
different particularly in design build
quality and specs the biggest similarity
externally is the power button and
volume rocker placement which are both
located on the upper left edge of the
tablets other than that they can be more
like into distant relatives than
siblings or close cousins the Nexus 10
which feels incredibly premium is
composed almost entirely of a soft touch
plastic around its back insides and that
offers a very nice grip on the device
its speakers run along the edges facing
forward and it's not exactly light on
the bezel but on the flip side it offers
on-screen buttons as opposed to the Note
10.1 obscure capacitive and physical
button layout the Note 10.1 is packed
into a much lighter compact chassis it's
63 grams lighter 20.8 millimetres
narrower 6.2 millimeter shorter and one
millimeter thinner than the Nexus 10
like the Galaxy Note 3 its backside
comes in either black or white with a
faux leather texture the black has
markedly more grippy and leather like
though the white still feels notably
more premium than the hyper lace coating
on other galaxy tablets have passed and
the faux metal trim along the edges is
still present though it's now lined to
resemble the pages of a notebook even
internally the 2014 Note 10.1 and the
Nexus 10 have a swath of dissimilarities
the Nexus 10 nearing one-year-old
features a 1.7 gigahertz dual core
Exynos 50 to 50 chip to the note 10.1
Exynos octa-core nation of a 1.9
gigahertz quad-core processor and a 1.3
gigahertz quad-core
processor which work together the Note
10.1 also features one more gigabyte of
RAM a high-resolution image sensor and
more storage options including a micro
SD card slot the Nexus 10 however does
offer a larger capacity battery 9000
milliamp hours to the Note 10.1 80 to 20
milliamp hours and it also has NFC while
the Note 10.1 2014 edition does not both
the Note 10.1 and Nexus 10 have super
crisp
wqxga displays that's 2560 by 1600
pixels at 10.1 inches making an
impressive 299 pixels per inch but it
only takes one glance at both displays
to see which one is the better panel the
Nexus 10 uses a super pls TFT display
the new Note 10.1 uses a Super Clear LCD
panel and the differences are rather
obvious both panels are incredibly sharp
bright and offer very wide viewing
angles however the Super Clear LCD panel
in the Note 10.1 has much more vibrant
colors better contrast and deeper blacks
finally the digitizer the Nexus 10 only
accepts capacitive input but the Note
10.1 as you would expect comes with a
Wacom digitizer for incredibly accurate
s-pen input something which couldn't be
more fitting on a device to size as much
as we love the filling of the Nexus 10
in the hands we have to give the
hardware edge to the note 10.1 it packs
significantly better specifications in a
smaller lighter package the software
side of things is where these two
tablets take to significantly different
routes the Nexus 10 comes with the
latest version of Android afford in its
absolute purest form it ships with bone
stock Android 4.3 and all the tablet
optimizations available such as the
separated notification and quick toggle
shades it also has support for multiple
user profiles as well as restricted
access the Note 10.1 may also come with
Android 4.3 but it's buried beneath
Samsung's own bloated software TouchWiz
we have a love-hate relationship with
TouchWiz it brings tons of value
proposition especially to the Note brand
but it also comes with a ton of
bloatware which often hinders
performance the s-pen for starters comes
with its own suite of software Air
Command is launched when you remove the
S Pen from its integrated slot found on
the upper right corner of the device
where you can hold the button on the S
Pen and hover it just over the display
Air Command has five Quick Launch
options action memo scrapbooker screen
right s finder and pen window each of
these features are unique to the note
series and are truly useful features for
any larger device TouchWiz also comes
with the infinitely handy multi window
feature which allows two applications to
run side-by-side you can drag and drop
text between two open applications
resize them swap them around and you can
even open a pin window atop the two
running applications making the Note
10.1 one of the most performance and
productivity focused Android tablets to
date many different TouchWiz features
appear on the note 10.1 as well smart
screen features such as smart stay and
smart pause chat on Samsung Apps Samsung
hub s translator s voice watch on etc
and there is some pre-loaded bloatware
worth mentioning as well sketchbook for
galaxy polaris office v evernote
Flipboard and Twitter which is the
official Twitter client with actual
tablet support exclusive to this
specific Samsung tablet however we
cannot begin to wrap our heads around
one single fact about the Note 10.1
considering Samsung has gone the extra
mile to make sure users get the full
effect of the 10 inch display it's
unacceptable that Samsung still has not
optimized the notification shape for
tablets it's full screen meaning the
notifications unnecessarily take up the
entire width of the display not to
mention the settings application on the
note 10.1 is even more confusing since
it's both tabbed and pained four tabs
separate various types of settings
connections device controls in general
and beneath each classification is a two
pane view for ease of use and looks the
Nexus 10 takes the cake in software but
thanks to the tablet optimized features
such as multi window and air command the
Note 10.1 actually has the upper-hand
keep in mind that upper-hand says little
about performance an area one would
imagine the device with two quad-core
processors would excel the Note 10.1
however has trouble keeping up with the
intense multitasking such as multi
window constantly stuttering and
dropping frame rates
it seems the over encumbered TouchWiz
software is more than enough to
counteract the performance improving
effects of project butter although
powered by less powerful chipset the
Nexus 10 seems to perform noticeably
more smoothly and day-to-day operation
that said it's not capable of quite as
extensive multitasking as the note 10.1
so it's a trade-off of sorts the Note
10.1 does seem to catch up after a few
minutes of dealing with stutters and
jitters
but honestly that sort of thing is
unacceptable on a device this powerful
if you're the type who cares about
benchmarks their respective score should
be a stern testament to how poorly
optimized TouchWiz is for performance
however thanks to the Exynos octa-core
one is noticeably better for gaming for
device geared towards media consumption
the speaker performance can't be
understated thankfully both tablets have
loud anchor speakers the Nexus 10
speaker setup however is notably better
the speakers are less tinny and they're
also forward-facing and effectively
impossible to accidentally cover up I
know 10.1 speakers on the other hand are
along the outer edges it can certainly
be muffled by accident battery
performance is also a place the Nexus 10
seems to soar the Nexus 10 employs a 33
point 75 watt power battery which tends
to perform exceptionally well on standby
only dropping a couple of percent per
day and use the battery drains at a
fairly respectable rate considering the
size and resolution of the display it
will only need to be charged every few
days depending on usage the note 10.1 is
not quite as favorable and stand by
dropping upwards of 10 percent over a
span of 24 hours but as 31 watt hour
battery will offer similar better to
performance while in use though since
you're capable of doing far more with
the tablet at once you may very well be
able to eat through your entire charge
more quickly stay tuned for a more
in-depth look at the note 10.1 S battery
performance in the full review finally
camera performance if you're so inclined
to take pictures with the 10 inch device
look no further than the Note 10.1 it's
8 megapixel camera isn't the greatest
around seriously your two-year old
smartphone can probably take better
pictures but of these two there's really
no comparison in favorable lighting
conditions both will take fairly
balanced photos but the Note 10.1 images
are more true to life more detailed and
more vibrant it offers more dynamic
range in the auto shooting mode and it
was quicker to focus and capture we had
trouble with the Nexus 10 capturing
blurry pictures more than once in all
there are only a few areas the Nexus 10
has an edge in this comparison the Note
10.1 software is bloated causing several
performance issues price is another the
16 gigabyte Nexus 10 starts at 399
whereas the same capacity Note 10.1
starts at 549 of these two which tablet
would you choose if this were the
Snapdragon variant of the Note 10.1 it
would be a no-brainer but since this is
the X
powered galaxy note it's up for debate
at the end of the day as much as we're
drawn towards the cheaper price point
purely stock Android experience and the
more reliable performance of the Nexus
10 the s-pen and the multitasking
features of the Note 10.1 make up for
the intermittent lag and stutters when
the Note 10.1 is running like it should
there's nothing else out there quite
like it we just wish Samsung will give
the Wi-Fi Note 10.1 some Snapdragon love
