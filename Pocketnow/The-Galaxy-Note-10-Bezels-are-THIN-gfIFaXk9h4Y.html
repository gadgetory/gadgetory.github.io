gonna be as much display as possible
Huawei is asking Verizon to pay over 1
billion dollars in patent licensing for
some cord network equipment and Google
just confirmed that the fan-favorite
stove design yeahright is coming to the
pixel for and they're actually
justifying a reason I'm Jaime Rivera and
you know guys it's Thursday I don't
blame you if you celebrate and if you
don't than I will anyways I mean we're
so close to Friday this is PocketNow
daily the official news today begin with
deals you know it's hilarious that we
cover so many Apple deals lately but the
thing about it is we're so not used to
it that it's like whoa yeah you know
here and now bnh has got like a
full-blown Apple event like a full-blown
Apple deals event we're talking about
$900 off max iPads and Apple watches
including free shipping for all of them
have a watch Series three which is not
necessarily my favorite is up to $400
off depending on the variant that you
pick the 2017 iPads are over 560 dollars
off and the latest iMac you can find for
$150 off for those of you that keep
complaining that Apple products are
overpriced this is your chance to fix
that
and there is of main reason why deals
continue to become more and more common
as Apple is you note is doing a faster
refresh cycle at least for their
notebooks so much so that we already
have a filing for up to seven different
variants that are coming very soon and
it could just be different SKUs for the
same product but the thing about is
we're due for a refresh for the MacBooks
I feel that the MacBook Air should be
getting a refresh very soon and
obviously we are expecting the MacBook
Pro to continue getting refreshes over
time as they've gotten a lot more common
lately whatever the case may be it might
not necessarily be the best time to buy
an Apple product unless you don't really
care about having latest and greatest
and now let's talk about that topic that
continues to happen what were you
expecting with the whole case of Huawei
and the United States obviously if the
United States is trying to block wall
wait there was gonna come a time where
whoo-hah way was going to come and fight
back and it just begun as apparently
Huawei is asking companies like Verizon
to pay up to 1 billion dollars in Pat
licensing fees the patents are for
coordinate or equipment that is being
used by over 20 of the company's vendors
there were four claims that these
vendors would indentified Verizon so no
we're not even talking about the 5g
patents yet which we know Huawei owns a
significant chunk of according to
Verizon these issues are larger than
just Verizon due to what's happening
they say that this is more about the
geopolitical battle between China and
the United States then about patents
think about it is if you have a free
commerce system and you block one
company and that company owns the
patents - instead of the products that
you use this was bound to happen so
we'll see how that ends and how about if
we move the spotlight over to another
problem that's happening which is the
Samsung Galaxy fold I am very excited to
finally get this product whatever it
happens but the thing about it is we
heard that Best Buy was cancelling
pre-orders now AT&amp;amp;T has joined they have
canceled pre-orders they're giving
everybody that ordered the product 100
dollars in the gift card they're saying
that you can pre-order the products
again whenever it's available but the
thing about it is we don't know exactly
when AT&amp;amp;T doesn't know exactly when
they're just saying that it is going to
happen obviously we heard that Samsung
might have another launch by end of this
month which other reports are claiming
that it's gonna happen until next month
whatever the case may be
obviously we'll keep you posted and how
about if we talk about the Google pixel
for pixel for Excel usually whenever we
cover news about pixels because not many
people are fanatics of them I'm always a
little skeptical but we've seen the
leaks of the stove design there are
still polarizing leaks over what the
display is going to look like but today
we got a tweet from Google and the tweet
is very simple they're like okay pretty
much for those of you that have seen
this they pretty much confirm that it's
real and they say wait till you see what
it can do and we see two cameras but
it's actually three according to sources
apparently at the top there is a
spectral camera that'll help you take
photos and videos of LCDs without
getting any more array or any sort of
distortion which is sort of weird
because how many people actually do that
I mean I do it for videos all the time
and I would love to see that but I don't
know I'm really curious two things why
we're getting the stove design of it's
just three cameras and number two what
exactly are the plants for that
secondary sensor which is completely
something else hopefully it's a wide
angle we'll keep you posted as the
bulbs what we do know is that we're
getting a stove design let's see one and
finally the very hot Leafs that I have
to do with one of the products that I am
anticipating most which is the new
Samsung Galaxy Note in Galaxy Note pro
we've covered rumors over the fact that
there are two devices up to four SKUs
possibilities of to being 5g to not
being 5g the fact that there is no
headphone jack and so many other things
we've also covered the display the fact
that there will be a single punch hole
in the center but well we are not
exactly sure about where the bezels but
today we've got some leaks of a screen
protector and man those bezels are
pretty much in existence at the point
where we don't even see the regular
curves that we have been seeing in
devices from Samsung on the Border's
instead this is a sharper display on
each corner going back to the way things
were and I don't know about you guys but
I really like what I see obviously there
is no cutout for the punch hole just yet
because apparently these are too early
with in production for that to be
confirmed that nobody exactly knows how
thick that cutout is going to be list
them in the comments down below what do
you think I mean do you like the Galaxy
Note taking an all display design
probably getting a smaller footprint
because I am really really liking what I
see let us know in the comments down
below I hope that this is gonna be
something final friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
on fucking out our comment subscribe to
both of our channels English and Spanish
