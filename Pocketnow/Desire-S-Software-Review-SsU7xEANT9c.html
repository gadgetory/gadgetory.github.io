we've already shown you the unboxing and
the hardware walk around of the HTC
desire s so today what I'd like to do is
show you the software that comes with it
particularly HTC Sense UI 2.1 so let's
go take a look all right before we get
started another big thank you goes out
to our friends over at negri electronics
who have graciously offered up the use
of this device so we could run a
thorough set of reviews on it now this
is an HTC Sense UI advice just like any
other HTC Sense UI device except that it
is running sense UI version 2.1 as
evidenced by this right here it's also
running Gingerbread the latest version
in fact two point three point three
which is really really cool now let's
get back into this just like any other
sense UI device it's got sense widgets
it's got the nice HTC dock bar down at
the bottom with your app drawer with
your phone and with your personalized
button which is now a little painter's
palette and paintbrush still has
animated widgets and it still has
proprietary widgets now by proprietary I
mean you can only run these widgets like
friend stream like you know this cool
weather widget and whatnot on an HTC
Sense powered device with HTC Sense set
as the the launcher on the device now
you can go ahead if you like for example
launcher pro or ADW launcher or whatnot
you can go ahead and install that and
use it and it'll work just fine but
you're not going to have all these cool
transitions and animations and whatnot
like you see here so what's different
about this phone than any other it's
really just an incremental upgrade HTC
doesn't like to go out and make a lot of
radical changes to their OS or to the
apps that come with it so it's pretty
much everything that you have become
used to just polished a little bit more
more smooth for example here's the app
drawer
and it's divided up into these three
sections now downloaded frequently used
which I really really like that I think
should become standard on every
android-powered device you know if I
have a thousand apps in here but i only
use ten of them i don't want to have to
sort through a thousand to find one of
those ten that i use so that's where my
frequent apps come into play but if you
want to see all of them here you go now
one of the things that I like about the
the samsung touchwiz UI is that it's
paginate 'add now what I mean by that is
you launch the launcher and usually on
Android it's this huge list that you
just flip through and it goes on and on
and on and on and on and on and on and
unless you're watching you don't know
where you know why if I look through
this whole thing and I know what I want
isn't on that screen then I go to the
next screen and well is it on that one
well there aren't really screens it's
just a row row row row and it gets kind
of confusing well TouchWiz has a
horizontal pagination so you view one
page of icons really and you flip to the
next one and you view another page of
icons you flip to the next one and so on
and so forth it's a little bit hard to
get used to for somebody who's used in
android-powered device in the past
because usually you've got this vertical
scrolling going on not really pagination
was scrolling so when you pick up a
Samsung device and try and use it it's
kind of kind of jarring to not be able
to use it just right away you've got to
rethink how to use it not difficult to
do but just one of those little hiccups
well this is HTC's take on that so here
is your app list and if you scroll down
you'll notice I've got this little bar
Raider you see that little horizontal
rule if I let go it will snap to that
and now i'm looking at another full page
if i scroll some more it will snap up
and i'm looking at another full page and
on and on i even have a little indicator
down here on the side that roughly tells
me where I am in my pages so very nice i
like that quite a bit again frequently
used is very very nice i'd love to have
this on stock versions of Android as
well but very well then HTC so other
than that there's no
an awful lot that I can show you as far
as what software comes with it because
it is all HTC Sense stuff it's great
it's wonderful it comes pre-loaded with
adobe reader it comes with their own
version of the chrome web browser with
some new benefits and features let me go
ahead and fire that up really quick so
it just looks really nice you don't have
any more of these plus/minus zoom in
zoom out because they're focusing on the
pinch to zoom and whatnot since you do
have flash pre-installed you can very
easily tap to load up the flash stuff
and it looks like I'm not going to be
able to do that on this one to show you
really easily but you've got flash right
there inside your browser the camera is
probably where they put the most work
into now I know it's a camera what does
it do it takes pictures right well let's
take a look at this go ahead and pull
over my t-mobile g2 it'll be my
spokesmodel for the day with its finger
printing stuff and let's say I want to
take a picture of that well normally I
can get glare out of the way normally
there's something called shutter lag if
I touch this take the picture I have to
wait a second before it takes the
picture this is immediate so again I
want to take a picture great stamps done
same thing with video there's none of
that lag that you'd experience before
with you know with other roms and
whatnot where you have to touch wait
snap and by then especially if it's fast
motion the pictures lost you know your
subject has moved on to other things so
very very impressed with the progress
that they've made their just fabulous
and it defaults to to high-definition
video recording right out of the box so
really great messaging and mail are
still the HTC Sense versions of the app
so a little bit more polished than what
comes with Android come back over here
and do mail again the same thing in this
case it's asking me to set up either a
pop3 or imap or exchange notice we're
still missing gmail from this they don't
really have a gmail feature for that
you'd use pop3 or IMAP most of the time
gmail is an imap client so you
disconnect to it that way or use the
gmail app which is what I have ended up
because gmail isn't real email but
that's a whole topic for another day
just to kind of close that thread though
it's a threaded conversation rather than
traditional email which is one in one
out one in one out so lots of different
stuff of course you've got the other
widgets fact let's go ahead and show you
some widgets over here I'll get to a
blank screen and all I can so we'll just
tap and remove and we will tap and
choose widgets now one thing that HTC is
doing is they're removing an awful lot
of the apps and widgets that come
pre-loaded with their device and they're
doing that so that you can go out with
your HTC dot-com account or HTC Sense
calm account and download more stuff
whether that's widgets well that's apps
whether that's whatever now I can't do
that because i don't have my sim in the
device right now but it's very easy it
gives you a list that you can select
from and download very very fast you can
see down here it's categorized this is
an android widget this is an HTC widget
HTC HTC yadda yadda yadda so basically
the same widgets already used to I'm not
familiar with the FM radio widget but I
am familiar with the FM radio app so
we'll go ahead and add that and if I
have my headphones which you do have to
have headphones because that serves as a
an antenna so here's my my android
headphones and that's all they are is
just my my headset but now I've got that
antenna in there I can now come in here
will choose which widget style we want I
like that first one so or I already have
done it anyway so what it'll do now is
it'll scan for the next radio station
that it finds and its past and a bunch
of them by for some reason but anyway if
we wanted to stop and listen to the
radio we could and then of course we
want to turn it off we just hit the off
button so just very easy like that there
we go what's turning on now and we can
drag this all the way out here
so there's my station you can see I've
got full stereo on it I've got this
little FM radio icon up at the top and
I'm even getting some information about
the song that's playing there on the
radio so kind of cool lots of cool stuff
that you can do we'll go ahead and turn
that back off and then we're back
looking at the widget so really kind of
neat cool stuff alright so here are a
few programs that don't come with the
device but will help show you what the
device can do from a software standpoint
so first of all I want to run speed test
now this is an edge only device on my
carrier and especially since I don't
have a sim in it so I'm just going to
run through an 802 11 n speed test and
we're going to wait for that to pop up
while I'm doing that this is running
it's got full HSPA on it so it should be
a very fast device if you've got the
right bands to cover it but it's also
powered by a 1 gigahertz processor with
768 megabytes of RAM so quite a bit now
with my with my internet this is a very
good speed I usually get about 15
megabit per second down and about 3
megabit per second up so you can see I'm
doing really good there we go ahead and
toggle this over 2 megabits just so it's
easier to see we'll run a second test
ping raid is really low which is good
there's not a lot of overhead with the
the Wi-Fi or the radio built into the
device but again about 15 megabit down
and over for megabit up so very very
good there obviously I'm not going to
get that if I walk outside and and do
this test over edge but you know that
depends really on where you are where
Wi-Fi is a little bit more standard
especially home Wi-Fi so next let's go
ahead and run linpack pro and again
we're doing this just so you could see
how fast this device is going to run
stuff so over here you can see we've got
41.5 02 mega flops took about two
seconds to run all kinds of cool stuff
so for those people who follow linpack
and know what these numbers mean and are
really interested in them this makes a
lot of sense for everybody else just
normal casual users like you and I
there's not an awful lot to see
just there's your numbers okay so we got
a few of them run next let's go in and
run quadrant quadrant takes a little
while to run so we're going to go ahead
and run a full benchmark on this and
we'll see what the ending result is in
just a moment so here are the results of
my tests right now it's testing at about
12 10 for some reason which seems a
little bit low but again these are just
benchmarks to get some numbers from the
the nexus one running android 2.2 is up
to a little bit higher than that but
it's still testing really nice and
really fast right in the same range as
the other one gigahertz power devices
and quite a bit higher than the standard
HTC Desire in the standard nexus one
let's go ahead and run another app now
run smart bench and get those numbers
and the reason we provide these
benchmarking numbers isn't to say hey
this device is faster than this other
device but it's so you can know
relatively how fast your device is going
to run certain applications calculating
pi for example is a good way to test its
math and whatnot but let's let the test
run through and we'll see what the
scores are on smart bench 2011 alright
so when interpreting smart bench 2011
results you have two numbers to look at
in the green is the productivity index
and in the red is the games index
productivity is what you're looking at
if you're just a regular business user
who doesn't play a lot of games and of
course if you do play a lot of games you
want to look at the games index so over
here we're at about a thousand three for
our productivity and 1288 for our games
index now compared to these next devices
these are super high-end devices it
looks like you know the desire s isn't
all that great but it is this device is
not meant to be a super high-end gaming
rig this device is really meant to be
like the nexus one replacement and I
mean look at this it's small it's sleek
it does everything that it needs to it's
fast and it does it all in a package
that we can all get behind and it's just
a beautiful beautiful device so the HTC
desire s running
Android Gingerbread and HTC Sense UI 2.1
definitely gets my vote of approval if
it had bands that got me really fast 3g
this would probably be my daily driver
and I'd probably go out and grab this
phone right away if you want to grab
this phone right away you can do so over
at negri electronics head over to pocket
now and we will give you a link and
current pricing on it know that that
might change as time progresses but
we'll go ahead and give you all the
information that you need to go ahead
and pick one of these up for yourself so
if you're in Europe or Asia especially
this device is going to be fabulous and
if you don't need super high speeds or
have the 3g bands that this phone
supports you'll love it it's absolutely
wonderful so again thank you to negri
electronics for showing this device to
us and letting us play with it for a
week or so we appreciate it a lot for
pocket now i'm joe levi
