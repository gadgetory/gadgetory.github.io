calm and part 1 of the video review of
the electrode
1000 today I'm going to go through the
hardware specifications for this Windows
Vista tablet pc first let me go through
the dimensions the device is 12.2 inches
wide x 9.8 inches tall by point 9 inches
deep and weighs three point three pounds
so this is really not much bigger than a
pad of paper and it really makes it easy
for you to carry around internally it
includes an intel core 2 duo processor
running at 1.06 gigahertz and come
standard with one gigabyte of ram and a
16 gigabyte hard drive the RAM can be
upgraded to a maximum of 4 gigabytes and
the hard drive can be upgraded to a
maximum of 160 gigabytes on the wireless
size it includes an 802 11 a B&amp;amp;G Wi-Fi
radio as well as a Bluetooth 2.0 radio
the only thing I didn't like about the
bluetooth on the device or that the
drivers do not include an 82 p driver so
you really can't use it with your
bluetooth headphones which is an
unfortunate also included is a 45 watt
hour battery which can be upgraded to a
larger capacity 70 watt hour battery for
longer usage times on the front of the
device we have a 12.1 inch xga panel
that has an anti-glare coating as well
as a Wacom digitizer so what this
digitizer means is in order to navigate
to the tablet pc you have to use the
included included tablet pen here so to
navigate here you just tap on the screen
like you saw i brought the screen back
on or if you want to go through your
Start menu you just use the pen here
using a digitizer has some advantages
and some disadvantages one is because it
only recognizes the pen if I rest my
hand on the screen here it won't
recognize my hand touching it and
therefore won't therefore won't
interfere with anything that I'm doing
but at the same time if you lose your
pen you can't navigate through your
device nor if you decide you don't want
to use the pine you just want to just
leave it in its little silo and just
quickly access things on the screen you
can't do that would have been nice of
electro via had included both a touch
screen and a digitizer hear something
that HP I've seen done on their consumer
tablets
the other thing nice thing about this
digitizer is its pressure sensitive for
so for you Photoshop users who are
familiar with wacom other the pen and
tablet combos you can use it to edit
your photos or create any images in
Photoshop with ease and actually some
fun there so that's a nice little touch
if we look around the screen you can see
it's got this nice black bezel Inge and
the screen itself is just very smooth to
the touch one thing I didn't like is
when you rest your hands on the screen
sometimes you do pick up the
fingerprints but you know what's nice is
electro via included a microfiber cloth
so you could actually wipe the scream
down to get rid of the the fingerprints
around the black that are actually
embedded in the black bezel there's a
lot of indicators and switches and
buttons and things but I'm going to go
through right now the first is are these
three little lights at the top here the
first is actually your battery charge
indicator light you also have a Wi-Fi
on/off light as well as your hard drive
running indicator in the center of the
top device here we have a 1.3 megapixel
webcam then we have on the left and
right here your stereo speakers as well
as a microphone across the bottom which
can be used to use your speech
recognition software oricum used in
conjunction with the webcam to do web
conferences web calls etc on the side of
the right side of device here there's
actually four little orange icons that
you can't see at first I didn't know
what they did but if you actually double
tap the first one they actually light up
and they're actually quick shortcut keys
for certain functionalities the first
icon lets you rotate the screen quickly
without having to go through your
settings this is pretty nice so you get
like it like I said it's quick it's easy
but the only problem is it only rotates
in a counterclockwise direction instead
of letting you go clockwise so you can
go back and forth in either direction so
if you go from portrait to landscape to
get back to portrait you have to rotate
the full 360 degrees and vice versa if
you're in landscape decide you want to
go back to portrait portrait want to go
back to landscape
the second icon is a quick access key to
the windows Mobility Center this is
included with most tablet PCs actually
all tablet PCs and it's just quick
access to information like brightness
volume Wi-Fi status battery etc the
third icon button here is just a quick
shortcut key for the Internet Explorer
which is really nice so you don't have
to go through the start use your pen to
to access your browser and the last item
we have here is a shortcut key for the
control alternate delete so it just
gives you get you quickly to the task
manager or if you want to lock your your
tablet up you can just access it quickly
here the other thing I didn't like about
these little icon buttons here was you
know one day it's they are lit so that's
nice but at the same time because
they're flush with the screen you can't
really feel for them you don't know
where they are exactly especially in
dimly lit rooms or in a dark room what
would have been nice if Allah is if
electro via had put a little dot or a
protrusion next to the icon so that you
could feel around and quickly just
intuitively just feel for those things
that would have been nice on a usability
standpoint if you notice here on the
device I'm actually have it propped up
it's propped up by this little stand
that it comes with it's a very
lightweight stand waist practically
nothing and it actually compacts to this
nice little size here so let me go back
to the device and let's go through the
other aspects of it across the bottom
here you'll see that it's pretty clean
there's nothing on it except there's
this little silo here for your tablet
now would have been nice this this
little silo is nice but problem I have
with it is it's kind of difficult to get
the pen out cci kind of struggle with it
what ever been that really nice is if it
was spring loaded or something of the
store just made it a little easier to
get your pen in and out
moving on to the left side of the device
we see a lot of inputs and switches here
the first is a jog dial so this is nice
for scrolling through your web pages or
any word or excel documents you just
scroll up or down and pushing in is just
a selection key we also have the on/off
switch as well as the Wi-Fi on/off
switch also have your headphone jack
your microphone jack a VGA output for
external displays or projectors two USB
2.0 ports as well as an Ethernet port
moving to the top here we have a pc
Express card slot here so if you have a
wireless data plan with verizon AT&amp;amp;T
sprint you can just get a card and just
plug it right in and you can access your
internet or your email without having to
use the Wi-Fi radio so it really gives
you just anywhere access to the Internet
and the right next to it we have the DC
port in for your AC adapter we also have
here a vent here for the fan to keep the
device cool as well as a fingerprint
reader which works really nicely lets
you log into this Windows Vista every
time you start it up or you can set it
up to remember your logins for various
websites and you have the just the
little key lock here that you can secure
your device when you're at your desk on
the right side here again it's clean
just like the bottom and all we have
here is just a switch for the for the
battery and if we go to the back here
this whole thing right here is the
battery here I'm presuming it's just a
memory slot and this probably is the
hard drive slot you're also going to
notice it's got a port replicator here
so that's really nice once not available
yet but we can assume that electro via
will come without it come out with one
pretty shortly so let's talk about some
things I didn't like about this device
here one like I said I mentioned earlier
was just these little icons here you
can't really feel for them they're kind
of flush with the screen it also would
have been nice if there were additional
where buttons things like a volume up up
down toggle as well as to some
additional buttons where you can access
quickly access things quickly in the
device you're really dependent on just
using your screen with you know again
it's a nice thing it makes it small but
from a usability standpoint I would have
liked something just some additional
buttons here just to use again like I
said I didn't really like the style the
stylus silo was just really difficult to
use and otherwise you know it's it's
just a a nice little nice little slate
tablet pc here again you can I don't
know if you can see it here that you can
see some of the fingerprints that I had
on here but again they included a a
microfiber cloth just to clean the
device so this has been part one of the
video review for the electro via
scribbler SC 4000 keep a lookout on
pocketnow.com with the next review which
will be the software that has been
included with this device</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
