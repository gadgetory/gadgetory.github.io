to take a look at the verizon wireless
motorola droid which will retail for two
hundred dollars on november six the
droid which actually comes in a very
consumer packaging is different from the
typical traditional verizon wireless
packaging where it flips up and you have
the box and the contents inside the
droid packaging which we will unbox and
do a hardware store in this first video
and cover the software tour of android
20 in a second video actually opens up
to review the device as such so let's go
ahead and take a look at the unboxing
and the hardware tour so let's go ahead
and remove the device from its packaging
by sliding off the cover go ahead and
put that to the side and then at the top
you have the motorola droid on the front
you have what looks to be little
markings which shows you what the
buttons are and what they do so motorola
really consider the consumer for this
device we're going to go ahead and set
aside the Droid and see what else is in
the box you have a micro USB to USB
cable which can plug your computer or
the power adapter here to charge the
device a getting started guide which is
in color and expands outward driving
precautions presumably for use with
google maps for navigation which now
includes spoken voice by turn-by-turn
guidance you have the FCC radio
frequency and product safety and
warranty information so we're going to
go ahead and set aside all the
accessories and take a look at the
device the front of the device you have
a massive 3.7 inch 854 x 480 screen
resolution which actually can slide up
to review a contiguous keyboard for
windows mobile followers who have been
following the HTC devices the keyboard
is
reminiscent of the Titan or tighten to
keyboard for us users that would be the
tilt or the fuse on ATT at the top you
have a three-and-a-half millimeter
headphone jack and it looks like a dual
purpose power and lock button on the
right side of the device you have the
volume up and down switch at the top and
on the bottom here you have a camera
button which you can press once to focus
and then press again to capture the
image speaking of the camera the camera
is actually located on the back and it
is a 5 megapixel camera with LED flash
and autofocus the camera can also serve
as a camcorder and record 25 frames per
second 720 x 480 resolution videos you
also have a speaker which is on the
bottom of the device if you're looking
at it in portrait mode and if you slide
off the cover which has a sticker on it
right now you have a battery and also it
comes with a 16 gigabyte micro SD memory
card so let's go ahead and put the back
cover back on there's nothing on the
left-hand side of the device except for
the micro USB charging port and on the
bottom here the buttons actually are
integrated into the capacitive
touchscreen like on the storm to which
you can also see on our video channel
you have the back button the menu button
the home button the search button and
also you have some shortcut buttons as
well on the keyboard right here which is
a shortcut for the menu button and you
have a directional pad right here it is
not an optical pad like on the samsung
moment but it is actually one that you
would actually have to manually click
through on the front at the top here you
have the speaker grill for your piece
volume and the volume actually sounds
very loud in the next video segment
we're going to
actually cover the some of the software
that Android 20 has and some of the
verizon customization it looks like
verizon didn't customize this device too
much except for including verizon
wireless visual voicemail which is a
subscription service and also we're
going to take a look at google maps
navigation which will give you turn by
turn direction so this is a quick look
at the verizon wireless motorola droid
i'm going to go ahead and set the device
down and actually power it on so we're
going to go ahead and see what it looks
like when it turns on so here when it
turns on you have the motorola logo
and then you see the red eye that's
infamous in verizon wireless's marketing
campaign for the Droid and it actually
says droid when you turn it on and that
saying chime actually comes on when you
have email coming in as we are getting
right now compared to other devices like
the HTC hero on cdma carrier sprint on
the sprint now network the droid is
actually not that much thicker it's
actually almost about the same thickness
it's a little bit longer and in with
it's a little bit wider but the device
actually feels solid it has a glass
screen and a metal construction for the
body so it actually feels good it's
actually a heavier device and as you can
see right here you can actually rotate
on this rotary dial here to actually
unlock the screen or turn on and off the
volume compared to the 800 x 480 wide
vga screen of the HTC imagio which runs
on windows mobile 6.5 looks like the
droid is a little bit thinner and a
little bit shorter and it looks like the
droid maybe a little bit thicker but the
devices are very comparable the droid
actually doesn't feel too wide in the
hands the keyboard actually does give a
nice click response to it and the screen
is relatively bright so stay tuned and
we're going to cover some of the
software in our next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
