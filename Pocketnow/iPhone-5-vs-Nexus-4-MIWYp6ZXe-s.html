pocketnow.com in this video we're going
to compare the nexus 4 with the iPhone 5
let's get to it okay let's get started
we're going to talk about hardware then
we're going to do some speed tests talk
about the camera really do a full suite
of comparisons here first let's start
off with the hardware these devices
couldn't look any more different the
iPhone 5 has a smaller screen than the
Nexus 4 at 4 inches and 11 66 by 640
resolution making for a PPI a pixel
density of 324 pixels the Nexus 4 on the
other hand has a higher resolution
display 1280 down by 768 across at 4.7
inches making for a PPI of 320 so
they're about 4 PPI away from one
another you can't see pixels on either
screen once you get above that 300
threshold you just can't see pixels and
both have a very high quality display
something to note though is that the
iPhone 5 cannot display true HD content
because the resolution is just not high
enough so if you're on YouTube or if
you're watching an HD movie it's down
scaling it to fit on the 11 66 by 640
display
whereas natively on the Nexus 4 you can
play 720p video although as we're going
to see shortly you do get small black
bars because the resolution is a little
bit greater than 1280 by 720
unlike the Nexus the Galaxy Nexus and
the Samsung Galaxy s3 and so forth so
let's take a look at the other hardware
two different design philosophies here
we've got glass and glass on the Nexus 4
which interestingly is is taken from the
previous iPhone the iPhone 4s and the
iPhone 4 which had glass on the front
and the back it's beautiful its elegant
and it's especially striking on the
nexus 4 because look at these little
circles there is a circle placed along
every millimeter or so and some of them
sort of turn on when you when you flip
it so where you think there are no
little circles and you turn it into the
light they kind of glisten it's just a
beautiful beautiful effect the downside
with glass as we learned from the iPhone
4 and 4s having glass on both sides
means is if you drop your phone your
more likely to crack the back because
now you have glass on the front and the
back and also glass can be as you can
see here a fingerprint magnet so you
might want to get a case for your Nexus
4's surrounding the Nexus 4 we've got
soft touch plastic here which gives it a
nice in hand feel it is thicker though
than the iPhone 5 and heavier so in
terms of weight we're talking about 139
grams on the Nexus 4 112 grams on the
iPhone 5 some people think that the
iPhone 5 feels a little bit dainty some
people like a little bit more meat to
their phone but there's no doubt about
it that the iPhone 5 is the thinnest
smartphone out there right now it's also
one of the most beautiful we've got this
really nice beveled edge we've got metal
on the back these tiny pieces of glass
on the top and the bottom but you really
don't have to worry about cracking them
because if you trap your phone it's
probably going to Nick an edge here and
unfortunately this metal is very soft as
we found out in fact you could probably
see some Nicks in here already I haven't
used this phone for that long both of
these phones really need a case you know
the nicer the phone design is that the
better the materials the more you're
going to want to use a case because once
you get a crack or a scratch it's just
it's pretty upsetting so very thin
design here on the iPhone 5 with the
metal and the glass and a striking
design here on the Nexus 4 with this
really awesome effect here on the back
now let's talk about specifications the
iPhone 5 is the Apple a6 dual core chip
running at about one to 1.2 gigahertz
it's got a gigabyte of RAM and it comes
in storage sizes of 16 32 and 64 no
storage obviously you never get
expandable storage on an iPhone here in
the Nexus 4 we get the Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core CPU this CPU
has shown to be the fastest CPU in all
of our tests and we're going to see some
day-to-day performance tests and see if
it's true when we browse the web when we
open apps and so forth we also get 2
gigabytes of RAM so double the amount of
RAM and we get storage options of 8 and
16 gigabytes so less than the iPhone 5
and there is no storage available on
this guy unfortunately that seems to be
the trend going forward is that we're
not going to have storage options
because it makes it easier to
manufacture
but unfortunately then you get smaller
capacities so the first thing we're
going to do is boot these two up see
which one starts up first so we've got a
power button on the top power button on
the side samsung style even though this
is an LG phone one two three press press
and found a vibration on both Google
Apple all right let's see what happens
see which gets to the lockscreen first
got the Nexus logo of the Apple logo
okay the Nexus for one the iPhone 5 is
up there there comes okay so the Nexus 4
was faster there now I want to compare
screen quality in order to do this we're
going to Mac screen brightness out at a
hundred percent on both so let's go into
brightness over here and display over
here and then brightness and hopefully
this doesn't blow out of the camera
because it's going to be a lot of
brightness okay so not both on a hundred
percent screen brightness you obviously
can see that there's a lot more screen
area here on the Nexus 4 but also you
can note that it's not that much taller
in terms of the actual usable screen
space it's about the same as on the
iPhone 5 because we've got these
dedicated Android buttons here so let's
go into the web browser real quick and
bring up a picture on both and see if we
can tell a difference in terms of screen
quality before we run into 0 before both
of these devices go to 0% battery
because they're on maximum screen
brightness so we're going to go to the
web ok now right off the bat here we are
on Google and we have a white page and
what you can see is that the white on
the iPhone 5 is definitely wider you get
a much warmer color temperature here on
the nexus 4 so let's go over to images
and this is not really speed test we're
going to do a speed test soon this is
just to see the difference in screen
quality so now we're going to search for
Beach okay we have a variety of beach
scenes here we're looking for color
naturalness if that's a word we want to
see which of these devices has more
true-to-life colors and we're going to
load up both of these we're starting a
kind of a zoomed out view can move that
over and so what we see is that warmer
color temperature really translates when
you're looking over at pictures here on
the nexus 4 you can see the sky is
warmer the sunset is a little bit more
orange although you could say equally
then the iPhone 5 is a little too cool
maybe it's a little bit too blue
but both look quite good if you're just
looking at photos here and let's go back
and let's click on this let's check out
the color of the water
so here on this water scene it looks
like the iPhone 5s doing a little bit of
a better job maybe in terms of making
the blue look more blue over here it
looks a little bit green because when
you add an orangey color to the mix with
a warmer screen things kind of look less
blue now another consideration when
comparing these two screens is that the
Nexus 4 is higher resolution so when
you're browsing the web does that
translate into seeing more on the screen
at one time and yes it does here we are
on the pocket now mobile site let's get
the address bar out of the way on both
it's not going to hide there and we can
see more of more content here on the
nexus 4 so here it's cut off on this
Nokia story but you can see the entire
Nokia story on the nexus 4 so obviously
higher resolution means you can see more
on the screen at one time and that
especially holds true here when you're
comparing the iPhone 5 with the Nexus 4
next up let's see how third-party apps
launch we're going to see which open
apps faster start with Facebook one two
three go and updating nexus 4 was
slightly faster the iPhone 5 was just
clearing up there let's open the camera
very important test because you want to
be there for that special moment one two
three boom okay that was inconclusive
that was exactly equal let's try it
again that was exactly equal okay let's
try
Twitter one two three Twitter okay
faster on the Nexus 4 let's try bad
biggies one two three bet Biggie's
faster right off the bat for the iPhone
5 and yep definitely faster on the
iPhone 5 there and let's check out
Spotify one two three Spotify okay
completely equal their note no
difference they both open at the exact
same time so pretty much a tie in terms
of launching third party and first party
apps let's go into the browser and see
which loads page is faster that's
extremely important
so we're going to go right into Safari
here well we've already got pocket now
open here so let's start there we'll go
to the bottom of the page and this will
allow you to zoom in but this has zoom
locked
I know the desktop version try to do it
at the exact same time one two three go
so lots of images here a ton of stuff to
load or over Wi-Fi on both iPhone 5
finished first or did it yes it did
finish first and the Nexus 4 came in
after that scrolling down the page on
the iPhone 5 pretty clear no white
spaces let's see we get on the Nexus 4
again no white spaces let's pinch to
zoom and see which clears up text faster
one two three release that was exactly
equal okay we're seeing that a lot these
are very very competitive devices both
top of their game so we're going to
click on this story see which gets there
first
as they slide around on the table and
we're watching the progress bar progress
bar iPhone 5 finish first Nexus 4 coming
in a few seconds later but of course the
page is usable and let's check out how
long it takes to load this YouTube video
okay let's see
completely equal let's try to go
fullscreen on these guys here and so you
can kind of see what I meant about the
bars on the nexus 4 so on the nexus 4
here you are getting some black bars
here on the top and the bottom they're
very difficult to see but that's what
happens because the resolution is higher
than then 720p HD on the iPhone 5 we're
down scaling here from high-definition
and you really can't tell I mean they
both look about the same in fact the
actual viewing area of the video on both
is about the same because of the UI
elements on the nexus 4 we're going to
go into youtube shortly and compare
rendering times for HD video let's go
back and do a little bit more on the web
let's go to the verge alright let's go 1
2 3 go
ok next is 4 got there first is ready
and waiting let's go down to the full
site here 1 2 3 go
and they're off
and the iPhone 5 one there let's double
tap to zoom in this time stead of
pinching zoom tap tap completely equal
no difference let's zoom in a lot more
and release they cleared up at the exact
same time and I got to say that text on
both of these looks really really good I
mean when you get above the 300 PPI
threshold text is just razor sharp you
cannot see pixels on the nexus 4 or on
the iPhone 5 so in terms of web browsing
performance it looks like the iPhone 5
is a little bit faster and and to be
honest we kind of think that's because
of the Chrome browser the Chrome browser
has a lot of cool features on Android
but it's not the fastest browser and
Google has taken it out of beta as if
it's done but we really think that
chrome is not done that there are still
further performance enhancements to be
made to this browser and that we kind of
wish that Google had included the stock
Android browser with the nexus 4 so
let's go to the YouTube app and check
out video so of course here often the
iPhone 5 the YouTube app hasn't been
updated for the full iPhone 5 screen
which is disappointing but we'll work
with it so let's click on YouTube one
two three go loaded faster on the iPhone
5 go into the Comedy category that's
fascinating and let's pick again the
sliding around on the table a little bit
let's pick this video here so we're
click on see which loads it faster play
a little bit faster there on the iPhone
5 but here's really where the the nexus
4 screen really shines because we're
watching native 720p video it's taking
up the full frame the colors look great
the saturation is fantastic and just
makes for a much better viewing
experience than this of course when we
get the update for the iPhone 5 YouTube
app it'll fill the entire frame but
again we're going to be down sampling
from Full HD and let's check out voice
assistance here so we're going to do
Siri and Google Voice
when is Thanksgiving this year
Thanksgiving Thanksgiving exactly at the
similar 22nd time 2012 amazing when does
Christmas take place next year Christmas
is on Wednesday it's December 25th
exactly 18 the same time
now what about photo-quality a lot of
people complained about the Galaxy Nexus
is 5 megapixel camera how it really
didn't take great shots and so let's
compare some pictures that we took with
the iPhone 5 and then with the Nexus 4
kind of side-by-side and we have to say
you can be the judge for yourself that
the iPhone 5 it does take better photos
it's better in low light it's also
better close-up it has an easier time
focusing so we definitely get the points
there too the iPhone 5 just in terms of
share photo quality now finishing up
here let's talk about pricing and
availability that's very important the
iPhone 5 is available on three carriers
with LTE the prices range from $1.99 to
$2.99 to 399 depending on whether you
want 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of storage
the nexus 4 if you can get it it's a
still up for pre-order or its sold out
early is available for 299 bucks or 349
dollars off contract unlocked which
means you can use it on any GSM carrier
you don't have to sign a two-year
contract
you only get HSPA+ data speeds which are
about 1/2 or 1/3 the speed that you get
over LTE and your storage configurations
are either 8 gigabyte or 16 gigabytes
the iPhone 5 off contract is extremely
expensive 600 plus another fee to unlock
the phones here at 700 bucks or so for a
new iPhone 5 that is unlocked that you
want to use on any carrier and of course
you won't get LTE speeds with an
unlocked iPhone 5
because AT&amp;amp;T prepaid for example doesn't
let you do LTE yet so if you want an
unlocked phone for the cheapest amount
of money really the Nexus 4 is a
no-brainer but if you want a two-year
contract
carrier you want to get the LTE speeds
and lock in the iPhone 5 is a clear
choice there so the iPhone 5 and the
Nexus 4 are both best-in-class devices
they both have really good screens they
have fantastic day to day performance
and solid battery life it's just a
matter of whether you want to buy into
Android or iOS it also matters on
whether you want to sign it to your
contractor maybe do prepaid the choice
is really up to you and hopefully this
video helped you decide between the two
they're both really really great capable
phones do you like this video please
give us a thumbs up and watch out for
more comparisons with the Nexus 4 coming
up soon that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
