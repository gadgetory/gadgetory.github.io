electronics you buy what's supposed to
be the best of the best and the next
year there's already something better
even if we don't like it we expect it
what we don't expect is to buy a
smartphone and have it superseded by a
superior one just two months later
that's the situation with the galaxy s5
LTE a which we've taken to calling the
galaxy s5 prime visually it's almost
identical to the phone we reviewed in
April but inside it packs enhancements
many expected of that predecessor so
just how I owed you feel if you bought a
galaxy s5 before this sucker came out
I'm Michael Fisher with pocket now let's
find out well to start with don't get
too angry if you live in the United
States as this phone isn't destined for
American shores to get one you'll have
to do what we did visit a retailer like
28 mobile they provided the demo device
for this comparison and if you want a
Galaxy s5 LTE a of your own pay them a
visit at the link in the description
below if you were expecting something
like the rumored Galaxy F with a metal
back or chassis well keep waiting from
width to height to depth to mass these
phones almost couldn't be more similar
aside from some new color choices and a
slightly more pronounced dot matrix on
the faceplate the LTE a variant is
physically identical to the Galaxy s5
despite the notable spec differences
will cover in a second day-to-day
performance is also very similar we're
long past the era of app launch times
being meaningful measures of performance
and while the LTE a does have a slight
edge over the stock s5 after a fresh
boot in normal use that difference isn't
much more than fractions of a second
performance within those apps is also
comparable which is to say it's usually
excellent
these are flagship smartphones remember
and despite the architecture difference
between their processors each is plenty
capable of smooth handling even when
running two apps side-by-side
the 16 megapixel camera on the new
device is the same one you'll find on
the well the other new device and the
software is essentially identical to
with the same shooting modes and the
dizzying dashboard of toggles the only
difference is we've found our small the
lte-a version lets you customize which
modes are displayed and also offers an
intermediate video resolution between
1080p and Ultra HD
it also doesn't let you turn off the
camera shutter sound as you can on the
AT&amp;amp;T version quality of the pictures is
as you might expect right on par
sometimes our stock s5 produces better
contrast and higher saturation than the
prime but other times that's reversed
shooting is faster on the prime though
especially with stabilized photos in low
light sometimes the prime comes out on
top and other times its bested by its
predecessor but in each case results
aren't the best trading eyeballs for
ears were still neck and neck whether
it's being used to blast songs from long
dissolved bands
or just to catch up with friends on the
phone the Galaxy s5 speaker fountain is
loud enough if in conveniently located
around back that goes for both of these
devices which are acoustically identical
from speaker to earphone and they seem
to have the same reception ability too
even though here in the states we can't
take advantage of South Korea's advanced
LTE network and you can talk on each one
about as long to an hour side by side
testing the prime and the stock editions
have kept within a few percentage points
of one another despite performing the
exact same operations for the same exact
time so it looks like you don't need to
be too concerned about that second
battery included with the prime you
might not need it as often as you'd
expect if you're wondering how that can
be considering the quad HD display of
the lte-a version we're just as
surprised as you with a much higher
pixel density we expected the primes
panel to be a real power hug but that
doesn't seem to be the case it does tend
to render cooler whites in some display
modes but the prime screen can also
swing nearly the full range of
brightness of the original s5 even if
the resolution bump isn't that
noticeable we'll take it considering
there's no real sacrifice maybe we owe
some of the unexpected good news here
too the Snapdragon 805 in the prime a
more powerful chip than the 801 in our
US version welcomed designed the 805
specifically with 4k displays in mind
and that plus the new GPU and added RAM
gives the prime an edge in some but not
all benchmarks more importantly the 805
provides a beefier isp and better video
compression which means it's almost
definitely responsible for the quicker
camera performance mentioned earlier
finally there's Samsung's download
booster which uses Wi-Fi and LTE
together for faster file downloads you
can actually get this on the stock s5 as
well but US carriers have disabled it
for obvious reasons while we couldn't
get the UI to show in the drop down
shade enabling download booster and then
downloading a large video usually
resulted in the s5 prime finishing the
job much faster it's a handy little tool
if you're a big download
while the primes special features are
pretty cool let's boil it down to the
essentials what are you getting if you
get the newer phone that you don't get
with the stock s5 a slightly quicker
camera a sharper display that you
probably won't notice unless you watch a
lot of ultra high def video a download
booster that you can hack on to the
original s5 anyway a processor that wins
in some benchmarks Network capabilities
that probably aren't supported in your
country and some extra accessories in
the box that you can find for not much
money elsewhere are these peripheral
benefits worth trading in your Galaxy s5
for a prime does it justify the anguish
we're seeing from some should you be
outraged that Samsung duped you know the
so-called s5 prime is a good device and
yes it is better in some ways than its
close sibling but it's a difference only
spec sticklers will notice if that's you
hey by all means pick one up but if
you've already bought the stock s5
there's no need for gnashing of teeth
wringing of handkerchiefs everybody just
chill out if you want one anyway we get
that head over to 28 mobile linked below
to order your own s5 Prime stay tuned
