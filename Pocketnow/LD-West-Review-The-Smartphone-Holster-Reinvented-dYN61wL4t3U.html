wallets taking up all your valuable
pocket space and you don't mind the
occasional double take on the street
accessory maker LD West just might have
the solution for you I'm Michael Fisher
and while the LD West's original might
be a little funky it's also one of the
most innovative smart phone holsters
I've ever seen let's check it out on
pocket now right off the bat I want to
say that the LD West holster isn't gonna
be for everyone it's best worn under a
jacket but when the summertime heat
makes that impractical it's a pretty
conspicuous accessory it's kind of
intense it also places your two most
valuable portable possessions your
wallet and your smart phone outside your
body in plain sight and exposed to the
weather so this is probably more a
wintertime companion to be shielded by a
coat what you get in exchange for
embracing the unconventional is
convenience once you get used to drawing
your smartphone like a detective's
pistol
it really is quicker than fishing around
in a pocket especially when sitting LD
west offers three colors and three
different sizes to accommodate
everything from an iPhone to a Galaxy
Note and the adjustable suspenders mean
you can carry that holster as close to
or as far away from your torso as you
like on the other side is a similar
pouch containing well the best made
wallet I've ever carried from the
stitching to the fabric inlay to the
stamped LD West branding it's so
beautiful I don't even mind folding my
American bills so they'll fit inside
as with many wearables there's a
definite learning curve to the LD West
it takes time to learn how to get a
detangled after it's been hung up for a
night and it takes practice to avoid
scratching up a fragile phone finish on
the magnetic metal clasps that keep it
secure but once you get the feel of it
once you make it part of your routine
you relish the empty pockets the holster
enables and you regret it if you leave
it at home
will I wear one after this review period
end I might wait until the autumn rolls
around but I'll definitely be missing
its convenience and craftsmanship in the
meantime if you don't want to wait that
long the LD west original holster is
available right now at LD west comm and
if you use the discount code and LD west
summer in all caps like your shouting
you'll get almost twenty bucks off just
