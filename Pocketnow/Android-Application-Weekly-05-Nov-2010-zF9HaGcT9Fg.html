Pacquiao calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which review five applications
in 30 seconds each so let's get started
this application is called color
detector in a disk free on the android
market what it allows you to do is take
a photo of anything and analyze the
color so right here I just have a male
or Emily Netflix let's say that you
wanted to I use this on your website as
a background color so that all you've to
do is select here select the little
circle and hit the camera button it'll
analyze and it will also speak the color
to you and give you the HTML code as
well as the percentages of the color
saturation all that great stuff howcast
is a free application available on the
android market and if your visual
learner this may be essential to learn
various tasks and operations so let's
say that i wanted to learn one of these
items on the featured page I can do that
of course but let's say that I wanted to
learn how to tie a double Windsor knot
I'll just search for Thai double Windsor
knot and click on the video here and it
will begin playing and show me
step-by-step instructions on how to tie
a double Windsor knot with a visual
display of tourists logmein ignition is
a great application if you want to
remotely connect to your pc or mac all
you have to do is download the software
to your computer install set up your
username and password and then download
it to your android device the program
does cost twenty nine dollars and
ninety-nine cents but is much easier to
setup than the traditional windows
remote desktop or even the mac remote
desktops we have all the various tools
like a keyboard and our network as well
as our mouse clicker here we can right
click if you want you can also zoom in
and zoom out and it does work in
landscape mode mint com is a free
financial application available in the
android market unfortunately because of
sensitive materials i won't be able to
show you my account on the android
device so here we have the demo account
of mint com on the pc so as you can see
we have our total cash or bank accounts
is
our credit and our loans and investments
and all that great stuff we can also
view our budget and this is similar to
how the display shows on the Android
device so we can also view all of our
payments and portfolios and all that
great stuff speedtest.net is a free
application available on the android
market that allows you to test your
network speed either through mobile or
Wi-Fi connections so the program does
find a the closest server to you either
by cell phone proximity or by GPS signal
so all I have to do is click begin test
and it will begin I'm using a Wi-Fi
connection right now so I can click
begin test it'll show me my ping and
give me my speed on download as well as
upload so we'll just let this load for
just a second so after the test is run
it shows me my download and upload
speeds so this is that another episode
of the android application weekly and if
