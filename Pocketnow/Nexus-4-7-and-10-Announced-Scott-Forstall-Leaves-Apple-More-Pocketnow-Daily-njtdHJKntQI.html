seven get released Microsoft takes the
wraps off windows phone 8 and Scott
Forstall leaves Apple I'm hi Natalie
vetta having second thoughts about that
Nexus 4 in a good way and this is poking
out daily contrary to what everybody
believed Google silently announced your
new Nexus lineup because hurricane sandy
pretty much water down there New York
event the Nexus 4 in the Nexus 10 have
made their debut they have some very
interesting specs but sadly I wish I
could say the same about their looks the
nexus 7 also got a 32 gigabyte variant
and a similar model variant but buyers
beware you've got really great prices on
all three devices but you get LT on none
of them these devices will be available
on November 13 so stay tuned yes Android
4.2 also made the spotlight in this time
even though it's still being called
jelly bean it's more than just a dot
upgrade first of all we get lock screen
widgets we didn't get before we get a
new quick settings menu in the
notification tray we also get swype
keyboard functionality along with a lot
more features though we still don't know
the data when this upgrade will reach
current generation devices most likely
it'll be november 13 microsoft also took
the wraps off windows phone 8 and as
expect that our full review is already
live there are tons of enhancement to
talk about with Windows Phone 8 and I
only got three minutes here so make sure
you hit all the links from Adams recent
videos on every single enhancement that
comes to Windows Phone 8 and also make
sure you hit the links for our full
review and of course to make our review
possible we need a windows phone 8
device so we've had the HTC windows
phone 8x in the pocket now last for a
couple of days now so far this device
does prove to be one of the greater
devices of the year so make sure you
watch Adams hands-on video with his
unboxing and first impressions obviously
also nokia has just announced a loony a
22 for verizon we've also got the
t-mobile line above Windows Phone
devices and Android devices happening
for this holiday season so hit the links
and get all the details of everything
that's coming up and finally for the sad
news of the day Apple is just announced
the Scott Forstall is no longer to be
working in Apple as the next year he's
considered by many to be the mastermind
behind iOS but sadly we know
what disappointment Maps was on iOS 6
and while Johnny I will take over user
experience and design and Eddy Cue and
breakfast Ricky will take over software
that leads me to the question of the day
do you think that the disappointment
behind maps on Iowa 6 was enough to let
go forestall I feel the should have
given the guy a second chance but leave
us a comment down below and if you want
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
will make sure you follow us on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm hi
Natalie better thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
