pocketnow.com and today we're going to
play around with the GSM feature in the
verizon HTC ozone phone which is
verizon's a global phone and has both
cdma and gsm capability so the first
thing we're going to do is actually go
into the settings and see if we can use
the GSM feature so we'll go to networks
here see the guy went too far so we'll
go to the phone and then into networks
and you can see you've got the global
operations or gsm only or cdma only so
let's try gsm only and it's got
currently in the unit a verizon vodafone
CD sm you can see we went to the signal
strength went back to 0 so now it's
searching so if we go back into phone
into networks you'll see we're searching
and obviously i've tried this before the
video just to see what would happen and
since we're here in the US and there
doesn't seem to be any roaming
agreements between verizon and AT&amp;amp;T or
tmobile we end up not finding a network
which is interesting because I would
have thought they might add a minimum
provide 911 service but that is not even
provided
in the US are at least in the area where
I'm at in a gsm-only area i'm not sure
what would happen so it's still
searching and it will fail at some point
and we get the ! up at the corner
telling us basically that it's failed so
i go back here i'm going to done there's
the air or the setting could not be
saved essentially there's no surface and
it says basically no service of you so
if we go in and i have happen have an
ATT sim card which has a valid account
associated with it it's really basically
out of my iphone it should work so we
will power off the phone here
and open it up get the battery out
always a little tricky but there's a
little tab here at the bottom should be
able to get it up there go put in the
TNT sip card put the battery back in put
the cover on make sure everything's
secure and then let's power the phone
back on so you've got the HTC logo and
then the verizon logo will come on in
the windows mobile 6.1 now you know
verizon has probably locked this phone
to their verizon Vodafone cards so the
odds of it working are slim to none but
I thought it'd be an interesting
exercise to try and if we could unlock
the phone the GSM side of the phone this
could be a quite an interesting device
so there's the message the sim card is
not valid please insert verizon sim card
device will default to cdma mode so this
is the location disclosure that
basically tells you that this phone has
a GPS chip with the location on so that
the location information is sent via the
phone will say ok but you see it
defaulted directly to see en paix mode
and it's verizon wireless so let's fire
the phone back off and they click put
the
right and carnage back in so interesting
experiment I'd love to see how it works
overseas but if this phone if you could
actually use gsm or cdma in the US then
you have no reason to be out of range
ever because i think between the GSM
network into the cdma network you're
pretty well covered in the u.s. it's
just too bad we can't use on this phone
and it's obviously for competitive
reasons a verizon has locked it to their
the GSM networks that they have
agreements with and they want you to use
their sim card my next video we'll be
testing the GPS and we'll see how well
it works with microsoft's bing windows
