pocket now calm the upcoming tmobile hd2
from HTC is supposed to have 576
megabytes of ram although the european
version of the hd2 this one right here
comes with four hundred and forty eight
megabytes of ram well there's been
rumors that both devices actually have
the same amount of RAM that higher-level
576 and that HTC kind of hid part of
that memory 128 megabytes to be exact so
this is sort of not spread rumors that
it would be coming with windows mobile
seven upgrade in the future well the
guys at xda-developers have created a
ROM that unlocks this additional RAM and
right now we're running the stock rom
and I'm just going to show you a little
before and then we'll do the after in a
sec so if I go to SD card and storage
you can see that right now i have a
total program memory of 336 megabytes as
you know some of its taken over by the
operating system so you're not going to
see the full 448 but keep an eye on that
number 3 36 and about 200 megabytes free
we're going to put on the new rom and
see the difference and actually prove or
disprove whether the european hd2 has
576 megabytes of ram which would be
Crichton quite amazing ok so we flashed
the rom that claims to give back the HTC
hd2 a lot of program memory the HTC
didn't include out of the box for this
European version let's see if it
actually hold true slide over here go
into SD card and phone storage and wow
yes a hundred megabytes nearly are added
to the total program memory and free
program memory before this number was
about 200 so we had about 200 megabytes
of RAM to work with the multitask now we
have more than 300 megabytes so it's
really amazing that the hd2 actually has
this additional 128 megabytes of RAM
that you don't get with the stock
software it's really remarkable and
we're sure that in the future when HTC
releases the windows mobile seven
upgrade to this device if it's actually
true that software will indeed unlock
this additional RAM for people that
aren't flashing their device with crumbs
as demonstrated here pretty amazing
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
