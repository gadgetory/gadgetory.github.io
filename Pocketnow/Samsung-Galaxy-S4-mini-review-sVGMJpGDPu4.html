mini is not such a mini phone after all
and they did perform quite well so
without further ado I'm Anton denied
this is PocketNow
and you're watching the Samsung Galaxy
s4 mini review let's go check it out
Samsung is not only overusing its
materials and design but with its recent
devices like the Galaxy s4 active galaxy
s4 zoom the Galaxy s4 mini
which we're currently reviewing it is
also reusing and heavily relying on the
Galaxy S brand in this case this year's
flagship the s4 we've reviewed several
versions of the samsung galaxy s4 and we
even submerge the Galaxy s4 active so
make sure to read those reviews on
pocket now and while you're at it
subscribe to our social media channels
to stay up to date the Galaxy s4 mini
provided to us by our good friends over
at Club that code at UK is this year's
miniature Android flagship from Samsung
it's not a mini per se as it sports a
relatively large 4.3 inch screen and it
specs aren't too bad either as far as
the phone's construction is concerned we
could limit ourselves to saying that
this is a smaller galaxy s4 we wouldn't
be lying to you since you'll see and
feel the same hyper glazed polycarbonate
case with the same color options that
plus the design is the same from front
to back and even the box itself this
truly is a mini version of the phone and
all respects our unit is the white frost
version which conceals fingerprints but
if you don't mind having a smudgy phone
the dark flavor is rather appealing the
galaxy s4 mini even has the same texture
on the plastic as its bigger brother
let's assume you've never seen a samsung
galaxy s4 or s3 or no.2 or mega and the
list can go on the galaxy s4 mini has an
earpiece sensors as well as a 1.9
megapixel webcam at the top of the 4.3
inch screen with 2 HD resolution
underneath there's the usual home button
flanked by the back and menu capacitive
keys the volume rockers reside on the
left side power button on the right side
microphone and microUSB port on the
bottom 3.5 millimeter headphone jack air
blaster and the secondary mic on the top
the back holds the 8 megapixel shooter
with LED flash and the speaker on the
bottom
the screen is 4.3 inches in diagonal
which isn't really mini named worthy but
in the context of five inch plus phones
we can understand the naming the
resolution however is qHD which is 540
by 960 pixels and we wish it would have
been a 720p screen but it looks good
nonetheless
we won't waste time now telling you
about the advantages of a Super AMOLED
screen instead we'll tell you this much
it's good powering everything is a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core processor
there's 1.5 gigabytes of RAM 8 gigabytes
of internal storage expandable via
microSD card slot 8 megapixel main
shooter 1.9 megapixel webcam Android
4.2.2 jelly bean and the 1900 million
power battery that's 7.22 watt hours
Bluetooth Wi-Fi NFC and even an infrared
port are present and since this review
unit we got from clove that code at UK
is the GTI 91 95 it has LTE radio
capabilities Samsung's latest TouchWiz
user interface runs on top of Android
4.2.2 yes we know the debate some of you
liked it some of you don't
it is however snappy even in the
software department yes for many looks
and acts like an s4 give or take a
couple of things like the missing LED
notification settings since there's no
LED light on the device ear view and ear
gesture you won't find as health as
there are no additional sensors and
Samsung tweaked the keyboard of the
Samsung Galaxy s4 mini to accommodate
the smaller screen you'll be using a
four row keyboard on the s4 mini those
differences aside everything is
identical or as close as it gets to the
s4 from the quick toggles in the
notification shade that have stock
wallpapers widgets and general user
experience make sure to check out our
full Samsung Galaxy s4 review over at
PocketNow as well as in the description
below to see the software in action
we've used the samsung galaxy s4 mini
over the course of a week and we can
tell you this much
we are impressed this mini phone is
snappy we tried hard to bug it down but
we just couldn't get it to lag or
stutter of course some of the
applications might launch a hair fast
around the octa-core galaxy s4 but
they're instant or almost instant on the
s4 mini - with our regular usage we got
more than a day's worth of battery life
nineteen hundred million power pack
which is powering the phone
that means phone calls text messages
social media and Facebook Twitter
Google+ taking pictures browsing the web
instant messaging Google Maps YouTube
videos Spotify music and even workout
tracking you will definitely get at
least one day's worth of action of the
s4 mini interestingly when we compare
the Galaxy s4 mini with the Galaxy s4 to
our eyes some of the shots generated by
its eight megapixel camera looked a
little bit better than the one snapped
by the 13 megapixel shooter on the s4
what we're trying to say here is that
the camera and this phone is good shots
are in focus well balanced and even
low-light performance seems to be decent
same can be said about voice and data
performance we experienced no problems
at all earpiece and speakerphone
performance was good and so did our
voice sound over the microphone but we
always want more we wish it had a 720p
display and we wish it had an LED
notification the phone's vibration is
funny noisy and the speaker could be a
little bit louder as for the pros this
is definitely a device you want to get
if you are not into big phones like the
galaxy s4
you won't be disappointed by its
performance because of all the
aforementioned
we are rating the galaxy s4 mini an 8
out of 10 which could have easily been
an 8.2 everyone this was our full review
