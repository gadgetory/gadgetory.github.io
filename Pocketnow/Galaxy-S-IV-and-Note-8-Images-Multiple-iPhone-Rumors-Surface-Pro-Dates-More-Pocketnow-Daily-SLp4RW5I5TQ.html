in the galaxy s4 the theory of multiple
iphones for 2013 gains traction and
microsoft sets the price and release
date for the surface pro i'm high metal
ravana in desperate need for another
gallon of coffee this is walking out
daily so the theory of multiple iphones
begins to gain traction usually what
Apple does is that they launch a newer
iphone and then the older iphone because
the cheaper one but as we recently
learned Apple is apparently testing two
different iphones a four-inch device on
a four point eight inch device and it's
really hard to know which of these
devices will be the entry level one but
we do know that one of these devices
will probably be made of polycarbonate
now we also know that Apple does a lot
of prototyping and these could just be
tests but that said it could also be one
of these devices is the new ipod touch
like has happened in previous years when
we thought that the iphone 5 was really
the 4s and it turned out to be the ipod
touch now Microsoft is just announced
pricing and availability for their
surface pro sales begin on februari 9th
and well the 64 gigabyte entry-level
model will retail for nine hundred
dollars they've also announced a new
touch cover design and also a new very
modern-looking mouse but the problem is
we still don't know these will be
bundled in the box and knowing Microsoft
that most likely won't be the case now
the only problem is they taken so long I
don't really know how many people are
actually waiting for this device anymore
i know i'm not but leave us a comment
down below are you waiting for it and
for those of you wondering about the LG
optimus g pro that was recently leaked
that finally became a reality in japan
the device is very unique very well
designed and very beautiful it looks
very different to the current optimus G
de we already know and there are some
software cues that are included that
make it quite the phone now aside from
that the phone does bring a beefier
processor and also a beefier display at
1080p at five inches the design is
really beautiful but we still don't know
when it will reach the United States or
any carrier so we will keep you posted
and for those of you waiting for the
galaxy s4 we've got good and bad news on
the good side we finally find the
rendered image of the device and
apparently it will look a lot like the
Galaxy Note 2 only on a small
chassis apparently it will be five
inches in it does look quite good though
the bad news is that sadly we were
expecting to see the device at mwc 2013
and a samsung executive has just
confirmed that the device will not be
available for an announcement we don't
have a PR announcement either so most
likely we will not see this device but
knowing Samsung they did the same thing
last year they filled a show with a lot
of mid-tier devices and then they
brought us the announcement in May but
apparently this announcement for the
galaxy s4 will happen earlier so we will
keep you posted on when that happens and
finally for the interesting news of the
day we've got leaked photos of the
possible Galaxy Note 8 and if you look
at the design it looks a lot like the
Nexus 10 only obviously in a smaller
chassis and in a white color and it just
brings the interesting aspect of note
input technologies to a much more
adequately sized tablet and another
interesting note here is that it does
have a speaker grille for you to make
phone calls though we can't imagine you
trying to do that but we still don't
have release dates no possible launches
but most probably mwc 2013 could be the
date and that leads me to the question
of the day what would be the perfect
size for a tablet or a smartphone that
you would prefer for note input in my
particular case I do like the 5.5 inch
Galaxy Note 2 but to be honest with you
I do believe in the 7 inch or 8 inch
form factor and I do believe that this
would be the perfect size for Galaxy
Note device so leave us a comment down
below and if you want an earlier scoop
of everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw i'm high memory better
thanks for watching see you tomorrow
