pocketnow.com and today we're taking a
closer look on the hardware on the
tmobile HTC Flyer so sit back relax and
enjoy the show for those of you may have
missed out on our unboxing we're going
to do a real quick recap of the specs
the HTC Flyer from t-mobile has a 1.5
gigahertz Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
it's got a gig of ram and it's got 32
gigs of internal storage and you have an
option for 32 gigs of additional micro
SD storage underneath this little panel
up here the Snapdragon processor is
really fast as we show them the kind of
the software review things are very
snappy it works very quickly hardly any
lock ups and there were just a few op
times where the sense actually crashed
we covered that in the software tour a
little closer look there it's got gsm
it's got the high bandwidth capabilities
there is the hspa+ will go down here to
speed tests show you some of our results
here so as you can see here we got up to
56 90 here and then I dropped down into
some lower speeds with the that was the
up 14 down 522 down and 722 up and then
the lower end speeds here are three
thousand and six hundred up and down
there so really the hspa+ the t-mobile
service on this has been fantastic even
on the road where there normally is a
lot of pockets I haven't had any
troubles getting signal on this device
it's got GPS Bluetooth 30 Wi-Fi b/g/n
den the capacitive buttons down here
there's three of them versus the normal
four and then the fourth button is this
green button here which is actually for
the pin you touch this and if you look
at our software review it enables the
functionality in the N trig screen we'll
talk about in a second that allows you
to write on the screen due to the fact
that it's not running
honeycomb or ice cream sandwich at this
point that pin functionality is limited
but it's supposed to get better one
feature I like about these buttons here
is that you can rotate them to the other
side when you tilt the device that's
shifts this down then green button moves
over to here and then when you swap it
back then it rotates back around the
problem with this is if you're holding
device like this and you flip the device
around then what you get is the button
starts getting pressed automatically
there's no way around that and you can
see the menu starts popping up if you're
holding on the home button what you'll
get is the home screen so a little bit
unfortunate there something's just have
to be aware of if you are navigating
with this device just to hold it across
this point or this point if you're
rotating the device back and forth it's
got a seven inch TFT display it's got
the N trig digitizer which is what the
pin uses 1024 x 600 resolution and as
you can see the screen is nice and
bright this is on full brightness right
now really easy to view in sunlight it
gets washed out a little bit but it
still does a remarkable job of keeping
that brightness the brightness is almost
too bright in complete black almost
hurting your eyes bright still if with
all the lights out and you turn the
brightness way down to be able to read
the glass itself is not Gorilla Glass
unfortunately this device here has
already got some dents in it it's a
previous review unit but it's got some
scratches and dings in it so if you have
this device my recommendation for this
particular vice since it doesn't use
Gorilla Glass is to get a screen
protector the outside chrome has taken a
little bit of dinging and denting as
well that not nearly as bad as the glass
dimensions we've got seven point six
nine x 48 x point five to the thickness
their point 52 it's not terribly svelte
but it is certainly nice in the hand
14.8 2 ounces a little heavier than some
other devices but not terribly heavy in
the hand either especially with this
little bump here on the back that you
can hold on to makes the device
a little easier to hold on to in the
portrait mode and then when you're in
landscape here it gives you another
little grip point especially with these
little to side beveled edges here makes
for a nice handheld feel it's got a 4000
milliamp battery 1470 ours is the the
noted battery life on this I found that
really this this gets amazing battery
life especially considering with the 3g
radio on all the time I've been very
impressed with the battery life on this
device 1.3 megapixel front facing camera
does a fairly okay job of pictures it's
better for skype type functionality and
you get what you would expect out of a
1.3 megapixel camera on the reverse side
you get the 5 megapixel camera here it's
again nothing special it can do 720p
video but that 720p video is just
resolution it doesn't mean 720p quality
auto focus camera no flash and then if
you take this cover off this whole piece
snaps off and there's a piece covering
up this camera that just slides right
off speakers are plenty loud enough for
this device a little tinny but it's
perfectly serviceable for watching
netflix on the go or with your your
child or yourself in a restaurant or
otherwise volume rockers here are nice
and solid no problems there headphone
jack on the top slides in very nicely
and the sound out of it was really great
coming back to the hardware form factor
of this device i really like this size
the 7 inch size so it'll be really
interesting to see the next few devices
are coming out the 7 inch screen size
makes it very nice to hold in the hand
and easy to use when reading it's a
little small when viewing like graphic
novels or comic books compared to the
ipad we'll get more into comparisons in
the next video but you know to say it's
still very very nice size form factor
and easy to carry around in a bag versus
the 10-inch tablets which are a little
bulkier and a little more difficult to
manage as far as the case in build is
concerned it's very solid device very
little flex there's no popping or
cracking the whip happens
like the HTC RS are the HTC but Samsung
Galaxy Tab 10.1 that we reviewed
compared to other devices in the same
size class like the nook color this is I
got a much nicer build quality than the
new color does and that wraps up our
closer look at the hardware on the HTC
Flyer from t-mobile if you have any
questions or comments or things you'd
like to see in the next video or on this
particular video we got the comparison
view coming up with some ipads and some
other devices leave us know in the
comments we'll get back to them as soon
as possible thanks for watching
