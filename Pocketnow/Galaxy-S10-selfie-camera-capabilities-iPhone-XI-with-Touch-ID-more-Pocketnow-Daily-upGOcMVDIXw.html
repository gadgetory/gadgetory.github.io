the selfie cameras of the galaxy s 10
and the s 10 plus and it's kind of
powerful new patents suggest that we may
really be getting an iPhone and both
touch ID and face ID in the future and
more renders to us at the Nokia 9p
review we'll ditch the notch and confirm
that it will bring Android 1 I'm hanging
that Iveta and you thought you'd spare
yourself for more Galaxy S 10 rumors
they're only gonna get more intense this
is a bargain out daily the official news
today begin with product launches as a
Motorola has just surprised us with a
new lineup of g7 s which is pretty much
their entry-level smartphone but they've
been the king of this market for a while
now we've got three variants to play the
power and the the g7 with the play being
the entry-level variant starting at 200
bucks and then we've got the power where
the five thousand milliamp hour battery
that's crazy
and then the g7 which has more standard
specifications at 250 these are all
good-looking phones we have a full
hands-on from our own Adam Lane make
sure you following the link in
description now let's talk about LG as
the company has pretty much teased that
one of the things that we should expect
for the next generation g8 is a time of
flight selfie camera meaning 3d sensing
and what are we gonna get with that 3d
sensing it could be better
selfie portraits but it could also be
better security as a time of flight
might be able to assist with that
obviously we will see as a face to
unlock on LG could get better with this
now let's talk about the Nokia 9p review
we are hoping that this phone is going
to be shown off at MWC at least I
personally am and well we get to hear
one that it seems that it will have
bezels no knotch
the second is that Android one is
definitely a given and then for those of
you that want to know what all those
five megapixel camera resolutions are
follow the third link in the description
that'll take you to the post because
it's kind of extensive what they can do
and what the purposes are that's gonna
be a really cool phone if it's real now
let's move the spotlight over to Apple
as one of the most controversial changes
that we had with iPhones was that move
from such ID to face ID touch ID was
already great now it seems that the
company might still be working on this
there's a patent filing right now that
shows a new way to get touch ID on the
display that apparently uses the rest of
the display and not just certain
portions of it to be able to achieve it
it's all technical you can read into the
description as well but that phone will
also bring face ID as well for those of
you that don't want to take your gloves
off in the winter I know I won't
and finally the hottest news today I
have to do with the missing link in all
the leaks of the Galaxy S 10 and S 10
plus we haven't heard specs on battery
and also the selfie camera so battery
apparently will be 40 100 million hours
in the case of the s 10 plus and then in
the case of the selfie camera we hear a
boost up to 10 megapixels with 4k video
recording finally at this Shen for those
of you that will get that variant that
has the additional camera which I
believe will only be the s10 plus it
seems that that one will bring a def
sensor which I wonder if that's going to
be time of flight or not whatever the
case may be let us know in the comments
I mean what do you think do you actually
use yourself the camera for video and if
you do do you care about 4k because in
my case honestly galaxies do a really
good job in video but and they also do a
really good job at bringing quad HD
video they're the only ones that do so
so 4k for me would be great that's just
me leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
if you want to get the news earlier
follow us on pocketnow.com and subscribe
to both of our channels English and
Spanish for more videos like this one

just go together on Instagram but hi
metadata please give this video a thumbs
up if you like what you saw I'm high
netting that I think so much for
watching
