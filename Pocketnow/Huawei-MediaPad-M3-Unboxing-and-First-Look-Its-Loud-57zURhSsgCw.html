market aren't really good enough devices
that were intended for content
consumption don't really meet those
needs and it intends to fix that with
its latest offering I'm high memory that
I would pocket now here for me for 2016
and let's take a first look at the
huawei media Pat m3 all of PocketNow
ziva 2016 coverage is brought to you by
XCOM global
Huawei has it necessarily soared the
world with its tablets in the past but
2016 has shown us that the company can
raise the ante in every one of its
departments the company sent us their
new media pad m3 a few days ago actually
before we came to Aoife for review and
our first impressions have been positive
so far the tablet arrived in a very
strong cardboard box that's clearly
larger than the tablet itself well then
we are met with the media pad m3 on the
side and then on the other side we're
greeted by the standard wires and well
there's no literature in this box for
some odd reason along with the usual
plastic that we enjoy peeling off at a
first glance the media padam 3 appears
like a very large Google Nexus 6p which
is actually a good thing we've got an
elegant blend of shiny sham furred
aluminum and glass and the very neat
visor at the top this could easily pass
as your standard tablet but there's a
lot more than meets the eye it starts
with the 9 point 4 inch AMOLED display
that provides a crazy 359 pixels per
inch at 2k resolution just to give you
an idea that's 30% sharper than even the
iPad Mini with then there's a 16
nanometer keren 950 processor powering
the show along with 4 gigs of RAM and
storage options that range between 32
and 64 gigs expandable the tablet is
also data capable by the way though the
feature is optional depending on the
variant choose there's a 50 100 million
power battery that claims to go as far
as 11 hours of video playback along with
charging options via microUSB you'll
also find the very nifty fingerprint
scanner at the bottom for added security
now what makes this tablet special is
really it's professional hi-fi sound
this is called the media pad again
Huawei has partnered with Harman Kardon
to include an AKM hi-fi chipsets with in
providing super wide sound 300 through
the dual speakers that can be found at
the top and the bottom the company
claims that there are also a pair of AKM
headphones that match the tablets
capabilities but sadly those that come
in the box either
and everything else this tablet runs
Android 6.0 marshmallow along with
huawei's emui
Huawei has built in some interesting
navigation gestures within the
fingerprint scanner depending on how you
slide more or less like the old web Oh
West days we'll be taking this tablet
out for a spin over the next few weeks
to see just how well it can blend to
content consumption so far let's just
say that these built-in speakers are the
loudest that we've heard an Android
tablet ever but then again we will be
comparing it against the iPad pro which
is the king of tablet speakers instead
of paying horrible roaming fees when
traveling abroad or the hassle of buying
another SIM why not try a smarter
