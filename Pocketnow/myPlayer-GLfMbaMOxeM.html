Park another calm and today i'ma show
you my player for your witness mobile
device and what this program is going to
allow you to do is tie directly into
hulu and other internet online
broadcasting stations so we can just go
into that right now wait for it to load
okay so here we are in the main page and
this is BBC iPlayer so if I click on one
of these little links here it'll
actually bring me to one of the stations
so if i wanted to click on one of these
the only downfall of this program is
that it requires core player so you will
have to purchase that or require that in
some way and it will automatically
launch the core player and it will begin
playing the video clip so i'm just going
to pause this right now and go back into
the program so we also go down to view
and look at hulu and there's a couple
other stations over here we can go to
the family guy once it's loaded we have
a page here for a family guy so we can
pick different episodes and these are
full episodes so if i wanted to click on
to subvert this one right here i'm about
steroids and again and will launch the
core player and start buffering your
video but it plays pretty well and
actually it's pretty high quality as you
can see let's play the full stream just
positive he's quite loud go back to the
program i'm going to go to some TV
station so if I want to get live TV it
can go here and see the full index and
as you can see it gives a larger rain
from many different countries in the
world so this program is a universal
program it looks like we have 539
stations in the US unfortunately some of
these stations do not work some of the
links are dead at this point but a lot
of them do you still work so we can just
go into some of those okay and here we
have all the stations in the United
States so there's quite a few to choose
from a lot of them are religious and a
news broadcast stations but there are
some pretty good interesting ones as
well go to view and you can i'll see
live radio so if you want to manage your
radio stations you can do that you can
pay different radio stations from here
and also add different links if you
wanted to so just click done
go back to many you want to go into some
of the options here so this is where you
can allow your core player to be
accessed and you can specify which
program you want the application to
strain from so if you want to stream
from this specified application or you
can configure stream settings
individually you can do that so you can
also change the stream speed so right
now it's up to 3g you can also change to
Wi-Fi if you want change the font size
and i like to keep it normal because it
keeps everything aligned perfectly you
can change the quality of your thumbnail
so when we saw the pictures of on the
Family Guy can change the quality of
that and when we have all of our
settings selected we can just click Save
if I click menu again it can also change
the way that the interface is set up so
I can either have it on a touch flow
which is the streaming which will allow
me to flick scroll through things or I
can change the standard and here we are
on the standard and has actually a
little bar on the side scrolling bar
that we can scroll down and it will
select it's not nearly as fluid as the
touchflo 3d type style so it's going to
go back to home so this is my player and
I all posts Linkin Park medicom is how
to get this this program actually is
free but unfortunately you will need a
copy of core player for your Widow some
advice and I'll also post a link on how
to get core player thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
