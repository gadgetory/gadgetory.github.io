pocketnow.com just about an hour ago the
quick application to enable the
real-time video chat was released on the
android market for the sprint EVO 4g i'm
going to test it for you right now with
mr. Jeff Farina you can find them on
youtube at youtube.com slash ultimo
that's UL t IMO 119 it's actually pretty
cool but it's got a big caveat so I'm
going to go into the quick application
here and here we go I'm going to go to
video chat and I'm going to see a
variety of phone numbers going to cover
that up on the screen but it would call
history and call Jeff Farina so here we
go and it's calling him let's see what
happens I'm going to go up a little bit
here okay so you can see me there and
you're going to see Jeff in a second now
Jeff cannot speak until he presses the
microphone button so Jeff if you would
say something I recall yeah yeah you
know the quality is pretty good the
problem is that the person that is is
receiving the call cannot actually talk
unless they press the microphone button
and they can't hear the other person
while the microphone button is being
pressed but I mean the quality as you
can see is not that bad i mean you can
see them full screen i can actually
switch the camera let me do that quickly
to the rear camera and here we go i got
a traffic violation in in Philadelphia
didn't feed the meter so let me jump
back to the front camera and yeah jeff
says i'ma say some more things that's
right now I'm just kind of walking
around my house to see how the other
frame rates baby audio stays especially
when I get
the upstairs no my feather was dumb I
think not Sophie how the wait they go
you are not coming up here sounds good
and we are both over Y over Wi-Fi right
now we should mention not 4g so this is
probably as good as it's going to get
and it looks like right and it looks
like we're losing Jeff a little bit as
he goes away from his hot spot all right
little better now heading back home
alright and that's getting a little bit
better I wonder though there's talk of a
premium service that has a higher
resolution right now this looks like
it's vga and not wvga quality I don't
see any options here I'm pressing on the
buttons the menu the menu item and I
just don't see any way to change the
quality yeah I don't anything yet I know
um I believe that premiums going to be
free until I believe mid-july which is
the five dollars piracy but you're right
it into the higher quality so so
presumably we are on the higher quality
right now I guess yeah and it's yeah
it's not too bad alright well thank you
Jeff for demonstrating this it's a kind
of exciting to do actually video live
video conferencing we're going to see
probably a lot more of this on other
phones in the future alright see you
later bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
