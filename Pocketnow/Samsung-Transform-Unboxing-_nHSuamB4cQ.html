pocket now calm if you've been following
a lot of the android news lately on
sprint you've seen a lot of the epic 4g
mentioned here and there and that is
from samsung however if that four-inch
screen is too big for you there is an
alternative which is also from samsung
now sprint is no stranger to touch
screen devices with slide out keyboards
so today we're actually going to unbox
the samsung transform which is one of
the new android devices for sprint with
a 3.5 inch screen so let's get started
so to make things easier we've actually
pre-cut the fedex shipping box or just
go ahead and slide the device right out
all right as you can see here we have
the box for the samsung transform itself
it actually shows the phone on the box
flipping over to the back it actually
tells us very briefly that it's a 3g
phone which offers the Sprint ID user
interface so it's actually a totally
separate user interface that we're going
to take advantage of here which will
actually show you one of our future
software overview videos and like we
also said this does not include 4G like
the epic this does have the 3g instead
so it's more of a mid-range phone from
there now opening it right up we see the
device right on top which we'll get to
next beneath that of course we have the
manuals we're going to have your USB
sync cable which is going to use the
micro USB so it's good to see a lot of
the manufacturers staying consistent now
with that design well of course have the
separate AC adapter which will actually
plug the USB cable into and the micro SD
card adapter which again is an also a
very good thing to see included here
this will actually allow us to slide our
micro SD into this adapter and put it
into our computer via the SD card slot
and now getting right to the phone just
very briefly peeling off the cover this
does actually resemble the epic 4g which
again we will outline in our future
videos but as you can see here it's
pretty much the same type design does
give you that slide out keyboard feel it
will actually go ahead and power the
device up first it'll give you just a
quick look
at the home screen when it does turn on
and then we'll continue our series of
coverage on the samsung transform now
this is an android 2.1 device so we
aren't going to be too far behind in the
updates as far as android goes off the
get-go which is nice it's always a nice
thing to see and you will of course get
the Sprint splash screen during the boot
up
all right it seems we are about to
finally kick into the boot up the boot
up has taken quite a while anywhere from
about 30 seconds to about 45 seconds
that's actually it's still going right
now however the advantages we do see
that the actual home key is that or the
home buttons are actually lit up here
which means we are pretty far along the
process and there we go as you can see
we have the typical android home screen
with the unlock as well as the volume so
we'll just go ahead and unlock this very
quickly and once again nothing has been
changed in our part this is just for
after the unboxing so none of the actual
widgets and that sort of thing have been
adjusted but the phone is good to go and
as you'll see you'll have your typical
interface here which we will again we
will go into detail on over our software
interviews I should hope this phone
fully boot up but for now this has been
an unboxing we're going to cover the
software as far as the user interface
what Samsung has done with this device
and especially the hardware we're
actually going to compare this phone
side-by-side to an epic 4g and show you
the differences in terms of the
footprint the overall screen clarity
screen resolution the battery size
battery life whatever it may be so stay
tuned for our next coming videos in this
series on the samsung transform with
sprint as always thank you very much for
watching everyone and please give this
video a thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
