calm it's been following some of our
Android device covers you've seen that
our past few reviews have been on
devices that are much smaller in the
form factor size however this device is
going to be much different the dell
streak is a android device / tablet with
a 5-inch screen in this video we're
going to go ahead and unbox that and
start our series on the dell streak
let's go ahead and get started now
alright and we are back in true unboxing
form so we're going to go ahead and
actually rip into this box right now as
you can see right here actually going to
pull this tab all right now we're just
going to slide the device itself right
out this is a true unboxing so we pretty
much go through the entire process here
with you lots of packing up on here
which we're going to just dumped right
out and there we go alright so placing
the Box aside as you can see we have the
dell streak now right off the bat this
is actually a very cool looking box the
final blocks itself is actually going to
show the facebook application as well as
kind of their little drop-down bars you
can see here which give you a lot of
shortcuts to a lot of the apps such as
the browser the foam the youtube camera
etc the side of the device actually
shows the car cradle which is actually
very cool looking and said it's not
included but if you can use this as a
gps what better than a 5-inch screen to
actually see that navigation app now on
the side itself is going to give us a
little more info now this does say right
here it's a 5 inch tablet and it kind of
gives you the the real life size of the
device and then lastly the back will
give you some of the specs now it does
say I want to highlight on this right
here it does say gorilla glass display
which that is the very strong type of
glass that was supposedly used on some
of the other devices however this one
now as you can see right there was
actually used in this devices
construction we get into these specs
right here a little more later on in our
hardware overview video for now let's go
ahead and cut this guy open and get to
the unboxing
all right now on the very top of the box
we have is the Quick Start Guide what
you're seeing on a lot of devices now if
we kind of give you you know some
information about the device itself
quick start looks like here we have the
back panel which will cover the battery
this is metal as you can see here that
is an actual metal back panel feels very
very solid and here we have the device
itself I actually have to zoom out the
cameras that you can actually see the
device in its entirety it is pretty big
will actually go ahead and slide it out
of the plastic here and I hold it up to
them next to my sprint EVO 4G as you can
see they're pretty big device however I
think this is going to be a great device
for a certain niche we will see though
after we use this for quite some time
now the battery actually looks quite
small quite quaint when you hold it up
next to the device itself it is a 15 30
million power battery for 1530 hours now
getting beyond that we have a smaller
box here which we have to actually turn
over to get out go ahead and put this
aside and this is likely going to have
our chargers etc etc now as you can see
here we have a little looks to be a
neoprene type sleeve well actually open
up just to get a confirmation and that
is it is a is a sleeve with the dell
logo on right there we have a set of
headphones with some gel earbuds more
information safety regulation warranty
manufacturer's warranty that sort of
thing here we have the world adapter for
the charger as well as another world
adapter the USB cable which uses that
strange proprietary dell charger it
looks it's actually a 30-pin just like
the ipods is very similar to what it
looks like well going a little bit more
depth and see if that is the same thing
as the ipod charger a little bit late
rom and then we have your wall adapter
here which is actually what it looks
like those charging adapters actually
slide into so we'll have to go the USB
charging route for this but that works
fine now what we're going to do is
actually put the battery in the device
itself and power it on now looking at
this here there's actually a 16 gigabyte
SD card microsd card already in the
device itself with a 5 megapixel camera
and then we also have these sim card
slot as you can see right here with a
diagram of how to slide the sim card in
which we're going to do right now and
put the metal back cover on the device
itself and we're going to boot it up
just to get a picture and see how it
looks all booted up now booing the
device up for the very first time you
can see here the buns at the bottom are
lighting up you now get the dell logo
and we just kind of want to get a very
quick sneak peek of this device itself
in this unboxing we will go into more
depth later on and our software overview
and we'll also go into more depth of the
hardware and the hardware reviews so
make sure you stay tuned for those
videos now typically devices take a
little bit longer their very first time
to boot up as you can see here we have
booted press the Menu key to unlock we
have a little bit of a quick start guide
and some of these little shortcuts here
and it looks like we can slide left and
right let's go to different
corresponding home screens you can see
there's actually a dot here that's
moving with that so we're going to go
ahead and do is get this guy all synced
up with our Google accounts and the next
video will be our software overview part
1 so make sure you stay tuned for that
and we'll give you a further look into
the dell streak android device as always
thank you very much for watching please
feel free to leave a comment on this
video to tell us how you feel about this
device and whether or not would fit into
your lifestyle and also if you like this
video give us a thumbs up thanks
