staggering 12.5 billion dollars samson
planning at ours 29th events hopefully
launched the US versions of the galaxy
s2 and Lisa what Android Ice Cream
Sandwich will look like all this and
more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm hi every letter with
pocketnow.com and welcome to android
revolution the show we cover what's hot
and what's not inside of Google's
Android project let's start this week
off with what's hot now what could be
hotter this week than the surprising
news that Google just bought Motorola
Mobility at least this kills all the
rumors of who's building the next google
nexus prime obviously it's going to be
motorola the deal went through for
staggering 12.5 billion dollars and the
deal was smart in every way if he asked
me first of all android was what pulled
motorola out of the chapter 11 pit and
well motorola did a really good job in
putting android on the map with their
droid lineup heck everybody comes up to
me and asked me if i'm carrying a droid
whenever they see me with my google
nexus one people don't really relate the
difference of what a droid is and what
android is so just to give you an idea
of who developed top of mine and so well
prepare for bigger and better things as
of now because obviously google is going
to be handling business a separate
business motor rule is going to be
completely independent though we will
see a larger lineup of android devices
coming from motorola from here on love
the idea out of the hot leaks this week
we have images of what we expect to be
Google's next-generation OS Android Ice
Cream Sandwich which you'll notice has
four icons at the bottom and then we
have blue indicators that's pretty much
it aside from that well and we also have
images of a Samsung zealots which seems
to be like a samsung galaxy s2 only that
its sporting LTE we also have on the HTC
world new releases of the bliss and the
pico coming up on blurry cam though
there are really good specs coming out
there hopefully these will just be
budget devices and while we have the
tmobile HTC ruby which is expected to be
the next t-mobile flagship sporting a
1.5 dual-core processor and really good
specs HTC also gave us a glimpse of
their probable next-generation NFC
device which is the HTC stunning which
by the way is that pretty much the same
HTC incredible s that we already know
moving away from HTC we have the pantech
apollo and before you tell me that
pantech doesn't really do good hardware
this device brings LTE to verizon so
we're hoping that this device will
really raised the bar for pantech
because in the past we were only used to
seeing a lot of keep software
part we're sorry and well aside from
that other rumors have HTC bigger coming
up the a samsung stratosphere and the LG
revolution two are really good devices
coming up so let's hope our man Evan
blass hooked us up with more information
on these leaks out of the launches for
the week set your calendar to August
twenty-ninth that's its the date that
Samsung's planning an event and we're
expecting for them to release finally
their variants of the galaxy s2 in the
United States I think that everybody's
waiting for and obviously will be on top
of it covering everything that you need
to know let's hope that Sampson doesn't
disappoint anybody aside from that
Motorola just made their the five plus
official which is the waterproof you
know groundbreaking device that
everybody out there needs just that
everybody out there doesn't want to
accept but it's really interesting it
brings the typical specs of every
smartphone but sadly it doesn't bring a
dual-core processor as of now it's
pretty much a mid-range device and while
LG Victor that we've heard of before
just decided to change their name to a
fancier device and I was called the LG
optimus sol and it's being released in
vodafone in europe it's a mid-range
android smartphone not really
interesting in specs aside from that
Samsung is also offering a galaxy r
which is not a galaxy s it's a galaxy
are that has almost every single speck
of the galaxy s2 has but from different
manufacturers it's got a Tegra 2
processor instead of a Samsung Exynos
processor really interesting to see why
and well aside from that be sure to
check out our reviews we have the droid
3 review full review posted by deke
Adams recently and well aside from that
Joe Levi is currently on top of the
Wildfire s from HTC which sadly is a bit
of a disappointment be sure to check out
the reviews as of now on the software
update side make sure you update your
Adobe Flash players it was recently
update on the android market AT&amp;amp;T is
promising to bring gingerbread to their
Samsung Infuse 4G this month though
they're just promising it they're not
confirming it yet and well aside from
that the european version of the HTC
Sensation just got done to android 2.3
point for gingerbread though since the
phone already rocked interbred in the
past you'd wonder what the update was
for not really sure hopefully I'm going
to regret adding this to the news
because the kyocera echo is getting
gingerbread again as of now let's cross
our fingers and hope that it's working
this time and not breaking devices and
finally if you were interested in
bringing your old HTC desire to
Gingerbread make sure you visit Anton's
recent posts on how to upgrade the
gingerbread and make it work he does a
really good job in bringing step a step
by step guide on how to do it so make
sure you catch on that moving over to
the dark side where we cover everything
that's heck related the motorola photon
4G finally got its bootloader unlocked
so before somebody figures out how to
pull it make sure you head on over to
XDA developers for your full
step-by-step guide on how to do it aside
from that the HTC evo 4g also got rooted
with revolutionary so if you stayed on
froyo just to keep the root upgrade your
device and make sure you follow the
step-by-step instructions that we've
posted and length aside from that
hackers have already figured out how to
port google videos for rooted devices
because you know that was blocked on
whichever device was rooted so if you
purchase google videos and movies and
you haven't been able to watch him make
sure you can't go on over to our post
and see how you can get it done as of
now really cool because hey these are
your movies you're entitled to watch
them no matter what you do with your
device okay so that does it what's hot
let's continue on with what's not
they'll really has bad luck with
smartphones and especially when they
desire to build a device that's neither
a smartphone or tablet nobody really
knew what the dell streak 5 was I mean
it was too small to be a tablet too
large to be a smartphone but then again
they wanted to advertise it as both and
sadly people are not after both because
it's currently being pulled by del it's
currently being cancelled sadly because
it simply didn't cut it people didn't
really like it so we're sad to see an
Android device that was probably
promising being pulled but sadly that's
the truth we really don't know what's
going on with Bell they don't seem to
figure it out sadly we caught on to some
rumors of a samsung omnia w another
really cool devices in a lineup that
sounded really promising and can even
had a 720p HD screen device on
world where qhd is pretty much the
standard that's what everybody gets
aside from the retina display you don't
really get much more than that so
imagine 720p screens available on
samsung devices but sadly Samson came up
and said no wait this is wrong it's not
real it's not something we offer at
least that's what they want people to
believe obviously Samsung is really good
in innovation so we are expecting that
Samsung is only trying to pull people
off their backs and well we're talking
about competition obviously because it's
too early for these devices to be
released we don't see the technology
being there just yet it could probably
be a midterm to long-term road map of
devices we can expect from Samsung and
well we'll just hit you back in the
future whenever Samson comes out and
says yes it was real we were just
pulling it back and will relate to this
pose and say hey yeah we leaked it
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high middle
you better remember to give us a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
