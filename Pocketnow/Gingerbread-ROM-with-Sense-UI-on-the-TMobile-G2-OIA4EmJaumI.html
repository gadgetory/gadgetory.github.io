gingerbread is the latest operating
system for android-powered smartphones
honeycomb of course is for tablets HTC
Sense is one of the cooler you eyes user
interfaces or skins if you want to call
it that that you can have on an
android-powered device but what do you
do if you want both and what do you do
if you want both on a phone that didn't
come with either well thanks to this rom
I've got your solution at least if
you're using a tmobile g2 let's go take
a look this is my t-mobile g2 which
originally came with Froyo or android
2.2 what I want to do is go ahead and
power it on and you can see down here
this is a villain rom and their tagline
is free your android now the cool thing
about villain roms like cyanogenmod
they're based on a whole bunch of stuff
the a sop sources for android but also
some other bits and pieces that they
let's just say they procure from from
other sources and we'll leave it at that
some of those things i'm talking about
our HTC Sense now this is a g2 it didn't
come with since it came with the stock
Android experience which honestly is one
of the things that drew me to this phone
there wasn't any of that overhead now of
course a lot of you like HTC Sense UI
and I don't blame you it looks great it
functions well so after we've booted up
and I've kind of stalled here a little
bit so that it can continue loading
things you'll notice the traditional
sense lock screen and we can drag down
to unlock just like that very smooth
we've got the flip clock which has
become the kind of iconic already UI and
then the nice little curved button dock
down at the bottom with the app drawer
over on the left with options to go from
all apps to your most frequently used
apps to your downloaded apps which is a
very nice feature in a very
fluid interface down here that button is
kind of a slider and it's going along
with it which is something that if
you've used since you're very familiar
with the phone button is front and
center and that's really it makes sense
i mean you know you've got a phone here
first and foremost on some other phones
like like the motorolas you have the app
drawer in the middle with the phone off
to the side and that really is the way
that most of android phones work the
third button down here is reserved for
the personalized button which is kind of
the kitchen sink for personalizing your
phone it lets you change the scene the
wallpaper and the skin those are all
kind of tied together it lets you add
widgets to the home screen and you've
seen all those before enna personalize
your your sounds right there as well so
you've all seen that now I don't know if
these are the new widgets that people
have been talking about because there is
a new version of HTC Sense UI they look
the same to me but I defer to your
better views see if you guys know
anything more about that let's go ahead
and that head into settings now so you
can see what this is and to do that
we're going to come all the way down to
about phone down at the bottom and on
about phone I'm going to come to
software information now this is android
version 2.3 it's two point three point
nothing which means there's a couple
more versions out there that this
doesn't have specifically the latest
version is two point three point three
HTC Sense version is 2.1 and the kernel
version is 2.6 point 32 point 28
cyanogenmod so we are using a
cyanogenmod style colonel that's been
customized of course to be able to run
all of the sense stuff but it's very
fast it's very fluid it's very
nice-looking if you've wanted to have a
sense experience on your t-mobile g2 you
can do that now with either Froyo or
gingerbread one little caveat here there
are two files that you need to download
and flash and of course you don't need
to do a full wipe and factory reset on
your device
before you do that I'll have links to
all those over in the article at
pocketnow.com so you can know exactly
what you need to do but the the froyo
version is pretty finished its polished
it's pretty well done I tried that
before I shot this video the gingerbread
version still has some things that it
doesn't do well there there are some
known bugs if you will and you do have
to flash those two files one of them is
the ROM and one of them is a patch to
fix and already known bug installing
apps from the SD card another thing is
and I don't know if I can get it to
reproduce but if you rotate the screen
the home screen a couple times which
it's not doing right here what's going
to happen is these buttons on the bottom
get all kind of squished and wonky and
it's weird so don't go into this
thinking it's a fully cooked product
it's not but it's still very good and
it's functional enough to be your daily
driver as long as you are a little bit
more patient of course they're going to
be updates to this coming along so if
you want two people on top of that
you'll want to make sure that you keep
up with what's happening over at the
villain rom camp and i'll have a link to
that in the article as well pretty cool
seeing what you can do and put stuff
that didn't come on your phone onto a
phone that really wasn't even supposed
to have it it's HTC Sense it's
gingerbread it's t-mobile it's the g2
very cool stuff go ahead and give this
video a thumbs up if you like to see
these custom style roms in action on
actual devices that you might have in
your pocket right now if you have any
questions or comments leave those down
below and head over to the article so
you can make sure and get all of those
links for pocket now I'm Jolie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
