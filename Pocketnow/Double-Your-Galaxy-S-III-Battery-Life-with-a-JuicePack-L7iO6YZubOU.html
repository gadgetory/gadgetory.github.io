pocketnow.com so you've got a galaxy s3
and you have pretty good battery life
but what about those really long nights
were those extended days what if you're
going camping you just need your battery
to last a lot longer without having to
plug in well mophie makes a juice pack
for the galaxy s3 and it doubles your
battery life let's talk about it so if
you're running low on battery power on
your device there are several things you
can do you can replace the battery which
is probably one of the most reasonable
things to do you just have to remember
to carry the battery with you and if the
battery is user replaceable that is
another thing you could do is plug into
the wall or you could have one of those
power bricks that you charge and plug
into but that's not really a good
solution because you can't really have a
power brick in your pocket wats charging
your phone while your phones in there
well you can but you'd have a big bulge
in your pocket mophie makes a product
and they've made products for many
phones that act as a case and a charger
at the same time and this is called the
juice pack for the galaxy s3 and as
mentioned it's both a case and a charger
and it will actually double the battery
life were almost doubled the battery
life of your Galaxy s3 because it's got
a 2,300 milliamp hour battery inside
galaxy s3 is a 2500 million power
battery inside of course the big
downside to this is well you'll see in a
sec so we can slide this in it slides in
pretty easily clicks on the bottom and
we add this second part and now you have
a case and also a charger so the way
this works is simple you go to the back
and you flip the switch by the way you
can press and hold the button to see how
much juice you have and it's charging so
essentially it's transferring the power
from the juice pack to your phone as if
you are plugged in when it's done when
the the batteries reached a hundred
percent you take off the juice pack you
put it away and you have just your phone
that's left now of course the huge
downside to this is that the juice pack
has a tremendous tremendous amount of
thickness to your Galaxy s3 again the
idea here isn't that you have this on
all day long it's that when you need the
power you put it on you put
for about two to four hours depending on
how long the galaxy s three tix to
charge which is about three and half
four hours then you take it off so a
really good solution it's a hundred
bucks it's more expensive than just
buying a replacement battery but you
have the added convenience of the form
factor kind of acting as a case here so
you can still continue to use the phone
quite quite well with the case on
although it is it is quite a big thick
case so thanks to mophie for sending
this out for review we just wanted to do
a quick video showing what it's like on
the galaxy s3 because I know a lot of
people in the mophie from other products
that's it for now
