now calm have you ever gotten home late
and tried fumbling around with your keys
trying to figure out which key gets you
inside well many other people have used
their display on their phone to try to
see in the dark but that doesn't work
too well and today i'm SEO program is
called torch button it's a free program
and i will post a link in pacu now calm
as to how to get this and the program is
pretty simple it has these five
functions and I will go through each one
of those so the first one you can see
here is the touch button blink and what
this program does is actually activates
the LED on your camera flash so if I go
in here I can look on the back and as
you can see it's blinking so that's
pretty neat that can be used for
situations where you're walking down the
street or whatnot the next one is the
bright function so we'll go to that one
and that was really bright so if your
LED is it's pretty bright it's very
bright so as you can see it almost like
blinds the camera the next one is the
push to talk button so if you have a
device that has pushed to talk like the
HTC fuze through AT&amp;amp;T you can use that
or any other phone out there that has a
push-to-talk button with the camera
flash so the next one is the SOS and
that is just an SOS so like Morse code
dot dot dot dot dot and the next one is
the dimmer flashlight so you can turn
that on and it's not nearly as bright as
the bright one but it still works very
well so this is a torch button i'll post
a link i'm talking out a calmness to how
to get this the program is free and will
run on most windows mobile devices
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
