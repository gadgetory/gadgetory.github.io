pocketnow.com if you've got a smartphone
you probably use your mapping
application all the time they are so
handy for finding directions to places
for getting traffic info for finding
nearby coffee shops and restaurants it
just those goes on and on they are so
powerful and they're so useful thanks to
GPS and these days smart phones get GPS
fixes in like a second so if the phone
knows where you are
it can provide a ton of location-based
services based on your location Google
Maps is now available on the web we're
going to take a look at it in this video
let's get to it so right now Google Maps
on Android and iOS are different and
it's a lot better actually on Android
which makes sense because Google makes
Android and Google Maps is also a
product of Google obviously so we've got
added features like this awesome two
finger scroll which allows us to pivot
the map and then turn it we've also got
a really cool way to see the tops of
buildings if we get close to an area
these buildings will sort of rise out of
the ground but you have to be in the
right place to do it
so we'll go over here and this really
helps you to be precise when you're
trying to navigate and you are on the
ground somewhere and here are the
buildings over here and we can get
closer you can see just this 3d view of
these buildings and if you tilt it it
looks so futuristic and so awesome to be
able to look at a map in this way and of
course from here we can turn on various
layers through this button here we can
turn on traffic take a look at the
conditions on the road we can turn on
satellite view terrain and even go to
more layers to get different ones that
are available for Google Maps very
helpful you can even use Street View on
this the iOS version is very similar
it's got some similar capabilities
except for those few that were just
mentioned another thing that the Android
app does that iOS does not do is
turn-by-turn speech navigation so it'll
actually tell you where to go and it'll
be like a real navigation like a Garmin
or another standalone GPS device right
on your dashboard so definitely in terms
of Google Maps Android has iOS B but now
they've released a version of Google
Maps for the web that levels the playing
field so we're going to go to the web
browser on
both of these devices and here we go and
the interface is exactly the same except
that an Android of course you get a
little bit more space on the bottom here
cut because in iOS you have this bar
down here so they're basically the same
we're going to move the iPhone away so
we can talk about the interface here on
the Android phone so very simple it
doesn't even have pinch-to-zoom
you might be wondering why would I use
the the web app version if I could just
use the regular app the native app that
has all the features we're gonna talk
about that in a sec but first in order
to use this you have to use these
on-screen controls which feels kind of
last year really and up here we've got
some buttons we can search obviously for
a nearby coffee shop after pressing the
little compass there which will find
your location using GPS on your phone
we've got layers just like we have on
the regular app and right now it's got a
layer for a location that I found you
can also turn on satellite view turn
that off and you know it's very similar
to what you get in terms of the the
regular mobile app over here to the
right is history so you can drill in and
see where you've been and where you
certain what you search for and to the
right we've got some other inference of
information get directions this won't do
the turn-by-turn based navigation
unfortunately you got to go to the app
to do that and then we go to my map you
can clear map to remove any markers that
you might have and you can sign out of
your account and get help now you might
be wondering why would I want to use
Google Maps in the web when I can just
go to the regular app and get all the
features here's why so let's go to a
website and interestingly it hides the
address bar unless you open it up by
pressing the Menu key and we're in
Android of course so google.com let's
say you are searching for something say
you're searching for pizza and it knows
where you are as is the case with the
you know Google calm on a mobile device
and we scroll down and we see a Mac
right and we say okay here's a pizza a
pizza place we want to go to so you
click on that and then you get an entry
for maps and if you tap on maps you'll
get a choice you want to use the
Internet or do you want to open up the
Maps application well if you go to the
Internet keeps everything on the same
program really not that big of a deal to
be honest too
open up the mobile app you can do that
from that previous screen anyhow but
this just makes the the workflow a
little bit more streamlined so you're
not bouncing in an app out of multiple
applications so that's Google Maps on
the web it's it's very simple and it
kind of lacks a lot of features then you
really need to add more features to make
it be as compelling as it is in the
application that you can run sort of by
itself so let us know what you think
about Google Maps on the web try it on
your Android or iOS device gave us some
feedback and let us know what you think
about it and if it's something that you
would actually use if you liked this
video please give us a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
