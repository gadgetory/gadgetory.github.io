unwrapped in more detail and here's
everything you need to know we have some
new renders of the Galaxy Note 10 and
the Galaxy Note empro side-by-side and
Apple just revealed a trick for their
new find my application to work and it
actually involves spending more money
maybe I'm high memory that I am yes this
is Friday but we've got so much content
and so much work coming up that I don't
think this is gonna feel like a weekend
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with deals those of you
in the market for an Amazon echo dot
which I am a huge fan of even if they I
don't know them they listen to your
conversations or whatever I wish anyways
the point is if you're looking for one
right now Macy's which I was like whoa
Macy's is selling echo dots okay fine
they've got them for 40 bucks and then
if you want to get them even cheaper I
mean you could also go just to Amazon
and those are currently for $30 you can
learn more in the description now let's
talk about the things that Apple did not
mention back at WWDC particularly with
what is going to be the feature with iOS
13 we did cover some reports that 3d
touch might die and according to sources
in the beta for iOS 13 there is no 3d
touch there's the whole option for
haptic touch which is what we see in the
iPhones and are the thing about it is
you know I I try to understand the
differences between one or the other
because they're both a long press pretty
much and it seems there aren't any which
is the reason why it makes sense for
Apple to be killing 3d touch the whole
concept of why are we adding extra
hardware to the display of we could
pretty much pull it off other ways the
haptic touch is pretty much deal I mean
we even see on the pixel three a to a
certain degree so uh there's no in the
comments if you're gonna miss it because
I definitely won't and since we're
talking about Apple another thing that
was not necessarily explained over how
it worked was the fine my service
obviously a lot of people are
questioning like if I leave my Mac lost
somewhere or another Apple product that
it's switch off how is it that Apple is
going to be able to pinpoint it and also
keep my connection secure it turns out
that's actually a very ingenious amove
what the company is going to do is
pretty
crowdsource connect your product through
bluetooth to another that's not
necessarily your other product it could
be anybody's phone around there I'll
send an encrypted message that encrypted
message will come back but there is a
catch you will need to own another Apple
product as the only way that you are
going to be able to know where your
product is is if that second Apple
product is able to decrypt the message
from you know whatever product is lost
so it's a genius move I'm actually
looking forward to it because I am
wondering like if you lost an iPhone and
somebody switched it off or the other
day that I almost left my Mac on the
plane guys for me this is a big deal but
yeah let's see it in action whenever it
comes out and yes let's also talk a
little bit about Huawei what the status
is we haven't really heard much over the
political implications of everything
that's happening we've discussed this in
extensive length you can just watch the
previous part now it's a lease think
about it is yesterday we cover that the
mate X is still going to happen now we
see that the company has just signed
with a Russian carrier NTS 4 of 5g
connectivity obviously we know how the
situation is between Russia and the
United States so it's not like if this
doesn't make sense but point is Huawei
is deploying their 5g and yet they've
got more country signing up I guess
we'll see how that ends up now another
thing that we covered yesterday war
renders of the Galaxy Note n and
everything that we had seen but we had
only seen renders of one of the devices
for those of you that want to know how
both devices look finally we've got
renders of both of I so side by side
they look gorgeous they look really good
but obviously there are some caveats
with this design particularly the fact
that there is no headphone jack and
either of these two models we thought
that at least the small one would
probably bring one but no there are no
dual selfie camera sadly the only way
you could find an extra camera is in the
back of the Galaxy Note empro and
correct me if I'm wrong but this looks a
lot like looking at a P 30 Pro the
rumored specifications for the note 10
Pro included Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 12
gigs of ram a 4500 milliamp hour battery
and 45 watt fast charging along with a
six point seven five inch display
compared to the regular note 10 six
point three in addition to less ram in
their battery in the regular no.10 I
think that these are going to be very
hot phones and I'm still inclined more
to the smaller one but we'll see what we
get
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with Google's stadia connect it is
now well it was official already but we
really didn't get as much information as
we needed for those of you curious as to
whether it's worth it or not here's what
you're getting I mean first of all it'll
run on a chromecast Ultra Chrome OS
devices chrome and pixel 3 and pixel 3 a
phones for now yeah I said the pixel 3 a
you can buy stadia pro which gives you
access to a library of games for $9.99 a
month this is pretty much a Netflix of
games because you won't get the hottest
ones but you'll still be able to play
without limits whatever is in the
library there is an option for on-demand
of single games they call this stadia
base though it's just one game you play
it all you want and that's it
they also announce the founders edition
package which I just pre-ordered and it
includes a limited edition controller a
full-on destiny to bundle three months
of stadium pro which you can actually
share with a friend and then early
access to a unique username offer 129
which of you do the math is around a
$300 anyways they announced some games
like Darksiders Genesis and Tom Clancy's
Ghost Recon get packed which will be
their first exclusive game will happen
in 2020 and the the only catch is that
you'll have to wait until November for
all of this you pre-ordered today and
yeah I just noticed in the email you
don't get anything until November sadly
whatever the case may be let us know in
the comments down below what do you
think about steady I mean $10 a month
think about it and you can get their
library of games and I assume that
whenever hotter games come you're gonna
have to pay extra for these but let us
know in the comments down below of you
like stadia or not because in my case I
mean if it plays in a pixel 3a and it
also plays in my TV and that controller
and this and that you know guys for 129
I'm down for that the starter bundle I
just grabbed it I just by the way you
can't get your unique user name now
it'll be until November so that's that
leave us a comment down below I again
I've pre-ordered I'm really interested

news earlier follow us I'm fucking out
