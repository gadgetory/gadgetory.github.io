is brought to you by XCOM global now
let's take a second to talk about style
joining a number of other manufacturers
this year designer Michael Kors is
taking a stab at delivering an Android
wear watch the smart play here is using
to watch casings which have already
proven popular with fans of this brand
the notion being rather than calling
attention to the technology of this
product making it stand out for bringing
gadgety features to someone's wrist
instead this watch should blend in
better with that individual who already
uses Michael Kors products these
Bradshaw and Dylan Styles are fairly
straightforward Android wear devices
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi enabled though
lacking speakers or a heartrate monitor
of course they do come with a small
collection of custom watch faces as
wearable technology becomes more
ubiquitous it's exciting to see more
traditional clothing and accessory
brands jumping onto this bandwagon while
tech companies like Apple Samsung
Motorola a Suzanne Huawei are quickly
learning how to address form not
everyone who might be interested in a
SmartWatch will be satisfied by what
those companies have to offer more
competition in this face even just for
the look of a SmartWatch will always be
a good thing and I was just rocking my
pebble at this booth tour so I I felt a
little underdressed
expect to see Bradshaw and Dylan and
retailers between 350 and 400 euro
depending on style and watch band later
this month instead of paying terrible
roaming fees when traveling abroad or
the hassle of buying another SIM card
