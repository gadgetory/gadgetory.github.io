selling point is there on paper even if
it won't make a real difference in your
daily routine
it's definitely expensive and shiny I'm
Anthony Knight with pocket now and this
could very well be just an expensive
bragging right let's take a quick look
at the Sony Xperia z5 premium and try to
find out if it is our first impression
start with the unboxing experience and
they're not that bright
sure sony decided to change the box and
presentation of the z5 premium but the
experience is not premium at all no
we're not talking about the carton box
or materials used we're talking about a
premium device that even has the word
premium in its official name which comes
with no headphones but sure some regions
might get them inside the box but this
one right here in Europe did not we've
seen mid Rangers ship with JBL
headphones or premium devices come with
AKG tuned premium earbuds right in the
box
this premium device does only ship with
a screen protector a charging cable the
charger itself and some literature not
only that but Sony calls out high res
audio on the box and specifications high
res audio you'll have to enjoy with a
separate set of headphones you do or do
not own the device itself feels good
we'll give you that much and the silver
chrome unit is shiny it looks good and
it can probably set a new world record
for collecting fingerprints and smudges
the Omni balance philosophy is still
alive whether you love it or hate it and
the Xperia z5 premium feels just as good
as any other past Xperia Z smartphone
yes you're entitled to say you're
somewhat tired of the same old design
but it feels so solid and good in the
hand that you might just want to learn
to live with it and its rough edges the
world's first 4k smartphone has every
chance of going unnoticed yes the 5.5
inch screen otherwise beautiful has a
potential 2160 by 3840 pixel resolution
and the EPI rating of 8
than six but that's something you'll
barely notice about 90% of the time or
even more you'll be limited to full HD
1080p as a matter of fact aside from
sony's own movie and album applications
everything else will run in full HD
including apps and home screens sony
says it was a user oriented decision to
conserve battery life combined with the
fact that most third-party applications
don't even support 4k resolution Android
itself doesn't support 4k resolution for
screenshots so those will result in
1080p files as well at least while
running lollipop the version of Android
that powers the z5 premium and even if
you shoot in 4k and play a vacuum 4k
which you can with or without the
upscaling would you be able to tell the
difference between 4k and 1080p on a 5.5
inch display we're inclined to believe
that this feature is just the bragging
right an expensive one but we'll have to
wait for our full review to draw the
conclusion the fingerprint scanner is
something new to the Xperia lineup and
its placement on the side mounted power
button is something you'll have to get
used to you'll have to register at least
three fingers right thumb
left index and left middle finger if you
want to be able to easily unlock your
device with your fingerprint when you
find the button it's working well it's
not awkward you'll just have to get used
to it the front-facing stereo speakers
could be a tad louder as usual and we
can't wait to see the camera improvement
Sony developed for the z5 premium the
software is android 5.1.1 lollipop with
sony's own skin on top of it pretty much
like on previous iterations processor
RAM and storage aren't an upgrade at all
over the c3 plus and we're yet to see
how the almost 3500 million power
battery will perform however we're happy
to report we've experienced no heat
issues or app crashes so far but we're
far from drawing the conclusion just yet
as if now we'll just say this the sony
xperia z5 premium is one hell of a
pricey z3 plus with a side mounted
fingerprint scanner and the 4k display
you will be happy
to tell your friends about but neither
you nor they will be able to tell the
difference
everyone will have a lot more on the z5
premium in the coming days and weeks

answered about the z5 premium and of
