nexus 4 Google's second-generation Nexus
7 gets leaked on photos and video and
the HTC one mini gets announced even
though there is some compromise I'm hi
Mary vera and if my Darth Vader tone
pops up at any time that's because I
have a massive cold but this is pocket
now is a lei especially i'll put some
odd and interesting announcements as LG
has just sent out press notifications
confirming that their flagship
smartphones are now going to be called
just G's and their flagship tablets
which they don't have any are going to
be called abused and so that means that
they're dropping the Optimus moniker and
from now on they even confirm that their
future flagship smartphone will be the
g2 imagine that the LG g2 LG g2 that's
gonna be the name of their next
smartphone and whatever the name of
their features have it could be but
anyway stay tuned as their event is
scheduled soon and we'll probably see
the phone by them and speaking of LG
we've got some leaked photographs of the
google nexus 4 running on android 4.3 or
near final build but uh that was pretty
much it there's just the photo that
shows that the versions out there ready
to be announced pretty much next week in
the google event but we still don't have
any specifics as to what the
enhancements are for this future version
of android so stay tuned to our live
coverage and speaking of google's have
been next week the successor to the
nexus 7 was shown off on video and some
leaked photographs and even though the
video is sadly not available anymore for
us to show to you it looks a lot like
the current generation Nexus 7 only that
the back is now flat instead of rubbery
or it probably could be rubbery but it
doesn't have any texture like the
current generation Nexus 7 it's still to
be expected as to what we will be
getting on this tablet but most likely
again it looks like a finished product
so expected next week Apple is up next
as I really wasn't a believer of their
fingerprint scanning leaks recently but
the company has just filed a patent
that's making me a believer they're
actually not planning on adding this to
the home button to a specific button on
the device they're actually working on
making the full display of fingerprint
scanner and the question is of Apple is
planning on new security features that
would allow you and
only you to control your iPhone stay
tuned on that one let's see how that
goes and finally for the news of the day
HTC has just announced their HTC One
mini which we've been expecting as the
smaller version of the HTC One meeting a
smaller phone with every single speck on
the list and sadly that's not the case
you know their sales representative was
very nice and saying that this is a non
compromised experience but then again
you get the same phone without optical
image stabilization so it begs to wonder
how that camera is going to perform at 4
megapixels and then we also get no NFC
we get ass much smaller everything no
expandable storage and only 16 gigs of
storage no ir blaster this is pretty
much a crop down pretty phone it's a
very beautiful device but it's sadly not
an HTC one at all but anyways that leads
you to the question of the day if you
had to pick between the HTC One mini and
HTC One which one would you get in my
case honestly I'd stick to the HTC One
for the price difference it's not really
worth it but leave us a comment down
below what do you think of course it's
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet or mushy follow us
on PocketNow comment subscribe to our
youtube channel as well you can also
follow me on twitter and hind underscore

watching we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
