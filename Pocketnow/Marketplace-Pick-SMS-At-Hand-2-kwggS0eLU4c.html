pakka calm and today we'll show you a
cool update to SMS at hand and this is a
program that will allow you to actually
organize all of your call history and
text messages on one simple screen so as
you can see here on my all my calls in
my history for over the past month
unfortunately i just updated this roms
on the 11 so i don't have too many text
messages or anything in here so let's
say I wanted to look at one of my
friends text messages and I wasn't sure
exactly where something was so if I
wanted to look at Kate's right here if
want to look all of her text messages i
can open this and open up the program
and it's actually pretty neat because it
gives you a chronological order of
everything that you've been talking
about even when even call history and
stuff so we can just go up to the top
for him to see like the very first
message that we sent over this month can
you meet me at my work tomorrow tonight
so we had dinner that night so if we
want to look at the calendar I can also
just go here and I can pick a specific
day so so if I wanted to look at the 9th
of november i can just click on here and
it will show me all the messages on the
night to november so as you can see it's
highlighted with the black and it
continues chronologically down the page
I can also change it so that I can only
view stuff that i have sent or these
stuff that she has sent and also cut out
all the call history so it'll just be my
text messages another cool feature about
this program is it allows you to
actually save your messages so I've
wanted to archive something and go tools
and export and I can just hit export it
will actually archive all that into my
storage card or wherever I designate it
to to save so i can export and right
here it's saving to my documents and
then Katie Rubin 09 11 25 so it's okay
it also allows me to reply so if i
wanted to reply to this message that I
got last night I can click reply and it
will actually send a text message
directly through a program something's
going to cancel this right now let's say
that I had a very long list of messages
and I needed to search for something so
if I want to go down here I can just go
to tools and search and let's say I
wanted to search
for account I don't need to type in the
whole word of course and those its
search and as you can see i have a text
message here that has the account or in
it so i'll just cancel that we can also
get message info we can show it in
outlook we can forward of course i can
also delete this message if I wanted to
so you can close out of that and as you
can see I have a lot of other messages
in here from other people you can also
scroll down from the side to select
which exact name you want to pick so
let's say I want to look at Katie's
stuff again I can do that can also go to
time so from the last person that sent
me a message I can also go to most
messages to the least number of messages
so whoever I talked to the most and
click on here and we'll just go back to
ABC because it's a little bit simpler to
go through your contact list if I go
down to menu I can select different
options so in options page we can start
at boot which will actually launch the
program when we start up the device we
can have home screen verification which
will show us a notification on our home
screen we can also auto rotate
unfortunately that only works on HTC
devices and seeing that this is the
omnia to it doesn't work on that device
but if you do have an HTC device you're
in luck so there we go contacts we can
show contact history messages show
recent notification we can also change
the way that scripts are written so we
can use unicode if we want and warned
when deleting messages editor we can
also change the size of our texts
autocorrect capital letters scroll show
scrollbar an SI p auto show can also
change conversations so if i want to
change this size of the text i can do
that here i can also get graphic
emoticons it's just pretty cool because
a lot of windows mobile devices don't
actually have graphic emoticons i can
warn the thor navigating to urls show
system scrollbar show new SMS icon show
calendar icon show filter icon show talk
icon course we can all go through these
can also change the colors on this
particular program and i have them set
to what kind of colors I like Silver's
come okay so this is SMS at hand
and the program does cost around
fourteen dollars and ninety-nine cents
for the full version and this is another
marketplace pick where we pick some of
the best and most useful programs on
windows mobile marketplace thanks for
