pocketnow.com and this is the software
tour of the mobi Nova ice there's a lot
to talk about in this video so let's get
started the first thing that I want to
point out is all of the functions of
this OLED screen you can't really see it
until it actually turns on its 96 x 96
pixels and when it does turn on you'll
probably see that it's flickering but
it's actually not flickering right now
just that the refresh rate is slower
than the camera that is taking this
video so the first function is kind of
to act as a system notifier so if i
press this button on the side a camera
button which is kind of weird that they
made it the camera button we will get
this and basically it tells us the time
battery life whether we have a cell
phone signal and right now the sim card
is out so there's no signal and i also
tell you that you have a new message
down below here and that's really all
you can do with it you can't tap on it
to bring up an email or anything like
that the purpose of the screen in this
case is just to give you some system
notifications now the other two case
this is that one it will act as a d-pad
when you turn on the phone and you get a
little bit of haptic feedback when you
press on a button and it's actually very
weird and kind of cumbersome to use the
d-pad because it's completely flat so
you have to look at it each time and
another problem is that the the soft
keys and the d-pad are so far away from
each other that you're moving your thumb
around a lot and I really try to avoid
using the d-pad if possible in the third
way that this OLED screen is used is for
new message notification so if you get a
new email you'll get a picture of an
envelope that fills up the entire screen
and kind of like a brownish color
although oddly this shows up mostly when
you turn off the device and you have a
new email which is strange because if
you have a new email you'd want to see
the notification right when you turn on
your device not when you're turning it
off oh well so let's take a look at the
rest of the device here so the screen is
400 down and 240 across but not really
you get this unchangeable row of icons
that you cannot alter or adjust this is
kind of reminiscent of early palm
devices or even the apple newton that
gives you kind of a launcher
various applications and system settings
so basically what you're stuck with is
AQ vga screen which is a very last
generation resolution making things on
the screen appear very grainy and
pixelated it's unfortunate that this
device doesn't take advantage of this
space down here that said let's talk
about how mobile Nova has used the space
down here so if I tap on the first one
says telephone it will go into the mobi
Nova interface and what we can do here
is if we tap on phone it takes us right
to our our phone and this is the skin
for the phone the screen is small and
it's hard to type the the buttons on the
screen it's best used with a stylus not
very touch friendly we can go to mobi
friends which is actually pretty cool it
gives you a circle of people that you
call often so if I tap on this person it
will bring up different ways to contact
this person so I can send them a text
message and email do a voice call remove
it's a really great way I think to to
access different ways of communicating
with someone if we go to contacts will
obviously go to contacts standard
windows mobile thing call history and
voice died now if we go to the right we
are taken to the next icon and let me go
back out and show you that we just go
right over to applications so that does
the same thing and from here this is
just a program launcher really so we can
go into email or SMS or anything like
that and we can go back again or I could
have swiped my finger to the side and if
we go into multimedia we've access to
things like the camera FM radio and the
cameras having trouble focusing because
it's a weird kind of a contrast there if
we go into settings we can change some
settings if we go into sound we stay
within the mobi Nova interface here and
we can adjust the system volume or turn
on ring or vibrate we swipe our finger
to the right we will go to connectivity
and here you can turn on phone or Wi-Fi
this is kind of like a sequinned
Communication Manager really go to the
right again and here is the display
settings from here we can adjust the
backlight or we can leave it on auto I'm
going to put it on manual there and if
we go one more to the right we get some
system settings we can turn on and off
mobi feel which is the haptic feedback
may be a good idea to turn this off
because it'll help with battery life and
as we'll see in the final review the
movie Nova ice doesn't have the best
battery life unfortunately and that
that's really the end so let's go back
back again and then we'll go over to
this last one that says today which
brings us to the mobi Nova today's
screen or it's actually a kind of a
program and this is what it looks like
so what we can do is we can tap on this
big clock and we can get multiple time
zones so we can set different cities and
we can add a city if we press that
button so I'm going to go go back there
oops if we tap on the calendar here we
will obviously launch into the calendar
if we tap on whoops got out of that if
we tap on the email icon we will
obviously go into email and if you've
missed cause it will show up here as
well but I like to stay in the standard
windows mobile today screen which mobi
Nova has at customized just a little bit
you get this row of contacts and if you
tap on one of the people it will take
you into that screen that I showed you
earlier where you can quickly dial
certain functions of certain people so
it's nice that Moby Nova tried to kind
of customize the windows mobile
interface but I don't think this was the
best way to do it I think this is kind
of a crude interface that doesn't look
too visually pleasing and I really hate
the fact that you can't remove this you
can't disable these buttons and there's
been so many times that I've tried to
touch a soft key button here and I've
accidentally pressed one of these
buttons below that's a that's another
big problem with this device so that
said let's drill into the programs i
want to take out the stylus to do this
and here we go so we have standard
programs here if we go into the control
center that is actually going to be that
that's that program that we went through
earlier where it shows you the settings
on the device that you can do through
that interface we also have FM radio and
you can't really do much with that
unless you've got a pair of headphones
connected and you saw the the d-pad
flicker on their mobile friendly with
the kind of rotary way of communicating
with people going down the list standard
stuff world time we were in there before
world weather let's tap on that and see
what that looks like and you can list
the the weather for a city although of
course I don't have a data connection
right now because my sim card is not in
and you can flick back and forth to
multiple cities so nice little
integration there you also get Microsoft
Office suite and let me show you the
on-screen keyboards while we're in there
so I'm going to go to word mobile now
unfortunately you only get one on-screen
keyboard option beyond the standard
windows mobile keyboards you know HTC
devices have three they've won the t9
style one is the suretype style like as
you see here and what is the full qwerty
that said I actually really like the
shirt up keyboard because the way the
device is designed when you type you're
actually resting your fingers right in
the center of the device whereas with
some other similar devices you're typing
down here which is kind of awkward so
it's kind of easy to to type so the day
is Thursday and I really not had any
problems with typing with this keyboard
that said if I want to type in a web
address in the web browser for example
it's really impossible to use this
because it's trying to use t9 so I have
to always refer back to the you know the
stylist tap tap keyboard here because
there are no other keyboard options
available that are big enough for me to
use with my thumbs so wish there were
more on-screen keyboards included on the
mobi Nova ice now this device does have
an accelerometer that said it only works
in certain screens and I've only found
two so far that it works in so if I flip
it now it will not rotate but if I go
into pocket Internet Explorer and by the
way there's no better browser included
that said you can always download opera
mobile 9.5 or sky fire or something like
that it will work in this screen there
it goes and the icons kind of reorient
themselves but the text does not which
is kind of weird so you have to turn it
this way to read the text it would be
nice if the accelerometer worked in all
screens and finally let's drill into
settings and see what we have there
anything interesting so if we go into
the day option we can turn off the mobi
plugin
is that one you saw with all of the
pictures of frequently called people
there is no way to turn off these
buttons and I've been in the program and
I've talked to the company there's just
no way to do it unfortunately I think
that's a big problem for those that
don't want these icons on the bottom to
take up extra screen space so here we
are in system and we can go down take a
look at memory I have a bunch of
programs open it has 81 megabytes of
program memory available which is ok not
so great finally if we go into
connections we can go to the wireless
manager to see what that looks like and
we saw this earlier this device does
have the bands necessary to do hsdpa in
the United States I'm using AT&amp;amp;T and I
get hsdpa signal over this device so
that is good and that's pretty much it
for the settings so overall I think the
movie Nova ice has a lot of usability
issues starting with the oled screen
it's completely flat it's difficult to
use you can't feel for it its
functionality is quite limited you can
only use it as a d-pad system notifier
and it will show you when you have a new
email things like that and I think it's
taking a toll on battery life
unnecessarily I mean you're powering two
screens here when you could just have a
standard d-pad have it be easier to use
and not take up that extra battery life
in addition this application launcher
while it's useful sometimes and I
applaud movie Nova's effort to kind of
bring this new interface you can't
remove it and it really gets in the way
when you're trying to operate the phone
and trying to use a soft key you're
accidentally pressing these all the time
which really is is quite annoying and
finally the screen is low resolution
basically what you have at the end of
the day is a qvga screen and all new
windows mobile devices that are coming
out at least the ones that i can think
of immediately have a high resolution
screen above this making for a clearer
image so i think those three things
really take a toll on the usability of
the mobi nova ice which is a shame
because it has otherwise nice hardware
the performance is good and it has a lot
to offer in terms of the wireless radios
that it includes in the FM radio and
everything like that but we'll have the
full take on this coming up in the full
review or we'll talk about battery life
pros and cons and everything like that
so keep it to pocketnow.com for the full
review of the mobi Nova ice that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
