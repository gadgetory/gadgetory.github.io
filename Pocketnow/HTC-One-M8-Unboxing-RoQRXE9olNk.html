whatever you call it
this is HTC's new flagship for 2014 and
quite possibly the most compelling
Android phone of the year depending on
your perspective our full review of this
device is already live here on YouTube
and at pocketnow.com but for those of
you curious about what comes inside the
packaging alongside the m8 this video is
for you I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is the all new HTC
one let's see what's inside the box a
small confession before we get started
generally I don't like fake unboxings
but due to timing considerations we did
need to remove our review unit from its
box before this video was shot that said
everything in terms of accessories is
still new to me so there may still be
some surprises to be found inside the
box so folks here is the retail
packaging and if it looks familiar well
it should here is the Google Play
edition HTC One box from last year and
here is the all-new HTC One still with
the rounded corners still with the the
very interesting contours still with the
collapse on the bottom Zoe boom sound
motion launched blinkfeed and duo camera
there is no question what HTC wants us
to focus on as consumers when we buy
this device so as I mentioned in the
intro we've seen I've seen the device
already but this may be your first time
seeing it and if we're playing the part
of the consumer it will be so boom there
it is it is not dead center it's offset
interesting HTC doing something a little
bit different and it comes in its own
little pouch here the very first thing
you notice when you take it out of the
box is that it initially feels quite
heavy quite substantial then you pick it
up you turn it around a couple times
you're like wait no it's not it's
actually maybe the perfect weight of
course that depends on who you are
depends on if you're if you're me or
someone else and we'll do a little size
comparison we'll put this aside though
let's get to the part that's a surprise
for me because I have not actually
opened this panel yet so let's stick a
finger in here pop this panel loose and
put it aside and see what comes with the
device so this is a UK
of the of the phone so your mileage may
vary in terms of what comes in the box
of course carriers always metal and
sometimes AD often subtract features so
none of this is guaranteed this would
appear to be a a gelatinous protective
case for the backside of the device
probably a really good idea if you're
gonna be using it in the real world as
that metal will scratch up something
fierce but well not you know certainly
not the most attractive thing everybody
really awesome for HTC to include that
that's very very cool this is a UK power
adapter which is useless to us here in
the States 1.5 amp output
I believe there's the power cable and
the familiar HTC earbuds check these out
let's get a little zoom action on here
there's the extra gels there's some
trash these look to be almost exactly
like the the earbuds that were that came
with the last year's one you know
nothing special but really really
awesome of HTC to include them once
again that's pretty cool sim removal
tool some barcodes and stuffs and for
service needs and so on if you want to
take advantage of HTC advantage they'll
probably ask for those a getting started
guide some warranty stuff some removal
tool and instructions on how to put your
sim in there put these all aside get to
the device itself now I'm gonna warn you
since I already have been inside this
pouch I know there's no screen protector
it's not because I removed the screen
protector it's because there there just
isn't one this pouch sort of does it all
and before we take it off we'll see what
HTC wants to emphasize here once again
boom sound blinkfeed motion launched the
gesture driven controls zoe and the duo
camera back out to a wide shot so we can
take this pouch off of here this very
very nice means of protecting the device
in its in its shipping container and of
course I just tore the thing so okay
it's alright tear that off and reveal
the metallic surface of our gunmetal
gray device this one also of course
comes an amber gold and glacial steal
but there's a light glinting off it
there the two different light tones in
our in our booth here wow that that's
Gor
zero gap construction is maintained here
there's very little that you can almost
can't feel the the division there
between the public carbonate inlays and
the aluminum casing the aluminum casing
now 90 percent aluminum instead of the
70 percent of the previous year's HTC
One
there's our either the SIM tray or the
micro SD card tray but the other its
counterpart is over here we have another
feature calling this out as the new HTC
One the special depth sensor up top
augmenting the capabilities of the
primary camera which remains at 4
megapixels much more on that in the full
review which once again is available at
pocketnow.com and here on youtube as we
do we try not to drop the device as we
boot it we'll put it right on down here
fastboot is enabled so this won't take
very long at all just in case you want
to see how it compares to the samsung
galaxy s4 the current flagship soon to
be eclipsed by the s5 but just for a
size reference there you are
considerably taller than the Samsung
device thanks to that 5 inch screen and
the boom sound speakers and now here is
the older 2013 edition of the HTC One
also known as the m7 here they are all
are in a line the brand new HTC m8 once
again our review live right now
several comparisons several features a
lot of content live here on YouTube and
