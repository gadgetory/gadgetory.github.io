a curved OLED display to happen sometime
soon we get more details on the future
Moto G now in photos we also hear about
the Microsoft mobled sales division
making some interesting changes I'm hi
Mary Vanna and if Monday's don't get you
going in a weird way I don't know what
does this is parking out daily
official news today begin with deals
those of you on a budget one of our
favorite phones of a couple of years ago
was the Moto X the second-generation
model mainly because well it was a
petite design that included a lot of
really good stuff right now it's
currently a hundred and fifty dollars
total after a coupon you can get more
information on the link of the
description and speaking of Motorola
those of you that are interested in the
next generation Moto G because yea it is
definitely one of the best premium mid
Rangers out there the next generation
one is apparently coming soon oven blast
just leaked the first renders of the
phone and it looks far elegant that any
previous version of the Moto G that
we've ever seen we also hear this
snapdragon 617 processor in addition to
a 5.5 inch the splint so we will keep
you posted as we learn more now some
very interesting developments come from
microsoft apparently the company might
be considering merging it's a mobile
sales division but this device is the
vision because well the mobile sales
division hasn't really been working that
well lately lumias are not selling I
don't think it has anything to do with
the department I think it has everything
to do with the product but yeah it seems
that Microsoft considers that internally
things could improve what will happen
for Lumias hopefully that means
something positive not negative in the
future you know one of the biggest
problem with these fitness trackers is
their price tag unless you're going for
a misfit getting a Fitbit as a hundred
bucks and that is just completely
overpriced for what you're getting
Samson apparently wants to do something
with their charm which recently launched
in certain markets apparently it's
coming to the United States over the
next few weeks and the advantage here is
that number one it looks good number two
it's only going to retail for $45 which
is a definitely a much better price tag
than everything else out there we will
keep you posted as soon as it launches
and finally the very interesting news
that they have to do with oled displays
and iPhones we've heard that these all
that displays are happening until 2018
they're not happening not even with the
2600 2017 iphone but according to the
sources because Apple likes to do
planning early it seems that this next
generation oullette I
will be curved it'll bring a curve
display because apparently Apple wants
to take advantage of something currently
we do notice a little bit of that to a
certain degree with the iphone success
not a curved display but definitely a
curve design all around that matches a
flat display obviously Apple wants to
give you that pebble feel but it leads
me to the question of today how
important is a curve display whenever
you're barring a new phone is it
something that you would consider a deal
breaker in my case I still feel that
they're overrated mainly because it is
very cumbersome to user in phones I
don't think that that benefits the user
experience in any way but leave us a
comment down below we would love to know
what you think friends you know the way
it goes if you want to get these news
