that far has just begun Black Friday is
just a couple of weeks away and I know a
lot of you are wondering which phone
should you get during the holiday season
a lot of us are asking ourselves the
same question so I'm high Meadow iveta
this is pocket now and these are the top
5 smartphones that we recommend you
purchase for this holiday season number
five is the Nokia Lumia 1020 and the
only reason why this phone is not really
number one on this list is actually two
reasons number one it's kind of a bulky
phone for most people and number two the
fact that it runs windows phone which is
still there to mature you still don't
have a lot of the applications that a
lot of people are looking for but this
is pretty much the camera phone to beat
by most point and shoot cameras not
smartphones this phone is on a class of
its own it takes amazing photography the
best that we've ever tested and it's
definitely a device that we would highly
recommend if you're looking for a camera
that's also a phone and if you're
looking for a good Windows Phone
experience number four is the Moto X and
the only reason why this phone is not at
the top of the list is because of its
crappy camera but aside from that every
single reviewer on the planet loves this
phone and that really can't explain why
they really can't explain if its effect
you can customize the phone or the fact
that you can just call it ok Google now
and it will wake up or the fact that the
phone is actually not so big but it's
got a big display for a small chassis
there are a ton of great things about
the Moto X aside from the camera that a
lot of people are recommending and it's
really a phone that we would love for
you to give a try number three is the LG
g2 and the only reason why this phone is
not at the top of the list is because of
the LG u y which is terrible but you can
install nova launcher on it and make it
great this is the Android camera to beam
pretty much the only smartphone running
Android that has optical image
stabilization on the camera and aside
from that great speed from that
Snapdragon 800 aside from great amazing
battery life a great display as well we
still can't figure out how LG was able
to manage to fit that 5.2 inch display
which is like the Galaxy Note one on the
size of a galaxy s4 it's just amazing
how they were able to fit this phone
together so again we would love for you
to give this phone to try as well number
two is the lg-made Google Nexus 5 and
the own
reason why this phone is not at the top
of the list is because it's battery life
could be better and because it's camera
could also be better even though
apparently a software update will fix
these things and still this is the best
Android experience you can buy android
4.4 kitkat out of the box and you get
frickin updates as soon as they're out
and aside from that this is actually a
great phone it's pretty much an LG g2
only on a smaller thinner chassis for
three hundred and fifty dollars unlocked
I don't think there's even a better
phone option for those of you that are
just interested on a great smartphone I
mean for that price tag it really makes
buying any other phone pointless if it
were just perfect for those little
quirks that we just talked about and
finally the top number one smartphone
for the fall of 2013 is a tie between
the Galaxy Note 3 and the iphone 5s
which are just opposing phones in every
single way but phones that you should
definitely consider pretty much the
galaxy note 3 is one of the best
multitasking experiences we've ever had
its the best phablet you can buy it's
got great multitasking experiences if
you get the Snapdragon 800 phone she'd
get great performance it's got a great
camera and it's really just the non
compromised phone all in all if you
don't mind putting up with its size and
then on the other hand we have the
iphone 5s which is pretty much an iphone
5 but then the touch ID enhancements are
great it's got a great low-light camera
even though you don't have optical image
stabilization on it and it performs
great with that 64-bit chip even though
some people are still claiming it to be
a gimmick both these phones are great
but again one of them is the biggest one
and the other one is the smallest one
and yet these are the two most popular
phones at the end of the year that you
could consider that you can buy so
either one of these phones will serve
you well but still out of all these
phones that we've just mentioned that
leaves us to the question of this top 5
which would be your top phone for the
fall of 2013 would it be either the
phones that we just mentioned or do you
think that we are leaving a phone now
leave us a comment down below that's it
for a top five thank you very much for
watching remember the phones that were
mentioned on this video are specifically
the devices that were launched after
spring because we have another video for
the spring line up so anyways make sure
you follow us on social media subscribe
to our YouTube channel you can also
follow me on Twitter I'm underscore

meta thank you very much for watch
we'll see you on the next top five</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
