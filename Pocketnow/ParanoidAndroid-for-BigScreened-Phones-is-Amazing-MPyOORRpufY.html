pocket now calm I've recently come
across one of the coolest third-party
android roms called paranoid android
it's fast it's available for a ton of
devices and it's got a crazy cool
feature that has literally changed the
way that i'm using my android phone and
in this video i'm going to show you
paranoid android running on the HTC One
X let's get to it so let me summarize
quickly what paranoid android does and
I'll show it to you paranoid android
allows you to run your phone in tablet
mode but not only in tablet mode but you
can choose selectively between apps
which apps are tablet mode which apps
are phone mode and if you have an
Android tablet like the Nexus 7 you know
that since android 4.0 ice cream
sandwich android apps are designed to
work in two environments phone and
tablet so what you might get on the
tablet is different than the phone and
the tablet you'll get split views for
example you'll get your email inbox on
the left and your messages on the right
whereas on the phone everything is
arranged in one column so you can just
really tap the power of high-resolution
screens if you've got a big screen like
on the Galaxy Note the Galaxy Nexus the
galaxy s3 the HTC One X anything with a
screen 4.5 inches and above paranoid
android makes your screen sing let's
take a closer look alright so let's take
a look at paranoid android on the One X
and this is actually based off of
cyanogenmod in this particular case
cyanogenmod 10 so yeah I'm running
jellybean here and it is super fast plus
I get all these awesome features of
paranoid android where I can run my
phone in phone mode in tablet mode or
phablet mode PHA blet that term favet of
course so right now I've got it running
in purely tablet mode so you'll notice
immediately I have no notification try
here at the top it's on the bottom like
you'll find on most Android tablets the
reason that that's awesome on a phone
like this where the screen is tall is
because typically on a 1x or a galaxy
note or Galaxy Nexus reaching up to the
top for the notification shade is a huge
reach but now it is along the bottom all
I've got to do is flick up
there's the notification shade and there
is you know just like the notification
tray at the top you can swipe
notifications off the screen and I've
also got a lot of quick toggles here
just like a tablet so within easy reach
I've got this beautiful toggle menu
thing in the bottom right corner of the
screen now let me show you where all the
magic happens I'm going to go into the
settings here and what you'll
immediately notice is again I'm a tablet
mode so i get two different frames one
on the right and one of the on the left
instead of a single frame window like
you get on android phone so that makes a
lot more easy to jump around you change
the item on the left and it shows up on
the right so let's go to the Paranoid
Android settings this is really the
heart of the ROM and this is where
everything comes together if I go to
configuration I can choose whether i
want to just run in standard phone mode
or stock UI run in phablet UI which is
the same that you'll get on the Nexus 7
where you get the on-screen buttons on
the bottom as well as the notification
shade on the top I don't think that's
the best use of space on a phone then
we've got tablet UI small medium and big
right now I'm running small that's why
it looks so tiny down here but I loved
it on maximizing screen space browsing
the web I get all of this screen space
it this is actually a lot thinner than
the notification that comes stock on an
android phone and you can change all of
these you can actually add back the
on-screen buttons here that would occur
in the bottom left corner of the screen
which is quite cool now what's super
cool is that you can configure whether
it's a tented running a tablet mode or
phone mode by the app if we go in here
it's going to load the app list and let
me show you what I mean I'm going to go
into the YouTube app and you're going to
notice immediately that this is actually
this is actually the tablet app from you
know from android tablet so we get this
beautiful 3d scrolling thing it's super
smooth because we're running with
project butter here on jelly bean and
this is different than the phone UI but
let's say we want to get the phone UI
just for this YouTube app well go back
into settings we'll go to the bottom
where it says YouTube and there are
several settings you can choose from so
I'm going to go to 2.6 pixels I don't
really know what a lot of this means
but let's go back to the YouTube app and
see if it's changed okay crash that's
actually kind of common but if we
relaunch there we go now we're in the
phone UI pretty cool right and we can do
that for every single app we can do it
for calendar we can do it for the web
the web actually looks super cool
because what happens is when you go into
tablet mode tabs appear at the top kind
of like Google Chrome so if we go into
it like this check it out tabs are are
at the top and if we go into the
settings let's say we don't want the
tabs at the top just for this app we go
to browser here's a browser and we go
over here we change the layout to the
sort of smaller screen layout will go
into the browser it might crash or maybe
not who knows it didn't crash and now
the web address bar is at the top
furthermore there are DPI settings so
let's say you kind of like no tabs at
the top but you want to make this bigger
watch what I can do go into settings
this is just tons of fun for an Android
power user I'm going to jack up the DPI
save it go back into the browser and
boom we've got a taller address bar so
you can just spend all day long
customizing every app to have the
optimum feel the reason that this is
awesome is because an Android some apps
are highly functional on a tablet and in
some cases they're just more usable on a
phone so you can mix and match to your
heart's content you can change PPI
settings to get more icons on the screen
less icons on the screen and again sits
at cyanogenmod based you get all of the
post cyanogenmod features so if we go
over back in the settings here are all
the launcher settings for trebuchet we
get some really cool system settings for
example you can actually customize on
this particular device the action of
these keys so right now I've got this
set as the multitask you I a tap and
hold will bring up the system menu and
you can actually customize the other
buttons to do whatever you want which is
super cold and check this out I can
actually turn on on-screen software
buttons and it's going to relaunch and
see look at this on the bottom of the
screen although it's tiny it's pretty
darn cool you can add back these buttons
you can actually run a piece of software
that will disable this capacity
buttons so you're just using the
on-screen buttons as if there was an
actual android tablet so really cool
stuff here if you if you've got a phone
with a large screen i highly recommend
you check out paranoid android i think
it's a power lover's dream to be able to
go into every app and change how it
looks on your phone so you can take
advantage of that huge 12 1280 by 720
resolution I've been having a lot of fun
with it so I know if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up we'll put
some links in the description to get
paranoid android jelly bean style for
some of those bigger screen phones out
there in case you want to try on your
phone thanks for watching and that's it
for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
