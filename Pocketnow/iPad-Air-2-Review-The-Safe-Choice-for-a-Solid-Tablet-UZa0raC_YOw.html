it's hard to review any new tablet these
days with notebook computer slimming
down and smartphones puffing up it's
tougher and tougher to justify the use
case for the so called third screen a
category Apple itself popularized four
years ago with the original iPad but
while tablet sales may be flagging
there's still a market for them and
there are still tablets worth getting
excited about in a lot of ways this is
one of them I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is our video review
of the iPad air 2
the iPad air 2 is beautiful because of
course hit it no matter what your
thoughts on Apple itself it's tough to
deny that the company makes gorgeous
hardware at 6.1 millimeters in depth
it's one of the thinnest tablets you can
find and it's aluminum frame with
elegant chamfered edges gives it a
rigidity and a sense of style that few
competitors can match despite the cool
metal touch it's also lightweight which
makes it easy to hold one-handed even if
you have to do it for a while Apple made
a big deal about the display and touch
ID on this model and much of that is
justified the 9.7 inch laminated screen
on the new ipad is bonded directly to
the touch sensor and anti glare cover
glass giving the sense that the graphics
are floating right on top of the display
the IPS panel doesn't have the pixel
density of some of its competition and
it doesn't have the bottomless blacks of
AMOLED screens but it's still excellent
the bezels flanking it have been slimmed
down but they're still wide enough for
you to anchor a thumb comfortably
without touching the screen by accident
on the bottom most of those bezels sits
apple's touch ID fingerprint scanner
right in the middle of the home button
it works well for unlocking the screen
and with third-party apps which support
touch ID and for those who've gotten
used to scanning their thumb on the
iPhone it's sure to be a welcome
addition here just make sure you scan
more than one thumb because it's pretty
awkward in table situations in those
cases we're glad pin entry is still an
option the only real complaint we have
about the hardware is the omission of
the side switch which controlled either
system volume or screen rotation on
iPhones and earlier iPad yes it's true
that this setting is only a swipe away
in iOS 8 but it was much simpler when it
was just a handy mechanical toggle
speaking of iOS 8 it's much the same
here as it is on the iPhone 6 and 6 plus
and we also have a full iOS 8 review at
pocket now so here we'll just talk about
the broad ups and down to get this out
of the way upfront
yes you're still confined to Apple's 4
by 5 grid of icons for a homescreen and
yes it feels very limiting if you're
used to a Windows or Android tablet
fortunately you don't need to spend much
time there because there's stuff hidden
behind almost every
edge swipe down from the top for the
cleaned up Notification Center which
gives you reminders appointments and
third-party widgets in addition to
alerts swipe up from the bottom for a
control panel with sliders for
brightness and volume toggles for other
system settings and shortcuts to the
camera and the timer for some reason
sadly one of our favorite features from
the iPhone 6 reach ability isn't here
which is a shame because it would be
useful even on this big screen and even
though you never use this thing
one-handed making up for that spotlight
search has made the cut you can swipe
down anywhere on the springboard and
start typing to search almost everything
on the device for that search term it
can also be used for a quick web
searches or to jump directly into a
given app if you can't find it in all
your folders and once you've gotten used
to having it it's really hard to go
without it on a non iOS tablet other
stock applications like calendar
contacts and photos use the big canvas
of the display beautifully in iOS 8 and
of course it's all backed up by a
third-party ecosystem that's second to
none you're more likely to use the iPads
cameras for things like FaceTime video
calling and document scanning but
occasionally you'll probably feel
compelled to take a few photos with the
iPad air 2 and when you do you'll find a
straightforward and easy to use
viewfinder with everything from slow
mode time lapse to HDR and the results
will look like this some great some not
so great and on the average ultimately
ok but no matter how good the photos
turn out or how much mainstream
acceptance this trend finds remember
that just still look like this remember
that here's some video from the iSight
camera and we'll turn down the music
to let you judge its quality for
yourself
once you're through taking photos and
video you get to experience the
performance of Apple's new a8x processor
with 2 gigs of ram juggling apps back
and forth is as easy as a double-click
on the home button and responsiveness is
as fluid as it gets
gestures that used to seem silly are
actually nice to have back after
spending some time away from iOS the big
screen is a huge pool for gaming of
course an apple's revised hardware makes
short work of both elementary titles
like implode and more demanding apps
like f-18 carrier landing on the radio
side Wi-Fi reception seemed right on par
with the Nexus 9 we didn't have a
cellular unit to test so we'll leave
that for another time the bottom firing
speakerphone is very loud here in New
England it's getting a little chilly as
we move into the winter time but even
the constant drone of our space heater
isn't able to drown out the iPad air 2
for your information we turned it off
for this test
get them star-lord supplement we've
arrived at the last-known coordinates of
the Ticonderoga I'm picking up debris
old friends SL casings
several bodies keeps coming
finally there's battery life and here
Apple keeps its word you really can roll
out of bed in the morning use this thing
all day and come on home and expect
there to be some charge left well we'd
like to see a charge faster and it would
have been great to see Apple sacrifice a
little thinness for a bit more endurance
honestly this thing lasts plenty long as
it is and after experiencing its super
sleek profile for two weeks it's going
to be an adjustment going to anything
thicker ipads are typically not the most
surprising tablets and this edition is
no exception it's consistency that
apple's going for here and it largely
achieves that this is an iterative
improvement but it's an iteration on a
tablet that was already near if not at
the top of the pile as far as quality
goes if you want to save some money you
won't be missing too much by opting for
last year's ipad air over this one and
there's even something to be said for
trying the super-sized smartphone route
as well but if it's a true tablet you're
looking for the iPad air 2 is the safe
choice for a solid experience pocket now
has other tablets smartphones and
wearables on the review desk this month
from the Nexus 9 to the Droid turbo to
the LG G watch are so if you don't want

media and subscribe here on YouTube also
