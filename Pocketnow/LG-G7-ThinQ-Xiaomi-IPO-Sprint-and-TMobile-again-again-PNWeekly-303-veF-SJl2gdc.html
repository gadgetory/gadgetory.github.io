contributing editor at pocketnow.com
joined as always by plucky podcast
producer mr. Jules Wong on the East
Coast how's it going sir all the power
to y'all for celebrating Disney at its
best and at its most profitable so I'm
very happy for you and I we may be
noticing if you're watching the live
stream or you might not be noticing if
you're listening to the
version of the podcast we're joined by a
third this week mr. Nick gray how's it
going sir it is going excellent I can't
complain
well yeah you can't because Disney is
listening that's that's gonna be I think
the theme for everything we had a little
conversation off air just before we got
started like I don't know if you guys
caught this it's just the little
pop-culture reference but the the Star
Wars congratulating Marvel tweet you
know passing the lightsaber from raised
hands to iron man's glove just good job
Disney on breaking the box office sales
that Disney created Disney so good
metaphor doesn't have to revolve around
the lightsaber and also like your Star
Wars baguette infinity Wars like is our
best pieces of media do they revolve
around Wars like is this something just
always oh well well here's $5 go and see
a star war alright we should probably
jump it we've got we actually do have a
really heavy news week this week and and
as some some big gadget news again that
all of the early indecision of LG at the
beginning of the year will they won't
they the t's of whether or not they were
gonna join the the smartphone flagship
market this year we finally have a
device from them but sort of an odd time
but um we should probably jump in kind
of run down through some of our
headlines and Jules how should people
get in touch with us if they ask to want
to join the conversation and if you want
to get in touch with us and talk with us
well we're broadcasting live at 1:30 on
the East Coast fourth of May you can
tune in via Twitter with the hashtag can
weekly we write in your comments your
questions and whatever especially as we
talk about some of the new items up for
grabs here the LG g7 being one of them
and if you can't make it here live if
you can't write in it immediately then
you can do so on email we check the
mailbag every end of the month and the
address to send all your queries to is
podcast at pocketnow.com
gorgeous yes indeed
deal alright so
we had a number of headlines we we have
some hands-on content to take a look at
LG g7 thank you more screen more AI
Jules what are what are we taking a look
at with with this one Oh standard 2018
kind of thing going on with the Android
flagships snapdragon 845 four gigs of
ram unfortunately that's the only thing
that we get here the only sq in the u.s.
because six gigs of ram is available
below me in certain countries Korea we
also have a couple of specific features
to this phone so we have the display
this is a well first of all the display
technology which is the super-bright
display basically adds the a white pixel
to the RGB W sub pixel structure that's
said to get up to a thousand nits which
is pretty impressive and we'll talk
about more about the display technology
debate that's going on here in just a
moment
there's also a whole bunch of
conversation about the notch and chin
that has been played out over and over
again one thing that has really put the
mass of this phone there whatever you
consider dead space of this phone to use
is the boombox speakers they say that LG
says that it has a ten times larger than
usual resonance chamber within the
device and that provides for a net
effect of about six decibels when you're
playing out from those front-facing
speakers which although is a good thing
you're stealing that from HTC boomsound
that's very nice it's taut the display
also is taller than usual instead of 2
by 1 or 18 by 9
you're now adding 1.5 points to that
thing which I don't know it's eventually
will have lightsabers in our hands that
definitely felt like the arms race
against Samsung so if you're high by
nine will be nineteen point five by nine
we we hate reducing fractions at LG
where it should be a two by one this way
there are things more complicated
it's like 13 by 6 though so I mean if
you want it if you want to do that
unsexy thing
audio - you know we are talking about
quad acts that's carried over from the V
Series and the 7.1 surround sound so
that's pretty special of course you got
the standard waterproofing and dust
proofing and drop proofing also from the
V series of V 30 and just a whole bunch
of stuff um I will note that as we've
pointed out before dual camera system LG
likes to use this via general telephone
or like a you know angle camera and then
there's the wider angle camera and we've
seen that drop in the field of view the
g5 had its widest at 135 degrees the g6
went down to 120 but all of the while we
saw the resolution increase from 5
megapixels to 8 megapixels 13 megapixels
on the V and now we're seeing equal
parity 60 megapixels on the main camera
60 megapixels and why it's angle sensor
but at a field of view of only 107
degrees so pointed to talk about here I
want to start off with them just your
first assessments here Nick and tell me
more of just the your impression so far
my impressions I now to caveat this I
have not touched the phone I have not
used the phone but I am honestly just
underwhelmed by it all and a lot of it
goes back to just the phone's design in
general I mean when you look at LG what
they've done over the years they started
to move in a different direction
and then came a little bit further back
last year with the g6 and now I look at
the phone and I think it's one of their
mid-range devices it doesn't scream hi
I'm a high tech flagship device that you
should buy me when you compare that to
you know a samsung phone or the latest
Huawei phone it just doesn't scream you
know this is the phone that you need to
buy
and Juan Carlos I mean well here's the
thing in the pocket now we had two
people sent out to the events that LG
has held one of them are editor-in-chief
Anton Dean Hodge was in Korea for the
big tour that everyone that LG gave him
the whole press corps - and then there
was humming Rivera at the New York
launch event itself doing an hour
hands-on video from there so lots of
debt that they could give but just from
an external point because I think
they've talked themselves out this week
what what are your general impressions
here well this is this is a tough a
tough marketplace for LG I I kind of got
the feeling like 2017 marked a more
radical change in terms of screen aspect
ratios so that felt like we were getting
fresher devices even though the overall
usage for most manufacturers didn't
change substantially from 2016 to 2017
it just we got longer screens now I
think every manufacturer is refining
what a longer taller smart show
smartphone should feel like so I mean -
next point I mean I kind of agree but I
kind of agree across the board with most
manufacturers a Galaxy S 9 feels like a
refined Galaxy s8 not like some fresh
new aggressive take on what on how we
should use our smartphones
I think LG McGann battling from this
underdog position is facing some of
those same challenges how do you make
noise how do you engage with the
consumer how do you really get the point
across that there's something
interesting to offer here and I'll be
really curious to see how that affects
their advertising it more than anything
else I think the biggest complaint I
still have facing LG products is rarely
the product itself it's often how LG
leads the discussion on what their phone
has to offer so you're gonna pick up
this phone and it's gonna look kind of
like a Samsung it's gonna look kind of
like a Huawei what makes it stand out
what sets it apart and I'll be very
curious to see if they can get ahead of
that messaging rather than letting
enthusiasts lead the
discussion where they're going to I feel
sort of do a disservice to what this
phone might contribute you know like
well it's kind of like this and it's
kind of like that but I really haven't
used it because I like my Samsung and
then that's gonna be the review even if
they contribute some sort of traditional
advertising marketing campaign to all
this
they have very decent features in terms
of just bringing on more sound more
media into the deals
and I'll be cured and they sum that up
in in an ad you know like Apple will go
out there and make a commercial for the
iPhone on one feature something new
water resistance comes to the iPhone we
get a killer commercial focused on just
that and I I'm concerned and I'm
doubtful that LG can carry part of that
discussion because that's a delineating
feature the headphone jack is going to
be a delineating feature those things
matter to consumers in their daily usage
of the phone but are we just gonna see a
bunch of feel-good millennial
aspirational commercials like do what
you do because it's so passionate in
your youth culture young and if that's
what we see then LG's gonna fail because
they can't out Samsung Samsung their
Samsung can come up with all this
feel-good e advertising because they
spend over a billion dollars a year just
on advertising alone if LG even
scratched that quantity of advertising I
don't think we'd be having this kind of
conversation of them having difficulties
reaching some of their consumers it's
already yeah go ahead to that point
though it's you know Samsung is so far
ahead and Apple is so far ahead and LG
their phone isn't that dramatically
different from last year's phone as
Samsung's phone isn't dramatically
different from last year's phone but the
level at which they start is
dramatically different like the design
of the Galaxy s8 was dramatically better
than that of the g6 and so if you start
on the same not not the same playing
field but similar playing fields and
saying okay we're going to steps up Sam
Samsung's two steps up is you know 15
rungs up but LG's two steps ups is
seven oh I don't know that I'd
completely agree with that disparity I
mean III think no it's it's not that
that far of a disparity but when you
look at something that has a lot of
appeal from a visual standpoint even
though you know Samsung's phone didn't
look a lot different this year
LG's just took you know a slightly
different turn and it honestly I think
it doesn't look as good as last year's
device and for me that's that's a step
in the wrong direction they need to make
it look better one of the things that I
think is kind of curious is when we look
at some of their design influence on the
last generate the V 30 the V 30 I think
beat Apple to the iPhone 10 with a
better version of what that design
language could look like but we still
didn't see LG give that phone the push
where it could have been put up in
carrier stores it could have been on
Best Buy kiosks and it could have been
shown off in ads outside of the Olympics
we saw some commercials for it with the
Olympics where you had a bunch of really
young people talking to camera and then
the phone would kind of pop up at the
end of the commercial those types of
things that's also why because to your
point one of the things that LG is a
brand I think is most sensitive about
would be things like QA consistency of
manufacturing some of their back-end
support when consumers have problems but
that's absolutely why I think they
should be focused on differentiators
right so so given that there is a
perception of Samsung being so much
further ahead than the rest of the
Android Marketplace how do you close
that gap you don't close that gap by
talking about your phone in a general
all-rounder sense you say objectively
without debate without you know there
there is no question we have the best
headphone audio on any device that you
can put in your pocket you make an
entire commercial just about that and
that sets up a certain idea in consumers
minds I think that some of the stuff
that worked for the g4 you know like
that year I would say Samsung probably
had the better all-round her phone but
the camera experience on the g4 was a
step ahead of what everyone else was
doing outside a like Windows Phone
for the time and and how do you
recapture some of that conversation
today it's not by you know putting out
like limping into the market in May
quietly sort of handing this phone over
to reviewers because we don't have the
the power to expose general consumers to
this stuff like we did ten years ago and
then being at because this is also the
big fear is LG gonna be absent from the
conversation for six weeks two months
while we wait to see where this phone is
actually gonna chef well they announced
it we're yeah we're bringing all these
tangents out to HTC which has had pretty
much the same issues in terms of getting
the word out in terms of making sure
that people know the features that they
have to offer and well carrier situation
obviously we're at a point where LG is
the fourth biggest manufacturer in the
United States terms of smartphones and
it's just well I'm not sure that they
had the reach but most of that reach is
in the prepaid market where they're
having like these k's and fees are early
a little tiny things and not the main
g's and Vees so this are they still
already have a very low base in terms of
their flagship usership and it's just
not they're not working it's not working
for them well and I think it comes down
to LG really doesn't have a strategy
that they're trying to deliver if you
look at Samsung there's a clear well you
know beaten down path that they are
going after people who are willing to
spend a lot of money on their devices
they're going after Apple they're going
after the high end of the market and as
you said most of the devices that are
sold in the US are these cheaper LG
phones so even though they're number
four in the US that doesn't mean that
people are walking into you know any of
the carrier stores and saying I want the
newest LG phone it's in what is the
cheapest phone I can buy sorry sorry
sorry to jump in on that that's actually
one of the things that I wanted to get
your your opinion on
so much of the American market is built
on this carrier relationship and do we
think that LG can make a name for this
product in North America when it's
looking like 18 t is is probably just
gonna pass on this phone entirely and
and follow up with LG depending on what
they do with a future V Series phone
closer to the end of summer or closer to
the end of the year maybe around the
iPhone launch how do you think that
affects the consumer conversation when
you know you don't like one of the most
primary resources we have is walking
into a carrier store seeing the displays
and poking at the phones there I think
that's how a lot of people are educated
about what their options are and now
here's the second largest carrier just
walking away well and that's the thing
here in the US I would say I don't have
the numbers but I would say 90% of smart
phones are still purchased through your
service provider store or website which
is really a sad thing because there are
so many other options out there that
aren't available through those outlets
that it's practically you know like
you're shooting yourself in the foot if
you want something that's different from
anyone else and that's how it is in
Europe you just go anywhere you buy your
phone very few people actually go into
their service providers store to buy
their device they go to a general
consumer electronic retailer like Best
Buy or just a corner shop like
everybody's selling smart phones
everywhere like every time I'm you guys
have been over to Europe it's you know
there's the markets completely different
and your service provider doesn't
dictate what you use and here in the
States even though you can buy unlock
devices now every device is bought
without you know a two-year contract
unless you're doing those payment plans
even though that's the case everyone's
still relying on their service provider
and having them dictate to them what
they're going to buy so AT&amp;amp;T customers
can still buy the LGG g7
they just need to go find it online go
to Amazon go to LG's website and buy it
they just can't buy it from AT&amp;amp;T and the
sad part is that's going to have a
big big impact because AT&amp;amp;T what has I
mean 9% of the US customers and 29% of
US customers aren't gonna have the
option well they do have the option they
just will not know that they can buy
something I think it's gonna be
exceedingly rare that 18 t customers are
gonna be walking around with this phone
when it's not branded and in a carry on
a carrier shelf especially what the
future strategy is going forward and
we've seen leaks today of an ATT branded
V 35 thank you that is going to be on
the network supposedly in the summer and
then there's the question of whether it
will carry the v40 as well like this
kind of interruption in the the release
well in this sense
oh sorry Jules I will drop out right
there to know the joys of trying to have
a conversation on hangouts like this is
what I'm really curious for you guys to
is the timing on this phone is so
awkward what do you guys think this is
gonna mean for a launch strategy on a
next-gen V cuz we're still overlapping
the v35 this phone already feels like a
lot of what we would see in a V 40 you
know again they're bridging the G in the
V Series they're getting closer and
closer and closer to each other on every
strategy could this just mean like
they're gonna go with a bigger screen
but and a slightly larger battery and
then that's gonna be what the v40 is or
do you think that we're gonna see a
bigger change more substantial change
for their next major phablet entry into
this market I mean I've never been a
huge fan of the V Series besides for the
camera capabilities I don't think that
there's much that they can do I mean
this phone's coming out so late in the
market or so late in the year that you
have essentially three to four months
before the V device is supposed to drop
and that's not enough time to get
something that's substantially different
or substantially better
this I mean looking at the specs the g7
is top-of-the-line device the only thing
that's really missing is a real selling
point as to why you should buy this over
any other phone that has the same specs
for me that only selling point is the
wide-angle camera
I love the wide-angle camera that these
phones have and LG has been honestly I
think they're the only ones that have
the second camera that has the wider
wider lens when everyone else is going
through that 2x telephoto zoom and I
think it offers an experience that you
can't get anywhere else
and if they can find a way to make that
better on the next V series offer
something different maybe copy what you
know why always doing at a third sensor
on there another lens and you know to
give the wide-angle the ultra wide and
then the telephoto who knows I still
think that there's an opportunity to
talk about sound I mean we're we're
hearing those rumors that the next you
know iPhone isn't even gonna have a
headphone dongle in the box and yet
here's here's LG sporting a really high
quality really high quality competitive
against some of my favourite portable
you know high quality audio player chips
it's a huge opportunity that I think
they're just throwing away you know so
many people walk around with headphones
in their ears all day don't you deserve
the best if you're listening to audio
all day long for your ears don't your
ears deserve the luxury under 600 Hertz
and also like commercials for them right
now while we're doing the podcast this
is a pout moment the sake of the
thinkyou branding I'm pretty happy that
they're taking a Google assistant I'm
not sure it was still about this whole
hardware key situation where you have to
press the button in order to get the
thing and it's to like and that's your
only option for the button you can't you
can't you get way too cranky about this
especially with the Bigsby button what
what are your thoughts on AI assistants
in general like were you not using your
assistant because you didn't have a
button
- click - use your assistant I use
Google assistant all the time I just did
a video for my own YouTube channel of
top 10 tips for the galaxy s 9 and tip
number 1 how to disable Bixby the
hottest tip most views but very good
like especially now that we've been
training consumers on smart speakers
that the killer app is gonna be voice
controls not not a tactile button which
is confused with a power button on your
fingertips because these things are so
well that's also coming to the the super
far field mic recognition that they'll
put on apparently they're gonna treat it
like a smart speaker or something so I
mean they're tackling it from both
angles but I don't know it's just a 1 be
the better one and the other one just
shove it to the side I don't know like
as far as like a dedicated button for it
I am I'm not a fan I mean if a voice
assistant is supposed to be a voice
assistant you should be activating it
with your voice as well
I used the pixel 2 as my main device and
you know it has its toll the squeeze
functionality from the HTC u 11 and I I
don't know I'd never use the squeeze
functionality ever I used it on the U 11
because I could reprogram it to
something else but I do not use it for
my Google assistant yeah I spend so much
time in a car cradle like reach reaching
up to push a button or squeeze the phone
when it's already being clamped any
appeal to me you gotta raise that power
threshold and whatnot a couple more
comments from the YouTube chat here
Ulysses Ramirez g7 is behind because the
marketing from say Samsung or Apple is
ten times more prevalent and therefore
more known and just a whole bunch of
other common it's what most people don't
understand is that just making a good
device with great features isn't enough
you need great marketing skill and above
all good after sales service or Samsung
and Apple Excel for Roshan sha Shan so
keep those comments coming in we'll be
continuing to read those throughout the
show and by the way I should correct
myself your boombox
speaker ism is still the mono bottom
firing thing I apologize for mentoring
that was a front fire it was actually
bonfire so we'll take that into mind and
maybe that will affect your decisions
but it's the latter Oh No we'll move on
from that though
well more to talk about in the reviews
and whatnot let's talk about the news
here we're gonna go one by one in sort
of a quick-fire fashion I'm just gonna
introduce I'm going to set up the story
one of you can pass on over to another
person and then we'll spike it over the
net and then we'll score well I think
that's how it works really Top Gun of
you Jules I don't Dead or Alive
you do not want to see jiggle physics on
I'm definitely rocking a dad bod right
now yeah there we go
let's start off with the LG watch
timepiece which is supposedly one of the
first
LG watch that we'll be featuring where
os last year we had a couple of Android
wear and then we have the branding
change so this apparently will be a
model that will fit between the LG watch
sport and LG watch style a lot of the
same specs but just a better display a
little by a little bit better ram and it
will have the ability to be a hybrid
SmartWatch being that it has mechanical
a mechanical watch face so you can keep
time and then there's obviously the
screen for the smart stuff now
supposedly this was supposed to be a
release that was set for this week but
apparently we we just haven't seen
anything about this so in regards to all
that neck where do you think where iOS
is that at this point I think where OS
is desperately lost which makes me
really sad I'm a big fan of smartwatches
I I've used them for years I still have
my pebble
I just think Google needs to have a
clearer picture as to what the
development for this category is and
where they
want to take it I don't necessarily
think we should need a pixel watch to
kind of define that but if if everyone
else seems lost along the way and
doesn't know how to bring something new
to the table maybe at this point we
should just all give up right this
doesn't even feel like a Nexus kind of a
project that yeah Juan Carlos has
something to say with this news oh no
I'm just agreeing wholeheartedly so
cranky about where OS and the recent
changes that like notifications have
gotten worse performance has gotten
worse I phone connectivity has gotten
worse this is a we've taken so many
steps backwards from the pebble that
yeah III would be recommending an iOS
strategy for people who were really
thinking that a SmartWatch would be a
good fit for them or I mean I guess a
close second would be Tizen get yourself
a galaxy phone get yourself a gear
SmartWatch and I think it's too fiddly
but it's better supported better
iterated and better hardware than what
you currently get in where OS land at
the moment and so just to let you guys
know my brother came to me asking for
SmartWatch recommendations and he's not
a SmartWatch kind of guy and he was
saying oh I want notifications I want
this I want that I was like no I
honestly right now what I would
recommend is a hybrid SmartWatch get a
whiffing x' you know something like that
or any of the fossil smartwatches that
just vibrate and count your steps
throughout the day yeah exactly it's
beautiful it looks like a lot which I
love watches and it does the basic
things that you need you know no one
needs to read a text message I mean if
you do that's fine but you know for 99%
of the people I think that I read
smartwatches oh yeah opposite watch fans
where I don't have to charge that every
night yeah indeed indeed that's what
that's why I used my pebble Joe yep one
thing I'm glad this week also from the
news is that Nokia sold Withings back to
its original co-founder let's play ping
pong with health
it's so yeah it's it's that's but no no
he is trying to consolidate I think it's
it's to battle against Qualcomm and one
night and it's a weakened state but in
you know in terms of that at least they
didn't poll a Microsoft and basically
just took a whole bunch of people from
Espoo and to Lin and then dump them into
the unemployment line after not too far
though I mean with the market does not
respond well to that kind of unsureness
insecurity you know what what label what
brand the Nokia name still has a ton of
respect but then they're dumping this
whole division Withings didn't have
quite the same visibility so it's not as
bad as Microsoft what happened with not
still like this is not a good luck for
this market you know if a company like
Nokia and Withings working together
can't inspire some consumer traction on
health fitness gadgets something that
should be blowing up right now
then that's a scary idea I think for the
entire market the entire set on your
wrist though don't have a blow-up on
your wrist because that would be bad
let's move on to read the camera company
that makes those fancy smancy
4k 8 K 12 K cameras that bet
cinematographers use and let's talk
about the hydrogen one for a second
there first Android smartphone that they
have absolutely no idea whatsoever what
we are doing in terms of developing
that's that's from coming from a Jim
Jannard who runs red and he's had to
announce a further delay first it was
gonna be quarter wanted this year now
it's gonna name was summer and now it's
gonna be we're pushing lay August we're
questioning that that fall barrier here
and all this is to well first of all is
to incorporate a four view camera
function in the base device because
we're talking about this modular set up
here that is supposed to be able to
record holographic images via the four
view recording method they had they
acquired him some technology from a
company called Leia
speaking of Star Wars Leia
and yeah the like this is that's great
but also in showing off Jim Jannard
greenness to this industry he also hopes
to hit up a few carriers and make sure
that there's a simultaneous release now
I'm not sure if maybe he's hoping to you
know get this all international and
maybe just achieve one carrier on each
country or maybe he's aiming for
multiple carriers in each country like
this that process is pretty darn hard so
I mean I mean it's it's all great for
him I have complete faith that he'll be
able to serve his very niche population
of very elite cinematographers in this
but oh no horn Carlos you have more
Hollywood side perspective on this
what's your take well this is I think
this is a a misstep in over-promising
and under-delivering they don't read
does not have any relationship or any
reputation or any presence in
smartphones so that works for them in
some regard in that expectations can be
managed that way but I ultimately think
it's gonna hurt them in the long run
because you can't you can't filter out
updates to phones the same way that you
work on red as a camera system with
different modules with different sensors
with different rails with different
battery packs different things like you
can add augment change and develop that
over time and red was a disruptor in
that space for how little respect was
given digital photography when they came
out trying to do something like that in
smartphones where we're at peak
smartphone I mean think of the
conversations we've been having about LG
and HTC and even to a to a lesser degree
Samsung and Apple the smartphone hasn't
changed a whole lot over the last couple
generations of smartphone we've reached
peak smartphone the the act of picking
up a glowing rectangle and pushing a
square and getting an app is kinda about
as good as we can make it
with the current metaphor we use for
data and services so Reds walking into a
mature market here which i think is also
going to be another strike against them
if they come out with something that's
that doesn't profoundly change how we
interact with mobile content with
smartphone cameras with multimedia that
that that's a completely different
challenge and I don't believe they've
got the team and the resources to really
join that challenge to really meet that
challenge and Nick I'm gonna put you up
for the next story here or with Samsung
and Verizon partnering up with this
crazy bloatware kind of deal going on so
Verizon's o'the subsidiary which runs
all of its media properties such as
Yahoo Sports and Yahoo News and what go
90 and whatever they basically teamed up
so that both assets are now providing
contents for Bixby home on the galaxy s
9u obviously s 9 plus and all this
content it's gonna be coming in well
just stories on the feed and also
increased installed apps with Verizon so
how much hate can we put on this or
excuse me
pre-installed on just yeah galaxy s 9 I
just want to make clear I don't think
there should be that much hate installed
on it like if you look at the breadth of
the content that's available through oh
I know we like to hate on it because
it's owned by Verizon but when it was on
its own it's a good source of content I
mean you you look at all the outlets
that are listed under it but then again
I don't like Bixby I I can tell you I
can show you how to disable Bixby home
on your Android there was a video that
we could run there's only a video
traveler I eye every time that I opened
Bixby home is by accident and I don't
think
that there is a substantial number of
people who open Bixby home on purpose to
go find content that's available on
Bixby home I mean correct me if I'm
wrong I have either of you ever opened
up Bixby home to find something useful
there no the only times I've used Bixby
is when I need to show it off in a
review and and there are so many good
ideas in there especially like creating
macros I think some of that stuff is
cool but again smartphones do what they
do and I haven't been won over that this
is a new way for me to use my phone yeah
what's a galaxy s 9 I I've never held it
actually I have but I don't own one so
so but more I do do we have with a
company like Verizon leveraging their
content their multimedia at what point
do we get to say as consumers that we
have control over the ridiculously
expensive pocket computers that we
purchase you know when when even on a
every now and then I'll run into an
unlocked phone that had facebook
pre-installed and I can only disable it
I can't uninstall and on an unlocked
phone that's unacceptable that is not
okay but now we've got these carrier
branded experiments where because of or
you know the same thing we can also make
the same criticism of Samsung and
Microsoft where you go in you got a
Galaxy Note from a Microsoft Store and
it's gonna have a bunch of Microsoft
apps and services pre-installed
pre-installed on it I mean you do you
own your device I mean yes you do own
your device you can turn the feature off
you can not use it my question is though
like is it exclusive content from oath
or are they simply one of others who are
feeding the news feeds and other things
like that for a big spiel the premier
content partner premier spelled as in
the first so I mean it could be that you
know there are more sources for more
regional
so I'm not thinking that yes you're
gonna get content from oaths and a lot
of their properties but it's not like
they are the only ones and you know it's
not like CNN is now you're only News
Channel ever so I don't want to defend
Verizon and their decisions but I think
a lot of people are over playing this as
something that's dramatically bad for
people everyone pays money to get their
content distributed Verizon owns oath
they're trying to get their content
distributed
I mean if PocketNow had the money and
could fill up Bixby home with pocket now
news I'm sure we would too right we've
come I got the marketing budget for that
yeah we didn't certainly do right so
yeah it's it'd be an interesting query
to watch for well we'll keep a watch on
that for you
let's talk about Qualcomm here and I
know this is kind of a we're getting
into the weeds somewhat bow make it
somewhat more simple or more interesting
for you guys so let's talk about
licensing rates the company just
announced that they now have to patent
bundles that they're they'll be selling
200 Am's from now on most OEMs at least
so they have the complete package of all
the stuff that they have all the IP for
5% of unit revenues or they have the
standard essentials patents package
which basically covers their breaded
month butter 3G 4G connectivity perhaps
you know the cellular side of things and
that would be only for 3.25% and this
was all based off of the settlements
they had to make in China back a couple
years ago so we're talking about if
we're talking they also load the cap to
on how much of that license fee applies
to eat the price of each phone so they
used to meet the first $500 on the phone
that's gonna be the first $400 of a fan
so what who was basically if you had a
flagship phone from like 2017 you'd be
paying $25 a piece just to you know get
the Qualcomm stuff on it and now maybe
if you have a flagship phone but you
just want the essentials
you'll be paying $13 but remember
Qualcomm is not just about modems
they're about a whole bunch of things
audio codecs for one I would see just a
whole bunch of things and with some of
those features like AI mirror processing
and all that those are those features
are being included into more and more
flagships as we go along in time so does
this is this a really make sense that a
move that makes sense excuse me
if you were an OEM what would you what
would be your strategy neck well I I
would love to know what the number was a
beforehand I know they've they've kind
of simplified it but I think before they
were actually charging even more which
seems kind of outrageous so it's
personally I love the idea of you can
patent an idea you can make some money
off of it but I mean Qualcomm why should
they get paid that much money for every
smartphone that's made and why is it off
of a percentage of the price like it if
it should be a set licensing fee like
you have a phone that has a 3G 4G 5g
modem and you we get ten bucks for that
you know it shouldn't be oh because your
phone sells for X amount of dollars we
make more money off of it those those
percentages like from a business
standpoint they make total sense for
Qualcomm but from a logic standpoint
like why almost from a monopoly
standpoint they make sense for Qualcomm
yeah yeah well I think that's one of the
reasons why I don't know the US
government and their stance on Huawei is
so strict like Huawei does not use
Qualcomm processors in their phones they
use their own processors and Qualcomm
doesn't get a dime from Huawei everyone
else is paying up the y and you know
it's and it's it's really feel I it's
frustrating because I think Wacom could
be making a really disruptive move here
knowing the current state of Intel in
this space you know we for the desktop
side we've been seeing them struggle to
break ten
meters on their more recent process
shift AMD is coming up some heavy
hitting gear we've been seeing so many
moves towards mobile chipsets starting
to make their way into more desktop and
laptop sphere products you know Windows
10 on arm is a perfect example of work
welcome could really hurt Intel in the
mid-range in the entry-level in the
mid-range and they're not going to do it
with this sort of halfway move
you know same same licensing structure
same deal same collection of patents and
technologies so it's a little bit better
we'll see a little bit more traction a
few more manufacturers might take risks
on a couple different products but I
don't think this is gonna significantly
move the needle on how companies are
currently doing business we'll call
what's welcome I think Apple is still
looking on how they can get out of any
relationship with Qualcomm tech well and
I'd like to remind everybody that
Qualcomm makes the majority of its money
from licensing its patents even though
it's chips are the most popular chips
and smartphones you can't go anywhere
without finding a smartphone that's
powered by a Qualcomm chip they make
most of their money and probably 85% of
their profits from patent licensing but
although that number has been depressed
with the ongoing lawsuits with Apple
true true but just to put it in
perspective everyone's talking about
their chips all the time their chips all
the time but that's not where Qualcomm
makes its money at all like they could
shut down their chip business and still
be a patent licensing business for the
next 50 years and fire 95% of their
workforce and it would be a very
successful company and that's how much
money and sway they have over the
industry with their patents it's like
the 1998 version of Godzilla where there
wasn't a name to talk about chips it was
all just about fish like that's a lot of
fish anyway so let's talk about Apple
let's make that full pivot here Apple
released its earnings and all in all
everyone seems a little surprised lo
they've been talking about the iPhone 10
being a disappointment with sale cut in
parts orders and
shits and whatnot and well Tim Cook says
no iPhone 10 was the bestseller week
after week
in the first quarter and it seems like
we have some proof of that Strategy
Analytics sees that in within the first
quarter this year 16 million units
shipped and you combine that with the
iPhone 8 iPhone 8 plus and even the
iPhone 7 which take up the first four
slots of their chart here that's a
pretty monstrance total where we have
like 40 million just from those models
alone and now it's a little surprising
to me that they still got an average
sales price of seven hundred twenty
eight dollars which is only twenty eight
dollars more then an iPhone eight base
model price so that's a little
surprising to me which like that that
stuff does just doesn't leave the mind
like that like you it really makes me
skeptical tip skis be skeptical about
what's going on here for me it's always
fun to see how analysts get things wrong
order after quarter after quarter
especially when it comes to Apple I'm
just gonna leave it at that I mean
there's so many things that they could
get right and get wrong but every
quarter everyone's always surprised no
completely agree it's it's it's
hilarious watching people make stock you
know significant stock moves on
speculation about this company when we
can't fault that there are money-making
juggernaut and even for some of these
phones maybe not performing like some
people thought they should have it
doesn't mean that this company wasn't
still making a ridiculously obscene
amount of amounts of money
purchase over purchase indeed and one of
those people that were that was making
money off of every move that Apple made
or supposedly made or may have made well
as KPI security is apples apples apples
analysts maangchi quo who has left
the firm to pursue ventures perhaps in
China perhaps in other fields so what do
you say goodbye good riddance good luck
yeah don't care don't care and I don't
all right let's move on working really
hard to try and have an opinion on this
and it's just not happening
everyone made a big deal that like all
the people like columns are like oh
maangchi quo he's such a visionary and
he has all these great access points and
whatnot and and yeah that's not really
good you know a conversation piece is
not really the thing here but hey I mean
maybe renamed Richie would make a big
point about it I don't know let's talk
about Xiaomi here we have a couple of
big debate topics and apparently topics
that Nick gray here our friend has
contributed editorials to on
pocketnow.com if you have the rundown
handy and if not well you can just click
on to pocketnow.com podcast section
should have the links for you over there
let's talk about Jeremy though this week
they launched into an IPO they finally
put the papers in in Hong Kong
supposedly it's gonna be ten billion
dollars they're gonna be valued near or
at a hundred billion dollars which would
be big for them they're expanding into
Europe with the new partnership the
three network and they have more Android
one phones that are being planned out so
all this is being in the contacts that
they're gonna have a hundred million
smartphone shipments this year they say
and that they're going to reach the u.s.
either late this year or early next so
what is the tackle that you're taking
here Nick in terms of what you're saying
for me it's people don't realize that
Xiaomi is just not a smartphone maker I
mean originally you could easily compare
them to an HTC Oppo and some other
manufacturers that just push out
smartphones but the companies expanded
so much over the last couple years if
you go to their website they have close
to 900 or more different products that
they sell
and to be fair they don't manufacture
all those products actually show me
doesn't manufacture any of their own
products but they they partner with
smaller Chinese brands and rebrand their
products to put Xiaomi on them and then
push them out the door but their breadth
of devices and categories that they
cover is just astounding and Xiaomi
moving into Europe and possibly the u.s.
actually means we get more than just
smartphones we get everything like they
make drones they make webcams they make
mirrorless cameras they make they make
electric scooters electric bikes pretty
much anything that has to do with
technology and their real goal is to
take on the bigger players like Samsung
and LG and not just be secluded to the
smartphone space and you're also making
a good point here that they've partnered
with big retailers students not just
carriers we're talking about what
fortress big chain in Asia and Europe
Superdrug Cuidad and ck Hutchison and as
well so definitely in terms of getting
not just phones but also all those
products be it you know air purifiers or
whatnot that's pretty important as well
well and you're not just gonna you know
someone a company announces that they're
coming to a specific market and all they
really do is flip the switch on the
domain name and say hey you can buy
things from our website now no they're
actually doing a retail push and for
some of you who don't know Xiaomi
actually has retail stores of their own
they opened a store in Barcelona late
last year they're working on a store
that's gonna be opening up in Paris I
believe next month and so they're and a
lot of their stores are pseudo Apple
stores the the feeling that you get when
you walk inside is like you walked into
an Apple store but it's it's one of
those things where it's a manufacturer
that's trying to enter a new market but
that manufacturer isn't looking for
ridiculously high profit margins like an
apple or a Samsung there when they
announced the phone last week
their CEO went up on stage and promised
that they're capping their profits after
tax at five percent
which is ridiculously crazy when you
think that Apple is making 45 percent
profit on every single iPhone that it
sells Xiaomi is doing the same thing
only asking for five percent profit well
and of course taxes and and operating
expenses of whatnot yeah it's already a
hard business to be in but especially
now when they file their IPO they have a
lot of investors backing into them and
they have more of a profit motive to
serve like and especially considering
that these are Western banks not just
charge not Chinese banks at all Western
banks that have the capitalist mind of
just be able to just go at it and make
sure that they make these a certain
margin so that's they're walking a
difficult tightrope here and we had a
couple of its co-founders leave the
company just before this IPO was filed
so all I'm saying right here is that the
road ahead for them is gonna be even
more difficult they're gonna have to
battle growth and their mission what
they are as just a basic brand so it's a
it'll be interesting to see well I just
wanted to make sure that things were not
frozen because I it was there was a
front moment there where I was like oh
everything is not there silence only
thing I have to add to this because I
mean we've got a couple there there
stories about will we see new Android
one phones on the rundown what the
global strategies are looking like they
want to ship a hundred million
smartphones in 2018 but to Nick's
overall point again I really want to
stress to people the waning power of the
smartphone over a lot of these
manufacturers zsa me is looking at being
a full-on lifestyle gadget consumer
electronics brand it's not hinged
completely on these smartphone sales and
when we criticize a company like LG for
example it's they have an entire
portfolio of products outside the realm
of the smartphone and I feel like for a
lot of these manufacturers the
smartphone is becoming a less
less desirable companion device for some
of these other these other these other
moneymakers appliances kitchen tax stuff
like from superstar fresh here on the
YouTube chat Shammi makes one awesome
Android skin I'll give them then they're
also expanding into our services as well
they've been that's where they've been
running ads and making most of their
money too so that's one of the things
people though though how the company got
started was their Android skin the me UI
was how they got started they started
with software I think it was two and a
half three years before they released
their first phone and people were on XDA
developers flashing me you eye-to-eye I
flashed it to my g2 you know way back in
the day and I mean they they're really
good at software yes it's not pure stock
Android but they had a lot of ideas that
are now part of the you know the base
version of Android that they implemented
two to three years before you all did so
keep that in mind and also they are
making noise there are the rumors about
them joining forces on Android one so
not only are they are they really savvy
at creating their own software I think
they're recognizing the potential of
well there are going to be a certain
class of consumers who are gonna want
this notion of purity they're working
the world outside of China that wants
that I think breathing this is such a
great show most looking forward to
before we completely lose connection and
I think Nicky you'll probably need to be
getting need to be going soon we should
probably talk out Sprint and t-mobile
probably one of the most well joined an
aggressive conversations I think I've
ever been included on on Twitter was
this debate over competition in a
marketplace mergers and acquisitions
resulting in job loss a lot of people
had very passionate and you know very
lengthy replies to be joined which of
course Twitter is the best platform to
once conversations but um at least now
your tweets can be a little bit longer
well it well then also it was it was it
was crazy trying to follow the threat of
this debate between five or six larger
you know like high name I made Iveta and
mr. mobile all having this conversation
together but then you would see people
replying with those stacked tweets you
know you can make a chain of tweets now
and like then someone would reply to
like tweet three of this chain and I
think this is impossible I I can't even
I can't even follow but I just want to
get like the bots Nick uh you know
t-mobile and Sprint third and
fourth-place carriers respectively
joining forces becoming you know a three
tier media landscape for most American
consumers in the smartphone space what
are your thoughts what are your feelings
on this the the pros and cons of these
two joining forces as a business major
and having worked in the corporate world
for years I would say that you know
losing a competitor is one of the worst
things for the marketplace it's you know
consumers should be worried prices will
go up but then you look at what t-mobile
has done over the last three to four
years and forced the other carriers to
submit to their demands by offering
unlimited data at bundling other
services with you know the basic plans
cutting out you know cutting down prices
including taxes and what you're actually
paying rather than saying you're paying
$40 plus taxes you know $40 is you know
exactly what you're gonna be paying this
whoa from Deutsche Telekom this was
coming from one person they this is
coming from John ledger I mean he he
wanted to disrupt the industry like no
one did and honestly I think if this
merger goes through he will be
emboldened to take it further I mean I
I'm a t-mobile customer I've been a key
Mobile customer since I don't know at
least a decade and I've I've always
liked rooting for
the little guy you know t-mobile wasn't
you know the best service that you could
get they didn't have the best phones
ever but they always offered something
unique and I don't think that's gonna
change if t-mobile and Sprint merge I
think the company's gonna be emboldened
and they'll still be the smallest of the
three carriers there'll be a couple
million behind AT&amp;amp;T and you know maybe
eight or nine million behind Verizon but
if at that point you just got you know
you moved up the scale and eliminated
your smaller competitor essentially I
think if you're that close to the top I
would say they're gonna push to be
number one and that's gonna mean more
disruption in the industry in terms of
YouTube chat here due to bang brasov
itch nice name they're talking about
their network technologies CDMA and GSM
combining amazing also is in Google five
based on both sweet and t-mobile
networks
well Google Phi correct you they're both
uses both as well as us earlier and they
have a whole bunch of other partners but
more than that it's CDMA and GSM
t-mobile had to go through that
transition to back in 2012 when they
acquired mutual MetroPCS they had CDMA
they have to shut it down and determine
imagine sprint towers will will soon be
cannibalized for 5g and team oh yeah
totally and they'll be equipping some of
the old it will be mostly t-mobile but
they'll be equipping some of the old
Sprint towers with proper radios as well
14 from use it properly yes I like that
operate for proper radios that sprint
cheap radios hmm
so but there's there's definitely a good
shift in the pure LTE is coming soon so
that's a something that we can all look
forward to what are the concerns that
people have been continually bringing up
is that with this lack of competition or
less competition there is less of an
incentive to price low Sprint t-mobile
have been the cut rates competitors here
but in the end they've been trying to
target 18
Verizon customers who have been paying
high prices I don't see too much of an
incentive to raise prices at this point
and at least for the short term there is
come some concern about prepaid because
between their brands MetroPCS boost
mobile version mobile they own 54% of
the market and that would be something
of concern if the Department of Justice
looks at this and says okay should we
treat postpaid and prepaid as separate
things and if so what are you going to
do about this prepaid situation right
now because from what we've heard from
the company they're they want to keep a
postpaid and prepay it all together so
this is gonna be interesting and if they
raise prices on prepaid where you know
the majority of households make less
than $75,000 a year where do they go and
where do MVNOs go because a lot of those
people a lot of those carriers buy
wholesale access from Sprint or t-mobile
because they are the most affordable
offers of that there's the the the
ripple effects here are quite wide like
Nick your perspective on this I think
would be appreciated too because when
we're talking about the big three
I completely agree with your assessment
that will probably see t-mobile
aggressively trying to take down 18 t
being the number one I think would be a
huge coup for them but how far should we
be taking our concerns on MVA knows the
prepaid market you know in an outlet
like freedompop where two million of
their subscribers are making less than
$40,000 a year something where we've
kind of democratized cell phone usage
through leasing air on these major
networks but for smaller players to be
able to compete via price um you know
I've I've used MVA knows over the years
and you know you always get almost the
exact service you would get from the
regular service providers you know you
have slightly slower data
but you get the better prices and that's
always the the appeal of going with an
MVNO rather than you know an AT&amp;amp;T
t-mobile or Sprint or Verizon but I
don't think that Envia knows will be
going away anytime soon or the pricing
for MVA knows is gonna go up the the the
benefit that you know t-mobile Sprint
and anyone else has from leasing their
spectrum out to these MVA knows is that
they're getting customers they're
getting paid and they're not doing any
work it's essentially free money by
having somebody live in your basement
that for in basement that you don't work
you know your your perspective like I
don't think they would want to do
anything to disrupt that model but what
I'm concerned about is the regulatory
perspective you know someone who's
looking from the outside of this
business deal and sees these two
companies occupy over half of this this
prepaid market is that something that
should give investors pause over really
trying to push this merger through like
should we be concerned that this could
be the hang-up which might slow down
Sprint t-mobile joining forces I don't I
mean I from a regulatory perspective I
don't think that's gonna be a big issue
at all I mean the only reason why the
NBA knows are going on Sprint and
t-mobile networks is because they're
offering the better rates it's not that
they have a competitive advantage over
Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T I mean they might from
an infrastructure back end because
they've worked with MVA knows so much
over the last couple years that they
have a better setup for it but the only
reason for that is that they've been
more competitive so if anything if
Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T want to get more into
that game we might see more competition
and even you know a broadening of that
MVNO marketplace because of that because
now it puts you know as you said that
big chunk of that MVNO clientele
straight on the new t-mobile and Verizon

they have brand stores even which we've
