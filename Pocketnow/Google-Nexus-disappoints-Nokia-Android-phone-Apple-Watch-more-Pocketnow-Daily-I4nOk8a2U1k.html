picture for Nexus devices Apple might be
considering some third party accessories
for the Apple watch and Nokia confirms
the news that we've all been waiting for
I'm hi mera neta and I am rushing
through with things this Friday mainly
because I have a life too you know this
is parking out daily the official
elucidated with Sony and t-mobile and
now it's not to announce the Xperia z4
actually it's to announce the return of
the z3 for reasons we don't understand
we don't understand why the z4 is
currently an exclusive to Japan why the
z3 is still in the market considering it
successor is already out and well the
only good thing here is that it's
dropped its price to five hundred
dollars on an hour contract pricing you
know the whole deal with tmobile that's
one hundred thirty dollars off it's a
good deal and yes today is the big day
for the Apple watch launch and people
are already claiming that there's has
arrived and great for them but
interesting Apple has published its
users guide for the Apple watch and
within it says that you can only use
Apple provided watch bands or apple
approved watch bands from third parties
meaning that yes it seems that Apple is
considering a market for third party
accessories for the Apple watch we just
hope that the price tags don't oscillate
between five and six hundred dollars
where you can buy a watchband an amazon
for 35 bucks probably the most
interesting official new sport today
have to do with Nokia as a no kin China
has just confirmed what we wanted to
hear for the longest time they have
confirmed that they will return to the
smartphone business as of 2016 the
rumors that we talked about a couple of
days ago and even more interesting they
are confirming that Android is their
platform of choice and we've seen
devices like the Nokia N 1 it's a
beautiful tablet the Z launcher from
Nokia it performs great and yeah imagine
a phone that does all this we really
can't wait we just don't know which part
of 2016 that will be hopefully the first
month and given the fact that people
don't really care much about google
glass anymore luxottica CEO and Alex
otic is the company that builds ray-ban
for example they've just confirmed that
they are already working on google glass
2 and
even Google glass 3 even though he was a
little skeptical about talking what
Google glass 3 was it seems that it goes
beyond what last two will be your glass
one now no specifics arm design will
provide it or what benefits will be
getting from google glass to or how
they're gonna improve the whole you know
user scenario deal and the fact that
people are skeptical of you using a
camera in front of them all that stuff
we don't know how that's going to
perform or when that will happen but
yeah it's happening and finally for the
very interesting and disappointing news
of the day Google's quarter results are
in and in the bottom line of everything
the company has confirmed that they have
dropped two percent in revenue in other
revenues meaning that area where they
get money from the google play store and
nexus devices and according to google
because of the google play store these
numbers were good but because of the low
performance of nexus devices the numbers
actually went below two percent one
compared to other quarters which is
really sad i mean the nexus 6 is a
beautiful device the nexus 9 is too but
it does lead me to the question of the
day why do you think these devices have
underperformed compared to last year's
Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 in my case I would
say it bluntly the price tag they got
completely lost with the price tag but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think is wrong friends as always you
know the drill if you want to get the
news earlier before this video is
filming you follow us on out

well you'll follow me on twitter i
