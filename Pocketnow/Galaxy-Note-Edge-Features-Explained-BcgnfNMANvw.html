how useful is the edge display samsung's
new Galaxy Note 4 edge is named after a
michael fisher with pocket now eddie for
2014 let's find out as we showed you in
our galaxy note 4 edge hands-on earlier
in the week the edge display adds a 160
pixel wide column to the right hand side
of this Note 4 screen
it's normally dormant but it illuminates
with notifications and you can also
manually bring it to life with a quick
side swipe though it takes some practice
to get used to the idea behind the edge
display is to create a special piece of
screen real estate for things like
notifications useful when you're viewing
a movie in full screen or something like
that but it also serves as a launch pad
for a customizable catalog of apps both
full screen titles and a variety of
miniature apps you can summon with the
sideswipe these include a flashlight
toggle various timers and stopwatches
voice memos and even a ruler which is
just the kind of novel touch we'd expect
from Samsung
finally and also typical of Samsung
you're able to change the wallpaper to
suit your desires and you give a not
just one but a bunch of plugins for
glanceable tickers from sports scores to
the news and in the touch shutter
functionality and the ability to glance
at notifications while the phone's still
in its case if you're a holster kind of
guy and the note 4 edge becomes a lot
more interesting just how useful any of
this is we'll have to wait for our full
review coming very soon
for much more from Aoife including more
note 4 and the edge hands-on coverage
