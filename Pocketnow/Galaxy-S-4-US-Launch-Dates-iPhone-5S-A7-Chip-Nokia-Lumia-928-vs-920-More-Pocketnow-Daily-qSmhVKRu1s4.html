for the united states the iphone 5s
motherboard leaks with an apple a7 chip
and more leaks compare the Lumia 920
with the Lumia 928 I'm hi meri beta
completely devastated and praying for
all those affected in the Boston
Marathon tragedy today this is
out daily continuing on with last week's
rumors of pantech bringing a note bezel
display our future device being dubbed
of Vega as their feed your smartphone
well we've got some leaked images of the
device that even though the design is
quite interesting it does have a bezel
savvy apparently companies have not
figured that out but we know that this
will most likely reach AT&amp;amp;T is this is
their current carrier partner and even
though previous devices in the past from
pantech haven't been all that hot well
this design is actually quite nice let's
see what they bring now let's talk about
the galaxy s4 we know a lot of you are
still trying to decide if you get the
HTC One or the galaxy s4 and new rumors
now have the device being released on
AT&amp;amp;T on April 26 on verizon on April
thirtieth and then we've got it on
tmobile on may first we don't have a
specific date for sprint just yet but
just stay tuned keep your wallets ready
because we will definitely have all the
review coverage that you need to help
yourself decide which is your next phone
now let's talk about some leaked photos
of the motherboard of the iphone 5s
notice we don't call it the iphone 6
anymore because we know how apple rolls
with their iOS devices so far it sports
an a7 chip according to the leaks and
according to the serial numbers
apparently this is their first quad-core
smartphone or first quad core processor
to come to the market and it also does
support to the good bytes of ram so
pretty much doubles on everything that's
on the current Apple lineup at least
according to iOS so stay tuned for the
rumors now let's talk about the Nokia
Lumia 928 rumors obviously this is no
longer the catwalk this is the device
coming to verizon and well it was
compared to the Lumia 920 recently it is
actually a little bit taller than Lumia
920 but also aside from that it does not
sport the LCD display the Lumia 920 had
which was actually quite good it's now
sporting an AMOLED display which is kind
of an interesting ship we still don't
have any dates for this device we don't
even have a release for the phone on
Verizon but stay tuned it'll most likely
happen very soon and finally for the
interesting news of the day we've got
some newly
it's about the nokia eos project you
know that concept of bringing the camera
from the 808 PureView that 41 megapixel
sensor to happen on windows phone lumia
devices in the future apparently nokia
is already testing their first quad-core
processor to work on this device which
is interesting but apparently they're
still under oath via making it quad-core
or sticking to dual core as it is
obviously more power efficient but
anyways that leads you to the question
of the day what a 41-megapixel camera
make you want to switch to Windows Phone
or stay at windows what if you're
currently disappointed for some reason
in my particular case honestly when
those stones still has a lot of things
to fix for me to actually want to stay
within windows phone but leave us a
comment down below is that 41-megapixel
sensor something you would like to see
on your future smartphone next year of
course for an earlier school of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet roll make sure you
follow us on pocketnow.com and subscribe
to our youtube channel as well please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I am high memory that I
thank you very much for watching and our
thoughts and prayers again go for all
the families of those affected in boston
this is a real tragedy a really sad day
for the united states and for all of us
