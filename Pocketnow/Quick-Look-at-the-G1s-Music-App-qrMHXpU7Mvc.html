application and a lot of people are
interested in that I've
home screen so basically just click on
it and there's already a bunch of songs
already included on here on the g one so
it's pretty neat you can press the menu
button and play all you can look at the
library in different ways artist albums
playlist or songs let's go back to where
we were you could do playback and it'll
show whatever has been playing more
recently you can shuffle among of course
you can always use your track wheel if
you want it is a touch phone so it
depends on if you're two-handed things
you can use your touch screen if you got
the trackpad that you can use that
alright so let's go into this song here
and what's cool is I've it starts
playing immediately but right here you
have the artist the album and the song
if you hold down the artist you can
search for the artist but amazonmp3
google or youtube if you want to watch
see if we got some videos on her online
and we've got some different videos that
are all right and this is her music
video and it'll start playing it alright
so we're still concerned with the music
application you could do the same thing
for the album let's look forward on
Google
focus there we go and find a bunch of
there's her website right there or if we
want to decide that we like the whole
album or we like more songs from Katy
Perry we can look her up on amazonmp3
and see what else is on there and buy
the album or different songs okay so
that's the basics for how the music
application works
and I think that's everything see oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
