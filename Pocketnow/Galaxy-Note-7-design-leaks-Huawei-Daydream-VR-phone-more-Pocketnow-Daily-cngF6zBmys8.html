very familiar design that we might
already know Huawei proves that there
might be a need for new hardware for
daydream PR and some hot new deals make
it compelling to buy the Google Nexus 6p
I'm hi Mary Vera with a lovely ten and
enjoying the benefits of Airbnb like
there is no tomorrow this is parking out
daily the official news today as always
begin with deals if you're in the market
for a moto XP edition this might be the
time to buy as a you're getting a moto
360 sport being bundled with that
package and the you're getting it for
free so you're pretty much only paying
four hundred dollars for both products
meaning that's almost a three hundred
fifty dollar discount which is rather
crazy you can learn more in the links in
the description and speaking of deals
the Nexus 6 feet is another device
that's compelling especially now with
Android n and if you're in the market
there are a few retailers that are
offering it in deals but the most
compelling one is 419 bucks again it
depends on the retailer you can learn
more details in the links to the
description and speaking of the maker of
the Nexus 6p Huawei CEO is recently in
an interview with The Wall Street
Journal and he teased that there is this
very interesting high-end device being
built for later this year probably the
fall and probably one of the most
interesting things that he mentioned
during the interview is the fact that
this device will be daydream VR
compatible so it makes us wonder if
current hardware will be compatible as
we heard the Google's guy in charge of
the project saying that there might be
an issue with that we will keep you
posted as we learn more going forward
now when it comes to the official
announcements of Samsung just made it
official their gear fit to in addition
to its iconix head buds obviously in the
case of the icon x we're talking about a
fitness focus air buds that will bring
you a lot of bass according to Samsung
and will work in the pendant with wires
which is great but in the case of the
gear fit to this is rather interesting
because it's what the gear fit should
have always been it's got a built-in GPS
in addition to storage free to add music
and you also have a permanent heart rate
sensor and monitor not just what we had
with the gear fit we will tell you more
as soon as the product
rise for our review and finally the very
interesting rumors today have to do with
some leaked schematics of the galaxy
note 7 or galaxy note 6 that show us
what the design will be like in a full
video that you can see in the link in
the description it shows us pretty much
the galaxy note 5 from the back with
some thick linings on the sides and then
we've got some curved edges at the front
and a display that looks like if it had
no bezels the device looks gorgeous in
my opinion but hey it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about this design I mean do you like the
fact that it looks a lot like the galaxy
note 5 just with the curve edges at the
front in my case I do i do like it a lot
but we would love to know your opinion
in the comments down below friends you

these news earlier before the video was
