with smartphones today their phone is
either too big or slippery for regular
sized hands or some companies ignore
design efficiency with large bezels or
my least favorite which is a beautiful
phone marred by sluggish software the LD
g6 tries to be none of these things and
I've decided to spend the week to see if
the company has succeeded I'm high
memory better with pocket now and let's
dive into our initial impressions final
impressions are still pending as all of
our LG G 6 units are still first look
prototypes and that's actually what's
most striking about using these devices
as none of them feel like unfinished
products the best describe this phone
we'd have to reminisce over how much we
still talk about the old LG g2 even
today it was the first phone to bring a
phablet experience into smartphone
ergonomics and the d6 embodies every bit
of what made that legacy phone popular
one of my favorite things about using
this phone for a week is the feel the
thick metallic trim on the sides
provides a pleasant layer to hold the
glass back feels grippy and the ice
platinum finish hides fingerprints like
a champ the best of all I'm really
liking how LG addresses ergonomics at
least for the most part fitting a
narrower panel on this body has made it
easy to reach buttons across a display
and little things like allowing you to
call on the notification shade with a
navigation button continue to be genius
about the only thing I changes the other
options which are for a qslide button or
for capture a menu button would be far
more convenient on a display this tall
come on LG you know you can do this and
speaking of software as unfinished as it
is this phone behaves just fine the
Snapdragon 801 underneath have handled a
week of intensive use without a stutter
this one cleaning feature this oddly
claimed this phone to be quite a ram hog
but I don't seem to find this struggling
anywhere and as for the common lack of
stock Android I'm not real
a fan of LG's UI from a design
perspective but it just pulls some stock
elements and it gets the job done the
main reason I've decided to stick to a
smaller UI on larger text as much as I
hate how small the icons become is
mainly because of the way the navigation
buttons pick up more space the larger
the user interface becomes which is
unnecessary and on that note alright
wish LG would adjust sixteen by nine
video to take up more space on the left
and not hide the navigation buttons you
know just to avoid these insane pillar
boxes on the left and right now not
everything is feedback positive notes
are definitely this always on display
which I find to be one of the most
useful I also love how well this phone
picks up on the Google assistants just
do as a favor LG and give us a quick way
to access the Google feed which I
couldn't find any other way to activate
but from the widget I've been using the
LG G 6 as my daily driver between
Barcelona Rome and New York City so far
battery life has proven to be good and
it's always great to find wireless
charging onboard though I noticed that
this unit doesn't really support faster
charging that we see from other
competitors even on these competitors
pads and as for phone calls the phone
has behaved admirably with callers
claiming a lot of clarity on their end
now have you been following me on
Instagram and if you're not I would
really appreciate it if you did you'll
notice that I chose the LG G 6 is my
primary camera in my recent visit to the
Vatican and this is all the while
carrying my sony a6300 why well because
as I'm finished as this phone is this
camera just rocks there is only so much
you can show on a standard smartphone
camera lens
so this wide-angle lens on the g6 proved
to be perfect for the task I love that
LG has decided to crop the field of view
220 degrees on the wide-angle leading to
less barrel distortion
I will admit though for the case of
video I just decide to use the b20
instead of the g6 mainly because the g6
video still seems to be a little grainy
especially in low light and again that
makes sense because this is still a
prototype and that's what's most
important to remember this is not a
final review there is still more to test
and there is still more to compare once
our final review unit arrives what I can
tell you today is that LG is really onto
something here
this phone has sought out to solve
specific needs in a very smart way so
much so that I'm kind of sold on it
after my brief time with it and while
that final review unit arrives make sure
you follow us on social media and
subscribe to our channel for more videos
like this one you can also follow me on
Twitter hi now to squat to be better on
into the ground at high marry meta
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I am hind
everything I think so much for watching
we'll see you on the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
