PocketNow in which I made the case that
smartphones were getting so big they
could serve for some as tablet
replacements
since then devices have only swelled in
size exceeding even the made-up phablets
category of phone tablet crossovers and
two of the most noteworthy entrance to
that new space are with us today so
let's bring them together and see how
they compare I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is HTC One max versus
Sony Xperia Z ultra we've already given
both of these devices the full review
treatment here at PocketNow so if you
want more detail and what it's like to
own each of these phones check those
reviews out on our channel page also be
sure to follow PocketNow at the online
watering hole of your choice so you
don't miss future reviews and
comparisons normally we kick off these
head-to-head contests with a build
discussion but an equally striking
difference in this case is found in
software so let's hit that department
first both of these phones run a
variation of Android jelly bean but the
third-party UI is running atop those
Android builds take entirely different
paths to delivering a unique user
experience both skins are very classy
and modern in their understated greys
and flat details and they each offer
fluid responsiveness with little to no
lag which we love but the Z ultra comes
pre-loaded with various titles that plug
into Sony's ecosystem like the Sony
select app hub and the branded offerings
like the Walkman media player and
PlayStation mobile gaming and so on
there's also something we love to see on
a device as huge as this a utility for
taking advantage of all that display
acreage Sony's small apps use a windowed
approach that we don't like quite as
well as Samsung's split-screen
multitasking but they still come in
handy from time to time and the ability
to download new ones or build your own
even is a very nice touch
you're not going to find any of that on
the one max HTC's device delivers a much
more familiar experience if you're used
to the original HTC One a really any
conventional Android phone the company
was interested only in porting the
experience of the original one to the
larger screen when it designed the max
so you're really just dealing with HTC
Sense 5.5 here we like the nice touches
like blinkfeed and the excellent gallery
and UI experience but the fact that
there's almost nothing here taking
advantage of the large display canvas is
pretty underwhelming next to the Z ultra
which is capable of comfortably
accommodating quite a few more apps and
widgets on its home screens let's talk
some more about the physical size of
those screens themselves as we pivot
into hardware well each is a 1080p panel
the six point four inch triluminos
display on the Z ultra Dwarfs even the
massive 5.9 inch s LCD 3 on the HTC One
Maxx and importantly it's just as
gorgeous in fact since we updated the Z
ultra software it's tough to tell the
difference in quality between these
panels in a dark room blacks are a
little deeper on the Z ultra while
White's seemed unnaturally warm next to
the One Maxx but these are tiny
differences you'll only notice if you're
looking for them the Z ultra has come a
long way since we first reviewed it and
Sony is to be commended for the software
tweaks that made that possible both
screens are excellent the casings
surrounding those displays though aren't
even in the same neighborhood the One
Maxx may have smartphone proportions but
it's a tank like beast an aluminum slab
measuring ten point three millimeters
thick and resembling the one mini with
its added reliance on plastic on the
other side the Z ultra more closely
resembles its tablet counterpart than
any of Sony's smart phones with a wider
body squared off corners and a thickness
of only six point five millimeters the
comparative fragility of the glass which
does scratch easily is offset by the Z
ultras water and dust resistance
impressive ruggedness for
so slim large as it is in the hand the Z
ultra is also aesthetically stunning
next to the one Max's more conventional
bigness looking beneath the casings
reveals more evidence of the Z ultras
bolder ambitions
remember HTC was just going for a bigger
phone with the One Maxx and as such it's
got a snapdragon 600 aboard powerful to
be sure but not as powerful as the zeal
triste Snapdragon 800 each offers
expandable storage via microSD and a non
removable battery though with the one
maxes coming in slightly larger than
Sony's and elsewhere the feature load is
comparable unless you want to change
your TV channels with your phone or
awkwardly unlock your phone with a
fingertip in which case you need to
stick with the One Maxx the added boost
of the Snapdragon 800 with its more
powerful GPU means some high intensity
games will function more smoothly on the
Z ultra but neither of these phones are
likely to disappoint most users in that
arena it's in areas like acoustics where
the Z ultra finally starts to lose some
ground its lone speaker very quiet and
tinny up against the hurricane onslaught
of HTC boomsound
that translates to the voice experience
as well with callers telling us the Sony
device made us sound significantly more
muddled than the one max also muddled
the camera situation we hate to say it
but choosing which camera we like
between these devices is definitely a
lesser of two evils situation the four
megapixel HTC camera is lower in
resolution than the eight megapixel
Exmor RS sensor on the Sony but it tends
to overcorrect for exposure issues when
using tap to focus much as the Sony
camera overcorrects in terms of white
balance rendering everything a little
cooler than it should be sometimes
that's a good thing
the HTC images seeming a little warmer
than necessary next to the starker sony
shots but get these things into a low
light situation and the one max shines
next to the Z ultras over processed slop
but then go ahead and choose another
low-light situation in different
conditions and watch those results get
flipped on their head inconsistency
seems to be the name of the game when
comparing these shooters the only thing
we're sure of is that neither would be
our first choice for a night or even a
day out on the town
fortunately we'd probably have plenty of
juice for test shots on each though the
battery endurance between these devices
is comparable and almost uniformly
excellent to tie a bow on it we're left
with the notion that how you feel about
these products depends mainly on whether
you're looking for an oversized phone or
an undersized tablet if it's the former
you're almost certainly going to prefer
the one max with its acoustic
superiority greater simplicity and
slightly better one-handed usability if
on the other hand you're looking for a
tablet that's been shrunken down to
pocketable size and barely look no
further than the Z ultra its software
utility resistance to the elements and
beautiful industrial design are a potent
combination that makes it the more
capable device overall a fact that makes
looking ridiculous while talking on it
more than worth it in our view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
