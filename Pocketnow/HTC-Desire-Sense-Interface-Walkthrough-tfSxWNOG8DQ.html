and this is a look at the new sense
interface for the Android based HTC
Desire we've already seen this new sense
interface on the HTC legend but the
designer makes the experience much
better because it has a faster processor
more RAM and a much higher resolution
screen 800 down and 480 across compared
to the legend which is 480 down and 320
across so let's zoom in on the screen a
little bit and we're going to talk about
these various widgets and various home
screens and you get to see how they
actually perform we're also going to
look at that new leap feature which lets
you go from the first home screen all
the way to the last within a quick
second okay so right now we have a
widget configuration that is called
travel it's from HTC you can flip to the
right and to the left see the various
widgets but I'm going to go back to the
center here and show you a really cool
way widget configuration that I came up
with I'm going to go into menu click on
scenes and go to best layout ever and
it's gonna load up okay and a new
background should apply and take a look
at this background this is one of the
wide wallpapers that you get in Android
2.1
but it's exclusive to HTC devices it's
actually called HTC Sense let me show
you what it looks like if I go to
wallpaper here and live wallpaper you
can see that HTC Sense live wallpaper
has been added now this does use up a
little bit of battery life but I think
it's worth it it's just beautiful to
have the colors sort of moving in the
background and as you slide to the left
and slide to the right the colors will
change just as if you were to have a
static background so let's talk about
some of these widgets so that I've put
on the scene that I call best layout
ever so here at the clock and of course
I can tap on the clock and I'll get this
beautiful HTC Sense like interface and I
can set the alarm and everything like
that let's go back I can tap on the
weather there to get the weather in my
area let's go back home and if I turn
off the device turn it back on you
should see a weather animation based on
the conditions there it goes this comes
from the hd2 where you can see clouds or
you see raindrops or you see snowflakes
depending on what the weather is in your
area so it's great that they brought
that
back to back to their Android devices
right here I've got a little widget for
my next calendar appointment today's tax
day I hope you filed your taxes if
you're in the u.s. tapping on that will
bring me into my calendar and I can from
here add a reminder delete the event or
share and so on down here I've got some
quick links to things that I things that
I do on a regular basis so I like to
check the battery use to see what is
using my battery life go back home I
like to go to pocket now calm I like to
call Alanna and I like to use the
xda-developers application so just
things that are within reach if I go
over to the left I'm taken to my text
messaging widget and this is really nice
looking so I can flip through with my
finger I can see the text message I can
see the picture of the person if there
is one and I can reply right from the
screen or go to my text messaging list
or even deleted over there in the corner
then I can go to this widget which is
for Twitter and it's going to take a
second to load because I just turned on
my device after leaving it off for a
little bit and I can flick through and
see all of my different tweets or I can
tap on where it says Twitter and should
we're actually the arrow and it will
take me into the Twitter peak
application which is HTC's full-fledged
Twitter client and I can slide to the
right to get this really nice HTC Sense
interface I can see my mentions my
direct messages and so forth all in
beautiful 800 by 480 resolution let's go
back and all the way to the left
I have a picture carousel here and I can
flick through and see all the pictures
on my device now let's say I want to get
back to the center screen well in older
HTC Sense you would have to go to the
right like this and then you would get
back to the center or you could actually
press the home button but let's say I
want to jump all the way to the right
new gesture called leap you pinch and
then you can tap all the way to the
right I can do that again and I'll go
back to where I was before I find myself
using this a lot it's a very very fast
way to jump around from home screen to
home screen additionally another way to
use this is by tapping the home screen
when home screen button when you're on
the home screen and you get the little
leap view okay now that we're back in
the center let's go to the right and see
the widgets that I have on the right so
over here I've gotten mail and I can
flick through my mail and see what's
going on
so the right I have really a lot of
different things going on here I've got
two stocks that I'm watching up here and
right now they're updating and I'll wait
a second till they update there they go
so I can tap on one of them and I get
into the stock screen and the stock
screen is made by HTC so it has that
fantastic Sense interface built right in
also I have quick switches for Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS and I can go into airplane
mode and then I have some links to some
things that I go to an irregular basis
so Facebook and Opera Mini the internet
browser camera a cool game called raging
thunder and of course Google Maps over
there swiping to the right I get
favorite people so I can quickly dial
and so what I typically do is say I'm on
the home screen and I want to quickly
dial someone I pinch tap and tap again
then i dial the person and over to the
right well it looks like we're actually
all the way over to the right so that is
how I have my widget set up and let's go
to one of these and delete one of these
widgets and see all of the other widgets
to see how they look in this beautiful
800 by 480 resolution somewhat it's
happen hold go to widgets then we look
for ones that are made by HTC because
they're always much better we have the
friend stream which will pull from a
variety of social networks we have
footprints which you've seen before the
music widget you've got to get a few
choices for this you get this full
screen look or the small look let's go
full screen and I can press play it
plays music if I tap on the album I I'm
taken into the extended HTC music
application which is really fantastic it
has album art you can go over to the the
library view here and get again this
fantastic Sense interface congruent
throughout the entire operating system
so I'm going to go back to the music
widget and delete it and let's see what
else will we see what else we have here
all of these widgets are the same that
you get on the HTC legend so you've
probably seen these before if you seen
the ledge in the video we can add a
stock's widget Twitter we can add one
just for weather and we can add one of
three different widget styles kind of
medium-sized very small or large let's
go with the the medium-sized and current
location so it knows where you are and
you can tap it and drag it around really
a fantastic array of widgets and I love
the way that you can pinch to go to any
of this of the screens and as you can
see from using these widgets the device
is not slowing down something that I
found on the legend to be the case is
that after adding so many widgets the
device would get quite slow but that is
not the case on this device so I think
that the story here is that the widget
experience is so good on the HTC Desire
that I really don't go into applications
anymore but rarely the widgets are so
functional so useful and so well
performing that I spend all of my time
on these home screens which means that I
can zip around extremely fast with a
huge level of ease so coming up soon
we're going to talk about the web
browsing experience compared it to the
iPhone and to the HTC hd2 if you like
this video be sure to give it a thumbs
up and we'll be back soon with more on
the HTC Desire that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
