now calm and i just installed the new
HTC youtube app so here it is I haven't
even opened it yet so this is going to
be first time experience for me too so
let's find it da da da and I think it's
going to be this one here we are that
was pretty quick so we have searched
most viewed most discussed top-rated
lots of menu items settings we can show
time filter video quality that's really
nice and over here we got it's going to
download some stuff most viewed I can do
more
pretty nice let's move over most
discussed that's cool top rated we see
it's a black background with a red
YouTube logo at the top that's pretty
cool and now let's see if we can search
and let me see if I can type
no videos found all right let's just
take one of these thin I'm not connected
to Wi-Fi so this is downloading alert 3g
especially glare here she looks like a
resizing button and I can change to low
quality or high quality right there and
if I pause it just pauses there's no
other information and that closes it so
if we do that I there's how we get more
information I can share it and that'll
go to email we got related videos and
back to detail I don't see any way to
view comments that's okay but overall
we're looking at a pretty nice new
youtube app here from HTC think that's
pretty much it if you enjoyed the video
give us a thumbs up that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
