Google i/o 2013 is already on schedule
and no kiss following some desperate
measures to stay afloat I'm high Meadow
iveta doing that whole to route or not
to route the bait on my mind and this is
parking out daily that's right the
Mayans haven't even done their thing and
Google has already scheduled there I 0
of n 4 2013 so set your calendars for
May fifteenth and 17 for Google will
unveil what we hope to be there next
Nexus line of aside from their new
versions of Android now this historical
event has been in point because this
year we got the nexus 7 and next year
we're hoping for a new Nexus 5 that's
better than the nexus 4 we got this year
speed of the nexus for the cyanogenmod
team has been hard at work and we've
already got version 10.1 running on the
Nexus 4 make sure you watch Joe's video
for the full detailed walkthrough on
what to do we've also got a nightly
coming for the nexus 10 will also keep
you posted on that one and it seems that
the nexus 4 is now going to be on sale
soon and the Google's Play Store in
Europe even though we just hope that
they last more than eight minutes trying
to sell that thing even if people don't
really like it that much recent rumors
have facebook trying to buy the whatsapp
messenger service that we all use but in
recent moves today Facebook has updated
their messenger application and you no
longer need a Facebook account to use it
you can only use your phone number and
your name so it does seem like a
Facebook is trying to compete against
whatsapp could it be the whatsapp then
want to get bought and Facebook is
trying to retaliate we'll know very soon
as whatsapp goes bankrupt Android 4.1
point one jellybean is finally making
the scene for some us variant devices
for example a samsung galaxy s3 on AT&amp;amp;T
is finally getting it though you need
the keys PC application to be able to
download it on the other hand we've got
the motorola droid razr HD in the droid
razr HD max both getting android 4.1
jelly bean so just make sure you hit
software update because i definitely did
recently and finally for the saturn
alarming news of the day nokia sold
their nokia house in Finland as part of
their economical measures to stay
economically afloat for 220 million
dollars
they're still running the place because
obviously it's hard to find somebody
else to rent such a big complex but it
does seem as if Nokia's doing some
alternate things to remain afloat
economically and you wonder if they're
doing the right things in their core
business which is selling phones so that
leads me to the question of the day if
you were the nokia CEO for a day you'll
probably need more than a day to fix
that thing what would you do to fix the
company in my case I'd probably adopt me
go again or definitely adopt Android I
leave windows phone is part of the
platform profile but not as the only way
to stay afloat but leave us a comment
down below what would you do and if you
want an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tablet world make sure you follow us on
paka now calm please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hina Ravenna thanks for watching see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
