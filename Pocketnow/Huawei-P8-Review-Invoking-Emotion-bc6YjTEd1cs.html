if huawei made Nexus and this just might
be our very first taste of it
I'm hi out to Houston bringing you
pocket now full video review of the
Huawei p8 here in the states while ways
primarily known for making budget
handsets targeted at the prepaid market
the p8 is anything but that dropping the
ascend brand-name found on most high-end
Huawei phones the p8 is the company's
latest flagship device and a showcase of
exactly what it's capable of from the
aluminum chassis and beveled edges to
the ultra-thin design it looks and feels
a lot like the Sony Xperia z3 or the
iPhone 5 and like those two devices
there's no denying that this is a
beautiful well-built handset
it weighs a comfortable 144 grams and
it's just six point four millimeters
thick the phone's 5.2 inch 1080p display
is an IPS panel coded and Gorilla Glass
3 with fantastic viewing angles and good
color reproduction though it's certainly
not the brightest or most vivid panel
we've seen so it looks great and can be
seen in fairly well in harsh sunlight
above the display sits the eight
megapixel front facing camera the
earpiece speaker and the ambient light
sensor the hardware controls for the p8
set along the right-hand side consisting
of just a volume rocker and a power
button and there are ejectable trays for
microSD and nano SIM cards here as well
especially given its physical
similarities to the Xperia z3 I would
have loved to have seen a two-step
camera button thrown in here but that's
just a minor complaint for the
outstanding Hardware there's a headphone
jack and a pinhole microphone at the top
of the PA and speaker and microphone
grilles on the bottom surrounding the
happiest microUSB port we've ever seen
seriously this might be my favorite
thing about the phone around back we see
hallways logo and the 13 megapixel
primary camera and F 2.0 Sony RGB W
sensor with optical image stabilization
and a dual tone LED flash the p8 runs
Huawei's custom emotion UI 3.1 on top of
Android 5.0 lollipop it's pretty far
from the typical Android experience
we're used to seeing but if you've used
a high-end Huawei phone like the ascend
mate 7 this isn't much differ
there's no app drawer on the home screen
but you can always sort your apps with
folders and anything you can't find you
can pull down anywhere in the home
screen to search through apps contacts
messages and more in the unified search
bar there's also a search bar in the
settings menu because there are so many
options here that it's hard not to get a
little overwhelmed along with the
standard settings hallway offers options
like one-handed UI motion controls and
so on
we like the constantly changing
wallpapers each time you turn on the
display and the lock screens quick
toggles are reminiscent of Apple's
control center overall it's a pretty
good software experience but it's not
without its quirks there's a new knuckle
sensing feature that's supposed to make
taking screenshots quick and easy just
draw a box with your knuckle to capture
a part of the screen or not twice for a
full screen shot but all too often the
p8 seem to have trouble differentiating
my knuckle for my finger and the result
was way too many screenshots and missed
touch input there's also the way emotion
UI handles Google notifications
particularly from Gmail where the
subject line is an illegible dark gray
font over a black background speaking of
Google notifications if you wanted to
use your Android wear SmartWatch with
the PA you might be out of luck
something about the way the software
handles notifications keeps the wear app
from running properly and I couldn't get
it to work for more than a few minutes
with my Moto 360 with two quad-core
processors and three gigabytes of RAM in
its disposal it's no surprise that the
p8 flies through just about any task you
put it to it's pretty tough to trip up
with normal use and even with demanding
tasks like streaming high-res video or
playing games you won't see much
hesitation the media does have its
troubles elsewhere while performance is
fine the speaker is tinny and though it
gets plenty loud it's easily muffled by
the hand the battery life also takes a
major toll here I was able to get over
five hours of screen on time on days of
just scrolling through Twitter and
responding to emails and texts but even
just opening YouTube for a short while I
brought my average screen on time down
to about two and a half hours
the 13 megapixel camera is pretty good
with varying shooting modes and decent
manual controls it takes reasonably
sharp photos even in low-light and
colors are fairly well balanced too
although nothing really seems to pop at
you always included a quick shutter that
allows you to double press the volume
down key when the display is off to
immediately launch the camera and snap a
photo though this means that you can't
frame the shot or focus on the subject
beforehand but what really impressed me
was how well the additional shooting
modes worked like the LG g4 the PA has a
few long exposure settings called light
painting
I tried silky water on this miniature
waterfall and the result actually looks
quite nice there's also panorama mode
which does an excellent job at stitching
together each angle you capture so long
as you have a steady hand video also
looks good thanks to the p8 s included
oh is but keep in mind that there's no
option for 4k or slow-motion just 30
frame 1080p call quality in our testing
around the Indianapolis Metropolitan
Area sounded good for both ends of the
call and it's even pretty good on
speakerphone the only network problem we
ran into with the p8 was its lack of LTE
compatibility in the States so 4G will
have to do but that's slightly offset by
all of Huawei's antenna optimizations
the p8 connects to a network 33% faster
at boot up than its fastest competition
and it intelligently switches you
between your mobile and Wi-Fi networks
depending on which connection is the
strongest the pH gorgeous hardware is
paired with powerful specs speedy
performance a reliable camera and is
somewhat lacking software experience
that leaves us thinking that Nexus
version would be outstanding but until
then always version is still a good buy
for the right kind of user just so long
as you don't use Android wear
