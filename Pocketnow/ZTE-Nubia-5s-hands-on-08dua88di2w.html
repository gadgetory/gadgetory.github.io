at CES 2014 at the CTE booth ZTE a brand
you may not immediately associate with
smartphones in the united states that's
something the company is looking to
change going forward and we're gonna
check out one of the leading instruments
of that effort the ZTE Nubia 5s so first
glance the 5s looks a whole lot like its
predecessor the the Nubia 5 which Jaime
Rivera reviewed for us not very long ago
this device is in white it is available
in white and black you can see this
glossy finish here the dual stereo
speakers down below in the hand the most
interesting thing about the device when
you first pick it up is it's all
mobility I mean yes it has some of these
narrow radius corners down here but it's
not at all sharp feels very comfortable
in the palm and yeah this is gonna pick
up some grease it's gonna get really
literally fingerprint II but it's still
fairly fairly comfortable and the first
one of the first things you notice of
course this hardware camera key here I'm
gonna get back to that in a second
because this camera is one of the most
important features of the device the top
around to the front just talk about the
basics real quick it's powered by a
Snapdragon 800 processor
it weighs 126 grams is actually a lot
lighter than anything else or a lot of
other devices of its class but it
doesn't feel cheap at all put it down so
you can kind of take a look at it on the
table they're two gigs of RAM backing up
that Snapdragon 800 2300 milliamp hour
battery within that display you're
looking at it is a 5-inch 1080p display
protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 of
course
of course none of the UI customizations
are at all as interesting as what's
around back the camera on this device is
13 megapixels it is the Sony sensor
underneath the hump there this is Exmor
RS an aperture of f28 oh but the
distinctive thing here something we're
becoming used to seeing on high-end
devices that Lowell humph implies oh is
optical image stabilization of course
meaning Hardware stabilization we pop it
around back here with fire up the
viewfinder jump into the camera always
love to see that hardware camera key
we'll see if we can take a shot of our
chi energy bar there half press to focus
full press to snap a little bit of a
shadow a little bit of a hand and that's
a wonderful thing to see but okay
there's nothing terribly special in
automatic mode but you hop into pro mode
and you get kind of sorry a double tap
there that's my fault
up into pro mode and you get kind of a
interesting heads-up display first of
all you've got an artificial horizon
which I've been wanting on smartphone
shooters for a very long time to make
sure you're taking a good shot
especially if you have a horizon in the
shot you can't really tell whether it's
even or not or even if you don't ever
horizon in the shot whatever it's a good
thing to have but the really awesome
thing are these independently
controllable icons which means which
controls white balance focus and
exposure all of them independent you can
link them together yes you can also
control them independently if you want
to which might be useful in an
environment like this with constantly
changing lighting conditions this is
really awesome it is not the end of the
camera customizations in the viewfinder
but it is certainly one of the most
distinctive and this software suite may
come to other Android devices in the
future there's a multitasking view and
we want to get out of the camera give
this toss it right off the top of the
screen this is a quick look at the ZTE
Nubia 5 we don't know anything on
release plans on pricing and all that
will be determined at a later date this
is pre-production hardware and software
but it is probably one of the more
interesting things we've seen thus far
it's a yes look forward seeing more PCT
Michael Fisher Toni and Taylor are
behind the camera make it a ZTE for the
early look and we'll stay tuned for CES
videos we're making more of them
let's end this video before I keep
talking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
