now Tony behind the camera we're at MWC
2013 still and we are checking out the
new Sony Xperia tablet Z now before we
get into the software here we just want
to look at this hardware we don't have a
measurement in front of us on the spec
sheet but this is incredibly thin and
light for a for a 10-inch tablet and
this is a 10.1 inch reality display
we'll get to that in a second but this
is a soft it's not quite soft touch
coating on the back it's more like a
like a really expensive the countertop
or something like that but absolutely
can't overstate just how light this is
it's almost hard to believe I'm holding
a 10-inch tablet on the left side of the
device we have our standby button a lot
of the design cues here echo those of
the Xperia Z smartphone power standby
button and volume rocker there you can
see a little flap flaps and all we have
the return of the flap for your
headphone jack so I'm here actually
that's the charging port these are
charging terminals some information
about the units some speaker ports but
otherwise everything just held you know
everything hidden very very nicely maybe
a microphone up top here and of course
the Xperia branding on the back this is
an 8 megapixel 8.1 megapixel camera with
Exmoor our HDR for photos there is a 2
megapixel front camera
there's the Sony branding there and a 6
thousand milliamp hour battery powering
at all even though it is so thin and
light go ahead and power on the display
and you can see possible hopefully it
reads on the video just how absolutely
gorgeous this display is from the front
and there's of course a stock summary
background but once you get a little bit
off angle here and you'll notice you do
delve into some Gray's here it's
obviously not a it's a it's a temporary
one inch reality display at 1920 by 1200
resolution obviously not AMOLED or
something because you're not seeing the
deepest blacks in the world similar to
what we saw once again on the Xperia Z
smartphone this is running Android 4.1.2
like like an off
a lot of tablets are nowadays with
Sony's custom skin over the top of it
take a brief look at this skin we'll
just hop on back out of here and we'll
go back to the home screen
obviously configurable home screens some
widgets here if you want to press and
hold we can do that we can see the
outline of all the home screens here
apps widgets wallpapers and so forth
there's also support for themes just as
you might expect from Sony all of this
has done up in a really wonderful
minimalistic look that's that's not
anywhere near the Metro design language
from Microsoft is just something very
very different it doesn't even look like
Android at points until you hop into
something like like the app drawer but
just the beauty of the software is
absolutely matching the beauty of the of
the hardware as someone who as someone
who doesn't carry 10-inch tablets very
often this is one I would definitely
consider picking up just on the merits
of this pass alone and we should mention
while I'm thinking of it here that this
device also comes with an aluminum
colored bezel in addition to the black
that we see here and on the back that's
just very very clean isn't it there is
NFC aboard so these might talk to each
other I'm not entirely sure these are
the two available colors with the Xperia
tablet Z which we're going to be taking
more of a look at as the days go by and
certainly this will not be the last time
you see one of these in our hands
Michael with pocket now tell me behind
the camera MWC 2013 at Sony thanks for
watching stay tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
