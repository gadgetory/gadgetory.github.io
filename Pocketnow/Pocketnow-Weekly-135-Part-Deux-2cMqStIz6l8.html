emergency part 2 of the pocket net
weekly you will not believe what
happened folks if you're just watching
this video you want some context you
want to know why all the fancy stuff
isn't happening well everything broke
and things caught on fire someone died
probably somewhere in some server for ya
far away and it is not at all guaranteed
that this will continue to work we had a
board failure and then I googled kicked
me out in the middle of a live hangout
it decided to challenge my
authentication do it which triggered the
two-factor authentication which means
that I was waiting for a text I was
waiting for a text message should show
up on my phone of course the phone
doesn't have any reception the studio
said to go upstairs and the phone
decided just not to connect to the
cellular network until we were back here
and I hit the button i started this one
and then i got my confirmation text from
google so sorry about the mess everyone
sorry to those of you who that we have
no viewers right now we have no no live
viewers but later in bernal hill stack
up on youtube and we'll see how it goes
so very sorry yes i will tweet it once
you you guys tell me where you were when
i had to go spend 20 minutes on the
sidewalk waiting for a text message what
you guys can finish talking about the
motorola valentine's day sale very good
then cam are you are you still are you
still with us in this in this roughshod
amateur still I still ready bush league
bullshit you know you know William we in
Britain pride ourselves on doing things
adequately or slightly less than
adequately well that's what well that's
exactly what's happening on today's
episode of the partner with yourself
folks and let's move right on and if
we're done talking my motorola let's
move on to whatever the hell the next
thing is on the run down samsung samsung
is gonna be the new galaxy phone who
knew so what does the start we have a
way of a render which always is just the
most exciting thing they're getting more
interesting yeah they know they are and
I actually do like renders a little
better than I like leaked photos so just
even tell us what's cool what's going on
as I tweet the link to the new show sure
um we've been seeing a rush lately of
renders non officially source but based
off of informations already been leaked
based on pics based on schematics and
very talented 3d designers are putting
together these renders that are going to
give us probably the the best idea we
have so far of what these models are
going to look like they may be often
this is again it's based on information
that's not official to begin with but
they look pretty polished we saw some
really cool HTC One m9 ones the other
day and then those are follow it up
shortly thereafter by a new galaxy s6
render now we've seen a lot of galaxy s6
renders thanks to case makers those are
often covered up though you didn't know
we've seen some of transparent cases
look pretty good but this latest render
it's a little bit different I mean
little bit different than some of those
earlier ones it's based on a more
recently provided set of schematics and
it's just showing a little bit of
differentiation the only things I
noticed really were some moving around
of the the proc sensors up top and the
home button look has been constantly
changing no one really seems sure what
to make of this home button this new
ones a little bit larger than we saw
before at least be taller larger and
kind of squatter looking assumably we
have another fingerprint sensor embedded
in there but it looks pretty nice you
still have that kind of prominent camera
out back getting past the otherwise flat
exterior and it does seem to be more
pronounced than it was on the the galaxy
s5 but I guess we can live with it um
it's also this one doesn't show us the
actually I wanted to show us the
underneath you a little bit
and yeah it's kind of ripping off the
iphone 6 but yeah I can live with that I
in a hater what do you guys think of
this new look I mean as far as I'm
concerned Stephen this is not at all
surprised nothing about this is a
surprise to me it looks a lot like a
samsung phone it looks like it looks
reasonably classy I don't know if I'm
there's nothing here for me to complain
about rejoice in or otherwise comment on
it just looks like what that's out
galaxy s6 would look like it's painfully
predictable I mean and it's not people
are going to second dog and Samsung I'm
not it's just this is what happens when
you have a manufacturer going into its
sixth iteration of an increasingly
homogenized category like ah it's yeah
whatever it's whatever if this render is
it all accurate camp what's the word
it's so obviously with it being metal
it's going to be a bit more solid than
last generation from a design standpoint
it looks like a galaxy device okay I
don't know that's a bad thing or a good
thing we'll see when we go looks like
this the band-aid design isn't coming
back so that's simply you know what you
like me you like sugar the guy either
died having someone I know I I saw the
blue the electric blue with the dots and
I just thought it'd look really cool oh
i mean i'll give you the electric blue
yeah yeah the electric blue wasn't you
know when um when they reduced the scale
of the of the dots for the galaxy alpha
when it was much more of a stipple a
very subtle stipple and not so much the
golf-ball dimples oh my god that that
looked tremendously great so maybe we'll
see something similar on this this new
one yeah right yeah I wouldn't help the
things we've seen so far this is based
on I don't think that the texture is
very set in stone this seems were based
on measurements and and layout things
than actual material so this is very
well could be one of the loosest parts
of this particular render but
it's a lead I think the one thing that
maybe concerns me ever so slightly know
if you look on the back of the render
where the metal chassis or the frame
looks quite rounded at the corners it
worries me that it's not going to be
flush with the back of the with the back
of the phone I'm not sure you know when
you might just catch a hare renewable
something have if you if you have facial
hair what was that phone yo it's just
something you think was I thought it was
a Sony's e3 man everyone's like oh my
god we had so much dust stuck in there
that I cool down it's gonna like it's
like those grates in a bridge it expands
and contracts based on thermal variation
oh no that was the note for then yeah
yeah between the gorilla glass it was a
samsung and the metal bit yeah yeah at
the same time people are complaining
about that and they were complaining
about been gate on the iphone 6 plus
then people found a sony phone like
somebody found a sony phone and did like
an extensive text piece or a way to long
video on how like it traps your hair and
like pulls out your hair when you're
when you're talking the phone with it
and it was just you it was like there
was plenty of news for us to talk about
in the fall but everyone was acting like
there was no anyways and we had to go
find some stuff to complain about on
every phone ever oh my god it was
terrible um while i'm going to this room
seems to be working nicely and i'm gonna
reenlist oh so while I do that I want to
hear about iOS Adam but before we move
on to that I guess melted to comment one
of the stories that came down the
pipeline this morning as we're putting
this podcast together samsung started
teasing the next Galaxy they're not
calling it the galaxy s6 by name get on
social media and it changed its Twitter
user icon to this skwerkel circle inside
icon and it's also shows up in the video
itself but it very much looks like the
camera we see on this guy the circle I
think it's a little bigger in Samsung's
thing but it's it's close i'm pretty
sure that it's going to focus a lot on
camera performance being a major selling
point of the gsx hadn't we heard that
the GS 6 was going to come with a 20
megapixel sensor what was the rest I
came out the other day that was about
Sam
in some of the insider source talking
about the camera on there but I wouldn't
be surprised to go 20 mega know it
follows I mean you know 20 megapixel
sensors are nothing new we've seen them
on the the Lumias we've seen them on the
Sony's and a couple others and you know
it Samsung does like to have substantial
spec pumps to point to when they come
out with a new flagship piece of
hardware and the resident the added
resolution doesn't really hurt anything
and certainly we talk about it is not
being the defining characteristic of a
smartphone camera but it's certainly
great to have if you're trying to do
some digital zoom you know mm-hmm do we
think it's going to affect the dave the
low life capabilities though i mean if
they're pointing to the cameras
abilities than OAS is probably gonna be
bundled in so i'm not worried because
it's big you have to think that there's
some substantial hardware in there can
make this thing jutting out to the
extent that it is that was my first
thought with the the amount that it
actually sticks out it's it's got to be
at least half decent in low light
otherwise they just make it again flush
with the back of the phone wouldn't man
so right or maybe they're just copying
Apple II cuz Apple has a protruding
camera now so I another one of those
things when we had to find things to
complain about like there wasn't any
people news last fall yeah really oh
speaking of Apple what's what's the
story on the larger apps that are
landing in the store that are now
they're not landing yet but are now
authorized for the store and they've
been there apparently that Apple's been
like on the sly letting these in since a
little earlier in the year now it's
formal Apple has raised its limit on App
Store app size from 2 gigabytes to 4
gigabytes that doesn't change anything
about you still have that hundred
megabyte over-the-air limit which some
users are frustrated about would like to
have that choice there's to make rather
than apples whatever you can always find
a Wi-Fi spot later even have to wait
till you're at home but now it's a
possibility to get bigger than ever apps
which it's kind of a double-edged sword
I mean while it allows developers to put
a lot more content in there and to make
you know Microsoft that we're talking
about universal apps this is probably
going to mean some even higher quality
larger high-profile titles for
especially for gaming
you get in the whole pc xbox moving that
so same titles over to the phone if
that's going to be a bigger competitor
in the future Apple wants to have more
high-quality titles of its own so add
four gigabytes gives developers more
room for resources you know characters
textures it's just going to be a richer
experience all around of course this
means if you a smaller phone no you're
going to be hitting the walls of your
storage limits very very quickly so
maybe 60 gigabytes won't be the lowest
option for the next iPhone maybe a 32
gigabyte model will come back as the
minimum but you wanting 128 gigabytes if
you want to be safe even though Apple
will charge you you know your firstborn
son for the the privilege of having a
phone such capacity this reminds me of a
pitch email I got this week to cover a
pc game that's a first-person sci fi
game whose name I don't remember but we
could we didn't we opted not to cover it
because we don't cover pc gaming but I
was like Dan well we didn't yet really
you know I mean I think about it we're
thinking about it so then I would but I
was like oh my god if you guys did a
mobile port of this i would love to
cover this and they said that that's in
their plans so okay cool but it just
puts me in mind of that cuz that looked
like a very graphically demanding title
and i was like you know we're seeing
more and more advanced games and mobile
so this makes all the sense in the
worlds of four gig lemon in just 2 i'll
bit like you said stephen allow give
developers the you know resources and
the space needed to make higher quality
titles now what are the appli- what are
the capacity limits on other platforms
did we do we know that's like a question
i don't know i don't know either and i
wonder how this affects the i'm often
not often using but I've seen apps where
you download the main app and then the
first time you run it it's got to go and
download crapload of resources from its
server that it puts the focus oh yeah so
20 megabyte download but it balloons to
300 megabytes after it downloads all the
you know the tracks the levels that
whatever have you I wonder how that it
looks like Android expanded their app
size limit to four gigs back in 2012
according to a post on Android
developers dot blogspot
and then there are people who have found
apps that are beyond a 50 meg limitation
for the initial download and then the
expansion apks afterwards so it's its
head for for a while wonder what windows
phone is not that it necessarily matters
much given Menon eggs state of the yeah
given the state of the games uh you know
categories in the Windows Store but look
at him I also have something in December
didn't Apple tell all up and developers
that they had to have 64-bit support
yeah although get in all their out so
that might make a small difference
speaking of other platforms I was trying
to wake up the the a30 here to to be my
podcast assistant and it just snot
waking up right now so every piece of
technology we touch today yeah this is
the technical preview so we expect that
but every piece of tech we touch today
is just breaking all around us I'm
looking at all of my humble bundle
android games here Tennessee but the
largest one is looks like chunking bytes
is the largest one that developers have
been did you ever play Republic
république sorry on ipad that was he
that was a huge download know what was
république about heard should i should
i download this friendly thing I don't
you should it's by a developer called
camouflage and am I think some of the
guys they used to work on things like
Metal Gear Solid on the PlayStation
years ago and it's it's like an
exploration game but graphically it's
quite intense there's a lot of space to
move around in the map it's there's lots
and lots of data and you paid quite a
lot for the initial download and that
got you the first chapter and then you
could pay again to get the next few
episodes so you end up paying maybe
fifteen dollars all in but you get this
huge game that takes up all the space on
your iPad if I ever had if I ever want
to download anything videos or content I
always have to download delete that one
first before I can go and do anything
else it's 1.1 gigs guest for the base
download here yeah and then there's
expandable there's downloadable content
after the initial download yeah
crazy man it's a pickup I gotta add that
to the list after I finally played the
room to which I think I've had on my
device for eight months and haven't
gotten around to playing yet but I got
through that in about two hours I think
oh damn alright well the gauntlet has
been thrown doing tonight let's pivot to
wearables please Android wear is has
there's some metrics on the market today
metrics on the wire today about the
market and these have been released by
analysts and we got it from here or not
seeing more though so kind of let's talk
a little bit about it left out a lot of
details it said that we saw in the past
year in 2014 there were about 4.6
million smart wearables and it uses that
to mean any sort of wrist born he's
wearing your ankles anything it's not a
clip-on design and that can run its own
software or run third party software it
draws a line between wearables like
fitness trackers and and smart luckiest
because sometime that it's a little
blurry where the distinction is there
yeah the ability to and it doesn't
necessarily mean apps that you run
directly on the watch like a full-on
like a watch it runs straight up Android
not Android where it's even counting
things like pebble which are loaded by
the app on the phone onto the watch but
4.6 million of these total which is a
decent number but of them and we where
it sees only making up about 720,000 of
them which is less than 15 or just over
fifteen percent we don't really have a
lot of context because is a very new
market but everyone found that figure a
little surprising i mean granted Android
wear a lot of the really compelling
models like the Moto 360 didn't come out
until you know close to the end of the
year with guesting on every once before
at December there but still 720,000
doesn't sound like a lot no it doesn't
and especially when you consider that
it's not sold but it's shipped yeah yeah
this does not take into account models
that are sitting there on the shelf i
think it was Giga MIT who suggested that
there's a lot of you know Gear Live is
possibly sitting on the shelf at Best
Buy waiting to move for months and
months so
to kneel yeah I was just I was just
gonna say how many of those are things
that Samsung is over prepared for and
just shipped millions of Samsung gear
devices right but but no but your
devices are in a totally different
category though too because that that's
that was the surprising part to me where
I was like you what percentage did we
did we say it was the 720,000 that was a
slow pitch 15 a little over fifty to
eighty five percent of the rest of them
are that's Tizen Tizen yeah really that
many people buying buying ties and smart
watches you of them could be like these
giant Kickstarter's the ones that
actually run full blown android on them
but I can't imagine it's a very large
fraction and I don't have the detailed
breakdown to look at I don't see a lot
of people running around wearing like
Neptune pine yeah merchants you know
awesome sweetie everybody at a tablet
but you know I that that just was
stunning to me because I think of of the
options despite despite androids where's
numerous shortcomings I do think it is
the it is the leading platform right now
in terms of utility in terms of striking
the right balance between utility and
user-friendliness if you have an android
phone of course cam what are you wearing
is that a fitness wearable you've got on
or what this is the up24 the jawbone
it's not a SmartWatch I have a motor in
3d I have a moto 360 over there
somewhere and to pebble steals over
there as well that whatever interest
yeah well the reason out I get one that
was it was faulty the the screen was
wrong and they sent me a replacement and
they never collected the old one so i
have a few Merrill's deals one leather
one metal so why are they not making a
home on your on your wrist cam is it
just you're just not sold on the the
category you don't like those particular
in our guinea sick of them yes like a
charging and what's the deal I love the
Moto 360 but it's I think it's more to
do with the fact that I change phones so
often that I don't want to have to keep
repairing and reconnecting so isn't it
frustrating yeah so I I mean the Moto
360 would normally be on my wrist but it
hasn't been for a few days yeah it's
flat and I haven't bothered to charge it
but that's all it is really yeah gotcha
I've actually woven that in rather
well to my gym to my daily routine like
a guy come home of Zuko we've got a
better drop a phone on the Qi charging
plate and I dropped the Moto 360 on its
own little cheap edisto land it works
out pretty well it would work out even
better if my Moto X had qi wireless
charging because oh yeah that on the Qi
charging plate and it looks nice oh it
doesn't really do anything but it's it's
I don't mind it the only thing time I
mind i think i mentioned last week is
when i go over to stay over my
girlfriend's house here it's a sleepover
with my buddies and i have to bring a
motorola a charger for my for my
SmartWatch which is really anyway I this
is directly related to rumors out of HTC
talking about a new wearable with a
really really funny screen dimension
which says to me I'm probably not going
to care too much about it on account of
maybe it's a fitness band Steven unlock
the mysteries for me heavy so HTC rumors
have been flying for literally years
that it's working on a wearable of some
kind the company acknowledged this that
it would do a wearable when it made
sense when I could do a really good one
last year we saw there was a promotional
video HTC release that made it look like
someone in the cubicle had a very smart
watch looking thing they were working on
companies like none and nothing like
that just yet so now we're wondering if
yet is finally coming around and there
have been numerous suggestions at mwc
will finally be when HTC gets ready to
reveal it it's for a SmartWatch as
that's coming up we're hearing a few
more details and this hardware is
starting to sound less like a SmartWatch
and more like a fitness tracker Ella
Microsoft's efforts so yeah there's that
weird display a very rectangular 32 x
160 pixels which sort of screams to me
fitness and not a square SmartWatch face
and there's talk of accessories like a a
pad that would slide into your shoe kind
of like that old the nike thing for the
ipod what was that call it what they had
a shoe accessory for that thing yet for
the losing like a nike+ fit thing I
don't nobody was cold yeah flipped onto
your shoe to use that say you know
pedometer there yeah okay but something
like that that would but it would be
like an insert that would I don't know
if
is we heard about something a while back
that would like analyze your how you
were walking and try to give you advice
on carrying yourself better I don't
think that's what this is there's no in
yet that it's so advanced but it's very
fitness focused so also probably not an
Android wear device they talked about
this using a real-time operating system
that may be based on Android but not
running Android apps not you know just
probably using the colonel if even that
and not connecting with Android we're
compatible software on your phone this
would be HTC's own no thing and one
reason for that might be to give it
broader a device compatibility we hear
especially likely iOS connection might
be something she's going for here and I
guess that is it might be a way to get
the sails up to a workable level if
we're seeing this you know these android
wear numbers being as low as they are
the fact that you're tied to using there
with an android device may be part of
that granted Apple users are going to be
heavily drawn to the apple watch will
finally start selling in a couple weeks
but if there's a a that's going to be
relatively expensive even for the most
affordable option there it is an apple
product after all but if HTC can do a
really cheap thing it's decent no why
not doing something to consider
especially if it's more lightweight than
the Apple watch this may give iOS users
a reason to consider a product from
another manufacturer yeah I guess the
question will be is there space in
between you know things like the jawbone
or the Fitbit and the Apple watch for
iphone owners who want to buy a wearable
and it will depend on what this what
this wearable from HTC actually offers
if it offers anything if it's if it is
real that screen measurement thing I
mean I think it's possible to make a
good looking device in this form factor
they think the gear fit looked really
good and it felt really good and it
worked really well thank God it's a
weird middle ground here between very
bare bones but very hardware simplistic
fitness trackers ones that don't have
screens but they do have incredible
battery life and they often have great
connectivity options of devices on the
far end you have the smart watches that
are the battery hogs with the big disc
ways that can run a lot of powerful
softer themselves maybe have some
mutations with other devices that can
work with they're just middle ground
with their fitness like fitness tracker
plus they'll have a screen they might
have some extra features on there but
price goes up a lot you start to lose
some of those battery savings and I
don't know if it's a a worst of both
worlds or best of both worlds situation
yeah i think it's it's one of those
things I mean the fitness tracking
market is quite full now but like you
say there's one the area where it's not
full is things like the Fitbit surge
which is a fitness tracker that looks a
bit more like a watch so if that's the
kind of thing that HD are going for
that's got a display that's got it all
the fitness tracking stuff as well then
they haven't really got that much
competition except i guess samsung but
then Samsung products won't work with an
iphone so then it's it might be clever
it might not be clever hey you don't
know we don't know what could be amazing
it's gonna have make a huge difference
here battery life is going to be
something everyone's concerned about I
think until we have those answers and
did I wonder did that come out in this
week I talked about the think you guys
are are overlooking the really
compelling thing about this which is
that is this RT OS is just a rewritten
build of windows RT so you know it's
gonna be really really great yeah way
it's gonna be it's about Lee for windows
phone right this is the show although i
would buy that i would buy an HTC made
Windows Phone wearable in a hot second
but I'm their lifestyles would work
really well on the square screen they
show absolutely just just a little swipe
it's going about something to you guys
I'm I'm looking forward to talking about
that HTC they more rooms I'm so I'm so
I'm just so pissed off still and i need
about our technical problems and i need
something that's going to put me into a
better mood we don't have a sound drop
for it we don't have I don't know if we
have an animation for it I don't know if
we have anything to usher us into this
little corner of our friggin podcast but
it's a segment we've done once before
it's called nerd nostalgia I
love it and this is what we're gonna do
right now let's talk about the past
hellos are you ready because this is the
only thing that's gonna make me happy
right now is thinking back to do that
over a decade ago to when things were
different and simpler and that could
make livejournal.com updates from my
blackberry yeah when Nokia ruled the
world yeah oh yeah indeed okay and palm
together so this is segment folks last
time we had this thing we talked about
amps the advanced mobile phone system or
analog telecommunications that was a lot
of fun this time we're talking about an
era when phones were made to be small
they weren't made to be highly
functional so the most advanced things
you could hope to find in a cell phone
store were you know they were like the
size of like little like maybe um maybe
the droppings of a large raccoon like I
think that was the target cross section
for for us for a mobile phone in the in
the days of the dumb phone because you
wanted it to be as pocketable as
possible but also you had people saying
well I'd like to use my calendar I'd
like to get my rolodex on here I'd like
to do my task list and such such things
and for that you had dedicated devices
called personal digital assistants yes
and he's been our guest and since I
think he is the coolest thing on the air
right now cam Bunton what was your first
PDA and and and how did it change your
life my first PDA I didn't I think it 10
years ago I don't think I actually owned
one but i remember the first one i
actually bought was i think it was an
HTC made device but it was a carrier
branded one it was an MDA vario which
was Windows Mobile one of the first
smartphones yes one of the first yeah no
I mean those windows mobile which was
basically a pocketable version of I
guess windows XP with all of the fiddly
menus of the stylus but recently I
bought this which is the Ericsson r380
and I bought this just because I
remember seeing them at the time
thinking that's really cool and somebody
was selling it on eBay and that is a PDA
in there with a touchscreen and then you
flip it over and it's a it's a regular
mobile phone visible anymore was that
analog sell this is analog yes only and
like not digital at all I don't think
it's digital i'm not sure i think its
analog in it so it's got a flip-down
keyboard like the later p 9 hundreds
would have with a numeric on the outside
and or no just a numeric on the inside
what what what Sonny just outside but if
you look on the on the back of the flip
you see it's got like little buttons but
I've presses down on the screen so in
the black and white of a LCD yeah we
didn't have a back way um I can't tell
wish I remember that one of these kia
said it had like it had a big old black
and white LCD but it had a sweet green
backlight that we have yellow or green
lights around the sides that aren't
really diffuse properly yeah I read
stead of the breakpoints oh man I think
this might be digital I think it may
have out really early I'm not sure it's
some it was way back in the day when
mobile internet was whack and it was
black and white on your screen and you
couldn't really do much with it and it's
like hours to load and nobody really had
a web page right and every time you've
made a request I'm you clicked a link
you'd see the sending and receiving
arrows you go on forever before the
page.reload yesterday yeah but you could
set it had a browser you could send
emails calendar tasks it was a phone and
a little PDA in your pocket now this was
made by ericsson was this before
integrated Wi-Fi chip set because i was
it was the mobile network your only
option for that yes your mobile network
was the only option so you had GPRS or
the mobile network i think you know when
you when you wanted to connect to the
browser i can't really test it now cuz i
never got the settings working but it
actually you shows you like a little
dialing screen it says Kylie like it's
what you have to put a phone number in
the internet settings for it to connect
to in order for you to get in is
basically mobile dial-up yeah I ran into
their own I ran into that when I was
doing the throw back on the on
the clay that's on the screen where it
was like yet has the software for for a
you know a modem connection but doesn't
actually have a moat a minute so you
have to get a modem that has an IR port
or you have to drop the thing into the
cradle then it can dial up yeah yeah
because you could do data through the IR
port on the clear that one doesn't have
its own cellular radio that's correct no
cellular radio no Wi-Fi radio no no
bluetooth I mean that was I know why
either is it this has infrared to what
were you supposed to use it for this was
in a period when this is what we Stephen
this was amazing work in the am i right
yeah in the world like you could carry
it with you throughout the day and
somebody would be like hey meet me for
coffee on Saturday like okay I'm putting
that in my account it's exactly app on
iOS yeah so so you could put it in and
be like okay I got my calendar and then
you have like a shopping list down here
now and I've got some mp3's that I want
to listen to and when i get home i drop
it in the cradle that's plugged into my
machine and then it sinks everything it
does the hot sink which you know is
listening hot term yeah but my friends
had a palm tungsten do you remember
those oh yeah the taking i was like very
premium wasn't it wasn't like a gunmetal
finish and very nice looking at was but
i think they may have had bluetooth and
so you could have oh I don't know maybe
he somehow managed to send and receive
emails on the move and I don't know how
he did it absolutely this the foldable
keyboard as well with the little just
hold it up and put it in your pocket
used to sell those that nextel for black
bears you you'd fold up the key was a
full-size qwerty but it had like three
joints in it that so it would accordion
into a four segments thing that went
into then like a metal wallet that you
would get and it was so cool yes it was
you deploy it at you know and like the
coffee shop the laundromat wherever the
hell yarns extinct all right and then
you plug in your tiny blackberry to a
full-size keyboard like now I'm ready to
work yeah exciting things like that I
was been watching this uh this vh1
series where this girl time travels back
to the 90s which is just like four
people it's obsessed with retro tech
this is because the dream come true the
old thinkpad that had the keyboard that
you opened the screen and it kind of
spread out do you guys remember this
wait the old it was an IBM his idea
think that it kind of it the keyboard
was it compacted in it kind of went up
and down and left and right and as you
open the screen it went Chuck trunk and
it became a full sized wider than the
body of the laptop that's Hannah so
awesome no I've never stabbed although I
did see when I uploaded this sony CLE a
video someone else was talking about
twitter he had a different version of
the sony hey that was um it was like a
tiny notebook like it was it was about
you know this big was by the size of
maybe an old sidekick or something like
that and it would open in landscape mode
and you'd have like a full landscape
keyboard and a little hinge and a little
monitor and it was like a kid it looked
like exactly like what a futuristic
object in a 1980s cartoon would have
would have looked like from scotts my
pocket computer and it's also cool Jules
has the video of the sliding keyboard
come on up I had never seen them I
remember why I was thinking of this I
had a little dock for my dell axim x30
that was just like this where it would
open up and fold out and become I mean
it's super cramped still but a little
more usable my god there's there was so
much cool stuff at the beginning of the
previous decade that we as people you
know are you filled with form factors
and all that kind of stuff but the
iphone killed everything cool about
technology because now everything just
looks the same and does the same thing
that needs to be a minimal slate right
yeah that's so there's nothing more
boring you remember um I was watching a
film I think one of the Marvel films
once and yeah it was it was it was the
first Ironman and Tony Stark is in the
desert at the top and he has a verizon
branded phone but I think Nokia made it
it was a clamshell but when you opened
it up the no is LG when you opened it up
the display could rotate to a landscape
orientation like a t-shape what Samsung
Samsung did one of those as well ah
subway I think this one is not okay
remember yeah over and this is one of
our phones i have as many possible parts
that could break or just get dust and
the resulting thing as we can read
tithing number as well with like with
like my new fun thing and there was
always someone like you stephen it was
like the second or third reply were it's
like you know the more parts you put in
something the easier it is to break
like what phone do you carry your nokia
candybar yeah I'm very cool and you're
not gonna be 70 that swivels 302 far but
yeah going too far as a good time
sometimes when you talk about design my
worst memories from this era where
connectivity related going back to what
we were talking about with her the Axum
it didn't have any GPS built in it had
Wi-Fi and bluetooth so i had to connect
to a handheld gps receiver that i had to
charge separately that would connect
over bluetooth and then there wasn't a
standardized or there was a standardized
but shitty a physical interface it had
instead of having like the connectors we
have now are usually spring-loaded
things or are just bare contacts and the
springs are in the connector so there's
very little to damage this thing had
physical pins get sort of floating in a
little avoid there so if you tried to
plug in a connector at anything other
than a perfectly straight angle you're
going to smush those pins down and once
you did say goodbye to charging this
thing connecting you're not you're ever
again it is Miss wrong irritating that
just means you're free speaking of uh
spirit hahaha I'm sorry I I need to tell
that story in a hot second cuz i just
looked at my phone at the wrong time and
I'm just LOL enlike hard um but before I
do that Steven connectivity yes um
during this same period of time in in
chem it was during the same time as the
palm tungsten were very popular people
were looking for these connectivity
solutions and if you weren't a business
man you couldn't afford a portable modem
to carry around you're like well I
already carry my phone so what if my
phone could provide like a hot spot for
my PDA and there was only one phone in
the US that did this longtime listeners
you've heard this before i'm sorry to
repeat myself but i remember sprint was
the only carrier for a while that
carried interesting phones in the States
for for tech heads like us and the T 608
from Sony Ericsson Saudi ericsson
announced the intention to carry it they
then delayed it for months and months
and months and this was right around the
time when Erickson came out and said hey
we're not making cdma phones anymore so
sprint had already i think taken
delivery on the 608 inventory so they
were just making the decision whether to
sell or not they eventually made they
eventually decided to sell in a very
very few people got out I think through
telesales the reason this is important
is because at the time the T 608 was the
only phone to open its Bluetooth
connection to an internet doesn't need a
Wi-Fi hotspot this is no it's a
Bluetooth hot spot right so you could
keep your phone in your pocket and
tether it via bluetooth to your PDA in
your hand and have like a full web
browser on your whatever and man I never
got to do it because I just it was such
an ugly phone and I didn't have a PDA
that I was just like whatever but if I
had bought that CLE a like I wanted I
would have would have used a 608 in my
pocket on sprint's superfast 1x RTT
network I was surprised we didn't see
more people carrying around acoustic
couplers and like plugging their PDA in
to say phones somebody the comment on my
video on the in the clea video said that
he used to have that fun and he did he
had an acoustic coupling modem that he
carried around so he'd be like you'd
roll up to a payphone be like watch this
Connect is anything less seen in hackers
when they're all and Grand Central yeah
or in war games like you know what the
first coupler attached to the m's I
Steven did you have you seen like a guy
that would have had a PDA did you you
didn't on one back in the day yeah I had
a dell axim okay so what did the action
run was that a windows mobile yeah
windows mobile it was a decent is like
600 megahertz processor on there uh
Intel something so this was this was a
be later on it was this like 05 06 times
I feel like that yeah ram windows mobile
03 so okay so maybe gonna pull da does
it does it some hardware keys below the
screen it looks like maybe is that a
front-facing camera on that sucker no no
something I'd like it had the little
plastic riser with the antennas for the
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and this is back in
the air when you still had dumb phones
with the most crazy notification LEDs
like you're in 10
would spin through a rainbow of colors
and sure ass flash green we had
bluetooth on flash blue for Wi-Fi so you
knew at a glance what was enabled their
officials important because we didn't
turn those radios off when you weren't
using them your battery would just
deplete itself in minutes you know who
else was big on those was HTC when they
when they started making the smartphones
would based on Windows Mobile on the
Mogul there were two separate LEDs one
was for network condition and the other
was for which radios were on in
notifications and stuff ah those were
the days but wait lashing LEDs will keep
you up at night okay yeah but that's in
in the better get that police outside
wiser believe like ah was the best in
the Samsung we had the the rainbow LEDs
for a while that like you wouldn't even
not that you could customize them like
you could currently but it was just a
rainbow and if you didn't want a rainbow
then you would turn off your old lady I
loved that on a 600 but didn't the
accent have Wi-Fi or something Steven
yeah had Wi-Fi and Bluetooth just no
cellular radio so what was your usage
scenario like like where did you use it
only at home did you use it as a sort of
surrogate like a tablet or what told
this story before I got because it had
SD card support so i found an offline
version of still Wikipedia in its very
early days and I loaded the entire text
of the thing on to achieve a SD card and
used to cheat at Bar trivia that was all
given s you succeeded at bartram you
never talked in ever at all that story
before I didn't know you were a bar
trivia cheater i would i would not
associate with you any longer had i know
you need to verify my hunches let's call
it that this is the last is the last
weekly you'll ever see steam is so cool
no that's why i thought you were gonna
say that you got an SDS t cards that had
a radio in it cuz now you know that um
like the st i/o cards for Wi-Fi back in
the day if you had a phone and you
wanted to add Wi-Fi capability to define
an SD card slot with sdio you could plug
in the card and it would give you Wi-Fi
access if if you had all summer i just
used it for the wikipedia thing and i
played one round a lot with gps like i
mentioned earlier with the the bluetooth
connection a ps4 navik
and stuff because you nearly have a we
didn't get to the point where there were
these very full-featured standalone gps
units that were affordable so this was
super duper happy and i keep charging
gps separately but who worked in a page
and it was fun to play with while we're
talking about connectivity guys this is
hilarious um someone in the QA was
talking about our technical difficulties
before with jelly jackets again saying
it's a real Friday the 13th for you guys
right haha yes but you know what's funny
you remember when I told you guys I went
upstairs to go try and get my
confirmation text for the two-factor
authentication to get back into Google
yeah that time correspondent exactly
with a new england t mobile outage so it
wasn't just me like the whole network
went down in in and around Boston at
that very moment I have just found out
not at all coincidentally this was a
this tip was provided to me by a friend
by a friend at AT&amp;amp;T who's read my I went
to tmobile that was the awesome because
thanks something like because I know
their network they're gonna tweet oh now
Sprint's down you really should be
anything yeah yeah yeah so I'm the easy
out isn't it's a tmobile stone
absolutely are always doubt really news
yeah um before we move out of here
because we do have to move out of here
and I feel like ham go to dinner and
it's all good it's all good okay all
right good well we're about to hear from
Steven about Windows one before we go
though you guys have any specific
memories about the PDA period because I
am like I'm like you cam I don't think I
ever had a standalone PDA the first one
that I had with PDA functions was
actually smartphone was a blackberry
7520 but I remember something very
specific about a first first with that
was when I learned how to use the
blackberry browser which was a full HTML
browser incidentally three years before
Apple came on the scene saying they
brought the real internet with them I
don't often get crabby at Apple but
that's one who claims I didn't like and
I found out that I could do literally I
could do journal updates because I
really did have like a livejournal uh
this is not had the really genuine
Google's cloud looks like Bobby's
podcast a revelation yeah oh wow that's
the cool i'm looking for a going fast
yeah i think it's what we had last week
how's this how's that show ya talkin
talking about HTML before iphone i
remember having a nokia n70 and that had
HTML on it nervous before i'm sure that
was announced before the iphone 100 yeah
yeah no the real web thing that's a
whole big conversation but I just
remember being able to pound out an
entire maybe 500 word you know emo
bullshit journal entry on this on this
leg thumb bored and being like wow I
remember I remember where I was I
remember the kind of day it was it was
at the laundromat and I'm like I can i
really do this can I do this on a
blackberry I can run I can I can like
basically run my life on a mobile
browser that's really really bizarre do
you guys have any similar memories of
like the first time you were able to do
like a rather complex task on a mobile
device and when you first realize the
power of a mobile device maybe i think i
did i'm looking back at it now it was
probably the most terrible thing in the
world but it was the old pdas when they
had their handwriting recognition and
you have to scribble up a little hard
but in like it ever do you mean like
real handwriting or like the power with
its graph is the palm thing the girl we
had to you have to follow the
instructions exactly it would not
understand what you attract to write yes
oh it's a whole new character sex yeah
so I could write it in freehand it knows
what I'm trying to put in oh how much
displaying a 90s trivial pursuit and a
question came up about PDAs I had no
idea us robotics was the company behind
Palme initially whom I only really knew
from their modems but apparently they
were and if they bought palm or if palm
was a spin-off of them but modems pda's
why not
wow that's wild yeah I forgot about that
Association there's a lot more nerdy
nostalgia Jules has cooked up a us
robotics page so we can verify that you
have previous products and services Palm
Pilots you wow these were good days I
wish I wish we had a couple fewer
technical distractions that could allow
us to go for a deep dive on this but
we're over time I can't really afford to
be over time and hope all coming soon
wait a second is this where is this a
landing page oh this is life just got
really excited yeah yeah this is the
cheapest page yes yeah it's like the
other thing what should we do with it
I'll make it pre for please make a pre
for with webos no I think like yeah that
would be nice right but they wouldn't do
they already have a pixie so they would
make a well we'll we'll see what they do
I just I don't want to see a pre for if
it has android and some BS skin on it
like just if you don't do that if you
have to but don't make don't call it the
pre for or the pre anything with the
post okay anyway I'm sure we'll hear
more about that going forward let's move
on let's sound the drop so we can get
into dial F or fail that's right you
were out of oh that's right i'm not on
the board so anyway um Steven you will
have a proper intro in the high-quality
cut assuming we bother coming better
might just quit after today I think I'm
gonna do Drive time radio here to you
ers lips I'm good Susan get me in get me
in the door please yes um only if you
don't let your car i will donate my car
don't worry i did also go steal one
first this is a segment folks all about
stupidity general foolishness and
unreasonable moves in the mobile space
now steven is going to give us both
sides of the story as he always does do
not be concerned if you thought that
this was going to be a hit piece because
there's other a couple dynamics of this
with this segment it's called this title
is called why you'd be forgiven for
thinking Microsoft hates flagships or
why did my friends crap phone get the
windows 10 phones review and not my 930
Steven we only have about truthfully we
don't have about seven minutes do my
battery life but take it away friend you
know I didn't
where I had to hit both sides of the
issues here I was really planning to be
one-sided and just unfair but I guess
well but yeah that Deb factors into the
woman doing things you buy as hack right
so this is what I was talking about
earlier when we first brought up the
nose and technical preview for phones in
that you can't use it for all devices at
the moment Microsoft was it was clear
about this over the past few weeks there
would be a list of specific vices that
were supported and the good news there
was that it would include some of the
lower ram matos people initially were
fearing wouldn't make the cut microsoft
also explained that we'd be seeing
further models add to this list as
future technical previous released so if
your phone wasn't supported out of the
gate it wasn't the end of the world when
we actually got the list of supported
models yesterday yesterday though it was
a bit of a shock because these are
solidly low to mid-range devices however
the 830 is the most interesting
spec-wise of the list microsoft tried to
pass it off as the Affordable flagship
but as you might have seen in our review
affordable it may be flagship it very
much is not so if you have something
like a 930 a Lumia icon the 1520 of you
mention that Joe Belfiore he's been
showing off some of these features on
for the moment you're out of luck now
Microsoft has a very good explanation
for why these higher end models aren't
supported it has to do with the way the
file system is partitioned on these
devices such that installing the update
the way it's being done now would prove
problematic with the amount of size
allocated for the the operating system
partition Microsoft has a plan for
addressing this and in future updates we
definitely will see the ability to
install it on these higher end phones
but that doesn't change the fact that
it's kind of a black mark on Microsoft
that it wasn't able to do this out of
the gate I say this because Microsoft's
had a problem for a while now when it
comes to flash of devices on Windows
Phone we haven't seen a new one that I
would consider a capital F flagship and
again I'm not considered me at 31 in a
very long time now coming up on a year
in just a few months and then rumors
suggesting we won't see another model
like this until the latter part of 25
teen so if you were already being
nervous about Windows Phone being a
platform that wasn't very conducive
towards users looking for bleeding edge
tech this is doing nothing at all to
dismiss that fear should Microsoft have
held out a little more until this it
calls it a partition stitching the
technique is going to use to deliver
Windows 10 to these devices like the 930
1520 shouldn't have waited a little
longer to release the technical preview
until that was ready to go I maybe want
to say yes now we don't have a lot of
insight into exactly where along and
development that is and Michael
mentioned that he was a little surprised
to see the technical preview come out
when it did yesterday Microsoft had
until the end of februari and no one we
would have gotten a little anxious but
we wouldn't have you know taking pics
forks and torches to redmond and
demanded the preview come out then we
knew it was coming maybe it could have
waited a little longer and got this
thing ready to go for more devices I
would have liked to see it support
higher end phones when it finally came
out if that meant waiting until March or
April okay i can understand I wanted to
get us out of the gate when you did
Microsoft but still this has to really
suck for a do proponents of the platform
because when Microsoft is putting these
next-gen features and yeah it's still a
preview and it will come two more phones
later and it'll be more polished but
when it's giving this early taste for I
mean I'm sorry some of this is some
crappy hardware here a crappy
comparatively yes windows phone runs
good on lower-end hardware yes there's a
real market for low and mid-range
devices but I mean come on Microsoft
this is a little embarrassing more than
little disappointing and for fans of the
platform who really wanted to see do
great things with great hardware I feel
like this is just another we're not so
concerned about these the bleeding eggs
I've been using that phrase a lot we're
not so concerned about the super
high-end here maybe that's a good thing
and it's making it more accessible but
for the really techie geeky guys I feel
it's a disappointment what do you guys
think i think paul theroux paul thurrott
rather feels a quite the same way and
has been vocally lambaste on microsoft
for this in the step
I don't think it's that big a deal
frankly particularly with the the
technical limitations that we were
included in on you know from from where
I'm sitting Stephen this is a technical
preview and Microsoft is using it to
aggregate feedback as much as anything
else from the hardest core of the fans
yes the hardest core people were are
more likely to have the high-end
flagships and it's a little bit of slap
in the face not regard but it's not like
this is the only release you know I mean
this is like what if last year at Google
i/o we hear about Android L that preview
release comes out and it's only for the
Galaxy Nexus you know you know I
understand I I know but this is if this
is the first time we've seen a public
release of any windows phone bill right
I mean you last year I seem to recall us
being Brian for briefings when they had
a much more a much more shined up
version but it had the insider program
before didn't they the inside of the
issues you still didn't downgrade
remember that was the big new thing with
this one is now there's a way to move
back I don't remember so decide later
I'll bleed together but wouldn't you
know regardless i don't i'm glad that no
one I to my knowledge has yet it come up
with a twitter hashtag and a gate suffix
Griffith you know like tech preview gate
and but I'm a little surprised no one
has because there's so much just umbrage
intriguing fear about this and I'm so
what do you want just what I know it
lacks it'll come in the visa Fraley I
know one of my our colleagues at another
site who has named Owen mentioned was
like didn't have an 830 so he went and
got an 8 30 and then now he can run the
technical preview like I I'm not saying
everyone should go buy an 830 obviously
but hey I did think was a little
hysterical when this first came out I I
hit up Michael with a message like have
you seen this yet has come out are you
gonna do a video on this he's like oh
yeah I'm waiting for it on my HTC One m8
very no way the previews coming out for
the one ending right you could at your
head that was I was doing that based on
the information I got an earlier in the
week that it was only gonna come to the
MA but that was those incorrectly anyway
whatever we had some stuff lying around
can we look forward to hearing your
thoughts on understand when it gets a
little bit more mature I imagine you'll
spend some time with it once it gets a
little polished up yeah yes I will be
definitely good we
just enough time for listener mail guys
Jules to bring us into that we're not
using the board so forget it we'll do it
live to the HQ I'm at fifteen percent
battery life so this is what we call a
race to the finish initiative and we're
going to start with listen and mail
number one if I can find a cami wanna
stick around help us answer these real
quickly I can do yet thanks man this is
listener my loved one from le can tell
real I can tell with phones like the s6
and z for approaching I was wondering if
people really care if their phone has an
IP rating as ingress protection or you
know water and dust rating people baby
their phone anyway so I wonder if it
matters thanks in advance and love the
show I'll answer first Eli it would be
my contention that people baby their
phones because they're many phones can't
need to be babied they can't handle real
life for the vast majority of my
existence yeah I don't need an IP
certified phone but this is me talking
in the depths of februari in Boston when
all I want to do is stay inside and stay
away from the horrible cold outside in
the summer I'm going to beach all the
time around on them boat or you know I'm
whatever I'm hiking maybe I don't want
to pull out a phone that's you know five
millimeters thin and if I put it down on
the wrong branch it'll break in half I
want something robust and I don't have
to go spend a bunch of money on a case
that one is going to boat the f er up
and two is going to look ugly as sin on
the thing f cases man so yeah I need an
IP rating I I like him and I'm going to
be sad when the s6 probably launches
without one so I think that was one of
the best things about the s5 what do you
think either of you gentlemen I I'm
inclined to agree i've got this egg
three and i live i live in an area where
it rains probably eighty percent of the
year and the having worked in mobile
phone retail and dealt with insurance
claims of water damage as there's
nothing more freeing than going out with
a phone and being able to answer it in
the rain oh look at my phone in the rain
without having to put a lifeproof on it
that's what I have to put on my iphone 6
if I'm going out for a run or I'm going
out
and it's a bit damp I put a waterproof
case on my phone Godwin isn't a little
frustrating you yeah but this ad three
it's fine I've got no worries it'll last
yeah yeah I totally get where this
question is coming from for one I find
those ratings extremely confusing
because a lot of different numbers can
follow that IP they mean different
things it's not going to be the same for
every phone and it's not immediately
intuitive what the rating actually means
even when you know what it means though
yeah I still would be really careful i
mean if you've been watching our videos
you've seen Michael destroy waterproof
phones by just dropping them in water
like you're supposed to be able to do
and there's a lot of asterisks that
follow all of these ratings like yes a
phone may be rated for three atmospheres
but that's static water yes you may be
able to put it you know three meters
deep into a still pool but that doesn't
necessarily mean you can take it in the
shower where there is moving water and
it doesn't seem like that's equivalent
pressures but that could end up damaging
the phone so it's really hard you just
look at that number and understand what
you can and can't do with it so as a
result I think we are a little
overcautious with these devices for good
reason yeah no caution is always advised
especially considering the number of
devices I have damaged that are supposed
to be what it what our impact resistant
yes Stephen but if you do read the
numbers right you would lessen your
chances of that if you do some research
and look at the tables you know IP is
different from mil spec and mil spec is
weird rather it's become a rather short
cut and kind of inaccurate way of
reporting durability because it turns
out that in order to meet the mill
tekram ended the mil standard 8 10 of
the a-10 standard you can you don't have
to go to a centralized testing facility
you don't really have to adhere to any
normalized or uniform code scout some
sort of declare something mil standard
if you want to like the standard itself
is something like 800 pages long it
covers everything from you know how
devices to get to like but but like even
in the terms of the things that covers
it covers everything from handheld
devices to like waterproofing on tank
treads
diculous to say anything is good week on
the podcast yeah there'll be a fun thing
to review them let's move on to lose my
number to Steven you want to go ahead
and read it from our friend Baldwin be
sure sure um Baldwin rights thanks for
keeping us phone nerds fed with info and
rumors and not force look forward to new
shiny things and the podcast to let us
hear you feel giddy about it too we are
happy to do giddy let me get this out of
my head though with a move to Windows 10
making the Kota base uniform across all
devices and with intel mobile processors
becoming as efficient as arm ones do you
think the next Lumia will run an intel
chip of course us with alienate Karen
flagships but Microsoft did that before
anyway would it make things easier
faster you so tell people it's one LS
space that everything will be x86 going
forward when tell phones for the win I
so yes to know about this I had the
exact same response as you except mine
was more like oh wow oh man so third
selling mobile I called for help from a
friend Joel Eva he wrote a rather
extensive reply Steven if you want to
get in real quick before I leave that
because I'm not the power through it uh
I I'm hesitant to believe that this
could actually happen Intel chips
they've been making some headway over
the past couple years but they're still
kind of Frings chips that when you see
them on devices it's not great
compatibility will this new code base
thing improve the situation almost
certainly especially with our level
language here it's going to be easier to
run on different devices with less of a
differentiation because of what the
silicon under the hood is still arm is
so ubiquitous it's cheap unless Intel
make some real effort of giving its
chips away to manufacturers practically
I think arm is gonna be the standard
here for a while and just because it's a
different underlying instruction set I
think it's going to impact when so much
like it was that uh that's a shame it's
a shame I tried to sneak in there
because I wanted to get some music for
the asteroid that may be saved one part
of the show but we couldn't do it so get
out of my face microphone and we're not
going to use that and when I can
music and were just yeah winnebago man
hey as jane says to this answer Oh Adam
answered first and he says there have
been rumors of an x86 phone both running
either android or windows phone for a
few years I don't follow chips too
closely either but I'm sure it's very
possible they move the windows phone
from the sea eternal to the NT kernel
specifically for the flexibility to
support a wider growing range hardware
it sounds like tablets with less than 7
inch screens will be able to run the
phone style version of Windows 10 right
or plenty of those on x86 processors
already adding a little phone hardware
doesn't seem like a big deal that's from
Adam Lane our windows phone expert solid
I've Jeep that's that's that is one
great response Joe's response is a
little bit more significant and I have
to go through it rather quickly joe says
this isn't the first time Microsoft will
have unified to a single architecture
etc etc arm is a risc processor reduced
instruction set computing risk is
stereotypically built for small
lightweight energy efficient code and
devices x86 and x64 are sisk processors
complex instruction set computing sisk
used to be the exclusive run for doing
high-end high power computation believe
it or not we do a lot of what would
previously have been called complex
instructions on our reduced instructions
mobile devices today but the line
between the two has been blurred Joe
goes on to say how that has been
accomplished focusing on a single
architecture simplifies development
testing and QA for the OS developer the
OEM and software developers it also
provides a more consistent experience
across platforms something end-users
highly desire mm Joe could the next
Lumia be powered by an x86 or x64
processor absolutely should it be there
are many reasons to support that
direction is it the right choice that
remains to be seen surely vibe with a
great answer and unfortunately can't
talk anymore about if you wonder why
them rushing at the door guys because
I'm at five percent battery and he
computer's gonna end the show for us if
I don't do it have you drop out you're
gone for good yeah exactly oh yeah this
is from Greg vote with a great question
with my
red cell phone contract about to expire
I've decided to change carriers was
considering switching to AT&amp;amp;T and going
no contract as I have cell phones to use
recently through research I found that I
can get a similar plan and cricket
wireless bubble blah since I'm bringing
my own phones and going no contract are
there any disadvantages to going with an
mvno over a mainstream carrier if they
both use the same network Greg vote yes
yes absolutely Greg there are
disadvantages and they are predominantly
in how much data you are allocated
because MVNOs by broadband from the big
guys and after a certain threshold you
are throttled and we just saw a couple
weeks ago Stephen there's a new story
say you're advertising unlimited and and
it wasn't true yeah everybody's that may
carriers are yes but it is generally
much more severe in terms of mvnos
because they are under restrictions from
the carrier's providing them to them now
I read this and I first thought about
rumors I've always heard these MVNOs you
don't get network priority so like if a
rising tower is crowded and you're on
some Indian oh that uses them the people
who are on postpaid plans are going to
get their data through first and you're
gonna get you know be second fiddle I
looked around and apparently that may
not actually be true it's a lot of you
know people suspect that their signal is
bad when I blame it on something but
some of these MVNOs have said no no our
contract with sprint or whomever says
our traffic gets the same priority it
may be an issue that it's routed
differently on the internet like it gets
sent through proxies through these MVNO
carrier companies so it may not make the
most efficient route but that doesn't
have to do with a cellular network and
by and large I don't think you gonna get
a difference with the the quality of the
data you get yes you'll have those plan
restrictions still which may be more
onerous than with a a postpaid plan but
I don't know I am always very wary of
being on an mvno because i feel like if
there's a capacity crunch and there they
you know there needs to be a decision
made in terms of who that comes into
your going to favor the postpaid people
and benelli evidence to support that
idea yeah well you're right he used to
be the case cam as any insight from
across the pond on this now he actually
know probably less about UK networks
than I do about American waters since I
write for tmonews as well
I've heard the same I've heard that the
NVA knows get lesser priorities when
it's when it's a bit busy but I don't
know where I've heard it and I don't
know if it's true right yeah but this is
one of those muddy areas that sort of
underreported because a lot of people
reported on years and years ago and I
don't think there's been a lot of
follow-up on it but all right in these
days of did net neutrality discussion
maybe we'll see that maybe we'll do some
time because this right there it's one
thing i noticed i actually used one of
the uk's envia knows i think it was
about two years ago they were running
off one of the bigger networks and when
it came to tethering it wouldn't let you
do it at all because you had to have
different settings installed and you
just couldn't do it so who sometimes
have technical difficulties with using
an mvno yeah but yeah yeah now I always
generally stick with the big guys Roger
that yeah and but you know Greg if you
want to give it a try give it a try I've
heard great success stories from people
on NBA knows this is going to depend on
your needs it's going to depend on how
you use your service there's no reason
not to give it a go especially if you
don't actually if Google gets into the
game like has been rumored with
increasing frequency that could put em
via knows a whole different level here
so amazing coming ya know this is very
true I think we've got to go to sort of
get out of here how well do you think
the serious sent seven will adapt to the
Candy Land android lollipop go as Sonny
kalra I don't know we've seen it start
to sort of trickle out right it seems to
be sort of a mishmash of grays and
whites I don't know I haven't used it
personally that's like I can't say kam
you have any experience with sense on
lollipop no I have none nice I don't
have an HTC device anymore which is
really odd what do they do i do over
there a Lumia 400 something you don't
have an HTC them right what's going on
now I do i do Scott Josiah 820 in the
cover just again oh thank goodness is it
holding up holding up a table in there
or what
yeah yeah it's actually I checked the
measurement is actually slightly shorter
than an iphone 6 plus how that deters
you how big the iphone 6 plus yeah for
real it's bigger than a desire 820 oh
god the source i asks after the
blackberry passport in class like which
do you think is the next step for
blackberry where's blackberry going it's
a good question source I we are about to
look at the blackberry passport due to
popular demand we've been we were
bludgeoned for not covering it even
though blackberry didn't send us one you
guys would not leave us alone and when
the opportunity came to take a look at
the AT&amp;amp;T variant which has slightly
different hardware we seized upon it and
we'll be taking a look at it don't work
where it's going next is going to be a
another full touch phone i think it's
the Rio I want to say has been leaked a
few times just to step back from these
last two Cordy models no kidding I've
not seen those leaks thank you ever yeah
I feel it I'll be I think it will be
more like it I don't think we had the
said this is the said three dozen
accessory was a 30 yeah and it was in
the 30 budget of wuzzle it has a budget
model that was the century I think they
launched it in Asia and growing markets
I from what i've read as well it seems
like it's going to be a follow up to one
of that to that device kochevar do i
asks this is our last one i live in the
UK london and I've never seen an Android
wear SmartWatch you see many out in the
wild I'll enter for Boston I haven't
seen any I don't think ever maybe once
sell them all over in philly really
which one moto 360 s like numerous
wrists in a very hipster e bar how about
your you're part of the UK camp no i
have not seen any in the wild the only
time I've ever seen any in the wild is
that Aoife in Berlin yeah and then and
everyone has 360s at those yeah we never
fail to ever see Phil makinson and he's
got is this susan watch on I'm like man
it's a good call I should I should I
should be wearing that too but I didn't
want to be different all right we gotta
get out of here guys were three percent
cam I'm sorry for all the technical
problems i really appreciate you being
patient with us come back
be with us again and will will it'll
work right I won't have a major network
a noted authentication and things will
go well it's not great great Steven as
always thank you for for for your hard
work and your fun faces and you
appreciate all of them Gordo viewers
thank you for being patient with us as
well folks that's going to do it for

phoneDog underscore cam and i'll be
bitching about yet another blizzard at
captain two phones its captain the
number two phones buck and I was also on
Twitter Instagram Facebook and Google+
