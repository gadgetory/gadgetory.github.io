good morning good afternoon good evening
to everyone of you it is about that time
to talk about Windows 10 the event just
happened this is pretty much the second
preview that we are getting from
Microsoft over the future of Windows 10
we saw a preview early later last year
and today we get to see what it gets to
look like on mobile in addition to other
devices that microsoft announced today
and that we were actually only expecting
one of them and in the end there being
more so let's begin with our quick roll
call let's start with our
editor-in-chief mr. Anton Dean arch how
are you good morning good afternoon good
evening everybody I am fine I'm still
trying to process all the information
which Microsoft threw at us that windows
seven shrit looks lovely living on you
yeah it's I'm celebrating the free of it
that's why it is here manish i could
find my old internet explorer 3 midnight
launch t-shirt it glows in the dark it's
awesome then we have our editorial
director mr. michael fisher how are you
sir I'm very well and just like the rest
of you trying to make my mind soak up
all of the information that microsoft
revealed from from seattle and also
trying to deal with this aspect ratio
sorry i look weird everybody but that's
what happens when you break your other
camera which was lovely and is that a
predictable Dunkin Donuts coffee mug you
had best believe it brother something's
got to stay consistent chief news editor
mr. stephen chang how are you i am doing
well and finally stopped screaming in
frustration over the issues with
microsoft's live feeds skipping out on
me so cool calm and collected at this
point can I share area can I share a pro
tip about that that's that's actually
too late I too had some skipping I had
skipping on my Windows RT device i had
skipping on the macbook air the only way
i could watch the microsoft event
without incident was to stream it on
through internet explorer on my lumia
930 and it was smooth as anything even
on 3g i don't understand why but it
worked
so next Microsoft then you know break
out your Windows Phones everybody I are
these priorities indeed and I am
primarily led a multimedia manager we
are going to discuss this as quickly as
we can there is a lot to talk about just
remember everyone the Q&amp;amp;A is active we
already have one question live and we're
expecting you to shimon with your
impressions and questions as well so why
don't we take it off with Steven since
between Steven and I we were covering
the news tony was helping us on social
and let us know how things went Stephen
let's begin with I think our first news
post was directly about a microsoft
making windows 10 updates free for
windows 7 windows 8 1 it's about the
updates this is a new version the
operating system coming out so the
question for a lot of users I mean some
of us certainly will be buying new
devices with windows 10 on it a lot of
us want to know what's the path to get
Windows 10 on our existing stuff now
Microsoft had already talked about of
making windows 10 available to Windows
Phone 8.1 Lumia devices that may have
given some of you a little pause away
this single that Lumias there granted
that's the lion's share of the Windows
Phone 8.1 market but they confirmed yes
all Windows Phone 8.1 devices will be
getting this free upgrade to Windows 10
maybe the bigger news though is on the
desktop side of things with smartphones
we're pretty much used to now getting
our updates for free it's just expected
on PC that hasn't been the case but
Microsoft is changing course of Windows
10 users not only of Windows 8.1 will be
able to upgrade to Windows 10 for free
but even those who have been holding out
on Windows 7 will be invited to make the
free step forward to Windows 10 now the
upgrades are only going to be available
for free at least as far as Microsoft
has confirmed for the first year that
Windows 10 is available you're going to
QA they sort of alluded to not having
their plans after that set in stone
there may be something involved if you
delay or long enough but you know it's
news for too long it the first couple
months you can upgrade to Windows 10 for
free and once you're there you'll be
able to can continue upgrading windows
10 on this device for the rest of its
life span so Microsoft is really
committed to bringing pretty much
everyone who's a current user of a
microsoft windows product along for this
Windows 10 journey and that's really big
news for the company getting everyone on
the same page maybe for the first time
in a long while yeah yeah definitely
it's what Apple has been doing with OS
10 for the past three years obviously
Apple sells computers and Microsoft is
barely only selling the surface I think
it's a very good move I just I because
of how competition is with OS 10 I'm not
sure it's going to be sustainable for
another year but who knows probably
Microsoft finds another business model
to make money out of windows through
what do you think Tony well let me start
with devices and I will be honest and
saying that at one point my heart
stopped because I really did not want to
see another windows phone seven to 7.5
to eight transition where some devices
do not get the latest version of Windows
Phone but luckily Microsoft learn from
their experience and when those 10 will
be available on current windows oh that
run Windows Phone 8.1 which is I believe
a natural thing and I kind of expected
this what came as a surprise was this a
windows 10 upgrade for PCs for free and
I think that this might have something
to do with everything Tim Cook usually
brags about when talking about Mac OS
and how Apple is chewing up parts of the
market share from microsoft and windows
and maybe Microsoft is trying to catch
up with that then gained back some parts
of that lost market share by probably
losing some cash because Windows Windows
updates usually cost about a couple of
hundreds of bucks I don't know exactly
how much it cost because I'm a Mac user
but still giving up that in order to get
everybody on a unified platform as well
as at the same time trying to get back
some market share I think because it's a
smart move it is are you worried there
might be a downside to this in the long
term that we won't see for a while here
but Microsoft's been talking forever
about how am I cut down on piracy with
its OS on PCs especially like markets in
the east where seems like more pcs are
using pirated windows than not this idea
of a subscription-based Windows system
has been put forward and a lot of the
talk today was about windows as a
service not just a platform and you
bring everyone on board get them all in
windows 10 getting
used to these updates coming all the
time no one has to think about mi on the
latest version not it's just coming
maybe 34 years down the road this
becomes a subscription and ongoing
subscription model where you're paying
you know 100 bucks a year for continuing
access that this is just you know
paranoid guess work at the moment but
you know and it's a it's a valid point
the thing is well Microsoft doesn't
really succeeded in doing that with 365
up to the point where they dropped the
price almost three times in less than a
year so I don't but they're succeeding
on xbox live with the same sort of
businessman who true true but I would
love to hear Michaels opinion since he's
the one with the surface pro 3 uh he is
yes indeed and he likes it quite a bit
actually is demon mentioned something
before about with regard to those
updates you know being coming sort of
without user interaction you know that's
that sort of Microsoft vision they laid
out there everyone's gonna be on the
same version to unprecedented levels
compared to where it's been before and I
really liked one of the boulder claims
they made where they microsoft said I
don't know if it was Terry Myerson or
somebody else said that Sony hack if
everyone had been running Windows 10
that wouldn't have happened because
protections are built in bull but that
over the seal the vulnerabilities that
were exploited for that particular hack
so then caught my attention I thought
that maybe that was gonna be one of the
bigger stories of the day but of course
then we moved on to even bigger ones
which I guess we should probably still
comin up yeah i guess the second biggest
news and my opinions gonna come in a
little later but Steve and talk to us
about Windows 10 on mobile I'm oh yeah
we got our first real preview today of
what Windows 10 is going to look like on
smartphones we only saw a few aspects of
it but Microsoft showed us home screen
configuration settings it's sort of
changes it a lot of users have been
asking for for a while now it really
dope into apps for the majority of the
presentation here talking about the
shared code bases between PC and
smartphones a lot of time there was
spent on looking at the office suite
what's really nice is how office or at
least Word Excel PowerPoint is going to
be bundled into Windows 10 for
smartphones and
small tablets believe the cutoff there
when somewhere the eight inches of solve
that it's going to be pardoned sorry
about the time-traveling I said eight
inches I was just remembering what you
said yeah but these smaller devices will
have office built-in you have it on your
pc then you can easily move back and
forth and editing on mobile and on your
laptop or desktop it's the sort of thing
much less been trying to do for a while
now but it looks like with Windows 10
this is a from the ground up idea and by
putting a word on the phones like this
Microsoft able to take advantage of the
very advanced text editing features and
sort of built into other app so they
were showing us a new outlook client
that has word pretty much built right
into the editing screen there that was
also need we see the keyboard moving
around a lot of more flexibility i think
that what we've seen so far and as far
as I'm this might be getting ahead of
ourselves but the preview of this which
we had been wondering when user finally
get a chance to try some of this for
themselves isn't available right now but
next month is the ETA for users as part
of the windows insider program you can
get this on their current Lumias in at
least some up early preview of how this
is all going to function now is it just
me or I mean Microsoft didn't really
talk about the phone you how much they
focus directly on how office integrates
with it and it was a really short
presentation on phones is it just me or
him am I being only one skeptical here
it's not just immensely yeah they did
that we're gonna have a dedicated
Windows 10 on phones event at some point
you know in a few months I have a
feeling because your retro bill this
will be big y yes an almost no time
passed but before like Joe Belfiore is
like hey check it out you can now you
got a wallpaper behind your tiles if you
want it okay now right onto microsoft
word on your phone come on is cement are
you okay I yeah there were some things
that I did that I liked in terms of
inbound messages that come down from
your you know from the notification bar
you can reply directly to them in there
much like it was done in iOS yeah you
can pop the keyboard out if you're
working with a large screen fun like the
1520 you can move the key
order on the screen now Action Center
you can dismiss individual notifications
it looks like recent apps have been
moved to the top of the app launcher
it's actually PP say say again Stephen
I'm sorry I didn't get that they and a
sink with of your pc with notifications
across devices that's right yeah we yet
again we have this promise for Microsoft
about now phone is really gonna sink
with desktop they're really gonna play
nicely together and I started writing
like a really cynical note as they were
promising this because this is what
we've been promising from seven to eight
to eight eight I want and now it finally
would stuff like that it looks like
we're getting a taste of it yes your if
you dismiss a notification on your
Windows Phone it'll be dismissed on on
whatever Windows 10 PC you're running
and stuff like that but you know is and
then there's skype integration right in
the messaging hub and which is the part
that I like the most how its vibration
in the messaging why now explain that to
me hi me because I didn't get it okay so
what I missed from the transition of
Windows Phone 7 to Windows Phone 8 was
pretty much this is the dismissal of
Facebook is part of your messaging hub
so in originally you could use Facebook
messaging integrated with a windows
phone you didn't have to actually launch
the messenger app it didn't exist back
then and so I I've missed that I missed
the fact that on iOS you have I message
where it interact you can either it'll
automatically select either you know I
message or typical SMS and to my
understanding that's the way it's gonna
work only it's going to use skype and
obviously they're trying to push skype
further and I like that integrated hub
of just one messaging application for a
mainstream service like skype and SMS
that's what i like is it like it too i
just wish I knew more than 10 people on
skype sorry Tony go ahead this is
currently operates no it's got you know
the messaging hub is just is just SMS at
the moment and there's not the you can't
you can't toggle back and forth in the
same thread between text and Skype as
far as as far as I know this has been
eliminated since Windows Phone 8 one of
the reasons I think there was little
emphasis or little time spent on Windows
10 on phones because apparently it's
going to be called Windows 10 and that's
is either one of the following two
options either number one they didn't
want to make this two and a half hour
event even longer which I can understand
because the emphasis was really on on
Windows 10 for PCs and on the
holographic stuff which to which will
get later or I think that Windows 10 on
phones is not yet ready to be shown off
and Microsoft is taking the time to
further perfect the platform and make it
ready for a maybe build or mwc
presentation and so on they're probably
going to have that februari preview
thing going on where users might be able
to send in some feedback but I have the
this idea that it's not currently
finished as for the changes i welcome
the custom backgrounds I welcome the
flexibility included but the user
interface is the same and that's not
necessarily a bad thing if you like the
good old metro UI back in the day you'll
still love it today if you love that you
load it today as well so there's little
changes to the concept but but they're
focusing more on the listening to the
user feedback and trying to bring in
they were complaining about and don't
get me wrong Windows Phone might be a
third in in the top three platforms in
terms of market share but is a
completely capable platform which you
can use as a daily driver and give or
take if you have a google if you're
invested in Google ecosystem but then
again you can do everything on a Windows
film that you can do in an android phone
or an iOS phone and that's I think that
speaks pretty much well of Microsoft
whether this Windows 10 update on phones
will boost the market share I would be
implied to say no but let's hope I'm
wrong we have a Q&amp;amp;A in terms of that
blood go ahead Microsoft's making a
really big deal talking about user input
and the feedback it's been getting from
people with the the windows 10 preview
on the pc so far so for those of you who
maybe haven't seen what you wanted to
yet out of windows 10 on phones from the
event today have some ideas of where it
should go or you don't like the look and
feel about certain things definitely get
involved
with the the preview the the insider
program when this goes live next month
get involved let Microsoft know what
your feelings about the Tsar this is the
OS is not set in stone just yet they're
still working things out and users
contributing is going to help shape this
into its final product so take your
Microsoft they really want to have all
of us involved so by all means speak
your mind and help craft us into the OS
you want it to be I mean were you going
to try and answer the Q&amp;amp;A from zodiac
fair exactly he asked do you guys think
of the unified windows will help close
the app gap on Windows Phone we've had a
lot of discussions with Michael
particularly we've been using the Lumia
930 for a couple of days now uh so far
as long as you're not invested in the
Google ecosystem I say that most of the
apps that most of those use are there so
yes I'm go ahead like here's the problem
right I you know I here's the issue yes
hi me that is true for me and I've been
making that point repeatedly of late I
have very little trouble using a windows
phone as my daily driver but you know
that's a whole nother conversation what
I found striking with regard to this
question is there is almost no move made
to address the app ecosystem on Windows
Phone at this event and Tony you're
right they probably didn't want to make
the event run any longer and yeah this
is a Q&amp;amp;A about that someone asked what
are you guys gonna do to address this
and they just kind of gave a weaselly
answer yo do the ok I missed that yeah
it so that was obviously not on the
agenda today and even more striking if
you live in the United States and you
happen to use chase bank this morning
like right before the microsoft event
chase bank officially announced her you
may have been yesterday that they are no
longer going to maintain their Windows
Phone app and they're actually gonna
pull it from the app store in a week
because just don't have enough users
just and this is chase bank you know
it's not a it's not like you know the
the your local Savings Bank like a major
bank is pulling an app from the Windows
Store because they don't have enough
users to justify keeping it in there now
you know obviously that's not a death
knell for the platform but it's also a
really not a great sign er yeah and it's
a reinforcement of all these kind of
this is bad press Steven yes that that
we've been hearing when this one fell on
time so that's that's a shame and the
fact that Microsoft didn't have any
good news to share with us like say even
an Instagram update for Windows Phones
who to get it out of beta and bring it
the two generations ahead that it needs
to come to be current with Android and
iOS the fact that none of that was
assured it's it's it's frustrating and I
am scary perfectly agree with you and I
think that if in the beginning Windows
Phone and Microsoft had an an appt gap
problem now it's not so much about the
app gap because the applications are
pretty much there in their majority
right now I think Microsoft is facing a
problem where the applications that are
there but the applications themselves
suck I don't think work as they should
or they look like crap and it took
Microsoft how many years to finally
perfect a Spotify app which came out two
days ago to finally make it look like on
iOS and we can go on and on with
applications which are in there
including Facebook which are far from
their counterparts on iOS or Android
yeah oh I just my one final point on
this this is all very true guys and just
to close out my participation on a
somewhat higher note i have been using a
blackberry classic for about the past
week and after that a windows phone is
just positively a vacation in the app
i'm actually using no phones and then
using a blackberry there you go well the
same exact thing Tony right right oh I
guess my biggest complaint is like for
example i love Michaels video on the
Spotify update yesterday please viewers
make sure you watch it to get all the
details on the changes but I've been
using it ever since I saw Michaels video
i downloaded i started using it and but
part of my you know my biggest complaint
with windows phone that was not
mentioned on this video on this event
and that i mentioned in the after the
buzz of the lumia 930 is either the
excessive animations to go from one
basic thing to another on on windows
phone is one thing and the second is
Michael have you noticed how it just
keeps having to refresh Spotify every
time that you launch it just goes from
exactly the it if you don't do anything
but remain on Spotify you're cool but if
you want to
multitask from one end to another every
time that you go back to Spotify it'll
relaunch the app even though the music
is still playing it'll take you back to
home it doesn't take you to the current
feed playlist that you listen uh yeah
conversation dating from back in the
windows phone seven points something
days with application to Dokdo and and
whatever they called it back then yeah
same time all right I oh I'm sorry
Stephen go ahead you and then I'll open
it I don't want to derail things ever
these are you know ongoing issues with
Microsoft's smartphone platform why
don't we keep moving into what got
covered on today's a bit goes a lot more
exactly there is a lot more to cover
Steven don't want to leave this topic
without mentioning something which we
have not mentioned and about which I'm
really excited it's that Microsoft is
bringing Cortana to the BC and I'm not
going to find on that it's just a thing
worth mentioning and guys in the States
and in the countries regions in which
Cortana is available will probably
appreciate it sadly not in my region but
that's the smart move i think yeah yeah
is that it's actually that's the next
topic actually and i covered that post
particularly microsoft is has done some
amazing things with Windows Phone
particularly for example on Lumia denim
you can just call and say hey Cortana
with the phone being turned off like you
can with moto x it'll activate itself
but you know they're not just launching
Cortana on the pc and making it the same
thing that you have on the phone they're
actually making Cortana better it
actually has context on whatever
information you provide to Cortana about
you but in addition it also searches
within documents and it should have just
activated it stuff Thank You Donna um it
actually digs into PowerPoint
presentations Excel sheets if you're
looking over for our particular
information within documents it'll do
that for you which is something you
can't really do on OS 10 surely you have
spotlight on OS 10 and it'll dig through
these these things but there is no
Siriano as 10 to allow you to use your
voice and bring that information up
which is really cool and they announced
other different changes like for example
if you're going through a web page and
you
look for a particular restaurant stuff
it'll Cortana will automatically give
you directions to the place dietary
information and just about it almost
every single context that it can pull
from that web page and whatever it is
that you're looking at so yeah it is
smarter than what you're getting on your
phone I think I think the new i'm sorry
steven going I'm trouble getting really
excited about this because like I am a
big fan of Google now Google Voice
Search interactions with my phone you
can do that on your pc with chrome but i
just don't idea of talking to my pc for
some reason is a lot less appealing and
the idea of talking to a mobile device
i'm not sure why that is and if it's
just something that we as users will
have to get used to but i can imagine
this being a little less appealing
Steven I think what I think it's just
something we have to get used to because
I share your view where I saw my friend
use google now on his laptop the other
day with chrome and I was like that
that's making my head just feel people
come around yeah she uses microsoft made
the example of the tired old example of
the offices system it's like having your
own secretary to you know i'm just tell
her to do stuff or whatever and I it
were just go ahead and I guess we're
Cortana is different is that just like
you know in the case of Google now it'll
pull information the more you use it and
understand what you're looking for but
Cortana is specifically on you know it
how can I say this whenever you're
browsing for something it'll already
give you information without you
searching for things so it's not just
the fact that you can call on Cortana
through your voice it's the fact that
it's interacting with everything that
you're doing in providing additional
information it's adding value to
whatever it is you're doing with the
computer and I guess that's where
Cortana has a difference with Google now
good point in she is also integrated
into the new browser not just the pc i
should mention so yes that's true
there's a quarter point she's in a lot
necessarily about this feature just just
one Centon time I appreciate the fact
that Microsoft found a way for the user
to eliminate certain things out of
Cortana's knowledge because if I would
actually care enough I don't care
because that's my type of person I don't
care about my
and see that much like other people but
Cortana is really dns a on your computer
local annecy on your computer it's their
watches listens and learns everything
from you about you and if you just don't
want crotona to know something about you
you just delete some references and
that's it for that or like I think in a
broader sense that if this is important
because Cortana is one of the best I
think one of the best things that was
included in Windows Phone 8 at one and
for Microsoft to take that and move that
to the desktop where historically I
think windows has been kind of less
exciting and much tougher sell
especially with windows 8 the people i
think it's a very very smart move and i
think it's going to make some a good
amount of people happy i think it's
going to play into this microsoft push
to make windows and experience that
people move from i need windows too okay
i should get windows too I love windows
and I think Cortana is going to play a
big part are you trying to answer the
question that we have on QA right now
we're source cy saying Michael as as we
all know you love Cortana's the
availability of curtain on windows make
you move from from your macbook air to
Windows Device I think it I think it
will take more than that yeah well I
mean it's not gonna be that much so I
think in about four days my macbook air
is finally gonna erupt in it you know in
a pile of flames and black spot but uh I
already use the surface pro 3 quite
often and not for any purpose like
review related purpose i just use it
often because I actually quite like it
so I don't really need much pushing to
to move to a Windows Device part time at
least here's here's a good as in a quick
question I just want to yes or no answer
do you guys think that apple will
introduce Siri in the next version of
Mac OS yes it has to yeah yeah it has to
it has to i just i find it so surprising
that Apple has not talked about Syria in
the past like three events yeah so it
could be that it could be that the Craig
federighi is just letting this be Scott
Forstall thing no if I were Apple I
don't know I'm not sure I really needs a
new recently anyway I'm sorry Stephen
you and I are having a latency idiots
ass kicked in the press we've seen all
these analyses where independent
researchers put on those questions to
Siri to Google now now to Cortana Siri
it may have
really impressive at first but everyone
else seems to be really outdoing it in
you know real life use cases so Apple
may just be waiting until I can I don't
know freshen Siri up with some
functionality before it wants to put
emphasis on it again but the one thing
stuck my mouth yep Apple Apple II use
your Apple usually does that that's just
the way it is it either it can either
improve it initially or at leave France
eventually but streaming back to the
topic how about if you run that run us
through the you know the emphasis on
gaming from windows stem Stephen yeah
yeah so a couple things are interesting
that are happening with Windows 10 that
will have an impact on gamers of course
the connectivity between different
devices is going to be big Microsoft is
all about social interactions when it
comes to gaming it really wants to put
Xbox Live first and forward as this way
for gamers to interact with each other
to share their accomplishments to just
you know shoot the and what is its
going to introduce people on phones
talking to users on consoles xbox one is
getting upgraded to full on Windows 10
users on PCs and Windows 10 those are
their phones on Windows 10 can all talk
with each other depending on the games
able to play with each other you'll be
able to stream games from the one to
your windows up PC or tablet and it's
all just about this overarching
connected social ecosystem for gamers
one thing was really interesting is the
way that sharing a game videos has
become really big in the past there's
twitch has blown up larger than anyone's
expectations on the Xbox already exists
these are really useful tools for
sharing video of your accomplishments
with your friends that's coming to the
PC and is correspondingly to phone so it
wasn't really talked about as much but
the ability to capture video to then
share it it's going to be baked right
into the OS so no need for hacky drivers
or third-party utilities Microsoft
really wants to give gamers the tools
they that they've already been using to
put the right in the OS and something
that Microsoft was talking about how
they don't want everything to seem like
a bolt on in Windows
or they want this to be really
integrated with all the features that
users use on a regular basis that's
going to be present with the gaming
focus here we also heard about DirectX
12 not a lot technologically was offered
there besides better access to hardware
should give games higher quality or
better performance they threw this fifty
percent improvement figure whether or
not we see as drastic improvements that
remains to be seen but no matter how you
slice it it's going to be very
impressive and accessible on more
devices of different types than ever
before am I the only guy that's thinking
that this is pretty much a response to
Sony's PlayStation live initiative that
never went live you know you are not the
only one thinking that no I mean for the
difference here is that at least the
PlayStation live platform whenever it
does work will work on OS 10 as much as
it can work on Windows compared to what
Microsoft isn't ending with with the
xbox one right I have more faith though
from Microsoft being able to pull this
off rather than sony true I think the
more Microsoft did does in gaming the
better off they will be I know there's
been a lot of talk a lot of speculation
about them spinning off the Xbox unit I
know there's a lot of business
consideration there's financial stuff
that I don't fully understand but every
time I walk into my living room and the
TV is on and the end the xbox is like oh
hi Michael because it recognizes my face
and then I tell it to do things with my
voice I mean it's it's just epically
awesome and it works much more smoothly
than a lot of large screen windows
microsoft products have for me in the
past so yeah the way the 360 at now the
xbox one have evolved past a pure gaming
console to this sort of connected home
device is it's probably where you know
pcs just computing in general is going
over the next couple decades here it's
given Microsoft a great inroads into
this and just early access trying out
new technologies like Kinect holla lens
which we'll talk about later but it's
it's been a great experimentation
platform and I act like I've heard like
you have these talk about getting split
off I can't see that happening it's been
too valuable to microsoft and
only going to keep on being valuable in
the years to come I'm actually waiting
for two things number one is for Tony to
tell us how much he doesn't play games
Tony I was about to say I have no
opinion on this because the last time I
played games I was broadly in the eighth
grade yeah ok thank you Tony going back
to the topic we do have a Stevens gonna
with uhh we do have a nice segue
opportunity here into another large
screen Microsoft device that was
announced today yeah well the phablet no
I'm actually going to talk about the
surface hub but I guess the only bid
closing down the whole xbox concept i'm
just waiting for the product to go live
and for your computer to tell you oh you
need a beefier processor or more RAM for
all this Xbox integration to work I'm
just waiting for that but anyways moving
back to the topic one of the major
things that was announced today the so
Microsoft announced two different
products two different hardware products
I'm not sure how important these
products will be to us particularly
because these are well at least one of
them is but the other one is really uh
more of a it's a I don't know it's a
jaunty it's an 84 inch TV with a 4k
display and integrated computing it's
got multi-touch multi-tenant but it's
got advanced sensors it's got built-in
cameras speakers microphones Wi-Fi
Bluetooth NFC etc let's call the
microsoft surface hub and well it's
really for business users it's it
enables two things which is one
brainstorming and another one with just
meetings with the service hub for
example you can pretty much project
whiteboard in a room and that whiteboard
is based on Microsoft OneNote and the
reason why the whiteboard turns up the
school is because a whiteboard is there
and you can either only erase what you
have or you know you can really scroll
down a physical whiteboard and you can
actually do this with this surface bub
it also allows you know different types
of collaborations with OneNote it syncs
instantly and it integrates with skype
for business for you know you can
actually have conference meetings and
you can actually activate a meeting with
one button Microsoft was making a lot of
emphasis over how meetings take up the
12 minutes to start we're here you just
have to press a button even though in
real life
take 12 minutes for us to press the damn
button and it just that that's just the
way it is but probably one of the
coolest things is you can also project
whatever you have on your phone or
tablet with the surface bug or the
computer and you can actually manipulate
and operate everything from the surface
hub and not necessarily have to operate
things from the phone or from the tablet
so it's a cool little neat product that
shows us where the original surface
concept you remember that big table
you'll never gotten about that with all
the damn table from the past this is
pretty much the maturity of the original
microsoft surface or the fact that they
they've been able to create this
productivity tool that'll most likely
cost ten thousand dollars whatever they
launched that's my problem with this
thing is i don't like how embedded it
all is it's an all-in-one device I think
Microsoft could have the smarter move
here would have been to do something
like an hdmi stick maybe with an
accessory like the Kinect that plugs
into an existing we've been necessarily
4k but a high res HDTV because these
will already exist in conference rooms
we just make it a lot more accessible a
lot more affordable that's not to say
that it doesn't look very impressive on
its own but Microsoft's choice you know
they were talking such a big game about
making it you know how the surface hub
was so so innovative and it made
everything so easy and it's all one
touch and like you know look you take
the stylus out and it automatically
starts the dry board that happen of
course it does if it didn't then it
would be dumb that's that's table stakes
that's not crazy innovation I was
expecting some some innovation that we
have the caliber that we did see on the
original surface concept where correct
me if I'm wrong guys but I think you
could like put a phone down on that
unload on the camera or a little wispy
photos and write these like bubbles
would rush over to it then it would be
like oh here's a device and it would
pulse and it'll be like okay now I'm
talking otherwise and we haven't seen
anything like that other from the
surface hub or anything else that so I
think there was sort of a missed
opportunity to really blow us away with
this and I but I do understand the
impetus for doing it you know that
Microsoft does want to sell their
services they want to be the company
that's like oh yeah we have to use
OneNote so we have to use this microsoft
thing because it works really well and
it we can snap it alongside the citrix
thing and take this diagram and drag it
over here and drop
into this note and it's great and it's
nice to have a halo kind of showcase for
that but I don't think it's going to be
a moneymaker so let's let's not forget
that this this product is not for you
mean or probably anyone oh yeah no
Microsoft is trying to appeal to those
business consumers business customers
enterprises which they are not i'm not
saying they're on their way of losing
them but they really need to come up
with a product this product to to keep
those customers happy so that's a little
bit we should all get that pub so why
not let's all brainstorm using a hub it
will probably take up half of my room
but no it's it's enough for us where
it's for the business enterprise
consumer maybe those enterprises which
have different offices in different
parties of world and so on it's it's not
for us but yeah they could have done a
little bit better I'll tell you this
much I you know I worked for two
enterprises ups being one of them and
these companies spend a lot of money on
services like WebEx I mean a lot of
money um and I feel that as Michael said
this is really a missed opportunity or
sorry Stephen where you know you're
forcing people to buy this humongous
displaying yeah it's cool i mean you
can't really just project something on a
TV and doodle on it and use a stylus and
use it as a whiteboard to that true
that's that's something you can't do but
you know if Microsoft would have used
this as a platform they would have had a
much easier selling point with a small
stick and estatus then you know to try
to sell us this huge $10,000 or whatever
that thing is going to cost but let's
just say gwai into something that is
consumer-based something that I know a
lot of people have asked for and it's a
new Microsoft browser and I'm still
skeptical over if this is really another
microsoft if it's another browser
because at no point correct me if I'm
wrong guys because I I was having a lot
of stutter with the screen that at some
point they say this is a new browser or
this is the future of internet explorer
I believe this is replacing Internet
Explorer yep I eat then yeah it's got a
new filtering engine a new look and feel
it's it's it's ground up yeah yes
this is pretty much the solution that
Microsoft is providing to everybody for
you know Brett the browsing prom with
Internet Explorer people complaining
that it's neither too slow or that it's
really not on par in it but the thing is
you know more than browsing it's a
branding problem I know and explorers
come a long way in recent years but it
still has this awful reputation going
back a decade or more it's it's time
Microsoft started fresh yeah yeah and so
okay so cool features like for example a
project Spartan allows collaboration uh
for example I don't know how useful this
is going to be but you can actually take
like it's not it's like an interactive
screenshot of a web page for example you
go to pocket now and probably you want
to discuss with your friends this cool
new post it's even just posted and so
you can doodle on it and if somebody
doesn't have a stylist that you can use
your fingers or somebody's on there or
somebody's on their phone you can
probably use your finger there or a
keyboard if you don't have a touchscreen
it allows collaboration and it even
allows you to share web pages very
easily in a sort of a way you could do
so currently on Android you just press
the share button and it gives you
different options to share things which
is cool yeah another thing another thing
yeah I know I know I mean I look that's
my question i guess like you know and
for enterprise maybe i could see the
school even the way Joe Belfiore kind of
demo did it it it reminded me of like a
Google way of presentation or something
or even just like a Microsoft Office
things like look you do an inline
annotation and then your whole team can
see what your comment is and stuff and
it's just it struck me as as utterly
uninteresting to anyone outside the
enterprise but maybe I'm just being
short-sighted because I but I can take
an android phone on an iPhone or Windows
Phone screenshot a page and do the exact
same thing I don't understand why I need
to why I would won't do it on a web page
well here's the thing right now only
only samsung phones and LG phones
actually provide that functionality
built in so the thing is this is pretty
much microsoft making it a universal
thing for any windows product which is
like for example if you want to take a
screenshot on an iphone and doodle on it
you have to take the screenshot take it
to a specific app doodle on it but it's
not interactive in life so i'm not
saying that its user born I'm
not saying that it's useful i'm just
saying that Microsoft is making this the
new standard and it's going to go across
platform so it doesn't matter if you
have a Windows Phone Windows tablet
Windows computer you can do these things
even if you're never going to use I do
like that there's an integrated offline
reader now as well and that's actually
what I was going to mention so there are
two other things that we're going to
mention number second number two is the
reading functionality and I was like oh
so first of all you get a built in
reader which you currently already have
with chrome and safari there's also a
built-in reading list which already
existed so far for the past like three
versions where you can actually read
things offline if you want cool but you
know currently this is like answering
the question to the lack of pocket on
Windows Phone and it's also got built-in
PDF support as part of the reading list
so you can probably find the PDF or is a
document that you're looking for on the
web is actually a PDF you can save it
for offline use as well couldn't you
always just save web pages for offline
viewing yeah could but it's really
cumbersome because what it does is it it
saves the HTML file and then it saves
this like huge folder yeah on the slide
and the problem with that is that works
on the computer but it doesn't work on
tablets or it doesn't work on phones
currently so again it's just finally
bringing a brat of Microsoft browser on
par with what you can drew do with
chrome and safari that's really it do we
nuts really think about the differences
in the rendering engine I don't mean to
ask something up in with a version in
the most pledge okay it was just bet it
was just said that it's it's a more on
par with the current engines that we see
but it didn't say how faster it is for
example lyceum go ahead go ahead it
doesn't say how faster it is like for
example you see in an iOS presentation
it'll tell you that the safaris new Java
Java rendering engine is five times
faster than the competition and we've
actually seen how battery efficient uh
you know uh OS 10 Yosemite is with the
Safari compared to Chrome for example
but we not none of this was mentioned
today and is that is the point i think
that that that is exactly the one thing
they should have mentioned because while
doodling and sharing and
liberation is good to be there as an
option which you probably use two or
three times within five years I'm
exaggerating the pores are it's actually
only one you are browsing the web every
day for multiple minutes or multiple
hours and you want to spend that time
mostly in consuming content and not
waiting for the browser to load the
content so I think that a speed
rendering and details like this should
have been in the presentation because
everybody wants to know how fast project
Spartan is compared to I II how fast it
is compared to the competition sure
today wasn't a very technical event I
think if we wait till build will get
those answers Emily and I we actually
have a Q&amp;amp;A question from shot at parvez
who's as he has if Spartan seems like a
better option to Chrome and you know
just to give you a quick answer probably
the only differentiate differentiation
between Spartan and every other browser
is the Cortana integration which is the
third thing that they mentioned and we
already discussed this the fact that
Cortana looks within the context of a
web page and that provides useful
information without you having to call
on Cortana that's probably the only
thing that goes beyond what print
browsers can do and Michael what were
you wanted wanting to say I don't think
that's true i mean we talked about a lot
of stuff that's partner is supposed to
be able to do that other browsers can't
but Cortana is certainly the most
visible so I sorted I sort of get what
you were saying that this question is
interesting to me because it reminds me
that the browser Wars and it should
remind all of us that the browser Wars
never really ended you know I mean in my
personal experience I started with
Internet Explorer I got really fed up
with it after a couple of years than
firefox came into the public
consciousness I was like oh wow this is
way faster and lighter and I'll use that
for a couple years then chrome came up
as i'm at firefox really slow chrome is
really light and fast and in the past
year or so chrome has just gotten so
laden with bloat and their most recent
update tripled the amount of clicks it
takes for me to go from one account to
another within chrome which is this
annoying thing that google keeps doing
keeps making things heavier and stickier
nastier and so i'm very much looking
forward to trying spark
but I think probably sixty percent of
that reason is just because oh it's new
and they haven't gotten a chance to
screw it after yeah looking for the next
to me I know and I guess the bait the
main reason why I'm now a full-time
Safari user even for this hangout is
because my god I could use the battery
and it really won't cripple the battery
like chrome does and that was one of the
biggest complaints about Internet
Explorer how it would just make your
fans go crazy on any Microsoft laptop so
so yeah that's that but in a nutshell
this is what project Spartan is we don't
have an ETA for us but we will keep you
posted how about if we move the
spotlight on this Tony I don't know if
you have any other final opinions on
this no I'm good I guess we should move
over to what everybody wants to hear
holographic hollow lens thingy and
Steven please I'm sure you fell so much
in love with this you want to talk about
it yeah this so with the past year now
we've seen this let me be more than the
past year really oculus got this started
with the oculus rift and this renewed
interest in virtual reality technologies
finally gotten to the point where it's
we're able to build devices that have
the resolution that have the speed to
make this approaching something that's
attractive these aren't like your 1993
clunky and not even texture mapped VR
graphics this looks nice you just have
been doing this in the PC with oculus
for over a year now it's moved into
phones with things like the gear VR
Microsoft out of the blue is decided to
take this to the next level with this
self-contained system they're calling
the platform windows holographic the
hardware is the hollow lens it's a
headset that has its own cpu processor
this isn't something like your view our
you plug it into your phone like oculus
rift you plug into the pc you put this
on your head and you're inside this
augmented virtual world the idea then is
that you can see these display overlaid
upon the the world you can reach out and
touch they had a really impressive
demonstration today with the user
creating a 3d model like it's reaching
out into space grabbing at pieces and
applying them to this bottle
and it looks very interested interesting
for designers gamers of course are going
to love this the ways that will use this
I don't think we can even fully
appreciate just now Microsoft talked
about scientific implications it's
working with NASA to have a simulation
of what it would be like on Mars from we
finally send astronauts there we don't
have a lot of technical details on the
hollow lens hardware just yet microsoft
tucked in general about how it's going
to have in addition to the cpu and GPU
is special holographic processor
designed for taking information about
the real world helping decrease latency
making this as fluid and experience as
possible it's all hugely ambitious and
we're just really barely touching upon
it here we're super concerned about
price obviously this is very advanced
looking hardware and we don't have a
great sense yet what it's going to cost
Microsoft insists that's going to be
affordable for home users as well as in
corporate customers but until we really
see you know make a formal announcement
of a special event just about hololens
we've been on all the details just yet
but my god this thing is impressive
looking impressive looking tell me
something am I the only guy that saw
that video of how they were building
that quarter cropped quadrocopter to be
fake just been acting set on them I mean
everything was first of all everything
was projected on a separate camera which
it you could possibly do if the API is
as robust as they're making it out to be
no you guys everything look okay wait
that camera had the glasses on and
that's why we could see the projection I
you know I don't know there are
technical confinements to doing a
presentation like that where you're like
it would be like us when we were talking
about getting a google glass unit when
they were new we were like wow okay well
that would be fun but we're gonna spend
1500 hours how are we gonna be able to
film it how are we gonna be able to see
the interface I mean you know so I
understand you know you have to it was
just like when they were showing off
windows 10 up for phones you know they
were like okay we can't run this because
the code is so young so we have to show
you an animation that approximates it I
mean you know it's whatever I get
custom that the end result is going to
look close enough to the simulation that
we what our appetites but I think they
did a really successful job of doing
that even if this is nothing exactly how
it's going to do anything though I will
say OMG go ahead Tony then I'll say man
I was about to say that I think that
this was the highlight and this this
took it home for Microsoft absolutely
it's super exciting it's super
futuristic and I'm super excited about
it it's just that I don't think that
it's for to kind of it it's not for a
kind of user like you and I are you sure
it's for the professionals for doctors
for fashion designers for astronauts for
viewing it's for the kids for gaming but
for a prosumer like us guidance not in
an enterprise not a businessman but it's
mostly working on a device it would not
be that useful to see Jaime on skype
while looking at my kitchen table
instead of just looking at home it on my
screen mmm not only that I mean I like
the concept I like the idea it's great
that's why just because it's just like
for example that whole quadrocopter
thing I mean currently designers use a
mouse and their hand is on a table and
so it's resting on a table to be able to
you know menu manipulate that same
design with a mouse pointer and have it
done compared to holding things well
holding nothing your hands in the air I
mean we've discussed over how cool
connect this but how people stop using
it after the gimmick face well not using
not stop using it fully but people just
don't like raising their hands in the
air to do things because people can
become tired of doing that you know but
I'm going to circle back digit Tony's
objections there but I don't understand
the use case for this I'd rather just
skype on my my pc or something we were
talking earlier about with the surface
hub and how businesses would use this
for teleconferencing and stuff remember
when this teleconferencing first really
took off and yes it can be very
affordable it can connect you with users
around the world without having to jump
on a plane but there was this pushback
that busy executives really one of these
face-to-face meetings there was
value placed on the descrition all
sitting around a conference table
together think about what you do with
this where instead of looking at
everyone on a screen or on your laptop
you're putting on the headset you're
sitting down around a table and it looks
like they're sitting there at chairs in
the same room with you everybody wearing
that yeah everybody in the regular
everybody in their other what if this
was the size of google glass though yeah
actually Stephen I I have a sort of a
counterpoint to that like Google glass
is is nowhere near the capability level
of this I want to acknowledge that up
front this is a you know this is a
flight a trailblazer for a new platform
and an entirely new way of thinking
about everything from gaming to meetings
to personal computing as a whole like I
mean this is a much more impressive
product than glasses conceptually but I
was forced to even as I was watching
their demo even before we knew that a
headset was involved as I'm watching the
demo video and it's very craftily
showing Holograms sprouting up from
furniture and things like that and it's
all very cool I was stealing a glance at
the actors in the video and the headgear
they were wearing and Microsoft was very
craftily shooting this thing that it was
minimized there was a lot of shadow on
the heads are behind a lot of me a lot
of from behind shots but even as I
before that video was even finished I
think I tweeted I'm like man that head
said looks like that's some intense
headgear you gotta wear it looks a
little heavy it looks yeah man so my
point is that you know people didn't
want something even as relatively sleek
and light as Google glass and some of it
was the camera some of it was the price
blah blah blah blah blah but some people
just were like no that's too weird I
don't want to put that on my head I
don't see something like this taking off
any faster but you know because of that
that's that physical inhibition well the
i guess the difference is the usage case
scenario google glass is only drink I
know Google glass is designed to be
something that Google wants you to wear
every day whereas you know the hollow
lens is really designed for specific
usage scenarios like you know a
conference call like we're talking right
now or building a specific thing and you
know once you're done you take it off I
just I I the minute we're having a
conference go like this and all three
thumbnails down
there are wearing that I'm just leaving
the comment well yeah well we wouldn't
have to we'd have little avatars so we
wouldn't be seeing each other we'd be
seeing each other's avatar and then then
that would be very cool because I would
be like really buff in like constant
uniform but but but it's like wait a
second so we're all gonna be blue and
wearing this long ponytail and speaking
and speaking Navi well you know guys I I
guess I guess we're done with the
rundown right it's well piss orgy but no
I guess we can't be done with hollow
right there's a lot of people asking
questions about it and they're not well
you find your questions there's there
was an awesome excellent tweet from from
our colleague Adam Lane who was very
excited to meet yes who followed we're
done no hollow Cortana let me oh wait
yeah yeah well you know they they had to
do when they released Cortana in
different markets they did enable
different voices so I imagine that when
we win we see this because we know we
will court you'll be able to choose what
you want court honor to be whether
whether it because they still own the
obviously it's an Xbox property it's a
Microsoft property they can make real
Cortana but also don't probably have a
dude court on another pretty good
probably dog the size paper clip you
know a clippie a clippie core tenet yeah
yes absolutely I don't know I don't know
well we've already given our opinions on
whole and so far and strange shahed odds
question of another question from source
see why asking what browser do you use
right now I well we already mentioned
that and when it's part projects partner
available we still do not know another
interesting question from coming alone
so says do you guys think that with this
new push of services they might finally
start playing nice with people who use
google um that's actually the other way
around yeah it's not Microsoft that's
that's that's the problem they have they
Google is you know is throwing up
roadblocks at every possible opportunity
and with this SMS skype messaging
integration are we going to see hangouts
pop up in there I'm not holding my
breath
and I mean that would be that's like one
of the last great unicorn dreams for me
of the entire mobile world is that
someday Microsoft finds enough finds a
way to throw enough money at Google or
or somehow get a google to play nicely
with integrating google apps and and
gmail and all that kind of stuff with
Windows Phone because that would you
know oh my god I mean I wouldn't even
have to carry metrics we will naturally
do it and I think it will come from
google side whenever microsoft and its
windows phone / windows then on phones
platform becomes big enough to be a
significant player in the game right now
its iOS Windows Phone is somehow
negligible in Google's cards no but I
know but you don't think that that's
exactly what Google the status quo that
Google is trying to preserve like they
don't want to see Windows Phone become
another competitor they will probably be
able to offer their services to
Microsoft whenever Microsoft manages to
gain a larger chunk of the market they
will I was to do it I was thinking about
that today I mean what is it why is I
think that with the windows face being
so significant I was thinking you know
what why is it that Google is so
reluctant to provide you know Microsoft
little bone here and I think it has
meaning to do with the fact that
Microsoft competes directly with google
in search which is the core business oh
I would say Google's being I didn't do
that an apple doesn't do that no I mean
Bing search has a relatively
insignificant market share compared to
Google true but it don't know it's right
it's ranked it's ranked the second
search engine ever since they are using
Yahoo Yahoo well yeah it is a second
yeah it has a small to the market I no
one is ninety percent and the other ones
ten I'm not gonna money that what but
where's the you know I'm going through
other q and A's for example dick sieves
question was already answered the next
question from source cy about Cortana on
xbox what do you think I don't see why
that hasn't already happened to be frank
I mean you know then again we're just
seeing Cortana I hit the desktop now we
know my
is not the fastest moving company so
just because it hasn't happened yet
doesn't mean it won't happen I think
it's very likely to happen and I I think
it should as for reasons we already
mentioned I think Cortana is a great
product and needs to be on as many
Microsoft products as possible I don't
have any experience with the latest
microsoft consoles but you earlier Mike
Michael were mentioning how you can just
talk to it now it's responding is it
functionally that different than Cortana
as it stands uh you mean with the voice
interface on next moment yeah it's um it
is just because you're using it more
like on the xbox with kinect at least
the way i use it you're using it more
more of like a vocal mouse pointer you
know it's like xbox select xbox go back
xbox go to Netflix so it's not like a
natural language shorts you're asking
its responding there's no back and forth
right and to be frank it's actually
quite quite inferior to Cortana in far
in so far as understanding those like
very often I'll be like your xbox
playing grand theft auto 5 and it'll be
like okay sweet what do you want to
search for on bing I'm like you we have
another interesting question from govt
air bin who says ms said windows 10
upgrade it no wait a second that that's
actually we already discussed the free
for a year okay just another one sorry
about that we have another one from
Steve who says I think smart Spartan
it's more of a rebranding of Internet
Explorer than a new browser I think so
because they were not giving us any
information on how better this browser
engine will be can we can I bring uh
there's a question another question from
Steve the audience seemed so bored at
the event a big difference from an apple
event and that is that's very true and
it's not I don't bring it up just to
just to be snarky and be like uh
Microsoft your dorks but like it's it's
really frustrating to me that most times
when i watch a microsoft event the
presentation is is I find it to be
lacking and I think some of the products
are really worth getting excited about
but the they tend to when they go bold
in a presentation they tend to go bold
in a really really nerdy way that's not
not really you know these jokes that
kind of fall flat and even if they do
Mike the audience which I don't think
they do you know I I don't think there
would be a lot of engagement there and
it's frustrating you know and it's
certainly not a problem unique to
Microsoft a lot of companies suffer
this problem but in a samsung
demonstrated a couple years ago with the
galaxy s4 it's really easy to go the
other way and just do that content on
this is not an easy thing to do and I
don't mean to trivialize it is like
every time every time I feel like we're
losing the crowd mention the Seahawks
and we'll get a chuckle out of them
right yeah yeah or like Oh a Joe
Belfiore hair joke that always plays
great like that's grown and that's it
I'll tell you this much in Microsoft's
defends Apple events are our number one
in a much larger venue um most a lot of
the people in the audience or Apple
employees uh you know you'll bid ringers
yeah Microsoft is usually the the
serious nerdy guy white apple while
Apple is always the nonconformist the
the Arctic losing their DNA I'll tell
you this much I didn't expect the
audience to go crazy over like something
like the surface hub because you know
once you project something that's really
for the enterprise how happy can
consumers be about something they're not
going to buy that's just the way it is
and the way they pertain portrayed the
whole hollow lens you know they focus
everything on how this is going to help
NASA and not everybody in the audience
must have been like oh I guess I need to
change my job or something like that if
I ever want to use it down all the ones
I mean can we answer this other one from
dex eve i know we kind of covered
cortana a lot right now but this is a
question that pertains to Windows
Windows 10 um in its bracket to you go
ahead Michael what do you think about
Cortana being implemented into your
desktop space question open to everyone
else like what do you guys see the
benefits to you having a Google now type
assistant in Cortona I think we sort of
covered that part of the question
already but if you notice the wake or
town is gonna be integrated into Windows
10 she's got a persistent search bar
right next to the start button and one
of my favorite things about OS 10 on the
Mac is that you can just hit command
space and you have the finder you can
pop up and search for anything instantly
and if Windows 10 indexes the system as
quickly as Mac os10 does and I don't
know if it will or not that's going to
be really really nice it's going to
remind people that that search bar is
there it's because it's
so here it'll always be there and then
when they click into it to search for
something they'll be reminded that
Cortana is there and then ideally I
think Microsoft to think well then why
am I even typing court on a search for
you know what sound studio and open it
up you know so I think that's gonna lead
to at least a unique user experience I
don't know if it would be worth it to
you guys would you guys find something
like that useful or you prefer to type
though I prefer to type and other things
that I searched for on my pc are rarely
natural language words like I'm not
gonna say find photoshop I know that
isn't my Star Trek for like a bright
smile extra 347 j18 right but but if
you're sliding into your chair like if
you're coming in with it with a fresh
cup of coffee and you're across the room
and like if I'm five steps with my
computer and because ik Cortana open up
what what do I use open up
iTunes or no open up Xbox music and you
have the app open by the time my butt
hits the seat I think that's cool I
think it's cool it's hard to me to get
excited about it but it's Oh take it why
not I'll tell you this much probably my
biggest complaint with Siri Cortana
Google now is the accuracy at you know
my English is not bad and even so not
most of the time but some of the times
it'll get it wrong and mainly because of
that I'm like I'm not gonna even ask
because you know there is a fifty
percent chance though that it just won't
understand what I'm asking for sizable
right fit we did see uh we didn't
mention this in the Windows Phone
section but we did see finally Cortana
starting to understand punctuation now
just like you can go anywhere it's like
hey everyone ! everyone ready for the
party ? that I do that all the time in
Android and iOS and I've it bugs me that
I can't do it on windows phone so I hope
they make that system wide and windows
phone cuz like two minutes after they
did that demo Joe Belfiore tried it in
the messaging app and it wanted to
automatically detect punctuation like it
currently does and is not very good at
so I'm like now no that's the way that's
the biggest problem and speaking of
Windows Phone up Steve Lamont has this
question that I really wanted answer at
this event aha I guess not it says that
they say flagship phones plural coming
this year I rewound that bit three or
four times because it kept skipping on
me try
to hear exactly what was being said i
don't but microsoft said we're gonna get
flagship phones i think that's a plural
but from them and other companies and
later this year at some unspecified date
there's really nothing i could pull out
of that that was an interesting factoid
besides new phones will arrive at some
point and we didn't see the exploding
tile thing when you hover your thumb
over a tile and it blows up like oh yeah
i mention that i want more windows phone
but we don't have no did you guys find
it the fake like I did the entire
conversation between Joe and and Cortana
yeah seems way too good yeah we're way
too scripted and for me that part was
fake not necessarily the the hello
presentation but that conversation right
there between Joe and Cortana that that
was like somebody's on the other end
then talking oh that was definitely
stupid oh it's just the recording so you
think that was just the record they
don't have ten Taylor do a couple of
like inserts for them and then they yeah
yeah yeah go ahead Michael no no I was
reactively making noise to hold the
floor for no reason because I'm a jerk
go ahead honey okay I think that I don't
know looks like for example shahadat has
a very interesting question that I think
would help us wrap this wrap this a
hangout up he says what do you think
that Microsoft will fill enough
expectation as rumors were very high
this time I think this is a really good
way to end our editorial round table I
don't know about you guys how about you
Tony now I think that that the buzz is
definitely there and I've been seeing
catching a glimpse of my twitter feed
and definitely their stocks went sky
high but that's how usually things
happen with presentations like this a
lot of exciting stuff to show and maybe
we are a little bit underwhelmed because
of the fact that we are mostly covering
phones and tablets and wearables and
we've heard a little too close to
nothing about those and that's probably
going to explain it I forgot what the
question is so I'm just gonna ramble on
I think a lot of exciting things and I
think there's going to be
other exciting stuff coming on at mwc
and at build you guys answer the
question I have the mighty was
definitely Tony okay I'll go last if
Stephen wants to go yeah I think we got
more or less what we were hoping for
here we heard that this would be a focus
on cross device connectivity especially
with gaming on phones we got that the
only rumors that didn't really I mean
there's the certain features we haven't
seen yet but we can always see those a
later date the only thing that we didn't
get that was I think directly teased was
news of this weird hardware the laptop
phone combo it only came out recently
this rumor and the fact that it didn't
end up panning out I don't think is a
huge surprise but yeah I think you know
nine out of ten delivered on
expectations here especially with
windows holographic which no one was
looking I mean we thought they might
have some sort of VR thing as no
specifics behind this the fact that we
got this at all I am very excited more
than I thought would be coming out of
this so good job Microsoft I think yeah
i'll pick you back on you with that
stephen i think a lot of people were
going into this event with sort of small
expectations and not not in terms of you
know diminished expectations but just
small in terms of thinking like oh we're
gonna get okay we're gonna get a new
browser and windows 10 is gonna be a new
desktop OS and we'll hear something
about Windows Phone am able to give us a
watch and you know that's kind of the
way we think a lot of the time because
you're conditioned to be like okay
what's the next product what are we
going to cover cover cover and Microsoft
instead wanted to tell this story about
windows transforming from an OS to a
lifestyle and people's relationship to
it going from utilitarian to love and
you know a lot of that is to be expected
that kind of hyperbole that marketing
departments kind of spin out and
certainly when satin ended up nadella
spoke there was a lot of buzz words
being used a lot of seamless seamless
being tossed around but you know they
packed it up with first with this
surface hub which I think was kind of a
red herring it was like oh okay here's
the new hardware okay it's a freaking
whiteboard and then 20 minutes later
they're like no but actually here we go
boom windows holographic so they backed
it up with that kind of excitement they
backed it up with some some cool stuff
like a new browser some of this stuff so
I think in the end yeah they met
they met and exceeded most people's
expectations but only in the long run
are we gonna be able to tell if if if
those expectations will continue to have
been met at because I have no idea how
that holographic stuff is gonna pass and
because I volunteered to go last because
we currently have a live viewership
roughly four times the size of the
average pocket now weekly live stream so
who can tune in the podcast on Friday
everyone cool cool that's actually you
know I wanted Michael free to give us a
preview of what else we could expect
from the podcast on Friday yes
absolutely and and we can expect a lot
more of Steven talking and telling us
exactly what went on maybe some some
cursing I imagine Jules Jules when will
it will fall over onto his side on
camera for some reason when we talk
about Microsoft and Stephen will
actually will actually have our thoughts
a little more condensed will be able to
would hope and oh yeah by then our
thoughts will be more clear exactly
exactly right so yeah tune in for that
on Friday afternoon it'll be a lot of
fun pocketnow weekly podcast can't wait
to hear and watch I guess my final
expectations a little teaser for
whatever you're gonna see later on today
I'm the pocket out daily Microsoft
edition because I guess we the only good
news or the good impression that I have
of this event is that it wasn't just one
thing that Microsoft is showing that
they are bold enough to expand to new
markets even though those are Enterprise
to bring new daring products even though
we still debate if these are going to be
useful to us at some point but I like
this Microsoft I'd like that this is not
the typical Microsoft that's focusing
just on Windows and Bing I like this so
my expectations were met to a certain
degree I guess my only disappointment is
again no devices no mobile devices no
you know no enhancements and no growth
and hardware when it comes to the
existing things that we can buy right
now with your phones and tablets and
computers hopefully we will see more on
this at MWC 2015 and we will keep you
posted guys thank you very much for
