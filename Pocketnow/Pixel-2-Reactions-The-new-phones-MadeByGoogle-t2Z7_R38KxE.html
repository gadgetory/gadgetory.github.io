to electric Boogaloo I'm Juan Carlos bag
mail here for Pocket now and it's time
to break down what's new from the phone
made by Google Google took the wraps off
a whole ecosystem of products really
taking that direct customer relationship
seriously with this made by Google
program we've got a new Google home
speaker we've got the new pixel book and
of course we've got the new phones it's
been a common trend for phone
announcements this year that we're
focusing more on the lifestyle aspect of
a smart phone rather than all of the
specs all of the tech inside I don't
know if you all remember in the video
we've just published on the iPhones
augmented reality I had this to say
we're entering the post smartphone world
where these have become more commodities
and less status symbols the next
transition will be peeling certain
services off of this glowing rectangle
metaphor apparently Google was totally
listening to me as a major part of this
keynote was focusing on the new
additions brought on by machine learning
and artificial intelligence and that's
where we find ourselves today with the
pixel to the smaller of the two phones
is gonna have a more traditional form
factor 16 by 9 1080p display it's gonna
be a little bit more petite come in
three different colors a really blue a
clearly white and a just black it's on
the larger pixel to XL that we're going
to see the taller aspect ratio screen
and that phone is only gonna come in two
color options a just black and a black
and white to tone which makes me really
excited because I used to be a big ol
scar ooh boy Google really didn't spend
a lot of time on specs and they really
weren't important to this keynote or
this discussion but we do know what's
coming down the pike we've got the
Qualcomm 835 we've got four gigabytes of
RAM 64 and 128 gigabytes storage options
and a lot of people are gonna be happy
to see the return of front firing stereo
speakers both phone screens will be
AMOLED panels the smaller one being just
a regular 16 by 9 1080p the larger pixel
2 XL moving up into a 28 80 by 1440 2 by
1 aspect ratio battery capacities not
looking terrible but also not leading
the way the smaller pixel with the 2700
milliamp hour battery cell the larger
pixel moving up to a 35 20 that one
probably given you a bit more Bank
Buc also not a surprise from the rumors
and leaks we will be getting the
squeezie action introduced on HTC u
phones a quick shortcut to get yourself
to Google assistant if that's how you
want to interact with your phone and
even though it was a selling point on
the original pixel the headphone jack is
gone unceremoniously killed during this
keynote a quick little snippet about how
you'll have some kind of adapter in the
box for your traditional 3.5 millimeter
headphones initially exclusive to the
pixel 2 but I'm sure it's gonna be going
to other phones soon Google took the
wraps off of their lens scanning system
this is going to help you figure out
things about the world around you by
using the camera on the back of your
phone tying together their wealth of
image data and machine learning this
should help you get information on
anything you point your phone camera at
of course this is going to be a very
early implementation of the service and
just like google voice search in Google
Maps they were very they were very
realistic about the capabilities of
google lens to start but like these
other products they seem to grow very
radically over time as users start
filling them with more information
photography of course a major talking
point for the original pixel launch just
as important for this one the pixel to
we'll be adding Hardware image
stabilization to what was already a
terrific camera experience now we were
pretty critical of the original pixel
for being called the best smartphone
camera ever made for obvious lens
defects and some issues with software
stabilization and low-light environments
if Google is able to correct for both of
those issues it instantly puts the pixel
too near the top of the list for a
premium consumer photography experience
the original pixel is such a favorite
for consumers because of the way that it
takes multiple images of your scene
stacks relevant information and deliver
some of the best HD are capable from a
mobile device the pixel to is going to
be taken that up a notch by delivering
portrait mode background blurring
without having that binocular depth
information the phone's gonna scan the
scene for you and intelligently pull out
objects that are in focus and further
blur the backgrounds of your shots
because that trick is all software based
that means even your selfie shots will
be able to benefit from that kind of
image processing of course that was in
all we're talking services and a major
aspect of the future of smartphone
computing is going to be augmented
reality
similar to Apple's investment in AR KITT
Google was on stage presenting AR core
again tying real world image acquisition
with machine learning to overlay
meaningful information it should
radically streamline the delivery of
augmented reality apps and services to
consumers especially as they should be
broadly compatible with most phones on
the market today one of the first
applications for AR core is gonna be
this new sticker system that you can use
through the camera app showing it off
here using some cute little animated
characters from stranger things and how
those characters are not only able to
interact with the world around them or
how so able to interact with themselves
now if that lack of a headphone jack is
getting you down Google also introduced
a first-party wireless earbuds solution
called the pixel buds ties to your phone
to introduce better real-time language
translation a demo onstage between an
English speaker and a person speaking
Swedish was actually pretty interesting
well I'll have that Hitchhiker's Guide
Babel Fish plugged into our ear whenever
we travel not a bad little perk for a
headset that's gonna cost 160 dollars
the 64 gigabyte pixel 2 is gonna start
at six hundred and forty nine dollars I
was a little bummed to see that the sort
of blue model looks like it's gonna be a
Verizon exclusive for our reviews I went
ahead and ordered a black model just
because it was unlocked and it was gonna
ship a little bit sooner if you want to
step up to the higher resolution larger
screen and the bigger battery on the
pixel to XL that's gonna add $200 8:49
is what that phone's gonna cost and both
phones should be shipping by the end of
the month pre-orders are open now so I
want to leave this video off with a
question do you find folks what are you
most excited to see coming on the pixel
to and what are you bummed that's being
left out or wasn't mentioned during this
keynote for myself personally I'm really
excited to see where they go with camera
tech and image processing that's gonna
be a huge real camera review for me I'm
always stoked to hear stereo speakers
I'm a little apprehensive about a
first-party Google product getting rid
of that headphone jack y'all know how I
loves me a good headphone jack as always
folks thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
our full pixel 2 coverage including
reviews and comparisons once these
phones are in our hot little hands
for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos bag nails
some gadget guy on Twitter and Instagram
and I will catch you all on the next
video
eventually we're not even gonna need
people in our photos we'll just have
cute little animated emoji sticker
things fight for our amusement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
