seven with an ammo let display is
actually possible motorola unveils its
indestructible droid turbo - and you can
say goodbye to international roaming
charges at least in the European Union
I'm Hyneman Ravenna and how much is the
most you've ever paid for roaming I once
paid a six hundred and fifty dollar bill
and I regret it
this is PocketNow daily the official
news today begin with Verizon and
Motorola as the companies have Justin
built their new droids for bo2 and Droid
Maxx - in the case of the Droid Maxx -
this is pretty much the Moto X play just
uh you know tropical eyes for the United
States and you get a couple of
replaceable backs and the decent
specifications but the droid turbo 2 is
the big news here Snapdragon 810 five
point four inch indestructible display
links in the description watch Michael
Fisher's hands on this is no joke
other official news come from Apple as
its quarter results are in the company
made eleven billion in profits out of 51
million in revenue compared to eight
million in profits and forty eight
billion in revenue as the same quarter
last year forty eight million iPhones up
as always but then again in the case of
the iPads they are still going down at
nine million units obviously the company
has a little to fix with its feature
products that should be launched very
soon but hey there's still more to come
from Apple and let's just see if they
could keep the rest of the momentum now
as will the spotlight over to the
European Parliament and roaming charges
as new legislation was just passed where
roaming charges will not be legal as of
2017 and yet there is a long wait but as
of April 2016 roaming charges will be
dropped significantly as well and the
whole concept here is that you could
travel within Europe as much as you want
to not have to pay for anything neither
data text messages or voice calls when
it comes to roaming these are great news
of let's just hope that it happens
worldwide at some point and you have no
idea exactly how invested Samsung is
with the Snapdragon 820 for the galaxy
s7 starting with the fact that it's
using its a 40 nanometer FinFET process
for the design and what Samsung is going
up to great lengths to fix the hole
heating issues that are reported with
its proprietary 820 processor or the
version that it's using particularly
when it comes to heat up to the point
where Samsung is a launching either a
patch on its software and its hardware
in order to fix this and if they can't
dissipate the heat with that they are
going to use heating tubes or cooling -
should I say Samsung is going to great
lengths it's clear that both companies
are collaborating for this to happen
with the galaxy s7 let's just hope the
performance actually pays off finally
the hot news that they have again to do
with Samsung and partnerships this time
with Apple Apple has been invested on
IPS LCD displays ever since we can
remember the first generation iPhone but
well things are about to change is
apparently trusted sources claim number
one that Apple is already testing
Samsung OLED panels for the Apple watch
which is interesting and the second is
that apparently both companies are
paving the way for the first-ever AMOLED
panel on an iPhone which is something
extremely weird Apple has been using LG
and sharp for years and it seems that
that's about to change so it does lead
me to the question of the day what is
your favorite display technology and why
in my case I will admit I just go crazy
over AMOLED displays I didn't at the
beginning because of the whole pentile
matrix but Samsung has done an amazing
job of this technology over the last two
years leave us a comment down below we'd
love to hear your opinion friends as
