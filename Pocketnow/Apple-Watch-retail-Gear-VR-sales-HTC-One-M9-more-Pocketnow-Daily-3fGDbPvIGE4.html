retail strategy for the Apple watch LG's
future plans might include sending the g
pro line up to rest and samson goes
official with its virtual reality dream
I'm high Meadow Ravenna and what would a
Monday be without me complaining about
it this is out daily let's begin
today with what's official I know a lot
of you are on the ropes considering the
Nexus 6 even though it is priced very
steep on AT&amp;amp;T at two hundred fifty
dollars starting and at sprint for three
hundred dollars at a starting price and
then after two-year contract but if
you're interested in the cheaper way to
start with the Nexus 6 a US cellular it
has just begun selling the phone for two
hundred dollars which is not bad at all
for what you're getting how about LG the
company has two very interesting
strategies up its sleeve you wonder
where is the g pro lineup for this year
and if you think about it well the g3 is
already so powerful you'd wonder what
they'd add to the g pro lineup it turns
out the rumors are that there won't be a
G pro anymore apparently it's going to
be put to rest but even more interesting
is that apparently LG has just ended the
GPM yeah everything's going to be called
G but it seems that they are considering
pen input for a product and if it's not
going to be the g pro than what will it
be and if you're looking for a new and
unique gaming experience notice I didn't
say better i said unique the samsung
gear vr is already on sale as of today
for twenty dollars as we mentioned even
though if you really want to play with
that thing you have to buy a controller
and other accessories but companies like
AT&amp;amp;T are offering very interesting
bundles it goes the description for
details but the i really would love to
hear from you in the comments do you
like the gear VR will you pay for it up
next let's talk about hcc we are already
expecting the HTC One m9 early next year
after mwc as was last year the year
before and interesting we have the first
leaks of the display 5.2 inches on
diagonal which is a good boost but very
interesting in the past the boomsound
speakers were actually part of the class
not part of the aluminum in the case of
the m7 so since we don't see the
speakers being part of the display
anymore we wonder what are the changes
that are coming
and probably for the very interesting
news and rumors of the day we hear that
Apple plants to sell you the Apple watch
in a different way in addition to having
very crazy precious eggs apparently
Apple is planning to hire employees that
are either from the you know jewelry
industry or from the fashion industry
and this is very interesting as Apple
has never been a company that is that
picky about the employees they choose
for the apple store it seems that they
want to do something completely
different with the Apple watch and it
makes you wonder why it makes you wonder
if that makes any difference and that
leads me to the question of the day do
you think that this strategy will help
do you think that Apple needs new types
of employees to sell these particular
products because in my case regardless
of how fashionable the Apple watch may
seem to be doesn't change the fact that
it's just a smart watch but leave us a
comment down below what do you think
friends you know the drill if you when I
get the news earlier before this video
with school machine follow us on parking
out I comment subscribe page of channel
as well you don't follow me on Twitter
hi my underscored iveta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi Natalie then I thank you
very much for watching we'll see you
tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
