pocketnow.com and something cool just
showed up at my door this is the
Motorola Atrix HD it's the third in
Motorola's Atrix line of handsets and
just showed up it got here a few minutes
ago and we're gonna give you a full
review as soon as we can but in the
meantime we figured we'd like to show
you what's inside the box
so let's get to it so taking a tour
around the box here we can see that a TN
t--'s I'll be kind and say minimalist
packaging effort is still in full force
I have to be honest it bothers me that
the normal 18t packaging is so cheap it
really doesn't help the presentation but
anyway on the front here we've got the
device pictured along with some clip art
with the Motorola and AT&amp;amp;T branding down
in the corners there nothing really
impressive nothing terribly important on
the sides here except for some call-outs
and some copyright information on the
back we've got a few call-outs to the
device's features we've got the 4G LTE
badge there the Kevlar call-out which we
will learn more about in a second smart
actions to extend battery life where
it's an Android phone of course and a
four star eco rating from AT&amp;amp;T how about
that that's great it's enough that let's
turn it over and pop it open here sorry
I got some of you apparently boom the
first thing we see is a Quick Start
Guide which we can go ahead and get out
of the way this opens like a random
acknowledge the device itself on the
Left which I'm going to take out and put
aside very carefully for a moment once
again we have the same call outs here
almost the same call outs we pull aside
the cheap cardboard and underneath here
we've just got the and dropped the SIM
card holder this is a USB cable this is
an American wall charger this is a
motorola guide on battery use and legal
notifications and things like that and
then we have a method of getting apps
that's easy
and the of course the obligatory SIM
card holder so nothing terribly
impressive in the box let's come on back
to the device here now the first thing I
noticed when I picked the phone out is
that the phone feels really hefty in the
hand it weighs in at about a hundred and
forty grams but it feels heavier because
the build is much more solid obviously
we've got the jet black version here so
I'm trying to pour as much light on it
as possible to get it to show up in the
camera the camera hump on the back
slopes down gradually instead of
abruptly on the other motorola units so
it makes it feel thicker overall but at
its thinnest point here it's still a
very respectable of 8.4 millimeters then
it's not too bad and I'm not gonna lie
after handling cheaper feeling phones
from other manufacturers it's really
really nice to hold a Motorola built
product again it feels like it could
take a beating so up front we've got a
4.5 inch 720p display it's an HD color
boost TFT LCD down below it is the ATT
globe logo here and nice and understated
counterbalance to the Motorola branding
up top up top an earpiece very difficult
to see here but there's a front-facing
camera there as well on the side a power
button and volume rocker now these look
like metal but I'm pretty sure they're
plastic based on how they feel on the
back if we can take this plastic coating
off we can we have the same kevlar
coating as is found on the Droid Razr
and the Droid RAZR MAXX which I was
really happy to see because I really
liked the look of that pattern I think
it's a really unique thing that Motorola
does there I think it gives the phone a
very high-end appearance your opinion
may very well let's see what else we got
underneath that is a non removable 1780
milliamp hour lipo battery up top there
is an 8 megapixel camera with LED flash
capable of shooting 1080p video along
with the speakerphone down below here is
the primary microphone up top we've got
the HDMI and micro USB ports along with
a three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack off to the side
and on the left here there is a slot I'm
sure there's two slots under a common
door for the micro SD and micro sim so
let's go ahead and take off the screen
protector here you have a little handy
call out there where to pull wonderful I
love doing that that's a great feeling
and will give you a first boot and then
we'll call this a video press and hold
on power
there's the Motorola logo
it's amazing what did the difference in
carrier branding can do I mean the fact
that the AT&amp;amp;T globe is just the globe
and not the Verizon check mark on the
Droid Razr is very nice more understated
just by virtue of being a different logo
so we've got some interesting animations
happening on the motor oil icon
here's AT&amp;amp;T is carrier splash screen
it's blowing out the white balance a
little sorry and we are live at the
lockscreen there boom
we're gonna have a full review as soon
