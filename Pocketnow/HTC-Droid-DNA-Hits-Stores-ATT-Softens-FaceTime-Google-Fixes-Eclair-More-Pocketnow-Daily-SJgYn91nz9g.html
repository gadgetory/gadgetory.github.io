AT&amp;amp;T softens up a little bit more on
FaceTime and goole fixes another bug on
Android but two years later I'm hi
Marietta wondering if there will be
turkey for dinner and this is PocketNow
daily I know we've teased you enough
with all the coverage that we've given
to the HTC droid DNA on verizon with our
review and comparisons but as you heard
in our pocket our weekly podcast we're
just getting started there's a lot more
content coming up but if you're sure
that this is the device for you well
it's now being so long horizon for just
two hundred dollars after a two-year
contract if you consider everything that
you're getting out of the box with a
stone I'd really consider that a really
good deal for this holiday season 80
seems to be getting more thought on
facetime over cellular data for iPhones
if you remember they loosened up a bit
for the iphone 5 on tiered data plans
recently and apparently we also have
reports now that iphone 4s customers are
now being able to get facetime over
cellular and also we've got cases of
people even having grandfather unlimited
data plans also getting face time of
your shoulder so is that your case
please leave us a comment down below now
if you're currently on the ropes trying
to figure out if you should get a nexus
7 or a nexus 10 this holiday season we
don't blame you these are two great
tablets and two great price points and
don't leave I just took the time to
compare them both in a video and he even
added the old generation Motorola Xoom
into the video because after all this
was Motorola's first tablet even though
that was android 3.0 honeycomb and yeah
we all hated that but there's a really
good comparison here that will help you
make up your mind so far I'll be honest
with you I kept the Nexus 7 but still
the Nexus 10 is really cool you should
definitely consider it now rumors of the
galaxy s4 bien well right after the
galaxy s3 was launched but this time the
new reports have Sampson working on
bringing their display technology to the
same 441 pixels-per-inch and 1080p
resolution that we have on the HTC droid
DNA but apparently Samsung is having a
little trouble being able to port their
Super AMOLED technology into these many
pixels per inch though there is still a
lot of time to wait for the galaxy
for probably may next year though we are
waiting to probably be teased on
something on either CES 2013 or mwc 2013
we'll keep you posted and finally for
the ridiculous news of the day back in
april 2010 and I didn't get that wrong
that's april 2010 an android 2.1 eclair
customer complain on a support thread in
google about the fact that his device
was having trouble resolving domain
specially over Wi-Fi and what lots of
complaints in 938 days later google
finally responded to this customer
saying hey yes we've acknowledged that
we found the bug and we're going to send
out a software update to fix it which is
ridiculous because there's no guarantee
that first of all that device will ever
get the update and second the customer
most likely doesn't have the device
anymore so that leads me to the question
of the day how do you feel about the
fact that you're not really sure if
you're gonna get the next version of
android or any upgrade because you know
the way things are with android but in
my personal case i always stuck to nexus
devices just to avoid the drama but ever
since i started using the galaxy s3 is
my daily driver i'll be honest with you
i really hate the fact that i'm still
stuck on Ice Cream Sandwich show he was
a comment down below and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening at a smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on pocket
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm home
every better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
