seven and some of the rumoured
specifications according to many eco the
Galaxy S 10 will have a good year
outperforming the s nine and Apple is
still king of smartwatches with the
Apple watch going crazy in numbers last
quarter I'm Jaime Matt Rivera and the
certain person that edits this video is
actually going to be in New York
tomorrow
so how about an episode of the recap
with them would you like that what is
know in the comments this is marking out
daily sponsored by the huawei mate book
their team the official news today begin
with deals sort of I mean if you want to
get yourself a razor phone to it's
currently on Best Buy for 500 bucks will
the bundled Cricut service but the cool
part is you don't really have to use the
Cricut service if you don't want to you
can just use the phone because it's
actually unlocked it's a great price and
I feel that it's a good phone for it now
let's talk about Google duplex that
service that helps you answer calls and
do many other things it's currently now
available in the United States obviously
it'll allow you to order tables and make
reservations and this and that I'm
really looking forward to giving it a
try I mean it look really good at Google
i/o and we saw it let's just see if it's
as good in the real world now let's talk
about wearables believe it or not the
company that is still king of this
department
even if hard to believe in the price tag
is Apple with the Apple watch according
to the IDC 60 million units were shipped
by Apple which we assume is shared
between air pods and the Apple watch and
ten point four million of these were the
Apple watch obviously they don't specify
which variants or anything but it's
followed by Xiaomi and every other
company afterwards hopefully more
competition comes now let's talk about
the Samsung Galaxy S 10 it's pretty much
in the hands of everyone as of tomorrow
some of you are already getting it now
according to recent analytics of it
didn't perform as great as many people
were expecting but it has outperformed
the Galaxy S nine and many Kuo is
forecasting that it will sell between 40
to 30 to 40 million units anyways so yes
it'll do better than the galaxy s 9
which is great I do feel that it's a
great phone
stay tuned for our full review we're
just waiting for a final software update
which is the correct way to do the
review and finally the hottest news
today have to do with the 1 plus 7 we've
got final 3d renders in video of what
the device might look like it follows
pretty much everything that we've seen
with the mechanical camera at the top of
the triple cameras at the back we hear
that these cameras will be of 16 and 20
megapixels if I got that right and then
the third sensor is actually a
time-of-flight sensor which is gray
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 and obviously
crazy specifications as oneplus usually
does listen on the comments down below
what do you think do you like what you
see in these renders or not cuz uh I
like him a lot
I'm just concerned about the water
resistance that existed before and that
it probably will go away I'm hoping it
doesn't keep today's episode of the
pocket now Daly is made possible by the
huawei mate book 13 even if Huawei is
relatively new to this category last
year's mate book X pro was crowned the
king of laptops by many publications the
baby book 13 is slightly smaller but
with 88 percent suite to body ratio the
most up-to-date internals of 2019 10
hours of battery life faster and smarter
charging them most thanks to its 65 watt
adapter included and best of all starts
at $9.99 for the Core i5 and $12.99 for
the core i7 with the sweet graphics
