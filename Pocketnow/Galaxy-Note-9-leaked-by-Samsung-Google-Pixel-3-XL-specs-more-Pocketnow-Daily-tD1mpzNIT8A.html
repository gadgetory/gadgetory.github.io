nines pricing details in an accidental
video again we get some benchmarks of
the Google pixel 3 Excel and the RAM
seems to be something we should worry
about and for those of you that think
that Apple is dying well the company
just reached the record trillion dollars
I'm hey Mary Vetta and please join me in
welcoming my great friend none other
than mr. Joshua Vergara is our new
podcast host I know right this just got
awesome this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with invent
invitations as a Sam sang has just let
us know that there will be an event at
Aoife those of you that don't know well
Samsung is probably one of the largest
events to happen at Aoife every year but
it's usually focused on wearables and we
were expecting the Samsung Galaxy watch
to be announced that unpacked this makes
me think that we are gonna have to
actually wait for that but hey you never
know we'll learn in a just a few days
now let's talk about a very interesting
twist that just happened from Google as
a the company has apparently been
working on launching their camera
application to pixel to the pixel book
and to some Chromebooks and the reason
why this is weird is because I don't
understand what we're gonna do with the
Google camera app in Chromebooks but we
do know that this is the camera
application that allows great
photography from the pixel to pixel to
excel and even phones have you side load
that application so it also makes me
think that that we might be getting that
application for Android in general that
would be awesome
and speaking of Google in a very
interesting twist we also have
benchmarks of what to expect for the
Google pixel 3 pixel 3 Excel and well
I'm kind of worried obviously the
Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 is gonna make
this phone awesome that is great on its
own but we're hearing 4 gigabytes of RAM
again and I'm trying to I'm scratching
my head over this as of right now the
pixel to excel is great but it's not the
fastest phone you can totally tell the
difference lately as of software
continues evolving so let's just see
what Google pulls out for you know
that's to be good now let's talk about
Apple for all of you that consider that
the company's going down held
cuz yeah it's not innovating and this
and that well the company just reached
the market cap of a crazy 1 trillion
dollars I believe that to be the
first-ever trillion dollar company in
history and just let that simmer a
little this is a company that only
builds a few phones a few computers and
a few other products and software and is
worth one trillion dollars I can't wait
to see what they do with those trillion
bucks over time as I hope they invested
more R&amp;amp;D and come up with some better
products we'll see and finally the
interesting news they have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 as pricing
details were just teased by the company
in a video that was pushed and then
pulled I'm not sure exactly what was the
thing there the video is still out there
you can find it and we have things like
the fact that the price is not going to
change is gonna remain at nine hundred
and twenty something dollars depending
on your carry you know that fluctuates
but yeah more than nine hundred bucks
then you have the option for the 512
gigabyte variant that's apparently gonna
cost over 1200 that seems to be kind of
crazy you know the price point for the
more expensive one but let us know in
the comments what do you think about the
Galaxy Note 9s price do you think that
it's worth it to pay so much money for
this phone particularly for the extra
storage in my case I don't know you have
expandable storage it's just hard why
would you want so much but that's just
me leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
