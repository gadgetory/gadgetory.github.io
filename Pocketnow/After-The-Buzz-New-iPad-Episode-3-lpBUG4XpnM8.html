when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappears
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say about the devices
they wear a min over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of a review to see how
they feel after a couple weeks so let's
do something about it let's look at a
device several months after its release
when it's no longer shiny and new I'm
Brad a minimun from pocketnow.com
and this is the new iPad and this is
episode three of after the bus
it was back when I received the first
iPad that I immediately began dreaming
of the new iPad that is an iPad with a
higher resolution display you see the
iPad became so intertwined with my life
that it actually caused me eye strain
I'd use it to check email read The Wall
Street Journal browse the web watch
videos and so much more for me the iPad
is a third device between smartphone and
laptop or desktop fulfilled my needs for
a more casual computing experience I
don't mean this to sound corny but the
iPad changed my life and allowed me to
get more work done in more places
subsequently all of this time in front
of the original iPad which amounted to
several hours per day hurt my eyes
because of the low resolution display
text was fuzzy the same was true on the
iPad 2 text looks fuzzy then the iPad 3
was announced with an insane resolution
of 2048 by 1536 a resolution higher than
the 24 inch monitor I used for work was
it the end of my eye strain well let's
talk about hardware first in a rare move
that defies apple's ongoing design
philosophy of thinner and lighter the
new ipad is thicker and heavier than its
predecessors to allow for a bigger
battery does this matter absolutely in
fact the new ipad is awkward to hold
because of its weight and thickness
using the smart cover to prop the device
on a table does help but when you're
reading in a bed or while leaning back
there's nothing to rest the smart cover
on you're just holding it in the air as
with dirt and fingerprints the new ipad
is resistant to both thanks to the
materials used just be sure not to drop
your ipad on a hard surface as it's
likely to crack the display in fact in
our official pocket now drop test we
found the new ipad to be particularly
front heavy so it's likely to land on
the glass should you drop it
accidentally you're definitely gonna
want to get a case with a new iPad
inside the new iPad as a beefier process
or the a5x with quad-core graphics any
dual-core CPU it would seem the new GPU
is designed to push all 3.1 million
pixels and allow the new iPad to provide
a snappy experience but in reality it's
gaming that's highly impressive if
you're playing a title optimized for the
new Retina display as you can see here
textures are console quality and
rates are very high beyond gaming
there's a little to no difference
between the iPad 2 and new iPad in terms
of day-to-day performance which is
really disappointing apps open a little
bit faster and webpages come in a little
bit more swiftly but only by a very
small margin let's talk about apps by
now we're happy to report that most
popular apps have been optimized for the
Retina display which is a great thing
because apps that aren't updated look
green
on the iPad 2 or iPad 1 reading text on
the new iPad is an absolute joy words
look printed on the page reading digital
magazines newspapers and websites on the
new iPad is literally a revolutionary
experience the clarity of the display is
at at times indistinguishable from the
quality you would get with print
publications this is how tablet
computing should be and my eye strain is
gone I'm happy to report even after
hours of reading on the new iPad also
we're really loving how iPhone apps look
much better on the iPad even one blown
up a double-sized thanks to the new iPad
taking advantage of the 960 by 640
resolution iPhone apps instead of 480 by
320 resolution that we saw for blowing
up apps on the iPad 2 an iPad one we're
loving the LTE connectivity on the new
iPad I opted for the Verizon version not
only because Verizon's LTE network is
more ubiquitous than 18 T's but because
the Verizon LTE iPad has the unique
ability to work on AT&amp;amp;T s 3G network if
you pop in an AT&amp;amp;T Micro SIM
we also love how easy it is to buy data
on the iPad no contracts here just input
your credit card information in the
cellular data setting and you're ready
to go if you're trying to choose between
the Wi-Fi and 4G version of the iPad we
encourage you to spring for the 4G
version even if you don't think you need
it right away you'll be glad you have it
for when you do need it and it will help
to increase your resale value now on to
battery life Apple promised unchanged a
battery life between the iPad 2 and the
new iPad and they were right on average
I charge my iPad every 5 to 7 days and
that's after about 1 to 2 hours of usage
per day remarkably over LTE battery life
seems to decrease at the same rate as
one over Wi-Fi now because the iPad is
such a large bed
it takes much longer to charge up to
seven hours to be exact this has changed
my usage a bit whereas before I take a
break from using the iPad and stick it
on the charger to get a good 40 to 50
percent charge but the new iPad an hour
isn't enough to get much above the 15 or
20 percent mark I try to charge the new
iPad at night so he can get a full 100%
power we can say that with confidence
now three months after its release and
after the bus has worn off that the new
iPad is the best tablet money can buy
right now it's got the X it's got the
display and while it's not the thinnest
or lightest tablet and/or the most
customizable you'll want to look to
Android for that it's unparalleled in
its ability to offer the most
well-rounded user experience and with
iOS 6 coming up iPad buyers can be
confident that there's a fair amount of
new and exciting stuff coming to the
iPad in just a few months it's just a
bit disappointing that iOS 6 has the
same look and feel as it has had for
years now with rows and rows and rows
and rows of icons this has been branded
in a min with pocketnow.com

months please leave a comment down below
