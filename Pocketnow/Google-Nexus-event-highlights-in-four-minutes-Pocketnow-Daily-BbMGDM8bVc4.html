Huawei in Nexus 5x from LG we get two
new chromecast models that plan to
improve your current experience and
google also surprised this with a new
pixel tablet I'm Hina Rivera and let's
try to condense all of googles event in
just a few minutes of highlights this is
parking out daily all news today are
official but let's begin with the
biggest surprise with just Google's new
pixel seed tablet it's not a Chromebook
it's actually an Android tablet that
brings the pixel branding to Android
tablets now the cool thing about this
product is well it brings the Chromebook
pixel elements like for example the fact
that its squared that it's got the
external battery indicator but even
cooler is the $149 keyboard accessory
because well it attaches magnetically it
aligns magnetically it's somehow it's
able to stand the tablet magnetically in
ways that we would love to see it
doesn't have a kickstand in addition to
that it's got this a Ninan video
processor it's got a 10.2 inch display
and for 499 it has to be hot let's see
what we get and yes I should have
started the show with the news that
everybody was waiting for when are your
current Nexus device is going to get
Android 60 marshmallow the answer is
actually next week and we are rather
surprised this google is coming back to
its roots Nexus 5 Nexus 6 Nexus 7 and
Nexus 9 in addition to the Nexus player
are getting their updates 26 thought oh
we don't know exactly which they in
particular or if it'll all happen on the
same date knowing google it won't but
stay tuned we can't wait to give it a
try and give you our full review of that
other products announcements include a
new google chromecast or should i say to
but let's stick to the most important
news it still costs 35 bucks but the
cool thing about this chromecast this
it's more powerful it's got a new UI
it's got new services and new
capabilities and yet it's still the same
price tag but even cooler is this new
google chromecast Audio because it
intends to take on sonos but for $35
you're going to make your average
speakers at home be smart speakers that
are connected to Wi-Fi through again
your google chromecast Audio so these
are two new cool gadgets they're
available for pre-order let's
see if you're able to nab one because
I'm sure they're gonna outsell
immediately we also have two new major
updates to number one Google Play Music
now you get a family plan for 1499 to up
to six users which is pretty much what
Apple music does cool but even more
interesting more updates to Google
photos the whole rumors that we covered
recently on labeling for contacts for
you to be able to find photos as
specific people is now their shared
albums is also another feature that is
up there which will allow you to as it
says share albums with people get
updates and everything really cool
updates that are being brought by Google
photos but in addition to that you'll
now be able to cast your photos to any
cast enable product which is again
another cool update and these should be
available for Android later this weekend
iOS and the web suit and finally the
very hot news of the day are obviously
the two new google nexus smartphones the
nexus 6p from huawei the nexus 5x from
LG in the case of the 5x you are not
getting a mid-ranger you are actually
getting a flagship with lesser specs so
you get the same Snapdragon 808
processor that currently runs the Moto X
in the LG g4 which is great you also get
again 16 and 32 gigabyte options you get
a fingerprint scanner obviously these
are polycarbonate design for you get
various color options and the very
interesting camera sensor from Sony that
we can't wait to give a try but in
addition to that obviously the Nexus 6p
from Huawei is the hottest ticket living
them design got this major camera hump
for that same Sony sensor it seems but
we have a 5.7 inch AMOLED panel a great
pixel resolution options for 32 64 and
apparently 128 gigs we have to confirm
that but yeah these options are
available for the Nexus 6p these
products will be available for pre-order
and you can get them soon but it leads
me to the question of the day what do
you think were the hottest news for
today was it the new nexus smartphones
the new pixel see tablet in my case it
was actually everything particularly the
new chromecast but yeah I'm very
intrigued by that pixel see tablet
because of that keyboard and I'm
definitely considering the Nexus 6p but
