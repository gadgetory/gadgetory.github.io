Plus show that we shouldn't worry about
specs Apple seems to be silently
limiting the CPU on old iPhones for some
odd reason and Blackberry earnings don't
seem to slouch after the company's new
push I'm high metal even out I was
supposed to be back and undo dust today
but it seems United wants me to stay an
extra day nola and I'm not gonna
complain this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with deals of
you're in the market for any iPhone
right now t-mobile is probably one of
your best options there is a buy one get
one free deal right now for the iPhone 8
that's enticing even more interesting if
you want the iPhone 10 there is actually
a trade and option available you can
learn more in the description now about
blackberry the company has just posted
its quarter results and for those of you
the thought you should worry about
blackberry it's very interesting once
you dig into the numbers first of all
the company reports that 25% of its
revenue is down but once you start
digging into the amount of profit their
profit is currently at 74% which is kind
of crazy I hope I got the numbers right
but most important is great to see that
the whole partnership between TCL and
blackberry and the company's push into
software has you know worked because
this is one of those brands we really
don't want to go away and speaking of
earnings for those of you that are
scratching your heads over why Samsung
is Apple's primary partner in the OLED
displays for the iPhone 10 there's a big
number involved analysts are confirming
that Samsung is pretty much going to
make twenty billion dollars in revenue
from this whole screen operation it just
shows you how these companies get along
and it's just funny to see everybody
just going at themselves in the comments
over the iPhone is better or the galaxy
is better and then Samsung and Apple are
just happy at each other just helping
each other out enabling their products
because that's the latest market
actually works
now speaking of Apple we've got some
very interesting news that emerge from
Geekbench where there are some forums
that are claiming that there are
problems in the performance of the
iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 and some
benchmarks have just proven that after
the recent software updates to these
phones the processor is being
modeled by Apple and the claims have to
do with battery life apparently Apple is
trying to preserve and provide better
battery life but doing so at the expense
of performance I haven't really tested
it out on either our iPhone 7 or unit
because it's not with me so let us know
in the comments if you're dealing with
performance issues after this update
because I don't think it's gonna go away
and finally the very hot news today have
to do with the Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus
there are some benchmarks from this
phone for those of you that were worried
about things like 4 gigabytes of RAM on
the smart phone according to this
benchmark it's 6 gigabytes of RAM but
then it makes us wonder if that's going
to be the case for the galaxy s 9 the
regular size variant as apparently that
one's going to stick to four gigs
processor snapdragon 845 in addition to
the X and O's 9810 so we can expect the
best top-of-the-line second-generation
10 nanometer process here but it leads
me to the question today I mean what do
you think about the specifications in
these benchmarks do you think that
Samsung is going the right route or do
you think that the company should push a
little harder because in my case you
know I feel that Samsung does a great
job at not catching up but not in this
case I mean why not something even
better leave us a comment down below we
would love to know your opinion friends
