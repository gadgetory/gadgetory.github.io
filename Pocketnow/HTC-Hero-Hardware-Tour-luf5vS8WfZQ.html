now calm and this is the hardware tour
of the android-based HTC hero we're
taking a look at this device from the
perspective of a windows mobile user so
let's go through the hardware now the
device is covered in white paint
although the hero will also come in
black it's got a Teflon coating on back
which gives it a really good feel in
hand it doesn't feel like you're going
to drop it like some of the other
devices out there with a very shiny
coating it's kind of a hybrid between
smooth plastic and the rubbery coating
you find on say the t-mobile dash or a
lot of other devices now come with that
sort of coating it's got a metal ring
around the screen which gives it a high
quality look and feel it's got the chin
which makes it feel like a good phone in
hand kind of like the old style flip
phones that really felt good when you
rested it against your face so the chin
is pretty neat let's go around the
device and take a look at what we have
up here we have the speaker grill with a
light sensor to regulate screen
brightness the screen is 3.2 inches
diagonal and is 480 x 320 resolution
this is a resolution that windows mobile
does not support it's the same
resolution as the iphone as the palm pre
and as the g1 the first Android device
that came out so let's zoom in to the
buttons down here and I should also
mention that the screen has the a
coating that will prevent grease and
fingerprints from accumulating on the
screen like the iphone 3gs so we'll have
to see if that actually works well down
here we have a call start and call end
button menu home back and search and
this button will actually also power on
and off the device and take it out of
standby and here we have a trackball
which also illuminates that acts as a
status light so if you have a new email
or misc aww you'll see this this item
glow right here let's go around the
device on the left side just like other
HTC windows mobile devices such as the
you know the touch HD we have the volume
rocker it's kind of flush on the bottom
we've HTC's x tu as a V port which will
work with all year mini USB accessories
here's the microphone whoops going over
to the other side we have nothing there
and on the top we have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which is great and this
is how you take off the back you stick
your finger in out now in there and pull
back now the camera is 5 megapixels with
autofocus there's no flash unfortunately
and here is the speaker grill now let's
take off the back battery cover and see
what we have underneath it's very
interesting to see a back battery cover
have a curve in it not many devices have
that so back here under the battery is
the slot for the sim card we have the
slot for the microSD memory expansion
here and the battery is of size thirteen
hundred and fifty milliamp hours so
we'll have to take a look and see how
great battery life is on the HTC hero so
that pretty much does it for the
hardware tour of the hero we're going to
be back soon more with lots of video
content about the sense UI and how it
compares to touch flo 3d and other phone
interfaces that you may know that's it
for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
