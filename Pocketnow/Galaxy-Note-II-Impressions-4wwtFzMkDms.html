pocket now calm Samsung has finally
announced the Galaxy Note 2 and in this
video I'm going to tell you what I think
about it let's get to it doh Samsung
truly defined a category when they came
out with the original Galaxy Note the
5.3 inch phablet that many people were
skeptical about many of you more
skeptical about it because even to use
this device as a phone is a little bit
ridiculous holding it up to your ear
kind of looks like you're holding up a
large brick like device to your head to
make a phone call but the sales numbers
have shown that people really like the
large screen form factor of the galaxy
note and so Samsung is obviously going
to do another one of them the Galaxy
Note 2 has an even larger screen instead
of five point three inches we get a 5.5
inch screen but here's where it gets
interesting the Galaxy Note 2 is less
narrow and a little bit more tall how do
they do that well it's because they
change the screen resolution to 1280 by
720 instead of 1280 x 800 giving it a
longer 16 by 9 aspect ratio which will
be nice when you watch youtube videos
and other 16 by 9 content you won't get
black bars on the galaxy note 2 but that
also means that the screen density the
PPI will be a little bit lower on the
original Galaxy Note you had about 280
PPI and on the galaxy note 2 you're down
to about 267 265 so technically the
screen will be slightly less clear but
it still should be quite nice because
it's Super AMOLED HD and it's no longer
pentile which is fantastic now just like
the original Galaxy Note Samsung has put
a lot of power into the galaxy note 2
it's got a 1.6 gigahertz quad-core
exynos CPU that's faster than the galaxy
s3's quad-core exynos chip which should
make for amazing performance they're
also adding 2 gigabytes of RAM so
there's no doubt that the Galaxy Note 2
will be one of the fastest smartphones
ever now one of the problems with the
original Galaxy Note was the software
they have this S Pen
which did some things but the its usage
was relatively limited the accuracy of
the s-pen was never that amazing and the
use case scenarios really weren't there
but with galaxy note 2 Samsung has
really bumped up the software which i
think is going to be fantastic it's
running on jelly bean Android 4.1 and
it's got a handful of really cool
features that I just think will make a
big difference for example little things
there's something called pop up note so
imagine you are making a phone call and
you need to take a note you take out the
stylus on the galaxy note and a little
notepad pops up so you can quickly write
down some information there's some other
cool stuff like pop up view so that when
you're in an email and you're using the
stylus which by the way has been
redesigned to be thicker and longer and
have a better grip because the galaxy
the original Galaxy Note cannabis has
this flimsy s-pen when you're hovering
over an email you can actually see
little previews of what the email
message contains the same can be said
when you are looking at your schedule or
when you're looking at a video or photo
gallery so that really reduces the
amount of times that you need to click
also you can draw in a lot more places
you can draw right into an EML you can
draw right onto your calendar and really
take advantage of those natural use case
scenarios where you just want to write
something down so what do i think about
the samsung galaxy note 2 I think
Samsung did exactly what they should
have done they made something that's
great even better by making it faster a
little bit thinner unfortunately it's
taller so it's going to be a little bit
more cumbersome in your pocket than even
the original note but most of all
they've improved the software leg should
be gone thanks to jelly bean and the
utility and the usefulness of the s pen
has been dramatically increased because
you can use it in a lot more places and
that's really what it should be about
the Galaxy Note should be about notes
and natural interaction and handwriting
so what do you think about the samsung
galaxy note 2 are you going to get it
let us know in the comments in the post
on pocket now if you like this video
please give us a thumbs up and thanks
for watching that's it for now
