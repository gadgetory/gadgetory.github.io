from pocketnow.com and it looks like 3d
is the new 2d well we have talked about
3d a lot of times before even in our
pocket now pocket cast and the opinions
are separated something that 3d is a
gimmick some say 3d is the future of
technology and soon we will all have 3d
displays whether it's on our walls or in
our pockets so 3d is the future and we
are here with a 3d enabled smartphone
it's not the world's first 3d enabled
smartphone that was the sharp links but
this one was announced at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona this year by LG
it's called the lg optimus 3d and we
will be unboxing this beast right now so
stay tuned
it wasn't such a long time ago that 3d
was a novelty and if you recall well I'm
sure that she went to the cinemas
wearing those fancy 3d glasses but 3d
has made its way into our lives in the
shape of smartphones and it will be
funny to wear some 3d enabled glasses to
watch 3d content on your smartphone but
thankfully there's a new technology in
displays which allows for glasses-free
3d viewing and it interpolates the left
and the right channels without the need
of funky color glasses bubble wrap
we've got here the lg optimus 3d beyond
dual core 3 jul 10 2013 the as being one
of the fastest smartphones with a glass
is 3 3d let's take a look at the box
we've got a nice red box and it
resembles the Verizon packaging we've
got a LG logo at the top of course 3d
logo with the beyond dual core and 3d
wall technology dual core dual channel
jolt memory you can see embossed the
shape of the smartphone with the four
capacitive buttons LG logo on the top
nothing on the bottom nothing on the
left and on the right and let's take a
look at some specs we got the Texas
Instruments OMAP 4 processor which is a
dual-core processor we got Android 2.2
Froyo and hopefully this will be
upgradeable to 2.3 Gingerbread or 2.3.4
to the latest one we got glasses three
3d we got five megapixel dual cameras
which is a must so you have to have a
stereoscopic camera at the back of your
smartphone if T once you record your own
3d content and this smartphone record
its own 3d content it plays it even back
on its own 3d screen and even via its
HDMI out to another screen what else we
have here we have YouTube 3d which will
be interesting to see in our software
review we've got DLNA which is among so
it's on almost every LG smartphone
nowadays we got Dolby we've got davecs
and we've got hdmi of course bluetooth
Wi-Fi and so on and so forth but let's
take a look at what's in the box
we got the smartphone itself which we
will leave for the moment let's just
take a little bit of zooming in and
let's see what we have here of course we
have a charger and this is the UK plug
because this comes from the UK and we
thank our friends over at clothes that
code that UK for giving us the review
unit we've got some literature user
guides
troubleshooting guide we've got a micro
USB cable or syncing and charging which
is always handy we have a battery which
is off let's see how many milliamp hours
fifteen hundred and forty million powers
ok and we've got your obligatory
headphones which appeared to be noise
cancelling headphones with controls on
the cable for microphone and some
playback what else is in the box nothing
else is in the bottom of the box is
empty let's take a look at the smart
phone and this thing is rather big so if
you've gotten used to the HTC hd2 or the
HTC hd7 this is around the same it's
pretty pretty lightweight but it feels
large in hand I mean I don't have small
hands but take a look it almost feels my
bottom we'll take a look at the
smartphone closer in our hardware tour

the lg optimus 3d this was Anthony
