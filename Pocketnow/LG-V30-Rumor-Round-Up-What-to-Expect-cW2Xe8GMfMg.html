our favorites for their focus on content
creation and multimedia we have our
invites for the press events on August
31st in Berlin to see what LG is going
to deliver for their next-generation
phablet its LG v 30 rumor roundup time
goodbyes ticker
hello taller screen the V 30 is getting
stretched to that 2x1 aspect ratio so it
doesn't make a lot of sense to dedicate
even more space on the front just to
include a secondary display what we're
really excited to find out though is if
the V 30 will get info LED display
there's been some talk behind the scenes
about daydream compatibility and that
means walking away from an LCD we
haven't seen an OLED on an LG since the
Flex 2 and the problems with the Flex 2
really didn't have anything to do with
the screen was actually a pretty decent
screen looking at some of the design
rumors since the g4 LG struggled to
really nail that cohesive brand
aesthetic the V 20 arriving is a
charmingly ugly experiment something of
a mishmash between old blackberries and
the LG g5 but the g6 was a phenomenal
step in the right direction delivering a
lot of the design cues consumers seem to
be responding to given that critical
success and the taller display aspect
ratio we're not really going to be
surprised when the V 30 arrives looking
like a g6 like a g6 like a g6 I only
have a few more months where I can have
use that joke a small concern from some
of those renders the subtle curves at
the edges of the glass for the screen
might make it harder to fit this device
with a screen protector not a lot of
phones anymore coming with that flat
front face the internals probably won't
be too surprising for a flagship phone
in 2017 the resolution on that front
face a wider quad HD 2880 by 1440 it's
very likely this is going to come with a
Qualcomm 835 in tow and likely launch
with 64 gigabytes of built-in storage
may be an option taking us up to 128 and
we're unlikely to see much of a battery
bump the V 30 probably arriving with the
same 3200 milliamp hour capacity but
instead of a removable back for that
water resistance this battery will be
built into the phone now what we don't
know is if LG is going to continue this
feature fragmentation between different
markets some areas getting wireless
charging other areas getting the quad
acker 6 gigabytes of RAM we're hoping
this phone continues to try
record of v-series phones being the
everything in the kitchen sink crown
jewel flagship devices in that all areas
will get to play with all goodies of
course one of the main features people
are going to be looking for the dual
cameras on the back it's very likely
we're going to see matched 13 megapixel
shooters just like we've got on the back
of the g6
so we are hoping that they'll increase
the sensor size given the additional
volume inside this larger phone
if these renders are accurate this is
also the closest we've seen these two
image sensors positioned next to each
other we think it's pretty likely
there's going to be a normal field of
view and the second sensor is going to
be an ultra wide we don't think LG is
going to shift over to a zoom sensor
like on the iPhone but given LG's
prowess in photo manipulation maybe
putting the two sensors closer together
might be able to deliver some of those
software background blur depth of field
tricks that last major bullet point for
a V Series phone it's got to have killer
audio for the headphone jack we need
that high quality DAC feeding a
beautiful signal to a killer amp that
can really drive your headphones and of
course we also need that multi
microphone array not just for recording
high-quality audio notes but then also
for your video being able to tune those
microphones to capture your source
what's less likely is whether or not
we'll see any significant improvements
to speaker tech given the form factor
changes we think it's unlikely that
they're going to try and pack in stereo
speakers this round
that brings us to pricing and shipping
it's looking pretty legit that the V 30
is going to be available sometime around
September 15th in South Korea launching
later in the United States possibly at
the end of September how much is this
thing going to cost it's a tricky
question to dig into right now rumors
are pointing somewhere around 800,000
South Korean one one not one if you hit
the exchange rate that's close to $700
US but compared to the competition the
new iPhone the Galaxy Note 8 coming out
we don't think a higher price would be
completely unjustified in this market
that and the v20 launched closer to $800
when it came out last year it's still
over $800 if you shop it on AT&amp;amp;T but the
last major point for any LG product
release and the question I want to throw
out you find folks is let's say the V 30
is the baller most coolest phone that's
ever been released
do we think LG is actually going to back
it up with a savvy ad can
pain to go out there and reach those
consumers the v20 had the benefit of the
note 7 mostly being absent from store
shelves last year and yet we still very
rarely saw this in any kind of
traditional advertising or traditional
media drop us a comment down below how
can L G step up their game reach out to
consumers build those happy fields when
buying a new smartphone as always thanks
