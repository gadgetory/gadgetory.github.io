pocketnow.com and this is a look at
windows mobile 6.5 build 23 81
it's been a while since we've taken a
look at these newer builds of Windows
Mobile and in this particular release we
see a lot of small elemental changes to
the Windows Mobile interface such as the
scroll bars are a little bit different
the check boxes have been revamped and a
lot of other small things that we're
going to take a look at now so let's
start and turn on the device and let's
go into file explorer so we can take a
look at these new scroll bars that I
mentioned so the newer scroll bars are
just kind of modified so that they look
a little bit smoother they are the same
thickness as the as previous builds of
windows mobile 6.5 but they look a
little bit different so if we compare it
to say windows mobile 6.5 the version
that is now out on the devices on the
carriers you can kind of get a better
feel for how the scroll bars are now
different something else that has
changed is the check boxes so if we go
into a screen where we need to place
checks as checks and boxes such as this
here we can see that the check boxes
have a blue or green check mark in the
box
compared to windows mobile 6.5 that's
out there now it's a much uglier version
of this and this is present throughout
the entire operating system so we can go
to other screens that have check boxes
we can go into system and go to say
screen and there's the check box for
enable clear type it can do the same
over here and you see the difference a
much cleaner looking check box it's
almost Android esque the newer version
of Android that's coming out something
else that's different that you probably
just saw is that all of the buttons are
different now they are much nicer and
cleaner looking than windows mobile 6.5
here where it's just a squarish button
now it has some depth and some texture
to it and when we go into the contacts
application you're going to see that
even more so let's go to the contacts
application we saw a few builds of
that the contacts application had been
revamped and now we have further
revisions to that application okay so
when we make a new contact we get this
new kind of larger more finger friendly
view of the contacts before in windows
mobile 6.5 if you're adding a new
contact you have to go through a very
long and ugly list of things to add but
this makes it a lot easier to to add a
contact and there are some new changes
so if we click add a mobile telephone
number we get this nice little pop-up
screen with these new revamped buttons
that we saw a minute ago a much nicer
look than how it's been before in
previous versions of Windows Mobile the
same thing applies to add email a nice
little screen we can scroll to the right
scroll to the left to get more info we
can add more addresses add more info so
it's really consolidated all of the the
fields that were there before now for
editing a contact we can go into this
new category picker which is just
revamped a little bit if we tap on that
that's as categories we can tap on
categories and see all of the various
categories that exist you can get these
nice check checkmarks to show up when
you tap on one of the categories and so
just a small another small change which
helps to make the interface a little bit
more clean finally the last change that
we're going to show in Bill 2381 is the
new text message screen and we posted on
pocket now that this was changed a
little bit in a previous bill just want
to show it on video here so now we get
kind of a more specific time stamp along
with each SMS really not that big of a
change hopefully this will continue to
evolve in future builds of Windows
Mobile 6 point because the SMS
application is not that good-looking as
it is and just by adding some time
stamps really doesn't make it any nicer
the only other thing that may be
different in this build of Windows
Mobile 6 point 5 is this button up here
so if we go to another day other than
today and the device here has has the
wrong data thinks it's the 25th if we're
on the 24th and we want to get back to
today we tap on this little icon up here
and we're jumped right back to the day
that your device thinks it is so that's
kind of helpful and that may have been
present in previous builds of windows
mobile 6.5 we just didn't notice so
that's all for windows mobile 6.5 build
2381
we'll keep an eye on these builds to see
what is new and what come
next that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
