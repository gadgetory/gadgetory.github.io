as we start December next generation
iPad with nine point seven inch display
is reportedly gonna be less expensive in
lunch soon and the essential phone gates
of portrait mode and we hear there is
another unit in the works I'm Jaime
Rivera and yes I had to record this
video back-to-back given all the
political issues guys trust me I am
doing my best to get you the news this
is Park announced daily the official
news today begin with deals I am a huge
customer of Spotify Premium ever since
its inception and if you're in the
market to get it right now even for
existing customers you can grab this
bundle where you pay $99 and you get 12
months of it so you're pretty much
saving 20 bucks it makes a lot of sense
I'm in the family plan so I don't
believe that it falls within that but I
would highly recommend it it's
definitely a good deal I was talking
about the essential phone believe it or
not the company has just pushed out an
update that brings a new portrait boat
to the camera the coolest part is you
don't need to update the whole firmware
apparently they figured out a way to
just update the camera through the
Google Play Store makes a lot of sense I
actually haven't tested the unit lately
I will look into what is our review is
going to come later we're actually ready
to do it now with all the updates that
have happened I feel that now probably
is a good time to consider this phone
even after the buzz if any now let's
move the spotlight over to Apple is I
was waiting for an iPad pro nine point
seven inch refresh it seems to ten point
five inch is going to be it but the nine
point seven inch model apparently is not
going away we've got some sources
claiming that there is an update coming
to this iPad that's only going to cost
250 bucks and it's going to be launched
in q2 2018 now I don't know exactly how
good or bad this iPad is going to be I
hope it's not as bad as the current
entry-level iPad that's out there as the
display is not really that great but
anyway so we'll see what happened
and speaking of Apple products and
design a very interesting interview
happened with Johnny I've lately and the
most interesting part of the interview
was not really what was said in the
interview but was really the fact that
obviously he sat down he laid his Space
Gray iPhone 10 on the table and the
interviewer was using an
iPhone 7 plus and his comment was that
Wow
that my phone 7 plus looks really
disconnected and it's just funny because
obviously he designed all of these
products and as it turns out with all
the changes of the iPhone 10 it seems
that even the designer claims that this
old iPhone is such a disconnection when
compared to the iPhone 10 so yeah it
seems that he's very proud of his new
iPhone 10 not so much about the 7 plus
makes sense and finally the very hot
muse that they have to do with the
iPhone 10 for those of you that still
want to get yourself a phone it seems
that Apple has finally figured out its
supply chain up to the point where if
you order an iPhone 10 now you will be
getting it in less than a week and this
is a major update given the fact that
it's taken Apple a while to be able to
meet up with demand it's taken longer in
other cases like in the case of the
iPhone 7 plus for example but seems that
Cupertino finally figured out the
biggest question with our recent reviews
the pixel to excel and everything is do
you really feel that it's worth it to
get an iPhone 10 now that you're able to
get it in a store are you getting it or
if not which is the phone that you're
getting for these holidays in my case I
stand by my statement yesterday that the
ghoul pixel to excel is one of my
favorite phones but my iPhone 10 review
is coming very soon it'll reveal a ton
of things leave us a comment down below
