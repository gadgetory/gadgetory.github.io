apps that we've been waiting for for a
very long time and now we're wondering
whether they were worth the wait I'm
Taylor Martin this is PocketNow and this
is a walk through of office for iPad
yesterday at long last Microsoft
released the much-awaited office suite
for iPad as Microsoft Office is a
globally recognized and used office
suite a standard of sorts this is more
significant than just any old app launch
but do they live up to the long building
hype are they worth the hassle or his
office for I have had just another
reminder that tablets are still a long
way from replacing the desktop this is
exactly what you can expect from office
/ iPad
if you've used Office Mobile on either
iOS or Android you will already
understand the basic principle behind
the basic functionality viewing mobile
documents that's it Office for iPad is
available in the form of three separate
downloads Word Excel and PowerPoint for
a total of just under 700 megabytes and
they're completely free to download and
use however you can only expect to view
documents not edit or create without a
Microsoft 365 subscription which is
either $9.99 or $6.99 per month
depending on the number of devices you
plan to use if instead you have an
office 365 subscription you can unlock
the full functionality of Office for
iPad which is strikingly similar to the
full desktop experience from within word
various formatting features picture
inserts text flow settings and all sorts
of other useful features are available
it comes with a bevy of preset templates
for quick creation of common document
types and you can tweak those to your
heart's desire you can add images shapes
hyperlinks headers footnotes page breaks
and almost all the objects you're used
to dealing with from word on your
desktop Excel for iPad includes its
famous robust formula creation simply
start typing a formula or choose one
from the dedicated formula tab you can
insert charts tables text boxes and
pictures and even from the iPad it's a
very desktop esque feel a feat for a
mobile spreadsheet app in fact both Word
and Excel are incredibly robust for
mobile applications and if you've ever
used office before these two
applications will make you feel right at
home
Microsoft has perfectly captured the
experience of its desktop offerings in
its mobile versions of these apps but
make no mistake these were designed with
iPads and touch screens in mind it's
evident and it makes
these two apps in particular rather easy
to cope with especially if you pair that
experience with the Bluetooth keyboard
as we have done we could see ourselves
hammering out a document or spreadsheet
on an iPad with few to no problems
however it's important to note both
Excel and Word are missing a few
functionalities they're particularly
great for anyone who wants to do basic
document or spreadsheet creation or
editing on the go in fact with the
little elbow grease you could probably
crank out some serious work with these
apps but there's a chance you'll
eventually run it to something you need
to do that these mobile apps won't offer
for instance you can insert formulas in
word a feature that might be necessary
for say a lab report and PowerPoint as
is usually the case with mobile
presentation creation is the most
feature light of them all you can create
presentations quite efficiently it's
simple to understand and use
particularly if you've used PowerPoint
in the past however the slides you'll be
making with PowerPoint for iPad are
going to be rather basic you can format
text edit layouts insert pictures text
boxes and tables and you can edit
transitions you can't get terribly in
depth with your slides which may be a
good thing if you're the type of person
who gets carried away and adds 10
transitions per slide the point is if
you need Microsoft Office support
whether it be for work or school office
for iPad is pretty impressive and it
promises to maintain the same layouts no
matter where you're accessing or editing
your documents it's not groundbreaking
or innovative but it's a necessary move
for Microsoft and I'd say it executed
these mobile apps incredibly well the
main trick here that makes it so useful
is onedrive support if you're using Word
Excel or PowerPoint from your desktop
it's save hit the road and break out an
iPad to pick up where you left off and
get some work done on the go this is
similar functionality to Drive or iCloud
paired with the iWork suite but from an
office suite which is much more widely
used and accepted as a standard the key
difference is price Drive iCloud and
iWork and even some other Suites are
free of charge mobile or otherwise
unless you need more cloud storage one
of the biggest disappointments with
office 4 I've had is the lack of the
ability to print directly from within
any of the apps we figure the feature
was passed up on since you can simply
save and print from your computer
seconds later but
still doesn't make up for not being
there either way color us impressed it
may have taken ages for office for iPad
to arrive but at least Microsoft got it
right that said we're not particularly
fond of the subscription service and
would have rather seen a moderately high
initial buying cost with no monthly fees
I guess you can't have your cake and eat
it too though if you want Microsoft
Office on all of your devices however if
you want to try office for iPad
free of charge download the free apps
and head over to office comm slash tribe
