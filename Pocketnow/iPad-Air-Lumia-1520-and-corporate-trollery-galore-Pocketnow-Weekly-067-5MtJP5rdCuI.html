blasts longer than one week but intrepid
tech bloggers somehow find a way to
soldier on elsewhere in the world nokia
announces a duo of oversized smartphones
and a new windows tablet all of which is
almost immediately overshadowed by
apple's new ipad announcement we'll talk
about the results of that media coo plus
some lingering galaxy gear talk and your
listener mail on episode 06 7 out of the
pocket now weekly the once-a-week audio
podcasts from pocket now where we
discuss smartphones tablets and the
state of mobile technology in 2013 I'm
your host Michael Fisher editorial
director at pocket now and today I'm
joined by senior editor and apparently
newly minted gunnar optiks enthusiast
Taylor Martin hello sir hello Lou and
yeah we're going to talk about that
we're going to talk about that we've
also got the grumpiest man alive that
title given by default to any
northeastern ER waiting in October for
his furnace to be repaired Stephen shank
hey man I am wearing so many layers at
the moment now it's not even funny I was
gonna say I'm liking like Korean are you
reporting from inside of a comically
oversized Ice Cube right now the worst
thing is my hands are cold and I can't
type the vibe gloves on
that is the worst when is someone gonna
come to fix your firebox birth tomorrow
maybe oh dear god how are you gonna
sleep tonight you do like a sleeping bag
under your covers I have two comforters
on my bed right now that's been my
operating procedure so far I think it'll
get me through the night oh god that's
it's like my night last night I spent
the night on the couch because i was so
tired when I wrapped the galaxy gear
videos that I couldn't get all the crap
off my bed so I was like screw this i'm
gonna sleep on the couch and i made the
mistake of watching sleepers before I
fell asleep so that was creepy my dream
sound morbid yeah but that's nothing
compared to the horror that is Taylor
Martin's sheer audacity and ripping off
my eyewear choice what's going on Taylor
Martin tell us about how you how you got
turned on to these gunnar optiks well I
mean I'm not gonna use them in videos oh
I wish the version we could be the gun
Roger those the the yellow yes Peppa
tighter spaces yeah tellers posted and
put two and two together on that yeah so
I had stared a computer for I don't know
anywhere from eight to 14 hours a day
yeah so no it's a smart choice I'm
putting mine on right now if we were a
video podcast you can see this but we're
not and we're gonna be smashing here
it's like the color makes it yes here in
your eyes yeah it like it is supposed to
reduce backlight driven eyeball strain
because of staring at a is specifically
staring at what a compact fluorescent or
Evan not compact fluorescent but
whatever the type of old yeah yeah you
got to go to whatever theater you're at
steal a couple gels cuz put them right
over the street no that would be awesome
where I could get one of those one of
those ones that also makes it impossible
to view your screen from anything but
directly to polarize it or the old I
know what you mean yeah yeah the CIA's
they did it panels yes yes privacy
screen right yeah those are just
polarized right so they remove the
polarized layer from the display and
then you put polarize it through your
glasses yeah how it works as well cool I
was thinking about the ones where it's
like a bunch of little slits and so if
you get like five degrees off center you
can't see you can't see all right right
right the ones that are like an inch
thicker than your actual monitor yeah
well Taylor I want to see I want to know
if you can wear those in one video I
want to see what people say would you
just do that we can we just roll the
viewers for a second I can I can track
the dealer lynnes do make me learn it
send me one of your hats and I'll wear
one of your hats one of my you can wear
gunnar optiks nears that are we great
yes all right I've been thinking about
buying them for a while they're always
always always on woot so I finally
pulled the trigger on some if I don't
like the most expensive they are
expended pricey but if you go to pax
east and buy them there are many
attractive booth babes who can make you
forget forget about your money because
that's what happened to me I was that
Paxton I was like walking around and OH
lo and behold there's an attractive
person trying to sell me something I'm
going to be a sucker for it and then I
bought them but I were my man were only
40 so dear God mine were not authority
at all sure at CVS I can get like a six
dollar period so does it yeah but then
you're gonna look like a senior citizen
driving on a Sunday afternoon you know
and the downside to that is well
actually no good call that is a really
cool thing to do shall we go how much
about your stuff mine were more more
than yours shut up there isn't a
sunglass show let's talk about let's
talk about iOS cuz it was big news in
the the the tech space to this week I
was out of I was like at lunch because
my grandparents are in town and I never
see them so I was like I got to have
lunch with these guys good luck with the
apple thing how was the Hangout guys uh
was bringing us an answer it's kind of
boring yeah what did you do first hour
Oh Stephen you were not on it well I was
sitting there trying to do the news back
then I was still on my crappy old
computer where I cannot stream video and
do anything else at the same time so I
was in single operating mode and I'm
sitting there wondering what are these
guys talking about because it's it's Mac
after Mac after Mac for the first 45
minutes or so well part of the time we
were making fun of Adam doubt because
his Tesla coil was back so when he spoke
when he turned his mic on it was like we
dear God really so that's what the
commenters were complaining about in the
in the feed because i was reading the
comments last night of like what
happened on this broadcast Adam need a
frickin microphone man like worse than
Steven needs a new mega relic Steven
you sound pretty good considering you're
using a karaoke revolution anyway anyway
I'm sorry so but by and large besides
the atom doubt microphone problems how
how when we kind of answered questions
and we talked about different tablets
and what we were we made predictions and
things like that I talked about the Moto
X cuz people were asking me left and
right what devices i was carrying and so
we talked about different things and
then when the announcement dropped it
was kind of chaos for a few minutes and
then let me dropped off here i mean it
was kind of boring was it a was it like
a euphoric moment or was it a
disappointed moment because apple
dropped two new ipads basically the ipad
mini 2 or ipad mini with retina display
which is exactly what it sounds like and
the ipad air yeah so when they announced
the ipad air my mind immediately raced
are they going to release them and i've
had pro what's good what's the mini is
the many gonna be like the feather light
what were they doing here no I didn't
get damn like why why wouldn't they just
called ipad mini the ipad air and the
larger iPad iPad pro yeah it's a good
because that would make that would make
perfect sense but obviously they don't
like to make sense so they didn't keep
the ipad 3 or ipad 4 and they kept ipad
2 right no that's a whole different
thing i actually don't mind the ipad air
branding because the what was our
biggest complaint about the ipad there's
no number well no no i'm not bringing
worse but for me that's bigger than
about it but my biggest complaint about
it was that it was heavy right like it
was no or summoning wieldy and now
they've solved that problem it's so thin
yeah yeah i'm used to picking up my
giant forearms anyway so used to being
so butchered brother check out these
pythons can we get some predictions
going on when Apple is actually going to
retire the ipad 2 well this thing the
existing movie on like the item is a HTC
hd2 of the apple line up soon so i was i
was upset about that why kill the ipad 4
and not the ipad 2 like why do that and
it kind of hit me um one
there Tim Cook is a number pusher he's
trying to cut costs so if you create
something and keep something going from
two years ago versus something from last
year if it's a lot cheaper and they can
make a higher profit margin because
they're not dropping rising or yeah but
but there's another reason it has a
30-pin connector so if somebody gets an
iphone 4s which is still around iphone 5
isn't the 4s is so thinking an iphone 4s
which ipad are they gonna go with are
they gonna go with something they have
to get a different connector for a
different charger yes positioned they're
gonna do that because nobody asked for a
thought in a retail store but exactly so
they shouldn't i'm not saying what they
should do right what are they gonna do
rio this has i think that the opposite
I'm surprised they're not you know
redesigning the ipad to keeping most of
the hardware intact you like she /
display and all that but giving it a
lightning connector just to bringing it
in line with everything else well you
gotta still wonder how much a little
right because you're spending on
redesigned and then you're also losing
money on old cable sales because you
know people are still buying them things
yeah I don't know when their profit
margin is I know USB cable but I mean
you know and in you know you know apples
you know hurting for money so they're
trying to cut every corner the count
yeah sorry i was two seconds behind on
your sarcasm there sorry for my late LOL
so okay so but the ipad air has some
really cool stuff i wrote a piece that i
didn't link to in the description called
like five things we love about it but
it's got some cool stuff it's got enough
cool stuff built into the design that
i'm actually considering it over the
ipad mini with retina display because
right now i carry for so much how about
stuff i have an ipad 3rd generation and
it needs to be replaced not least of all
because it's pocket nows and not mine so
it needs to be replaced so that i can
have an ipad but i like I i I've wanted
the ipad mini for a long time and the
ipad mini with retina display was very
compelling to me but now that the new
ipad the full-size one is so thin like
you said stephen and so light i don't
know i mean both rock basically the same
internals too is that correct yeah it
didn't last year if I murmurings
correctly didn't the first mini have a
previous gen SOC compared to the ipad
before
it did it had a a five instead of the a6
surprised to see them on the same level
this time around it was a great move
yeah so so it had that and it also had
half the Bram and the terrible display
so on many fronts it was May
half-measure right yeah but still it was
very very very interesting to a lot of
people because well for the same reason
when I picked it up in a retail story I
didn't believe it was a real thing I was
like wow this is so light it's
unbelievable and it's you know small and
portable and every time I Steve see one
out in the real world still to this day
I'm like oh man that's a cool little
tablet you know because they don't get
the same reaction from little androids
no you don't I mean you do once you pick
them up but God knows that's why I fell
in love with the original Nexus 7 and i
love i love this year's Nexus 7 I really
owe you do I know you did see I don't
like it stretched dimensions I don't
like the little bit exactly such long
Tennyson I thought I was the only one no
no I'm very sensitive to design elements
that do not matter at all the real world
yeah me too actually after this I'm
gonna fire up my nexus 7 give it some
love because I haven't you go use that
thing in a long time my old one my old
one my first gen so let's let's get back
talk about the iPads though there's
there's other stuff here they've got
their book coffee it's did I say a peds
yes oh man it's in any pain laughs week
I loved am a pads and a pet sounds like
a creep at you because oh my god yes you
know that some like manufacturer has
already badged that up and is selling
them at walgreens warehouse full 11 1999
yet oh cool Google is just gonna start
trolling Apple that's what they should
do instead of troubling us they should
troll Apple yeah check out the new iPad
Nexus a bed nexus 8 why are the speeds
have been improved I don't know anything
about my mo we should get geo Levi in
the pockets actually we tried to this
time around I mean our phones have that
most of them right isn't it the
diversity antenna pretty much for
cellular except for Wi-Fi you know I was
just about to start speculating with you
based on two verses 5 gigahertz bands
and then my mo and then AC versus
a/b/g/n and AC is not included in the
new iPads but really I'm going to get
out of my depth
very quickly since alphabet soup yeah
then some snarky dude is going to call
us jerks in the pod get in the comments
and then I'm just gonna leave the
internet forever it so i don't know i
love 64-bit yeah it's because i get the
same look with more gb's the the back
speaking of jeebies and MP is the aft
camera if we're going to be nautical
about this on each of these i think is
the same but the forward-facing camera
has been augmented with a BSI sensor and
I don't know if larger pixels is correct
but it's low light performance any
better yeah there's a larger one of them
the face tanya the front facer larger
pixels I don't know how big but better
light sensitivity hopefully Taylor did
you read my mind about the ipad the new
iPads piece you should have read it I
insulted you in it and I included a
picture as well I'm reading it now yeah
so I like that front facing cameras are
being given a little bit of exposure
here with these I know that nobody
really nobody else really cares about
these in some of our reviews of
smartphones even like if it's a rushed
week or if it's if we just did fall
through the cracks we don't even test
the front-facing camera sometimes and
then we have to go back and like put
that in after the fact because you just
forget that there there it's amazing
yeah if there was that earlier this year
we saw a couple manufacturers really
start bumping up the resolution on them
but there was a couple with 5 megapixel
front faces but since then yeah that one
cares and doesn't like doesn't the
surface do that isn't it the same camera
component both fore and aft or am I
wrong on that IDK yeah IDK either but I
wage that Apple should or wager that
Apple should actually just stop putting
cameras on the back or put the crappy
cameras on the back and the great
cameras on the front wow man hates a
rear cam how many people needs we're not
gonna like I feel like it's 2011 again
but we're not going to have this
discussion about whether users with your
tongue the way through the feeds
yesterday afternoon I don't know what
site it was but somebody or an editorial
piece about why iPads being used as
cameras is now acceptable by society
that was nine to five I was nine two
thousand nine to five yes
let's just put it this way i tweeted
during the event and I said stop
promoting vertical video recorded on an
idol now L that please that that is that
is true I cannot disagree with you what
if yeah but if I'm raz b 98 retweets are
you serious how yeah it went crazy wow
wow that's not what if the camera were a
center-mounted component on tablets and
smartphones what if like it was it was
mounted such that no matter what
orientation you used the device in
actually don't even know center top eggs
you mean Center center I mean center
Center yeah exactly what if it was in
what if it was mounted in the dead
center of tablets with like a big ol
like mechanical ball surrounding it so
that no matter what orientation you held
the tablet and it was always in
landscape like if he wanted to take a
portrait shop you couldn't that's what I
want to scopic we balanced yeah I'm
making the APA pad camera troll that's
what I made that's my that's my next
tablet you're not gonna be able to hold
out or you can use some stanky imagine
yes he goes over your shoulder Zack yeah
this is great all right good we got a
product venture capitalists email we
pricing is nothing new on these things I
don't know I it's we're talking we
talked about thinner edit so maybe five
millimeters what pricing on the mini is
oh why because it's been bumped up a
notch yeah seventy dollars no but hold
up hold up all of the Ida had mini 89
yeah it doesn't it start at 399 yes it
used to start at 329 oh that's the thing
i was looking the wrong spot so yeah so
they dropped the price you know thirty
dollars you don't like that old model no
i don't like it why don't you like it
why don't you think it's warranted with
a Retina display and the same internals
as the ipad air why is that not
warranted Tillerman because i'm gonna do
this I'm going to compare it to the
Nexus 7 even though we know that Nexus 7
is sold at or near cost the newness yes
the new Nexus 7 they have a comparable
display at least in pixels per inch so
both of them have the ipad mini has 320
for the Nexus 7 has 323
they have 5 megapixel cameras on the
back 1.2 on the front similar storage
capacities at least for the first two
models so 16 or 32 gigabytes the Nexus 7
has doubled the ram a Krait 300 cpu so
that's quad-core krait 300 so that's
part of the Snapdragon 600 but it's
actually a Snapdragon s4 pro yeah yeah
um Bluetooth cornpone alive I AC you get
better specifications in a cheaper
tablet it's not that it's just cheaper
snow it's just cheaper was the fact that
you can buy two of them almost for the
price of one ipad mini yeah but with iOS
you're not just paying for the hardware
you're paying for the Apple experience
the ecosystem the sucker people always
put a premium on that yeah exactly and
the end the build quality as well I mean
I haven't held an ipad menu I've had
many but I would wager that it can give
that neck new nexus 7 a run for its
money in terms of build oh I don't doubt
that it absolutely can but some of you
think more like if you hate it's worth
more but not double yes like the the
Nexus 7 is two hundred and thirty
dollars the ipad is a hundred and
seventy dollars more than that you know
you can get actually the most expensive
nexus 7 possible for cheaper than the
price of the ipad mini the lowest
capacity retina iPad Mini well that's a
frickin custom custom made ad right
there I'm sure though yeah if Google
were a different kind of company i'm
sure they would run that yeah i mean it
you the most expensive Nexus 7 is three
hundred and fifty dollars mm-hmm and the
cheapest ipad mini with retina is 400 so
it's 399 well let's i kind of want to
talk a little bit about about the
prospects for the ipad mini because i'm
i wrote a news piece alongside this kind
of stuff this was from actually just
today just this morning that the ipad
mini could see some supply constraints
and when I first like opened up the
piece based on the headline I was like
why are they having component shortages
with the thanks to the display but I'm
like wait no it's not that uncommon or
display resolution right so I was like
what's going on but according to this is
via 9to5 mac the original sources the
telegraph
according to it now and they were citing
a KGI Securities analyst got this chain
is long this new tablet who knows a guy
who knows guy who talks about right it
looks like Apple is apparently there's
only a third of the units according to
these people that Apple produced for the
old iPad Mini last year so a third of
the initial run so here in any reason
why that might be no like I'm trying to
like get around I'm trying to figure out
where time it was was going with this
really and I tried to do it before the
show and I still couldn't I would have
liked to have a tie my own but he's
still covering the new shifts because
Tony's sent me off this week so I don't
know if this is if this is something as
a result of demand anticipated demand
being reduced I'm it makes a passing
reference to the old iPad Mini having
some supplies you guys remember that are
not supply issues but demand issues
actually where people were like not as
many people were buying them as Apple
expected kind of like what hasn't with
the iphone 5c it was a compromise in so
many ways it really was so uh i'm
thinking i don't know i have no idea
what to make it this may be the the
higher price but i don't think people
are going to care that much it's seventy
dollars more than last year's model one
a lot better at least on paper yeah i
think it's we should make it clear here
this is analyst estimates this isn't
coming from like a rumor from you know
someone who we can connect a supplier
some of the manufacturers the ipad this
is looking at the industry there might
be some actual source is talking but
these sort of rumors always make me feel
a little iffy yeah now i agree i it's
it's not it mean it's a bit more jumping
off point for thinking about what what
the ipad mini represents to applebees i
still don't understand it like it seems
like almost everyone who talks about the
mini not a buyer not an owner but a an
analyst a journalist of whatever is it
sort of lukewarm on it and has been from
the start I know we're only in the shot
generation here but good I really liked
mine I really did I mean the display was
awful it was so bad um but but i liked
it i like the form factor and I don't
know maybe apples just not full on in
the ipad mini I mean they seem excited
about it
you have to remember i Apple was also
the company that said they would never
make a 7-inch tablet yeah I mean this
was granted 7.9 but yeah they said that
if the Steve Jobs said if he ever made a
7-inch tablet you'd have to sell it with
sandpaper so that's right yeah yeah so I
don't know maybe they're like one foot
in one foot out on it I don't know hmm
i'm still waiting for them to finally go
full-on widescreen for the tablets I
mean it hasn't anyone we hold out on
that I hate for three I really really do
it just like I don't know I like
everything like blown up Optimus of you
every time now it's not okay it is well
it is actually it is well it needs the
rubber diem but every time that I pick
up like a 16 by 9 or 16 to buy 10 tablet
like I'm like I can't use this thing in
portrait orientation and I imagined I
could have a better time of it if maybe
no I couldn't I mean if bezels were
slowing down it would get even worse
like and and then the manufacturer and
the carrier usually takes the
opportunity to brand the stupid thing so
that you only want to use it in
landscape because if you're holding it
vertically the branding is sideways and
that's annoying and then wait what it's
like and you've got samsung put in a
stupid home button on the long side like
it's just I don't know I don't
understand why 16 by 9 16 x 10 tablet
still exists like we saw the zoom come
out with it I remember still the first
review photo i ever saw the motorola
xoom being held in portrait and I'm like
yeah what no no everything else is ever
use I mean only ever used like 7-inch
tablets in portrait like I don't think
I've ever wanted to use a 10-inch tablet
in portrait like when I use tablets in
portrait it's generally when I'm reading
in bed I'm lying on my back and I've got
the tablet like on my chest if I'm tired
of holding up its massive for pound
weight in the case of them I'm gonna buy
useless England landscape what's that
I'm buying you some dumbbells no
obviously I was asking I was asking
Stephen because he was not regurgitated
a curvy commenter that what about for a
web browsing
landscape as well no I do it in portrait
generally portrayed okay yeah so like I
so I don't know I don't know I'm just
used to doing it that way probably good
so I don't mind for by 3i think Apple
shouldn't shouldn't leave it because I
know everyone else is doing it I know
it's more video friendly but no I think
order 3 is SEO friendly no excuse me at
sixteen by nine as well saying as i know
it's 16 x 960 x 10 yeah i think the
reason nobody really has ever tried to
go down that path like android wives is
is probably because the lawsuits against
a I'm song and everybody you know you're
how it looks like mine and it's probably
a reason but but I i prefer 16-9 tablets
I really do that there also might be an
industry issue because the company's
manufacturing these displays are making
no giant sheets that are cut up into
individual screens and when they start
doing a lot of them widescreen it makes
sense to keep going at that pattern for
the rest of it this is why it's so hard
to find if you want to get a computer
monitor an LCD and four to three you're
pretty out of luck unless you're going
to overpay or find an older model
because everyone it's just it's
economies of scale you keep making more
of these widescreen display so I can't
believe Apple has been sticking to its
guns it must be a huge pain to
manufacture these yeah probably I'm
totally cool with 69 except for on the
tablet Z because it's like I could use
this thing as a surfboard the bezel on
this thing is enormous let's move on to
I want to ask about the about
speculation on iPads and stuff that
hasn't really come to pass we're talking
about Steven's poll which I really liked
and this was a cool I wish I'd been in
on this speculation fest but when it was
happening because now it's just kind of
academic until next year i guess but
when i when apple released the iphone 5c
i think there was this really cool
mental leap that happened in some brains
not mine because this was huge news to
me that oh wow they could probably do a
plastic ipad stephen was this like your
idea or what was the deal here I'm
and on the team not you know globally I
mean it seemed like the obvious step to
do you're making that change to the
phone side of your devices why not least
consider it for the tablet side in a
real life though I am not so sure that
it's something that Apple might actually
be going down and we just mentioned the
the screen dimensions clearly apple
doesn't need to have its phone and
tablets perfectly in alignment but if
they want it to go with plastic there's
a number of benefits they might get we
could see a slightly cheaper device
maybe something more durable I don't
think it would help much with weight
because I mean Apple is great at
manufacturing aluminum so that its
strong thin light right but I mean it's
usually a chip or easily chipped yeah I
feel like classic and more durable it
could take a scratch but it's not gonna
get dinged up quite so easily I don't
know yeah well I'm holding the iphone 5c
now and I mean it's it's a heavy bc
which which I like because when your
when your plastic you want to offset
that but I don't think it's like the end
cost that would be the real benefit to
Apple is it sits would be in profit
margins again you know I've been making
a plastic ipad I imagined they could
apply some of the same lessons they
learned from this 5c which I feel like
carrying around in its current state I
mean I'm I don't know if I would deal
with this on a tablet though i'm not i'm
really really on the fence about this so
i had to wonder why not do like the /
see instead of still selling last year's
ipad repackage the hardware in a plastic
easier to produce higher margin case and
then sell that was the lower j I kind of
understand why and in it's actually
coming to me after doing this comparison
with the note 8 10 and the note 10.1
every pretty much every samsung tablet
to date minus the nexus 10 and now the
10.1 the note 10.1 has been hyper blaze
and that is absolutely the worst thing
it's not just because we hate hyper
glaze but it makes the tablet slick and
generally hard to hold and kind of slimy
the end it feels like utter crap its
nest now I don't yeah I don't like the
5c I went to a store that helped one I
don't like the finish on it
don't like slick finish anything really
and that that's I think part of the same
thing is the NIF own that fits in your
hand is one thing something that's going
to require two hands to hold and be a
little heavier with a spare pair that
with you know a slick coating that's not
a good combination could always go the
note 3 route give it some texture to it
didn't catch an apple doing that like we
get our iPad yeah after just abandoning
all that skeuomorphism in iOS yeah I
think that's probably this evidence that
Apple is not fully behind the the idea
of going plastic with the 5c I'm not
saying that they're going to change
course on the phone I'm saying that if
they were really going to jump into this
thing with with tooth with both feet why
not have a line of multicolored plastic
iPads alongside their multicolored
plastic iPhones and then call that the
entire low end of the line up you know I
mean if they're not doing that then why
then does that mean that next year we
might not see the 5c again we might see
something very different I don't think
so i think is like i was saying Apple
isn't that committed to having a unified
look for its products anymore I feel
like it's getting more comfortable
loosening up hmm what did the poll say
what were the world of the poll results
from our readers the question was would
you buy a plastic iPad number one
response what sorry I should send
everyone you know yeah well the number
one response that wasn't on the pole
which is reflected in the comments is
what would I ever consider anything from
crapple anyway which is of course the
most mature and awesome way to look at
anything but the of the poles that were
presented you know if I wanted a plastic
tablet I'd get an android forty-eight
percent of respondents hmm said that
it's our massive sample size and then
this is a first runner-up yeah if it's
cheap enough and the hardware still
decent sure so yes and no that's
interesting I mean I expected there to
be a much wider no gap here you know and
the devil I didn't seem to respond to
price besides any other possible benefit
that plastic might bring yeah I like
that you presented an option for
ruggedized build of plastic
translates to a ruggedized build and
sign me up i mean yeah man i had to make
sure that uh Steven rip this is not you
Michael after I saw that the recognized
vid yeah yeah I am obsessed with rugged
phones um I I voted for the cheap enough
hardware it cheap enough if at the
hardware still decent but that's not
ever gonna happen because Apple we we've
learned Apple is not making plastic
devices to make them cheaper they're
cheaper models are still there old
models ya know it's what I was just
saying yeah it's its profit margin not
end cost well that's the apple news I
want to move on to windows but I want to
ask you guys if you are at all
titillated by other of these units well
I was planning on possibly buying the
air but i'm reviewing it anyway so i'll
buy it anyway okay all right what do I
used to you know they're nice enough I'm
definitely impressed specifically with
the the mini and the hardware inside
there but iOS is just a non-starter for
me so even I or seven even new flat
colorful iOS 7 I can't get past the app
issues man yeah yeah I got you i
understand i am sort of in the same boat
but the mini the mini continues to
entice me it just has that magic so i'll
tell you what because what what what app
issues can't cite load oh you okay okay
uh for me it's the grid for me it's the
UI I oh they're like iOS 7 but I can't
stand that landing page all the time but
we all know this this all old news I'm
gonna be reviewing the Oh am I not gonna
I don't know who's reviewing the ipad
mini do we know do we know this you are
you oh yay okay i'm reviewing the
Yarnell excellent so I'm revealing the
ipad mini so I'm very excited to see it
and we'll we'll get to it there's other
stuff to get to though and it's time we
moved on to windows Who am at nokia
world we're very well represent I can't
get over this like I know that this is
the the rule of the day but companies
just trashing each other in terms of
event scheduling just cracks me up nokia
am I wrong on this
did nokia have nokia world scheduled for
like weeks and weeks in advance yeah for
the apple event we got official
confirmation an apple yeah and so nokia
world was always scheduled for october
or whatever it was I don't think Nokia
was purposely or even if it wasn't if we
they had planned in advance I don't
think that this is at all intended to
cram a lot of events into the one day to
steal attention from the other guys cuz
the Nokia thing was at three in the
morning here no no I some what I'm
saying I'm saying that Nokia had this
thing planned out and they had it all
set in their calendar and then Apple
came because these events have done the
same day the ipad announcement happened
listeners if you're not aware happened
on the same exact day as nokia world
where they announced all their stuff and
apple i would totally believe Apple did
that on purpose oh yeah really yeah
they're like it haha even though its own
totally unnecessary it's kind of like no
competition later it's kind of like that
like the big like steroid using 11th
grader like going to the playground to
find the sort of handicapped fourth
grader and then kicking him in the face
right and not the school has too many
grades in what ways well as wears a
small town you understand okay but you
know I got out of fourth grade it's all
right but no the thing is like it's it
not that I obviously I'm a giant fan of
Nokia and I that analogy is not perfect
but they're really not a threat to Apple
at this moment I don't think right not
really well I'm on the low end yeah on
the low end yeah 520 is yeah but doesn't
care about the low end right not if not
if you hear them tell it but so they
care nothing about it anyway you don't
care it wouldn't know oh what a little
are using is now so anyway I thought
that bit of corporate troller II was was
awesome this nokia world event happened
in Abu Dhabi the to everyone who
complained that you didn't see
sufficient coverage from us guys we
didn't go to Abu Dhabi so sorry don't
know what you want us to do we're going
to be reviewing the the Lumia 1520 the
1320 is going to be announced for Europe
it released in europe and asia so we're
not going to cover that probably unless
we are able to
then the 2520 tablet was now Saul these
three devices were announced at once I
can't I can't say it any other way we
would have loved to have been there
right Taylor sure I would very much like
to be there in lovely uh was the United
Arab Emirates and now that my heat is
what it is because it must be like what
95 degrees right now I'm sure is pretty
nice yeah yeah I'd love to have gone to
Abu Dhabi but Nokia event was cool i
guess i would have loved a garden 10
okie event to see them launched their
first tablet to see them launched their
first phablet i feel like it would have
been dwindling yeah by the end result by
the by the product well we didn't get we
were supposed to be all this other stuff
the we didn't see that blue music were
there and then the listen if that ipod
aping music player got cancelled more
power to him because come on guys it's
not the year for that mmm still I was
hoping to see a lot more there was good
stuff don't get me wrong I just we had
such high expectations going in this was
going to be like opening up the you know
nokia treasure trove oh do we even get
the treasure tag Oh announce that mm-hmm
I don't know if they did did they mmm I
didn't hear anything about that but no
kids bag it was pictured alongside the
Lumia 1520 right right so maybe it's
gonna come out another week or two yeah
no it's not it doesn't look like it's
been really talked about the press
renders out there it's leaks but they
didn't I don't think they talked about
it anyway oh so the 15 20 what is it
it's a big ol windows phone phablet and
I just watched the official nokia
conversations hands on of this device a
couple hours before coming on the air a
couple minutes whatever and man this
thing looks cool I mean I didn't expect
to be jazzed on it but it's got
basically down rated specs from the 1020
in terms of the camera we're looking at
a 20-megapixel ultrapixel 20-megapixel
ultra pic to know that's HTC a
20-megapixel pure of you who shooter I
was wondering where you were going with
that yeah so as I'm and ultra pickles
yeah it's it's got a Tony megapixel
PureView it
sensor that is optically stabilized
without for some reason they've managed
to do this without incorporating the big
ol protruding Oreo from the 1020 it's a
BS it looks like it has a wart on the
back at least from this angle it's way
smaller it's like the camera lens on the
925 tomato well it just reminds me in
the back at the note 8.0 which looks
like it just has this nasty oh yeah no
it's now this is way different this is
like different in an okiya way I like it
better but you know it's different cuz I
say it's different the this one left has
gotten a considerable upgrade it's 1080p
I believe a first in the Windows Phone
space and as a result of gdr3 sensing
that it's on a 1080p display you get an
extra row of home screen live tiles and
remember they're saying it's not the
pixel that's the size that they're going
for oh it is ok it's not the resolution
it's the it's the display size which i
believe is six inches on the mark yes it
is yes so that's substantial mm-hmm and
if you don't two bigs on its well here's
the thing here's the thing i don't think
it's too big i think i think it's too
big in the same way the galaxy mega is
too big i don't think it's too big in
the same way that one max is too big in
that I think this space is used more
effectively by Windows Phone than it is
by stock Android or skinned a droid
except for Samsung's implementation
which uses split screen which instantly
adds more value so yeah it's very long
sense but it was crudos phones dense and
it works well things this size it does
you pack enough live tiles into into an
area that you don't have to scroll as
much you can just kind of did the
glanceable dream can be realized maybe
not in the way that Microsoft first
intended hit three years with the way
you said that sounded awesome the
glanceable dream can't even realize yeah
it's like a industrials real radio video
from 1955 rentable dream there I was
getting more of like a like a I don't
know a 17th century like speech ah ok
inspirational the glanceable dream it
does sound like a hot air balloon
doesn't it so anyway there's there's a
lot of cool stuff on earth wireless
charging has been integrate
once again thankfully because the sleds
just didn't work in my experience on the
1020 we've got a bunch of different
colors on this unit and it's coming the
United States it's going to be an ATT
exclusive here from what everything I
understand which when I read I instantly
fell down in shock and surprise and you
know I was I was taken aback weren't you
Steven it's totally unexpected from
Nokia AT&amp;amp;T seriously really they've
never had a tight relationship in the
past but i don't i don't know say what
do you guys think it's as Taylor thinks
it's too vague Steven do you think this
is too big or do you think this is a
like a step on the road to visiting with
Artie yeah i think it's it's not the
best phone perhaps but we really need to
get Windows Phone moving on up into
larger spaces or kill a party or
something microsoft needs to solve this
mid-sized tablet problem and we're
getting those cheaper the little the
full eight tablets and that's a good
step but i think it really needs to
decide what to do about Windows Phone on
this larger scale is it going to keep on
moving it up are we ever gonna see a
7-inch windows phone-based device it
yeah this is a necessary in the middle
step yeah well I mean this phone at 5.5
might have been a little better i'm kind
of jaded towards super big phones and
that's just that's how it's gonna be
until I love the mega I don't understand
how you can say that because you really
like the mega I liked the mega i love
the note 8.8 point of it the note 3 um
well look at education this this week
this week has been on only good but yeah
this thing just based on the 1020 which
I still carry the bezels on that thing
just make it so tall and that's by
looking at this that's what I'm feeling
is just it makes me think of this e
ultra because that thing just had
enormous bezels on the top and bottom
and when you put it in your pocket and
sit down and jab you and poke you and
yeah so that that's what I'm afraid of I
mean I want to get one in my hands and
see what it's like but I also think that
physically if it's big like it
if its physical footprint is larger than
the note 3 I want nothing to do with it
I'm standing by that I said it and I'm
standing by maybe it's just it's some
phones you just don't put in your pants
pockets you have to have a bag or a
jacket or something and I don't like a
stick yeah looks like it oh yeah yeah I
know I I can't I can't disagree with you
Taylor I am also excited to see this I
read something interesting today and
this was um I think this was a story on
the tech block or something like that
and there was a wonderful quote about
how how the tech media reports on tech
and basically the central premise of
this piece was tech journalism needs to
move beyond just Hawking the latest
bright and shiny thing because it's new
and exciting and it's true pray tell
what should we be covering then the oh
no no we should cover it i don't think
that's the thing but i think that i
think we have a problem in that industry
wide review scores are higher than they
should be insights that still do review
scores in sites that don't do review
scores i think reviews are too generous
i don't think anyone is harsh enough and
when i came aboard here i was excited
about being harsher but there's a very
real there's there's it's not it's not
really bias because its platform
agnostic it happens to every single
device whether you know from iOS to
blackberry even you know things come in
and they're new so they have this
instant kind of cachet this this instant
goo well this is a lure this novelty yes
yes and if you're not careful that can
creep into the end product of the review
and suddenly you're putting suddenly you
look at you you're at your average
review score thing and it's like wow I
don't go below a seven like ever why is
that and because the time you do you get
absolutely reamed by everyone literally
annihilated right we're not going to
review the really really awful phones
out there exactly what there's a new
kind of years yeah you kind of stomp on
your relationships then people like me
why'd you review this solo that's the
plan right like it was like it's not
great a bad review is is the most work
ever because you get slammed in the
comments you have to moderate those more
heavily and then you have to explain to
the p
our companies for the manufacturers why
you gave it a bad review and then they
offer to send you another unit which is
like okay great and then you have to
read that unit more often than not it's
still crap because you weren't wrong and
then you have to write a piece that says
did we review a bad unit nope you know
it's like and the noodle is happy yeah I
don't know so we're gonna we're gonna
we're going to move on this this is a
bigger question this is a bigger issue
that I want to cover in depth more
specifically with in terms of review
scores we've talked about it a lot we
talked about a lot around the g2 the
whole atmosphere is it's just kind of
poisoned in every direction but but ya
know the reason but the reason I bring
it up is because this thing this 1520 is
going to land in my inbox or yours or
anybody's and you know I got it I'm
touching my nose not it see I would love
I would love to review it but the thing
is I'm gonna see the great the greatness
in it but it's it's so difficult to
couch the the negatives in terms that
that can be accepted both by normal
people and by people who are like listen
I value a large screen to device and
just because it's not right for everyone
doesn't mean this thing deserves to get
kicked and that's true right yeah yeah
like okay so the zeal for review I gave
it a decent review it's not a bad phone
but I scored it lower because it's not
ideal for everyone it's not this is the
problem but with scores because there's
no uniformity there we sat last with our
little matrix of the bottomless cord for
you bus goes only to make sense just so
much flexibility you can have there and
still have the information be useful
exactly yeah so so actually you're going
to score something differently if you
see a display and you might give that
display a seven I might give it an a5
and Brandon might give it a two you know
so it's there is always going to be some
subjectivity to number scores because we
all wait things different and we've
parlayed that into an advantage like if
you come read pocket now listeners who
believe it or not we are still talking
to you and not just amongst ourselves on
the air on the pocket at weekly if you
come to a pocket now you'll notice that
we have nine guys with completely
different opinions and we don't we
generally don't present anything as the
site's opinion but unfortunately one of
the only areas we do that is
reviews where it makes no sense to do it
so I think what we're saying is I there
are things I would like to change about
the way we do reviews it's funny we're
having we would like to change that yeah
they're things everyone on the sighting
be every time I write but but but but
remember we all different opinions I
don't want to speak for you Taylor no
but here's the thing it's weird that
we're having this conversation on a week
where we actually haven't posted any
reviews and we have the galaxy gear is a
de facto review we'll talk about that in
a second but let's uh let's move on from
the 1520 I think maybe that topic got a
little short change this week I'm sorry
there's just not a lot to talk about its
giant screened nokia windows phone with
another column of tiles which I'm
excited about a camera that seems pretty
epic they've combined the smart cam and
the pro cam into one app which was
overdue should have been done from the
beginning and that's awesome hopefully
they've also taken the lag out of the
pro cam app on the initial startup and
what about white balance can they fix
that oh yeah I'm sure they can I'm sure
they can if not actually motorola can
make you black update if Motorola can
make the Moto X camera passable from
awful then you can do anything let's
talk I don't wanna talk about the 1320
that's been announced for Europe and
Asia a boom it's out there it'll be
whatever it'll be the 625 for the larger
form factor and the 2520 guys I don't
know what to make of this someone talked
about this thing because I just don't
care about a Windows RT device tell me
why I'm wrong ah you're right well then
it's just somebody tweeted me yesterday
no like you guys don't give RT enough
credit and this is your right whatever
tacos we give it exactly the know the
amount of credit it deserves Dewey
though yes I don't know I broke
something last night there were some
commenters coming on I mention something
about limited functionality and someone
really took issue with that racing I'm
sorry it's not that you know you can't
get online with it you can't you know
download apps it's just when you had can
do so much more with a full Windows 8
tablet you can't help but CRT in terms
of what it doesn't do yes that's a solid
point now yes and when you compare even
RT to Android or iOS so that I've had
you have much broader ecosystems there
so mark it's here but that is the same
problem the windows phone well you know
not no it's not cuz window there's a
much more robust ecosystem then but then
RT sure but I mean compare it to deed me
earlier i was asking yeah it's no longer
as big a problem as a specially with we
got to mention it here especially with
instagram and vine coming to the
platform and that should have been a
separate topic on this podcast but I
know that everyone knows what what our
opinion is here right I'm a frickin
fanboy for Instagram i think it's great
news it's awesome vine I don't really
care about but I know millions of people
do so that's awesome for the platform
those that is a massive massive win and
the unfortunate part of it and I'm sorry
guys I know we'll get back to the RT in
a second here but did them unfortunate
part of it is that I i do see this thing
in the press where it's like I see more
stories about the fact that it took
three years for windows phone to get
instagram then I do that Windows Phone
is finally getting Instagram and by the
way it had it with six tagged in a
defective sense but III don't act great
6ag is outstanding but to have the stock
app conveys a legitimacy upon the
platform where no longer can people just
kind of out and out dismiss windows
phone and say no well you know cuz it
doesn't even have Instagram okay how can
I take it seriously you know well now
it's just you know not going to have I
don't know cut the rope or something I
don't know if it's not what happens
another yeah but my point with Windows
RT is that when you compare it to what
it can do compared to you know Android
and iOS or even windows 8 pro it's kind
of in the middle without an ecosystem
it's kind of out there by itself but
it's trying to appeal and come off as
sort of windows 8 pro you know it's
coming off that's what Microsoft i think
is kind of banking on hey this is
windows in a lighter form but you can
still do everything with it now remember
they are downplaying downplaying the RT
in the branding and they're downplaying
the desktop yeah exactly that that's
that's kind of a point like they're
trying to not harp on that too much and
say hey it's a cheaper windows thing but
it's it's tippy fair and Microsoft's
been downplaying the desktop side to
Windows 8 as well it really wants you
using this you know touch-based Metro
interface sure sure it does and which is
not well suited for interaction with a
mouse so that's why they have to kind of
straddle that line there and that's a
whole different mess but I wasn't just
uh this should just integrate leap
motion yeah I want to keep them gonna
find you forget that by the way Taylor
that ever get out I yeah I plugged it up
to my computer last weekend like I got
it months ago and never used it so you
can't really do much with it you can
play games and about five minutes after
playing cut the rope with it you want to
pull your hair out so it's it's awesome
and what it will be able to do what it
can do right now is what i did download
some plugins or apps for my mac i'm so
there i don't so i can use gestures on
my desktop school I can control my
computer with my hands floating in the
air is it be sure to visit desktop now
for that News desktop now calm
vaccinating desktop discussion who gives
you the keeping us on track it's no
problem no problem so now that we're at
55 minutes and I've just spent some time
editing out those swear words the Taylor
Martin made me use an anger what are we
gonna do about this 2520 what's gonna
happen why did nokia release it I don't
know this thing when it was leaked I was
like BS no way are they going to waste
their time on a Windows RT tablet what
are they thinking but there's gotta be
some actus Ilan showed what I'm kidney
what if we're seeing nokia surface
tablets a year from now what if this was
like how they sort of ease themselves
into that that could well be let's talk
about what it what it contains 1080p
display it's 10 inches 615 its
brightness that's awesome it's got LTE
built-in it runs on a snapdragon 800 did
this surprise anyone else I didn't know
it's supposed to read that so so I'm a
little surprised just because I just
read that i'm pretty sure it's what the
rumors thought it was gonna do for a
while but i just i don't know maybe it's
it's because of my knowledge steeply
drops off as we approach the crossover
category but I never pictured Windows RT
is being able to run on a Snapdragon 800
I I don't know why I just thought it was
too resource-intensive as this kind of
faux desktop OS but Microsoft has some
weird thing with SOC s and it
tablet OEM wasn't it like assigning a
certain manufacturers chips to each om
and they could only use those really
last year i believe i heard this like
samsung had to only use kind of Qualcomm
and someone else could only use taig
rose really I don't know they have weird
control issues fascinating yeah I don't
maybe could be of about this this is
they stood in one room and they drew
straws alright well whoever got a car we
got the short straw this is a there's a
6.7 megapixel rear camera interesting
from Nokia it's got Zeiss optics I'm
sure it'll be the best tablet camera
we've ever seen a 2-megapixel
front-facing mega milliamp hour battery
fairly standard and a right that's the
exciting thing it's got Qualcomm quick
charge technology so you need to use a
special plug for it but it will you it
will leverage the quick charge
capabilities of the 800 SOC so that's
cool and it retails for 499 unsubsidized
and it has it also comes with an
external sub woofer right no kidding
know that that's the HTC One max oh
sorry uh Wow yeah so I don't and then
it's got $150 keyboard accessory for it
so I don't know I just I just didn't
think that this would happen so I wonder
if it would have happened if it weren't
for the pending acquisition it seems to
me that if you want to get into the
tablet game I I I just windows RT is not
the way though not the way to do it but
maybe maybe we're wrong maybe we're
being very short-sighted maybe RT is in
fact uh-huh maybe they make this boot
with android shut your room yeah yeah
that'll that'll solve everything so I'm
confused I'm interested but I'm confused
and I'm hopeful that we will review this
tablet but we will have to see if well
I'll do it just not if it's white if
they send me a white one I will send it
back send it to me
ladies it's in a white one I will send
it back in the in the last bit of
absolutely nokia dominated windows news
this week that we cover anyway nokia has
committed a or achieved an awesome PR
coup it Stephen can you tell the story
please okay so there was this filmmaker
put together a clip he went down to
people getting in line for the iphone 5s
last month and I'm going to talk with
them about why they were there if they
really they were there because they just
felt like this is the thing that Apple
fans do if they were really enthused
about it and it kind of the tone to it
wasn't the most positive thing it was
sort of people getting caught up and
fanned them maybe not understanding why
and so he published this and it got some
nice traction online but then Apple
stumbled across it they took the video
portion of it they repurposed it then
for their own uses internally they sped
it up they added some little
light-hearted music and they were
overlaying all the great headlines that
people were saying about the 5s so it
changed from a slightly critical piece
to about the released something showing
how dedicated Apple fans are and Apple
hit another one out of the park with
this and so it made the rounds at Apple
internally and I don't know if they
published it or just word leaked and it
got out that not only did they you know
take this guy's work and completely
change the spirit of it but they took
his name off it in the process and we're
giving him any credit for it um so he's
a nice tat as it was yeah that's the
guys name and the Nokia got wind of this
after the story was out and they thought
that they would you know try to get some
good PR so they sent him a 1020 a great
phone to use it you're going to be
shooting video I think I'm more
impressed by the awesome case they put
it in it looks like a relic or dislike
mini Pelican case that's like yellow on
the outside black throw that off an
airplane it'll land fine good and uh and
a note and the note says casey we know
it sucks when you have your ideas ripped
off stay original casey and we hope
you'll consider capturing some new
moments on this if you're into it let's
do something together surely your friend
nokia it's so our straight yes awesome i
love this like i mean it's it's such a
cool interesting way of countering of
taking advantage of somebody else's bad
PR and playing into an existing
marketing scheme that they were using
which is like when the iphone 5c was
announced nokia was all like hey Apple
thanks for thanks for the compliment we
appreciate your invitation you know like
that was lame yeah that was stupid but
this plays into it in a much cooler way
in a way that's guaranteed to go you
know for lack of a better term go viral
on the other side it's like a positive
attack ad it's you're playing it's
already a polite it has a progressive
yeah it was passive aggressive way to do
something it's so cool I like it I i
really like i want to shake the hand of
the person that came up with this this
this move so i'm very interested to see
I'm gonna now follow casey a nice tat on
twitter and i'm very interested to see
what what happens actually started
following him about two or three weeks
ago so it was kind of oh really cuz i
saw yes all that unfolded i saw when he
got upset because apple stole it oh so
I'm tweeting a my car hmm interesting
well Apple is not the only company to
have suffered some theft due to have to
have committed some theft it has also
suffered a lot from theft and that came
to my attention in the Android part of
my week when I was reviewing the galaxy
gear smartwatch which I love and can
find a lot of areas to improve and
that's encapsulated in two videos we'll
talk about that in a second but what I'm
talking about is guys you know the
commercial we've all been drooling over
the two commercials about the galaxy
gear right where Samsung is like hey
remember all these smart watches from
your childhood check it out now you can
have one you know this is this is one of
those moments where you shouldn't speak
for me because I wasn't drooling over
either I wasn't born from like for the
times that all those things they were
referencing like I was I was not even a
thought at that point I'm not familiar
with us what do they have like a smart
shoe phone would you ever gadget wow you
look Tracy what are we talking about
yeah yes that's exactly right they had
all of that and Jetsons phone the Star
Trek communicator watches and all that
kind of stuff it was all strung together
in a very well done nostalgic commercial
that ended with now it's here and
there's a galaxy gear it's the next big
thing in la Loba but it was the best
Samsung commercial it was the best
commercial Samsung ever did and it's
backed by like a really hip LCD
soundsystem song like it's really really
excellent and I loved it and I thought
it was a turning point for samsung and
it might it may still be because I've
always hated their advertisements and
found them unfunny and stupid and lame
and plotting and cold cloying and stupid
so I love these new ones so they were
unmoving to me well that's it working
that's interesting let's let's just not
be friends and you have it i'll get you
Dunkin Donuts coffee you have no heart
sir i have my own dunkin donuts it's
right next to me but here's mine here's
the thing um someone tweeted about this
someone who writes for a design blog
tweeted a tweet that went something like
I've never seen such a shameless ripoff
I'm disgusted and like linked to the
Samsung Galaxy gear commercials and I'm
like I would want what are you talking
about a while and then he linked to it
wasn't a piece he wrote it was just like
a blog post with that video alongside a
five or six year old video six years I
guess at this point advertising the
first iphone do you guys remember the
first iPhones hello spot when it was a
TV spot it was about 30 seconds for 60
seconds depending and it was the exact
same thing just with people not talking
on their watches but people from the
last 50 or 60 years of TV and film
picking up a phone and saying hello you
don't remember this that sounds vaguely
familiar right I was like it was like
eight years old at the time I don't know
if you watch if you might even remind me
that we only need to have old dudes on
the show from now on that a crotchety
more crotchety we got to give the young
people there on the table okay that's
thanks get off my lawn but if you watch
the apple commercial alongside the
galaxy gear commercial like the tone is
exactly the same and like I would be
surprised if the cuts if the length of
the cuts was exactly the same
it's unbelievable I want to say that
that's been done before though I can't
think of any specific instance but it
seems like it's the general sort of true
like a car manufacturer must have done
something exactly like that and now the
new the Chevy altima right yeah at some
point everything is a copyright there's
got to be something that predates the
apple commercial that totally nullifies
this yeah right ultimately it doesn't
but chains are both mobile companies and
they aren't you and if their mobile
companies that have historically been
accused of copying each other yeah I can
say this i just watched that hello
iphone commercial yeah and I can relate
more to that of course what I don't
think you know the big lebowski I don't
your lender and things that I can vote
with chili of the most highly over rated
films in the history of the cinema I'm
sorry I'm shut your mouth about zulan no
I can't it's not funny I don't get it
it's not funny to me I don't understand
maybe you're too old and big lebowski
like I don't know after being told it
was awesome for six years I finally
watched it one night I'm like yeah I
mean it's fine I mean John Goodman's you
know big and angry that's cool anyway
the galaxy Gear's pulp fiction well pulp
fiction is pretty excellent but I don't
like when a tarantino otherwise but
anyway I know right we're all gonna have
a big artistic kerfuffle on the podcast
but not now because we need to talk
about the galaxy gear specifically dudes
related to what we were talking about
before with regard to our review
structure and stuff this was something
where we took an opportunity to do
something different I didn't want to
just do a review because we were late
because we weren't in the early seating
batch of galaxies years so we had to
wait for a second wave and thanks to our
friends at AT&amp;amp;T we got one and I was
like no we're what what are we like two
weeks beyond the first reviews landing
I'm not gonna we're not just going to do
another review so we decided to split
them up and we have two videos up five
awesome things about the galaxy gear
five awful things about the galaxy gear
it's also a fun little experiment to see
which one gets viewed more do you guys
want to piss like that to tip jars yeah
what what happened to tip jars and go to
a coffee shop you vote for something by
that happened to her too I thought that
was like it love is like a Boston thing
how cool ya know it's exactly like that
i want to see i guarantee you that that
the awful one gets watched like five
times more because people love drama yes
probably what do you thi know it has
more views does it have more views right
now it does they have similar amounts of
likes and dislikes but the the awful
ones has about a hundred more views and
about almost two hundred probably 70
more comments I would guess people it's
coming that way better anyway so that's
a fun experiment go watch those also and
this will I think be the last bit of
pocket now insider esque type stuff
people are mind-blowing Lee committed to
having us cover the galaxy gear as it
compares to the sony smartwatch 2 well
I'm trying not to air a lot of our dirty
laundry and I'm not going to do that but
guys the the simple truth of it is that
we didn't get a smart wish to the review
we don't have a very solid relationship
with Sony despite our best efforts so we
don't have one if we don't have a review
unit we have to go buy one and we can
only buy so many units a month because
we're not massive so I'm sorry we
haven't reviewed the SmartWatch 2 yet I
would love to I love watches I'm a geek
for smartwatches I would like to get one
but I can't right now so we will try to
do you think what you need to do is to
get tripod with you go to like a best
buy or something it's care about an
aisle before exactly right like if I if
this was a different situation if we
were like you know if it was just me and
I was Captain two phones calm and you
know it was like 2 2010 that's what I
would do I'd like sneak into a best buy
and be like hey guys this is a little
hands on the list no sony smartwatch 2
it's pretty cool no i don't need any
help thank you it's really it's got
buttons on the side and you know you
know we're not doing that we're not
doing that so um we'll do a sickly but
basically the comments to what you just
said are gonna be you don't have a great
relationship with Sony because you're
biased against its own that's right
that's exactly what's good actly what's
gonna happen yes yes yes it's true we're
not we have explained this million times
anyway so that's as I promised that will
be our last bit of kind of meta the
galaxy s4 has sold 40 million and six
months are all of us on the air very
surprised by this metric did we think
this thing was going to be a big flop
now we know we did not andrea was going
to be bigger than the s3 so
well yes par for the course exactly
exactly despite the fact that I think I
don't think they're hitting the numbers
that they thought they were going to hit
I have zero to back that up but Stephen
are you seeing anything on the in the
news side but yeah that's what all these
rumors about an early galaxy s5 launcher
based upon us right way talking they're
good but not great so they want to rush
this one out of the gate right right
right that makes sense hey this was not
going to as good as we thought it would
so let's push this one out early and
dead send out an unfinished product
suite that sound like a good idea I'm
gonna go ahead and sign that one yeah do
it good luck and you know what let's use
that guy's cross your eyes to zoom
feature cuz that one's something forgot
about that oh let's see than that i've
been using the galaxy gear has required
me to use a galaxy note 3 of course the
past week and i have been i've been very
happy to use the black one as we talked
about with Marquez last week it's been
really cool to like use the softer
better feeling one in the hand and I'll
take the opportunity got wet cement good
that was actually me did you sinned
really the verizon one in my way no no
no I didn't do that thanks guy I've been
asking the ladies in the office I'm like
hey have you got a package for me
they're like no I'm fire in its later
this week you have a package for me I'm
sorry this week has been atrocious I
apologize um it'll go out to you soon
we'll all have a galaxy notes again and
it'll be great I don't know if you know
except for Steven but see what you like
your idea do I have the since you via
first one yet I'll send you the note
10.1 know what did I do to you it's
actually nice if it had an Exynos it
didn't have the eggs in oside be a
hundred times better but if some butts
were candy and nuts and read for three
with Sense 5.5 starts hitting HDC ones
is the next bit of news on the rundown
this is important because a formerly you
can only get sense 5.5 with its
blinkfeed and gallery enhancements on
the one max which is not only less
popular going to be less popular than
the one probably but it's also going to
be
do not too late and its availability but
it's you can get a one right now and you
can't get a one max right now so blah
blah blah blah blah the sense 5.5 update
will make you happy if you have an HTC
one you want to download this as soon as
you can carrier testing obviously has to
go through and some of this stuff but
the enhancements that you can see in the
one max review are really really cool
and they're especially cool on the one
so get it you know this render for that
that article the blue HTC one that
render looks beautiful well the way
Tracy one is a beautiful phone I saw it
in person I didn't like it what you a
strange person why didn't you like it I
don't know this looks more like baby
blue than than the one english doubt in
person it's it's me than the red one the
red one is more brilliant but the de
pluie one is X get the blue one looks
like Duke Blue in person though do cool
yeah Duke Blue what the hell is Duke Oh
Duke like Duke University yeah the whole
lotta things down super Carolina oh yeah
that it's a big rivalry here in North
Carolina I mean I see you it's like what
a John Wayne like wear a lot of boys I'm
just thinking like a new look and that
didn't make any sense oh yeah man so
let's wrap it up and throw the flu in
the toilets on the airplanes that stuff
oh that's how yeah that's a gross blue
that's not a fun blue like a barbershop
hair juice or the comb juice blue oh
yeah oh I know what you're talking about
the bar beside bar besides mmm what are
we doing here all right let's close it
out on the news and HTC android HTC
amazon smartphone the smartphone family
that is rumored to be in development by
HTC for amazon is a bad idea says pundit
stephen shank of pocketnow.com tell us
why Stephen well I just feel like it's
HTC falling back on its old habits back
in Windows Mobile days when it was
churning out plenty of devices for other
people but wasn't making much of a name
for itself and it's grown a lot since
then and I'm worried that these you know
troubled times it's seeing or sort of
causing it to go back to its safety net
and I don't
think that a lot of people were agreeing
with me based on with the comments I saw
they think that HTC just getting any
business at all could help ensure it
will keep the company going and maybe
that will then allow it to a year from
now put more resources on its own phones
or maybe it's big enough that it can do
two things at once it can had its head
and drop its tummy without falling over
I just shank guy I could doing his job
better than he could though you know
first we saw the facebook phone and now
this it's like HTC's losing its HTC
pneus I wanted to ask some questions
about the HTC first at HTC frequencies
and I actually didn't didn't get to we
didn't talk about it at all but um so
who's responsible for that do you know
I'm gonna miss that form do you know who
does carry well tell her that's why I
bring it up you know who's carrying one
was uh was rich brown from phonescoop
and I he was nice enough to let me
borrow it and they're doing a car ride
at one point for like a couple minutes I
was like my god this thing feels great
it's a great little phone it is it's
like that sees Moto X it will I just
gonna say that yes yeah so is I want one
like I want to do it'll engine that good
they're so nice you know there were made
fun of me you made fun of me I shared
attributes as I'd like no but then I
came on the podcast I remember this I
came on the podcast I was like Taylor I
apologize cuz I went to an AT&amp;amp;T store
and handled that first it's cool but
even then it had a stupid cradle on you
know the stupid retail anti-theft things
I didn't get to actually hold one hold
one and then I held the one in London I
was like oh my god it's so cool I even
like the circle on it yeah the circles
even close I like the buttons you get it
you disable facebook home and you call
it a day and you had a stock android
phone and it's great yeah like another
thing that wasn't great on there was the
camera and it wasn't bad for a 5
megapixel camera or four I can't
remember i think it's five probably five
it wasn't bad like it would take decent
shots that low light was terrible but
you know it i would say that it actually
has a comparable camera to the Moto X
like like I would carry them first I
would it was a good phone we should all
just be just turn-turn like nouveau
hipster and every one of the puzzle now
team should get an HTC first like that
should be the official pocketnow team
phone and that because yes
that would get him puckett now branded
because yeah yeah we need to get a skin
on him yeah all right so that's cool so
Stephen I I like your your perspective I
understand i like i like Stevens pieces
because he frequently put stuff in
context that I and sees things from a
perspective i ordinarily wouldn't and I
really like that I I know exactly where
you're coming from I used to sell phones
back when HTC was making them for other
people and I was like man these guys are
going to be great if they ever just
break out on their own and do their own
thing and then they were for a couple
years and now they're still great but
nobody buys them so it's it's I don't
know I'm just excited to see these HTC
amazon phones if they do come to pass
yeah there's I'm excited I see new
things from HTC even if they are making
them for somebody else and I mean I
really want to see these rumors about
the talking about maybe be four cameras
on the corners of the phone there was a
patent that I think Amazon had for the
technology that would allow for really
accurate in space position sensing of
your hands so gestures not just like air
gestures using a single camera like on
samsung but it could you could like
reach in towards the screen and it would
also have a sort of pseudo 3d effect if
you sound really whoa interesting and
potentially more useful than those real
3d screens we had a year or two ago that
were complete fizzles I love Michaels
reaction whoa this is the kind of phone
feature that you would think of like
well hi right that's exactly how you
sounded you just kind of like uh well
which is it friday no not at all and it
should be oh my gosh so we'll wait to
see what comes out of that stephen i
hope one of those cool groundbreaking
features cuz you know what we don't need
we don't need a handheld kindle fire
that's what we don't need no we do not
we do not need amazon skin on it oh I
feel I can do anything about that if
it's good if it's good then I'll take it
if it's not good then I don't want it
either so so far the only skin i really
like is sense so you never decide the
editorial i wanted to about an Amazon
phone which was based on a rumor that
Amazon denied but it was
the rumor about an HTC not at hcc amazon
phone being free oh right right right
yeah art of that that's back now that
we're talking about it being free but
that still might be some sort of prime
exclusive mmm-hmm but doesn't make any
sense to me but yeah I don't know but uh
I mad I'd look at it I'd look at it but
I don't want amazon skin like it it's
one of the worst skins you haven't seen
another held yet they're gonna redesign
it for the handheld if they do and it's
possible that we'll look it'll look good
they're not going to do the magazine
analog they're not going to do the disk
rolling carousel of titles because that
makes no sense on the phone so that also
means but it also means that you're
going to have google play services at
all so it's not really oh why good as a
fedora yeah yeah yeah yeah so you're
tied into Amazon's ecosystem this the
whole point of it existing yeah which is
not cool and I love amazon i buy a ton
of stuff from amazon and woot which is
also an amazon company but is it oh
that's right it was a huge boob guy back
then they were stopped using it several
years ago I've never been a woot goo a
dude that was my favorite like rumor
that never came to pass was that when
when we were all like who's gonna buy
webos like Amazon was gonna buy it I
think that would have been really really
very cool yeah totally different
conversation right now be awesome he
said as he cradled his dead pre three
and thought of the pass over cold coffee
let's get to the end of the podcast
because we do have work to do even
though we prefer not to think about that
we are coming into listener mail you
like that Shatner Lena I'm just gonna be
a little own sound clip in the
background there you get via report oh
there no oh before we can do edited
version it's there it didn't put yeah
people are like what do you mean Stephen
it was right there listeners are very
confused right now look like a fool what
do you want to UM but before we move on
to list normal I'm just a reminder
there's a google play event tonight at
seven pm eastern way well it's not only
not going to be hardware I mean we don't
know what it is so just keep an eye out
for that I forget by then so it's
ironically I supported the words been no
news either hardware or software that's
very services so that's funny I hope
it's I hope it's not a big deal because
ironically i'm supposed to go talk with
somebody this evening about google stuff
so that's funny well okay well hopefully
I said I just wanted to plant plug in
there so we're not doing a yeah what
about doing a round table for it or
anything because we don't think
anything's gonna happen now chances are
all these rumors are bogus and
something's gonna happen and none of us
will be on our toes and then everything
will go haywire because that's how this
week has been so yeah so there's that
but I'll be working until late and I
don't probably editorialize something
that happens there because I've done
very little this week so never done a
little book end as much as I've looked
forward to this weekend you and me both
buddy that being said I think it's time
for the bong bong and it's time for
listener mail Remington Jackson kicks us
off on their first piece of listener
male deer PocketNow podcast he says I've
been looking at the pebble smartwatch
and wanted some advice what are the most
useful features that all you think this
device has to offer besides telling time
showing distance during runs and as a
dedicated Bluetooth device well this is
an easy question to answer first of all
showing distance during runs Remington I
know it does that but I have no
experience in that because I don't do
that whole run sighs this car is for ya
reminiscent there Michael does well
that's what Michael does he enables it
and then he runs and jumps on the bus
it's exactly right rides around I get 17
steps for my front door to the bus stop
there you go oh no no no in able it and
then you hop on the bus and you ride
around and you feel good because you can
look at your watching it says you
actually did something she did yes space
there is it like a pedometer yeah no I
don't yet gps-based okay no wait a
second if it's got an accelerometer in
her so you can get a pedometer if you
want in which case that whole bus joke
wouldn't work Taylor he had a lot lately
if you have your device yet every six
blog exactly so anyway Remington answer
your question notifications man like
that's what the pebble
does I I don't know if that's what you
mean by as a dedicated bluetooth device
Remington but um now I mean it's
notifications for me is the number one
thing that I love the pebble for because
as we've said a bunch of times you know
you can you don't have to take your
phone out of your pocket like at all and
and just drop inbound stuff and music
control if you if you use the stock
music player right no you can use
Spotify it's got support for all of them
oh really I didn't know as long as use
of a Spotify yeah what it does is if you
go into the app and you set your default
music player so if an application is set
to play music it did like it if it has
that capability then you can set it as
your default music player yeah so that's
that's pretty cool so you can use it to
skip tracks without taking your phone at
your pocket or using that stupid little
wonky button on your headphones which
never works right that was that any
different than just using the watch what
do you what what what do you mean I mean
you just actuated control that's not on
your phone what's the difference between
doing it on the watch and doing it on
the record well because the cord button
I don't know about you guys but I never
have any luck with like it's like double
tap to advance the next track and then
I'll like you know I won't get the
timing right and it'll like this instead
okay that's fair yeah also I leave my
phone across the room and I said a
speaker up near me sometimes like if I
need to charge my phone or whatever and
I'm pebble my wrist I just skipping
Paul's and play from across the room
plus like the little modules on the
cords on headphone wires I guess I wear
a lot of collared shirts like very
rarely do i wear a shirt without mr.
fancy cuz I'm a fancy dude no but like
it gets hung up on my collars and I'll
like turn my head to see something and
ripped it your butt out of my time like
I hate it so I took the stupid module
into my neck which is why when I call
Taylor when we're having a when we're
having like a like a deep throat news
conference like we did yesterday about
like breaking top secret news the
Taylor's like you sound like you're in a
wind tunnel I'm like shut up man
Boston's windy can you never refer to
your conversations media is a deep
through something please you know you
know get get with the news lingo buddy
or after after tucking something in your
throat like I don't know what's
happening right now Remington we hope
we've answered your question
i'm looking at pebble apps um you can
also put notes on your pebble so if you
need something to remind you you can
actually edit and look at notes on your
watch you can use if this there's if
this then that will plug into it so you
can do a whole map Remington it's a very
expandable device it doesn't seem like
it because the screen is like you know
it's like something out of I don't know
1989 but it's really really adaptable
it's really versatile and because the
screen is is that I Inc you know display
god I always get that wrong it's he Hank
naughty paper right the t paper not
eating it was an LCD mmm yes a paper is
an LCD dragon oil city because the
display using that technology it doesn't
use a lot of battery life so there's us
play who's flying an RC plane right
sorry I'm sorry there there
disassembling the sidewalk near my
office so sorry about the park yeah yeah
yeah and you can park under them and
stuff you know fancy but the thing is by
one Remington if you were thinking that
you might like it by one use it for the
return period if you hate it return it
when in lambaste Michael own Twitter
absolutely leave a comment about how
we're all wrong thank you for writing in
though it's good to hear from you again
oh and little is the next one and Taylor
why don't you read that one nokia's I
can't read learn another go and take to
go Nokia's announcements of the 15 20
and 25 28 nokia world highlighted
potential problem for microsoft nokia
not faced by android and iOS both of
these devices use the same Snapdragon
800 but offer different operating
systems capabilities and apps what
screen size is the right crossover point
for windows phone 8 to Windows RT where
there's a tarty does Microsoft need to
unify these before it can succeed thanks
for the great show it's I must listen
every week uh so Stephen are you still
there i'm back sorry i was like what
happened i was a little glitch there so
i was looking around to see what
happened I'm sorry oh and yeah oh and
I'm sorry as your mail was being read
like skype gave us the sign off sound
and then it and then i'm actually
looking at a screen right now that says
call ended with Stephen shank and Taylor
Mardan
I mean I'm still I mean we're still here
and the car recorder button is still
flashing so I think we're still good I
hope we're still good cuz otherwise just
redo the past hour and a half yeah so
sorry um thanks for the great shows who
must listen every week first of all
thank you for that and then how would
you answer this question Taylor I would
hand it over to Steve knew it because he
was talking about this earlier actually
I mean the crossover point should be
somewhere around six or seven inches but
uh oh wait what from Windows Phone 8 to
Windows Phone 8 to Windows 8/rt what is
yeah so as the red crossover point I
mean something running is with the sink
the 6 inch display is not quite big
enough for Windows RT I don't think
something with seven maybe but I don't
know I'm saying keep you know that like
maybe eight to ten inch tablets as RT
but then you've got this like just just
get rid of RTL together why don't you
just run Windows Phone 8 on everything
up to 10 inch and then have your pro
like your your your service pros and
your windows 8 pro tablets like I don't
understand why RT needs to exist with
Windows Phone 8 out there three brand
Windows Phone 8 is something else I
don't know it require yeah it just
doesn't make sense to me yeah I don't
think it makes sense to anyone that's an
interesting point I had never considered
running Windows Phone as like a tablet
you as a tablet OS on something like a
7-inch tablet I mean that's that would
make a lot more sense than RT in some
respects because you are getting the
you're getting that the advantage of the
windows phone 8 app ecosystem at least
which is much more robust yeah then the
windows also team so those guys outside
or trolling you I know I'm dropping out
I'm gonna believe it was like dead
silence and then Michael starts to talk
and no but I know tell her your idea is
solid though and that I mean I
completely agree although there's
something obvious that we're missing
what is it what practical advantage
besides fake desktop does our tea offer
over I mean does it all layout is it all
like taking advantage it allows
manufacturers to use the arm-based chips
I don't know where the actual component
costs are but maybe they're more for
durable than the atoms that you need for
the pro I don't know maybe but I mean
with say running Windows Phone 8 on a
even a 10 inch tablet couldn't you just
do kind of like a snap mimic feature
where if if the developer hasn't
supported a full 10 inch screen you just
snap a tiny little part of it on part of
your screen and do sort of like
multi-window I mean it to me mmm I feel
like you could do a lot with it a lot
more than this half-baked operating
system that really doesn't have a place
in this world hmm that was kind of harsh
but I mean it I mean it Oh heartedly
compelling thoughts the other words what
am I not seeing a hard cross over from
Windows Phone 8 2 RT I mean we could
have maybe this is an RT but windows 8
pro I think we could stand to have both
full on Windows and Windows Phone based
devices living in the same sort of size
range this 7 to 8-inch probably hmm let
the market decide which one's better
yeah and just a follow RT all together I
think we are going to see some
interesting interactions between RT and
Windows Phone 8 as time goes on but yeah
I would agree with you that the rough
crossover size is probably seven to
eight inches in my opinion and does
Microsoft need to unify these before it
can succeed yeah oh and I think so and I
think we also we all think so i think
everybody thinks so I think make
yourself no sir Microsoft has three
operating systems who else does that
Apple has to google has to Microsoft has
three and they all look exactly the same
so it's like why you said yeah all right
well let's move on this is I think we
covered it a little bit earlier in the
show so if you jumped right to listener
Melo and hop back up to the window
section we talked about that a little
bit more in the midst of a whole bunch
of trips into the weeds we hope you
enjoy I'll take the next free solicitor
mails from Jake Rossum guys just a
really quick question about the one max
what are those three dots or circles on
the back right side of it yeah I'll take
this because i like completely failed to
call these out on the video review and
then i was like oh I got to put that in
the written review and then I really
didn't those are pogo connector
they exist so that you can use
accessories with the one max such as the
charging power sleeve that HTC is
marketing to go along with it which uses
an external battery to provide
additional power it's really nothing new
that pogo connectors we see them on a
lot of devices the nexus nexus one that
we won they were on the nexus one in all
the galaxies and ex has had them as well
the sum of the nexus 7 7's have them
don't they ah yes the original Nexus 7
yeah you can do that with those things
you can do a lot with them you can do
external charging sleeves you can I
think you can make like Doc's that take
advantage of the Pogo connectors yeah
yeah so they have done I don't get that
that's what they're originally designed
for is hey here's a doc you can also get
for your phone for your nightstand or
your desk or whatever and then they
never release the dock where they
release the dock like eight months after
the phone comes out and nobody cares
about it anymore and then they charge
like eighty dollars for a piece of
plastic and charger or they implemented
poorly as such as in the Lumia 1020
where you can also see the Pogo
connectors and then you slap a wireless
charging cradle on there that doesn't
really mesh up well with the Pogo
connectors and as a result of dozens I
was wondering to mix that earlier
instead it didn't work well if you just
met like it didn't shart I gave it was
broken that sounds like what you're
saying well no that was one of those
situations where I was like guys thank
you for sending this I think you sent me
a defective one could you send me
another one then they sent me another
one like oh no this is just crap and
then I'm on the forums of the world and
everyone's like why doesn't this work
I'm like oh right because it's defective
that's the problem with pogo connectors
I mean they're great because they're not
going to get damaged you're not going to
bend a pin because it's perfectly flat
on a device but they can get dirty you
can have alignment problem so it's a
trade-off the accessory maker has to
like very very manufacturer accessories
to a very specific tolerance when you're
talking about Pogo connectors because
the usable area to work with is very
small and you for an allotment problem
like yeah yeah um go ahead tell her and
then you get to up the last piece of
listener man decided to read a piece
weights even didn't you already know why
I'm so tired Stephen you get to read the
last piece of listener man Taylor you
went to talk for ten seconds ten seconds
ok so galaxy note man galaxy samsung it
is you met it up you met them already
there goes 10 seconds um samsung did
this would be no tattoo nice but it
wasn't they didn't have pogo pins but it
was a dock so this is kind of the same
thing but uh okay yeah cool sorry I had
an email from Brandon yeah so what they
did is they created this dock which
would turn your Galaxy Note 2 into
basically a computer so it's a doctor
with a monitor port a keyboard and USB
ports for a keyboard of mouse and they
announced it like eight months after the
note 2 came out yeah not eight months
like four or five months and then they
released it like four months after that
like it just never really came to be so
it's like the galaxy s3 wireless
charging dock that that didn't happen
until like the galaxy s4 came out yeah
it's all this stuff it's all this crap
Stephen read that last thing okay this
one is from matt lawrence yes he writes
in to ask would you prefer having one
platform in your life across multiple
devices when your cell phone tablet pc
all that or would you rather switch
things up have different platforms on
different devices he says they're
certainly advantages to having the same
platform across them including new app
and data crossover and similar you eyes
but with cloud surface and cloud
services and apps available
cross-platform it might be less of an
issue wants to know if that matters to
us I love this question hmm even if I
didn't I'll answer first even if I
didn't have constant access to devices
on different platforms and a need to use
different platforms I would totally
totally have devices on different
platforms because I love the new i love
that different you eyes work better on
different screen sizes and as i think
i've said before my ideal setup is like
mac OS on the desktop android on a
tablet and windows phone on a smartphone
like that's kind of where I'm happiest
and I seldom have problems with the
multiple device multiple platform
problem because I use a lot of
cloud-based stuff like all my music is
Spotify based all my notes are in
Evernote or one note or whatever and
those were both cross-platform you know
like and then I've got a bunch of crap
and Google Drive I don't
need I think when it would cost me if I
wanted to jump ship from one platform
entirely and leap into another in terms
of purchased apps and things at this
point it would cost me like 20 bucks mmm
of like rebe eyeing stuff it's really
not as big a deal as I think a lot of
people think it is for everyone but I'm
sure you guys have different answers it
matter is going to go ahead Taylor I'm
kind of in the same boat as as you
Michael I use mac OS mac OS on my
desktop I have an android phone and
iphone and the windows phone and I
actively carry at least two of them
switching out different phones I have a
7-inch android tablet which i think is
my favorite android tablet size and then
i'm going to have an ipad air which will
be mine so and i have a lot of devices
and having services that work across all
of those is all important although i
have switched over almost entirely to
google play music it's something that i
just have to deal with yeah i would not
prefer to have one platform across all
devices or one experience even across
all devices because we've talked about
that before how iOS is kind of merging
with with OS 10 at least in the fact
that you get a very similar experience
across both of them having the same
exact experience on my computer a tablet
and a smartphone would drive me up the
wall yeah because there is no yeah
there's no one-size-fits-all you I no
one-size-fits-all experience really
agree know Stephen manufacturers I
understand they would really love us to
week is married to the one platform for
life I think Microsoft is pushing this
harder than everyone and even have the
xbox factored in for your pinging bring
the living room into this but I am fine
with switching between platforms I mean
I'm Android my primary phones right now
so that's not really an option on the on
the desktop so i'm already using
multiple platforms but like you guys
have been saying if you want what's best
for the device and with all the new
cloud services we have now to save our
stuff do we can access it easily when we
do have you know if you buy a bunch of
music on
toons you can always just import it into
google music and move it between these
more device or more platform centered
services so I say you know use whatever
you want on the device that works best
for you yeah now I agree and I will not
let this one thing pass in our final
piece of listener mail there Matt did
also say that he just started listening
