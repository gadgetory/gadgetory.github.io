pocketnow.com
and this is the hardware toward the HTC
snap this is the unlocked European
version which will work in the US but
not with 3G data and Europe it'll work
fine with 3G data and of course the snap
will see a release on many global
carriers in the US it will be on Sprint
and t-mobile and Verizon and you'll see
it in Europe on the major carriers there
too coming out soon so let's take a tour
of the device the device is
characterized by this kind of circle
theme this is because of the inner
circle feature so these buttons here are
circular you have a circular trackball
here then we'll talk about later and the
buttons are kind of rounded on the edges
they're not exactly circular they kind
of have a squarish rectangular shape to
them and and of course we'll talk more
about the keyboard in a minute but it's
a nice looking device it's covered in a
rubber coating just like the original
t-mobile - so it feels very solid in
hand it doesn't feel like you're gonna
drop it it's not as Sheen as a an HTC
Touch pro2 or a diamond - where there is
just shiny materials galore but that's a
good thing because you're not gonna get
finger prints on the HTC snap this the
screen is not touched so you're not
touching the screen and you know you
spend most of your time on the hardware
buttons which is a matte finish and
you're not gonna pick up fingerprints
there so let's zoom in a little bit up
here on the top we have the LED
indicator light with a speaker and to
the right of that is the light sensor
and the light sensor oddly doesn't
control screen brightness it only turns
on and off the backlit key
the screen is 2.4 inches diagonal which
is admittedly kind of small but these
non touchscreen devices have smaller
screens and that's not that big of a
deal compared to the rest of the device
that takes up about half of the portion
here so it's not too bad the resolution
is 240 down and 320 across again
resolutions kind of low but because the
screen size is so small the text is
still crisp and whatnot now let's go
down to this area we have this nice
brushed metal aluminum
piece here that surrounds the hardware
buttons here's call start soft key home
and then the d-pad which is actually a
trackball it's very interesting you can
adjust the sensitivity it's a nice
sensation because as with other Windows
Mobile standard devices you have to move
your thumb in this kind of fashion to
move around on the screen but with the
snap you have a smaller range of motion
which is good and it lends to higher
productivity I think here we have a
backer ok button followed by another
soft key button and the call and key now
let's take a look at this keyboard this
keyboard will definitely take a lot of
getting used to and a quick glance you
would think it's such a fantastic
keyboard because the letters are big
they're offset there is they're in a
kind of smiley face like pattern so that
it's more ergonomic but that's not the
case I've only been using this for a few
hours but so far I'm not too impressed
by the keyboard and one of the biggest
reasons is because this key here should
actually be the a key if you look at any
other QWERTY device like the q9 the a
key goes all the way to the edge or you
look at the blackjack to the a key goes
all the way to the edge so I'm
constantly hitting the tab button
thinking that it's an a making me have
to look at the keyboard when I type
which really slows me down it's
something to get used to but something
you definitely want to know about now
the numbers are embedded here in the
letters so if you want to dial a number
you just hold down the function key or
if you're on the main screen the home
screen and you want to dial somebody's
number you can start dialing here or you
can just type their name and in the
software tour we're going to talk more
about that now in terms of buttons we
have the use we can get into the camera
quickly we can get into the messenger
quickly Windows Live Messenger email
application in our circle which allows
you to filter out email and just see the
email from five or six or three people
that you only want to correspond with so
that you kind of cut out the junk and
the clutter just respond to people that
are emailing you that you think are
important up here is the lock button so
you tap and hold this to lock the device
and the unlock sequence and we'll talk
about this in the software tour is you
press this button the soft key button
and the Q again so that is the keyboard
it's gonna take some getting used to but
we'll talk about how the experience is
after a few days in the full review
coming up on pocket now calm here on the
bottom we have the microphone let's go
over to the side and while we're on the
side let's talk a little bit about how
thick this
this is a very very thin device it's
only 12 millimeters thick and as a
comparison the q9 is about 0.2
millimeters thinner but you really can't
tell it's it's much much thinner than
the blackjack - it's thinner than the -
actually the original t-mobile - the HDC
xcalibur
by a small amount but it feels very thin
in hand it slides into the pocket very
easily and that's a really great thing
so let's continue on the outside here
here we have a volume rocker then we
have a lanyard hook there this helps you
get the back battery cover off and we'll
take that off in a second over on the
other side we have nothing except
there's a little bit of a there's a
little cover here which will reveal the
charging port which is used for syncing
charging an audio of course this doesn't
have a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack so
you're gonna want to get a converter
jack or you can use the headphones that
come with the snap which includes that
plug and let's look on the back on the
back we have the the external speaker
that's used for the speakerphone or if
you're listening to music and then we
have a nice brush metal piece actually
the same sort of design as you'll find
over here surrounding the 2 megapixel
camera and there's no flash on the
camera unfortunately and as I mentioned
the entire back is that rubbery coating
that was made famous by the xcalibur the
t-mobile - really feels solid in him so
to take off the battery cover you kind
of got to stick your finger now in there
and take take it off like this now down
here you will find the microSD slot
unfortunately it's under the battery
cover this is a trend for all HTC
devices they're doing under the battery
cover for the micro sd card
interestingly enough the battery on the
snap is the same battery that comes on
the HTC Touch pro2
so we're expecting really really
fantastic battery life from the 1500
milliamp hour battery of course we're
gonna talk all about battery life in the
full review after we've used it for more
than more than a few hours so first
impressions of the device is that if you
had a - before or the xcalibur this is
going to be an awesome upgrade for you
especially when it hits all the carriers
at subsidized prices right now you can
get this at clove code
uk4 255 british pounds which comes out
to about four hundred and fifteen
dollars and considering this is a brand
new phone that's a really good price for
an unlocked device like this that just
came out so coming up in the software
tour we're going to go through all of
the enhancements we're going to talk
about the HTC inner circle feature and
soon after that we will post the full
review on pocketnow.com
i'll put a link up on the video for the
unboxing in case you missed that on the
HTC snap that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
