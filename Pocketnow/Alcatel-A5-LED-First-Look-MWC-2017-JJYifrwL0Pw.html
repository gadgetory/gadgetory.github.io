announcement of the BlackBerry key one
we also got some hands-on time with the
new Alcatel phones no not a new Idol
we'll have to wait a bit longer on that
instead we're looking at a revamp of the
pixi and the top
more specifically the names pixie and
pop are going away and in their place
are the a series and u series the new a
508 will bring a 5.2 inch 720p display
powered by a media tech chipset and the
hip new collection of removable backs
the unique feature here is this LED
panel which provides some entertainment
when bumping your favorite tunes and
will match the customization options
found in the UI for alerts and
notifications customization is the name
of the game and this red theme here was
built from scanning this color using the
phone's camera if a light show isn't
your cup of tea pop this back off or a
normal one or a battery pack or a larger
speaker yo Alcatel is going modular and
even though this is early pre-release
hardware they even figured out the
basics like swapping one back for
another and not needing to reboot the
phone
modular backs could be a fun feature to
include in this bang for buck territory
reinforcing the notion that not only mid
Rangers but entry-level faire is getting
a shot in the arm this year too we'll
also see the u5 arrive with modest specs
to cover the absolute basics it's always
nice to see a few more usable phones in
burner phone territory no pricing or
availability info just yet but we'll
keep you posted when we get more
information as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full MWC 2017 coverage
and help us out with some sharing on
your favorite social networks for pocket
now I'm Juan Carlos fag now some gadget
guy on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
