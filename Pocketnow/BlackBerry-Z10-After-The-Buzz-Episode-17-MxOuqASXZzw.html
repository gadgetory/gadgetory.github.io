new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it
let's take another look at the new
BlackBerry to see if it's ripened or
soured in the four months since its
release and what that means for the
company behind it I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow this is the BlackBerry
z10 and this is episode 17 of after the
buzz when it broke cover in January the
z10 looked nothing like the BlackBerry's
that preceded it the minimal thin and
keyboard less black slab was a departure
from the traditional design language of
the company formerly known as rim only a
flashing red LED and a pair of oversized
logos speaking to its rich ancestry and
the disparities were even more visible
on the software side with the familiar
blackberry platform of old replaced by a
gesture driven interface that resembled
a mash-up of a few different operating
systems rolled into one
BlackBerry had been in need of a
reinvention for years and the z10 was as
big a reboot as possible how is the
refresh held up well let's dive in and
find out in terms of hardware the z10
continues to stand out for a mix of good
and bad reasons
on the downside its design was pretty
generic when it launched and that
perception is only going to grow as
manufacturers like HTC Apple and Nokia
continue to kick out well-crafted
Hardware using higher-end materials but
though the Z tends aesthetics aren't
mind-blowing its materials are durable
and reassuring in the hand the soft
touch back and powder coated metal
casing members work with the stainless
steel frame to make the phone feel more
substantial than its 136 grams would
suggest and it holds up two drops and
scuffs pretty well because of this you
don't really mind dropping it or tossing
it carelessly around something that
really can't be said for Samsung's hyper
or HTC and Apple's aluminum the screen
still gets smudgy as anything at the
slightest graze of a fingertip but then
you've always got the carrying case a
smart accessory we still love using to
help with that the camera while good for
casual shots has suffered a bit from the
recent popularization of low-light
photography and optical image
stabilization so while it's the same
camera it's perception has diminished a
bit due to its no-frills approach
BlackBerry's timeshift offering is still
cool but it alone can't keep pace with
the feature-packed competition though
blackberry 10.1 does offer support for
HDR so it's nice to see the company is
still improving here if a camera is a
big priority in your smartphone shopping
though you still don't have much reason
to choose blackberry over many of its
competitors
overall the z10 Hardware may not turn as
many heads as its flashy er competitors
but it still got a kind of corporate
elegance that those with more subtle
tastes will appreciate it's also capable
of getting a little roughed up something
that always earns extra points for those
who can't be bothered with cases or
babying the extreme simplicity that
characterizes the hardware doesn't carry
over to the software with all its
gestures bb10 is a relatively
complicated platform something that
definitely takes some getting used to
unfortunately though once you acclimate
it's very hard to forget the muscle
memory of more intuitive gestures like
the up swipe just like the glory days of
webOS we found ourselves swiping up on
non blackberry hardware when using it
the gesture is that addictive also very
hard to let go of the BlackBerry hub
which remains one of our favorite
messaging solutions with its peak
functionality and also the outstanding
blackberry software keyboard but once it
learns your patterns it's entirely
possible to compose lengthy sentences
using only up swipes it remains one of
our favorite keyboards for one-handed
typing it's obvious some of the
beautiful astonishing tribe designed
apps are gonna age very gracefully too
it might sound weird to go out of our
way to praise a compass or a clock but
they continue to provide real if small
reminders of the attention to detail
that went into the software and of
course we still love the Z tens
buttonless screen unlock swipe a truly
futuristic and Han
you knew there was a but coming and you
probably know what it is so let's just
say it
apps the BlackBerry world app and
content store boasts an incredible
number of titles considering its age
120,000 since launch that's a ridiculous
growth rate for a new platform and it's
provided plenty of headline fodder for
the company to demonstrate just how
quickly bb10 is growing but the problem
is that a lot of those apps some sources
say at least one in five our ported
android titles brought in via runtime
while it was a bold move for blackberry
to encourage Android app porting in
order to jumpstart its platform runtime
is still stuck at 2.3 resulting in
imperfect performance and some pretty
ugly UI elements the bright side is that
support for Android porting up to
version 4.2 is due very soon but until
the major development houses get behind
blackberry and either port their titles
or write new ones for bb10 the
experience is still gonna lag behind
competitors can you access Twitter on
the z10 sure but you'll get a bare-bones
no-frills experience the same thing with
Facebook and Foursquare you want to Yelp
sorry no want a local transit app well
odds are it's not there you're gonna
have to use the mobile site here are
some familiar music and you want to
Shazam it nope
not unless you have an older blackberry
want to listen to a track on Spotify or
Pandora instead you can't unless you
want to use a third-party client and you
can forget about Netflix the company's
CEO just said this week that he's never
even touched a bb10 device and as this
video hits the feeds there are no plans
for a blackberry 10 Netflix app that
might change in the future but the
takeaway here is that despite its big
numbers
blackberry has been slow to convince big
developers to get on board with the z10
that's not really surprising and it's
not a reason to hit the panic button at
all but it's also not a great sign on
the plus side there's a fair bit of
entertainment content available in
blackberry world so you can stream your
video from a non Netflix source and as
mentioned above blackberry 10.1 brings
some notable improvements to the
software experience overall so at least
the company isn't standing still a four
months after launch the BlackBerry z10
stays true to its roots like its
ancestors its first and foremost a
messaging machine because of its app
selection and still
Aysen ecosystem you're unlikely to leave
another smartphone platform for this
device but if you're graduating from a
dumb phone and care more about excellent
messaging outstanding one-handed
usability and hardware that's not afraid
to take a few Falls the z10 will serve
you very well hopefully someday the
ecosystem supporting it will catch up
