the gheyness type rumors have the iphone
for meeting some manufacturing delays
the second quarter and it seems Apple is
preparing their retail stores for
something big in the next couple of
weeks all this and more coming up right
now hello everybody I'm Jaime metal
yvette and welcome to the pocket now I
reveal the show we go through all this
with school and the not so cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices let's
start this week off with the cool now
Apple's post-pc blockbuster story
continues as they break more records
this time they made the 2011 gaming
edition of the Guinness Book of World
Records for having the highest portable
gaming console sold in history if you
compare it they sold 1.5 million iphone
4s in the same period that Sony only
sold two hundred thousand PSPs the iOS
App Store also broke three records
including having the most games offered
for portable game console and even
though these games aren't all
groundbreaking well even angry birds
broke a record so kind of cool more
rumors of the next-generation iphone
make the scene this time it seems that
the device will not be called the iphone
5 but the iphone 4s which makes all the
sense in the world if you consider that
Apple most probably won't bring 4G until
next year so the next year's device will
be called a 4g or 4GS aside from that
well it seems that the device will bring
support for all US carriers meaning
Sprint and t-mobile customers will also
get an iphone probably in September
probably in June not sure what to make
of it and then aside from that well one
of the weird rumors is that the camera
sensors for the next generation iphone
have apparently also made the scene and
it seems that they are going to be moved
it seems that the LED flash is going to
be on one side and the camera is going
to be on the other which not sure which
aesthetically looks better but as long
as they get rid of all that yellow I
thriller effect that we get on iOS
pictures I don't care where they put
them we're still not sure what to make
of apple's WWDC event that's happening
on jun 6 in San Francisco but anything
can happen rumors have it we won't get a
next-generation iphone and only iOS and
Mac OS updates but apple's holding a
meeting with the retail employees on
mate
28th which is only a week before WWDC
and we're still not sure what they're
going to talk about apples retail stores
have been the tool that's made all their
post-pc blockbusters be total hits so
we're hoping that we do get a
next-generation iphone or at least
something big now will it be that Apple
will talk with their genius bar
employees about iOS 5 and iCloud could
it be that Apple will talk about the
next-generation iphone working for
sprint and t-mobile anything can happen
we just hope it's not going to be a
meeting to celebrate the employees of
the month and while out of the cool
changes in iOS applications Netflix just
brought an update that includes
subtitles for movies and shows sadly
it's only in English for now but at
least they're working on it because
sadly not all their movies and shows
include them let's hope they bring that
in Spanish Portuguese and just about
everything else except english if the
movies are already in english but at
least they're working on it well aside
from that while we all know that Bungie
kind of followed the vorsh with
Microsoft and everything seems to be
haloing towards iOS not sure if we are
going to get Halo or not but rumors are
that Bungie is working on this game
called crimson which is going to be
really cool no details on that no
release dates but it's hopefully
happening
levis are for the Coulomb let's continue
on with the not-so-cool and hey for
those of you that complain that we don't
have enough not so cool news trust me we
try but it's kind of difficult not
everything is not so cool in the Iowa
swirled but anyways Asians recent
catastrophe has been tragic though it
really hasn't brought many problems to
us gadget manufacturers at least yet but
digit times is reporting that it seems
that Foxconn is having trouble being
able to meet the Vans in both material
and labor for the iphone four
manufacturing process nothing's yet
confirmed but it seems that we will have
issues as of the second quarter of this
year so if you are planning on getting a
next-generation iphone our current
generation iphone for our advice to you
is move quick because things could
change in the next couple of months on a
sad note i flow reader software
developer is closing down and guess why
because of apple's thirty percent cut /
app store and app purchases sad news
though well it does makes all the sense
in the world for Apple to make a little
money over anything that's sold inside
their territory it's just a bit
difficult to see things work where
thirty percent doesn't make sense in
just about every digital content that's
sold for example books not sure what
Apple is going to do about it sadly it's
only one developer for now but we do
hope that Apple reconsiders their policy
kinda lame Google's recent IO oven but a
lot of hardcore competition to Apple
starting with their android ice cream
sandwich OS released to their google
music beta which beat Apple to any sort
of itunes in the cloud project we're
still not getting though well we do love
competition it does raise the bar to
grow technology into higher places
though you'd ask why is this a not so
cool section well it is because of this
slide it's kind of lame I do hope Google
puts their money with their mouth is
because June is still around the corner
and we're still not sure what Apple is
going to bring to compete let's see
that's a thursday show thank you very
much for watching i'm high Meadow you
better remember to give us a thumbs up
if you liked what you saw that's it for
now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
