performance is more important than it's
ever been before I'm Taylor Martin this
is PocketNow
and these are the best features of the
Nokia Lumia 1020 S camera before we go
any further we'd like to thank AT&amp;amp;T for
providing us with a Lumia 1020 to make
this video if you're interested in your
own Lumia 1020 you can buy one
exclusively from AT&amp;amp;T s website or your
local AT&amp;amp;T store
for years now taking pictures with a
smartphone has been somewhat of a
compromise taking a hitting quality for
the ultimate portability pocket ability
sure your DSLR or point-and-shoot camera
can take a much better picture than your
smartphone but it's also a burden to
look around everywhere you go generally
it has been either one or the other
quality or portability but there's a new
kid on the block a smartphone that
offers a much smaller compromise in both
size and picture quality the Nokia Lumia
1020 sold exclusively on AT&amp;amp;T the Lumia
1020 is a perfect blend of camera and
smartphone but what makes it different
from the rest around back it has a 41
megapixel sensor hidden beneath an Oreo
like hump with five carl zeiss lenses
it's capable of taking either 34 or 38
megapixel images though you will mostly
use the resulting 5 megapixel image
while 5 megapixels may not sound all
that impressive in comparison to other
phones that take 8 or 13 megapixel
images it actually is the information
from the 34 or 38 megapixel image is
packed down into 5 megapixels resulting
in an oversample picture a 5 megapixel
image with a lot more detail than your
run-of-the-mill
image at the same resolution but that's
only part of the story we've been using
the Lumia 1020 for weeks and we're
constantly drawn to take pictures with
it practically everywhere we go the
problem is not every picture turns out
quite right sometimes you capture too
much in the frame or maybe you zoomed in
too far a unique ability of the Lumia
1020 is reframing a photo after you take
a picture open the Photos app select a
photo and tap the Nokia procam link
beneath the photo from there tap the
reframe button pinch and drag the photo
to the desired frame and orientation and
press save we use this feature to crop
out unwanted parts of the photo and
digitally zoom after the picture has
been taken this unique ability to zoom
comes from the original high-res image
and the results are quite impressive
take the Charlotte skyline for example
we were several miles outside the city
and wanted a closer shot instead of
finding a closer spot to shoot from we
went to a place we're familiar with and
took several photos we later frame the
image how we wanted without losing any
quality
and my friends and I have been meaning
to go to a popular bar and nota growlers
poor house we took a picture of it and
later wanted to see the hours of
operation even though we took the
picture from across the street we were
able to zoom in enough to see it opens
at 5:00 p.m. during the week and at noon
on the weekends or take the picture of
this month we found on the sidewalk we
snapped a few pictures of it and later
decided to crop in you can see the
individual fibers on its wing something
we couldn't even see where their own
eyes at the time however zooming isn't
the only trick of this film sleeve for
removing unwanted content say someone
inadvertently walked through your shot
using the nokia smart cam app you can
erase moving objects from your image
this is made possible by the camera app
by taking multiple pictures in a short
period of time and extracting the moving
objects it also performs quite well at
night and in various low-light
situations using the Nokia pro cam app
the automatic settings work pretty well
in a broad array of different lighting
conditions but sometimes you may need to
tweak the settings yourself slide the
on-screen shutter button to the left and
you will reveal manual controls for
white balance focus ISO shutter speed
and exposure the optical image
stabilization allows the shutter to stay
open longer without the natural
shakiness of your hand ruining the
picture but it also helps to stabilize
yourself by leaning against a wall or
setting the phone on a hard surface for
longer exposures you may need the Lumia
1020 camera grip and a tripod using
manual settings we were able to capture
this long exposure shot of a church at
an intersection and this picture of an
Old Courthouse at night these images
just go to show that the camera on the
Lumia 1020 isn't your average camera
