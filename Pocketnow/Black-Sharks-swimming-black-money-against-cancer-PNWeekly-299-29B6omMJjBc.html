Apple is looking to design their own
processors for the next generation of
Macs starting as early as 2020 so sorry
about that loss Intel Microsoft hololens
- could arrive by the end of this year
sporting a custom qualcomm chipset so
sorry about your loss Intel there and
the Nation magazine dropped a monster
report on the business of studying cell
phone use and cancer and there's a lot
for us to unravel there so we've got a
lot to talk about make sure you're
charged and ready for episode 2 9 9 of
the PocketNow weekly recorded April 6th
at noon pacific this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables it's
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and you probably weren't
as concerned with medical science
surrounding your toys as you probably
should have i'm juan carlos bag now
senior editor contributing editor at
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. jules wong on the
east coast how's it going buddy boy
that's good well how about you today I
am froggy as heck we were talking off
air I I think I've been good for almost
10 hours of talking this week and so
wrapping up a podcast at the end of the
week I don't know that I fully recovered
so I'm gonna have cool guy Mick scratchy
voice going on for for most of this show
or if you're froggy enough then you can
do your best was a Paul McCartney
impression
oh I don't yeah I don't think well you
know what I could realize is look you
know when they would end a end a show
when the Beatles would end the show
that's when they would sing twist and
shout because their voices were already
blown so if I were gonna sing anything
right now I would just be the screaming
and that's already enough of the song to
get us a copyright strike so either that
or like all the other kinds of stuff
that has come out of a Paul McCartney's
mouth in the past 30 years or so I
really feel like that's a different
podcast we need to have Jules is a
different came out of home the curtain
brought to you by pocket now
oh boy this is a well we've been looking
to have a second podcast on your network
so let's have that why not indeed yeah
and if you don't prefer to talk about
that topic then you can talk about these
smartphones tablets smartwatches
whatever the heck that were talking
about this week and you can do so via
Twitter you can talk with us as we're
broadcasting live with the hashtag P and
weekly if you have any thoughts
questions or whatever or just said along
that tweet and we'll be able to read
that throughout the show and if you
can't make it to this channel if you
want to still get in on the questions
and answers and whatnot then head on
over to your email client and type in
podcast at pocketnow.com along with your
message and we'll be able to read that
at the end of each month in our mailbag
episode so definitely get involved join
us we wouldn't be here without you yeah
and we already have a few tweets coming
in we got a great question from renato
Laporte on twitter which we're gonna
cover when we get to one of our stories
about motorola this week so yeah
definitely looking for you guys to join
that conversation the livestream the
Twitter's the the emails all that fun
stuff and we'll make sure we have a nice
fun chat especially this week is we've
got some news which is I think gonna be
a little tough for us to to chew through
a little a little tough for us to
unravel later in the show for those of
us who are enthusiasts and fans of
mobile technology these types of stories
which I think give us pause into our own
consumer behavior so I really hope that
we can have a good dialogue to get back
and forth with those of you who are
watching our stream indeed and there's
plenty of outside material as well in
regarding today if you'd ideally suggest
that if you're watching live right now
just head into the rundown it should be
in the description on the YouTube page
and like actually go scroll down to the
link for the nation and the Nation
magazine did this huge article titled
how big Wireless
excuse me how big Wireless made us think
that cellphones are spayed safe a
special investigation and we'll be doing
that at the second half of our show but
in the meantime we've got plenty of news
still to talk about so for the week of
April 2nd 2018 this is all the news that
has for the podcast bloomed I was about
ready to talk to already bounce come on
yeah for the week of April 2nd 2016
bloomberg reports that ape Apple is
looking to replace Intel processors on
its max with its own design though it's
not clear if it will continue to
reference arm blueprints as it has done
for the iPhone and iPad market analysts
say that Intel will likely see limited
impact with one of its biggest business
relationships if Apple is to wean in
these new chips especially on the lower
end where they make up less of the Intel
share in max in related news Intel may
be falling out of favor at Microsoft for
the next hololens device instead of a
chae trail core processor for the
hololens - we could be seeing an ARM
chip as well along with custom a tie-in
holographic processors this could allow
a standalone unit to survive longer on
battery power coming up to Xiaomi here
and it's the Chinese company is looking
forward to officially debuting its new
sub brand focusing on gaming April 13th
at least in China black shark is also
set to release snapdragon 845 phone with
liquid cooling among other features that
give me enthusiasts should be looking
forward to Motorola's setting itself up
for an April 19 event in Brazil it could
possibly launch the Moto G 6 with
Snapdragon 600 chips and extra tall
displays at this event a longer shot
would be the entry-level Maru
five coming out it has been a year on
since the Moto e series got an updates
so possibility is there Japan display is
looking too straight together five
hundred million dollars to patch up its
lackluster LCD business doing sir it
will involve the sale of one of its
newer OLED plants the iPhone tens poor
sales performance seems to have a
chilling effect on OLED a production at
this moment
JDI hopes to get a piece of the LCD pie
back with a Apple's iPad business Google
has rolled out rolling steady hauls in
three rural school districts in North
Carolina South Carolina and near this
year in Colorado the pilot program
started in 2016
Wi-Fi is being equipped on two school
buses that make long treks to shadow
kids to and from school in places where
home Internet services or Google has
been able to increase student engagement
with its program and encourage teachers
to implement more digital elements to
lesson plans ZTE has partnered with
tabouleh to show its so-called news feed
off on its phones when it relies on for
the most part is paid content from
grains the integration will allow a
widget to be shown and for the Google
feed at the far left side of the home
screen to be replaced with this new pane
showing our stories and such ZTE had
promised to revert its Android
experience to a more stock look with its
rollout of goryeo it's not clear how
this integration will take place going
forward
and finally there's went from Evan
blasts top leaks and journalists that LG
has decided on naming what's supposed to
be the g7 the g7 thank you like it did
the V 30s thank you thank you being the
brand for LG's artificial intelligence
enriched products so there you go
thank you very much LG cool yeah all
right is that the the savior the g7 is
dead long-lived the
seven is that what we're expecting oh
yeah that that's supposed to be the
phone that saves us from our dumb
smartphone troubles and how dumb the g6
was I guess how dumb the v30
is it's just dumb they're all stupid I I
just I don't know I'm having a hard time
with this this sort of philosophy again
the same way that Bixby on Samsung can
do some really cool things and I think
there's some interesting consumer
benefit I'm not sure that this is the
killer solution for getting people
excited about smart phones again my v30
just got the Oreo update and I've been
playing around with the camera and the
auto mode got a nice little touch I
actually posted a photo on my Instagram
this morning just you know full auto I'm
liking the output a little bit better
than when I first got the V 30 but I
can't say I'm I'm really I I can't say
I'm super impressed by the AI camera
modes the way that it alters exposure
and it alters post-processing you know I
think there are some interesting ideas
there I think Huawei is kind of in the
same boat we've got this whole neural
processing unit on the chipset just to
chew up and and figure out what it is
that you're pointing the camera at and
while that's cool I mean there's some
cool technology on display I'm still not
sure that it's it's really improving my
photography that much when I'm trying to
when I'm trying to shoot just like a
general consumer full-auto let me just
point my camera at something and hit the
shutter button it doesn't really feel
that much different than most other
phones normal auto or HDR modes well
what we seem to know is that the LG G 7
in render leaks and whatnot is that
there will be four buttons they I mean
they're taking the Samsung strategy here
wholesale because you got the two volume
rockers on the side and then you getting
you know two more buttons so one of them
has to be a power button and if that's
the case that would take the power point
off of the fingerprint sensor in the
back for the first time in a while so
what's that extra button could it be a
think you Bixby button thing like and
like that's it doesn't have people
enthusiastic
I'm gonna tell a I is gonna be shoved
into our faces we don't want it to be
you know it's it's right there at the at
the top of the finger but really you're
just it's like we're gonna accidentally
tap on it and it's gonna be clapping
let's get out of that for a second cuz
even I'm even though I really do like
some of the the individual features that
Bixby brings to the table and it has
improved I still disabled the Bigsby
buttons on my note and my Galaxy s8 I'm
not looking forward to having that same
extraneous piece of hardware on an LG
and if they do move the the fingerprint
sensor or me if that the home button off
the back of the phone I'll be really sad
because this is something I've enjoyed
about LG design since the since the GU -
I've really enjoyed that
that'd be Homer that would be a bummer
for me as well and like how much more
ham-fisted can again with the name that
because I'll admit they they started off
last year I think with smart think you
like that that's all one word SME Smar
thi NQ and which is not supposed to be a
word in any human language ever so I
don't know why this is a good idea why
the V 30s + thank you was allowed to be
a phrase used in marketing like yeah
that's that's not really cuz I agree
with you it's just it's just clumsy we
want something that consumers can
identify you know galaxy branding for
Samsung works really well they've got a
huge portfolio of products under that
galaxy umbrella but it's an abbreviated
way of getting the consumer immediately
into thinking about one particular class
of products and LG has struggled with
that the aesthetics on their devices
what they want a G Series phone to look
like versus what they want a V Series
phone to look like and now that they've
kind of figured out
design language they're still struggling
IMO with things like branding think
think you isn't gonna mean anything to
consumers and it's barely enough of a
feel-good word that will resonate
emotionally and it sounds a lot like
thank you I don't like here we are
eternally grateful for this artificial
intelligence service I'm really I'm well
I I mean we're it's for me it was more
the you know the LG's the grantor
eternally grateful for those of you who
buy our products I mean there's
something it has to be some form of
ingratiate given that if retained mobile
division has been cutting you know
that's been losing for about a year
straight now I mean there's a good idea
in there somewhere but it doesn't feel
like it's fully baked or there's there's
a there's an interesting thought in
showing gratitude to a consumer base and
trying to bring people into the fold and
like you were saying ingratiating but
the this is this is a a stage one on the
blackboard idea not a let's go to market
idea yet it this has not been refined
enough and I think we're seeing just a
little too much of how the sausage is
made that it'll be tough to unravel or
it'll be tough to come back to this
brand and say like oh well this is their
flagship premiere product with one of
their flagship features and this is why
consumers should be interested in it and
consumers are going but what is thank
you or what is that
think think queue or think think you or
think thin queue like it's a very thin
letter in the alphabet yeah if the
two-dimensional queue it's that thin
yeah uh I don't know that this is this
is the killer find it really I mean
whatever additional fun or AI features
they put on this phone I just hope they
they deliver a solid device the g6 was
such a big step in the right direction
evolving off of that would be great and
trying to continue pushing out the
messaging on what makes an lg device
unique you're not gonna get there by
copying a Bigsby like feature you're not
going to get there by copying apples not
there has to be a differentiator and if
they continue to use like the best audio
processing in a phone
just give us a commercial on that give
us that Apple style commercial on you
you want to have the best this is the
best and there isn't really much room
for debate there yeah you talk about
Apple stylings here I want to move on to
the Intel story here now they've been
work a police a has been working on a
sort of merger between Mac OS and iOS in
terms of the app ecosystem there and
their interoperability and that could be
one sign of this whole arm-based
infrastructure going over to son max
perhaps the low end maybe the MacBook
Air and like 2020 or something like that
it's plausible I think it's I think it's
more than plausible I think it's
necessary because this Qualcomm story
this Intel story happens on two fronts
Apple considering redesigning the
chipset for say a MacBook Air let's keep
it simple
we're gonna say a MacBook Air as as my
my futuristic hypothesis at the same
time we've been seeing Microsoft making
big strides on getting Windows 10 on arm
so this news of hololens isn't
particularly disruptive to the industry
there's very little movement happening
on hololens but it's another data point
to show that intel's domination on
chipsets is is has the potential to be
rocked substantially by a newer class of
lower power and portable devices and i
think it's another data point to show
consumers may you're spending a thousand
dollars on a phone are you potentially
over buying for some of this high-end
hardware which you might not be really
utilizing to its fullest you know a
Qualcomm 845 is a substantially powerful
mobile chipset what are you doing with
it and might you have been just as well
served by a lower a lower power product
so I would be very concerned at Intel
there their current strategy like I got
to play with the new
the new Nook again this tiny little box
which is surprisingly powerful from
Intel but the entire industry right now
is diversifying around different
implementations of arm and different
implementations of low-power x86 so this
is a very sensitive transition for Intel
to manage and it's not great for them if
Apple is looking at taking one of their
product lines away I only makes up what
did--what did do you guys put any
article Apple makes up about 5% the 5%
that some of the market analysis says
that the lower and the lower end max
make up about 2% so that the higher end
makes 3 so so we probably IME like and
if I'm putting on my prognosticator cap
I would say that any shift in this
strategy would probably start with a
single Apple Mac product line something
like the MacBook Air and likely won't
disrupt the overall Core i5 or ultra low
power ultra-low voltage chipset strategy
that Apple's employed on other things
you're definitely not gonna switch over
to arm for a mac pro which we hopefully
will see a proper redesign on that in
the next year or two
so Intel's safe there but it does set up
sort of a new conversation in what
consumers need versus what they want
Apple pushing into arm territory for a
MacBook makes a lot of sense Windows 10
operating on arm makes a lot of sense
and if you're not doing anything that
requires the heavy lifting of a core i5
or a core i7 you'll be well served on an
ARM chip set not to mention all of the
education market that's looking at these
products to Chromebook and what Google
can do in this space is going to be in
extremely formidable and Intel doesn't
really have much of a say in that market
at all they don't have much of a
presence in that ultra low-cost laptop
market from from Google's so this this
is the beginning of what could
potentially be a very disruptive change
for how we look at is Intel as a chipset
supplier agreed and I think a lot of
that has to also do with the form factor
here because there's still war going on
in between
traditional laptop and that the
convertible tune one you know you have
the optional stylus people manufacturers
are trying to still figure out what to
do with that and whether the arm
infrastructure makes sense go more or
less convertibles yeah
and and this also opens up this also
opens up a huge potential for Intel like
I said on the Nook it's this tiny little
box it's got tons of i/o it is
ridiculously powerful just on its own
and it can come in a fanless design this
is a huge opportunity for Intel to
really start pioneering the connection
and protocols for a more modular system
like say you've got an operating system
which follows you around and you've got
an arm powered phone that you can cradle
into a dock that has like a core i7 and
it you know it a discreet graphics card
all connected through thunderbolt and
you can connect that with you know big
mass storage and really fast solid-state
drives to then move your portable life
immediately into a more desktop grade
environment and that that can be a
seamless transition there's the
potential to really lead in in a market
segment like that where I don't need to
have a phone a tablet a laptop a desktop
you know I can just have one computing
operating system source that follows me
to whatever display and whatever
infrastructure that I really need if
Intel can get ahead of the conversation
on that then I think they set the stage
for the next generation of data and
services how services follow you from
screen to screen that's a really big get
though and you know that Qualcomm is
gonna be aggressively fighting in
exactly the same space Apple now taking
its chips and looking at how it can
control more of its hardware Microsoft
same this this is a really shaky market
right now and I wouldn't discount a
resurgent AMD also joining the
conversations well well now with that
soft banks a because at this point and
they're pouring good winning into it so
you look worth of that going forward one
switch gears into black shark or chamois
for the sake of a conversation here
because I don't want I don't necessarily
see black shark being a direct
competitor to razor at this moment if
xiaomi is continued campaign into the
Western world goes on perhaps this could
be an interesting thing so I will have
to keep tabs on this but already we're
talking about this phone for April 13th
with a the liquid cooling system
according to this article at least
that's from the China mobile or what
will China not try to mobile
that's a telecom mobile China and so
look at cooling and perhaps a discrete
GPU so that suggests not using the snap
targeting 45s Adreno 630 now what could
take take its place is would be an
interesting factor here but yeah what do
you think of this kind of upstarts
within an upstart formerly known as an
upstart no III think this is a great
play this is the right time to be
looking at specialist flavours
enthusiast flavors of devices and if you
think you can make a premium argument
for a very specific demographic then
now's the right time to make that player
to take that chance I think a lot of
consumers feel like they're well served
by all rounder gadgets but if you're
really into a particular brand like the
razor lifestyle razor consumers are
super into their razor hardware their
razor look their razor aesthetic and
having a phone that matches their laptop
is is part of a conversation which makes
sense aesthetically for that that kind
of consumer so Xiaomi has been mmm
Xiaomi has been pulling off some really
interesting and some really exciting
design conversations with mobile devices
and throw-in their weight behind a niche
like gaming I think they could do very
well as
think that they have enough critical
mass in terms of of users and fanbase
that they could be disruptive in that
kind of a conversation you're right I
don't think they're directly going to
compete against Razer because I think
Razer is best served by Razer fans
so as Yami isn't gonna be able to pull a
Razer fan away that that just doesn't
work
psychologically but that that also means
that there's a huge number of other
people out there that might be looking
for something specific in how they use
their phones and just like red might be
able to make an enthusiast argument for
people who are cinematographers and
having a phone which complements their
camera lifestyle
I think Xiaomi can also make a similar
argument and they have the resources to
back it out and release fat produce on
Twitter hashtag P and weekly I hope that
mystery but another new LG g7 is a
two-stage shutter button and we all know
that the two-stage Sirte button died
with Sony well it hasn't died I mean
we're gonna be putting out a video on
the XA to ultra which I've been spending
the last week reviewing but it's gone if
Chloe doesn't far we didn't put it on
its freakin preet p20 with its three
cameras but III think you know any other
manufacturer that wanted to treat us
well and look at that could make an
argument for it that's what's that's
what's so frustrating is we see so many
manufacturers try like dip their toe
into some really interest in ideas and
then just not back it up with any
consumer conversation or consumer
education and that's where a lot of
these good ideas just go to die you know
water resistance on phones was sort of a
niche feature for years and then Apple
finally got on board with better
lifestyle resistance and now we expect
and we demand that a premium phone is
gonna have some kind of high P rating
from the same thing with camera tech
same thing with audio tech there are all
of these opportunities for razor with
screen tech I think they did a good job
of saying like there's a reason why we
went with this display there's a reason
why it's gonna be a benefit to you and
this is a reason why it's different from
our competition it's just that there are
first generation phone brand
as far as many consumers are concerned
so yeah and they don't have that
character that a razor has built among
its fans because I mean one of the other
tweets that we got one outlet port at
underscore Reina and just scorch an
underscore to many underscores ma'am
why raiser in two hashtags hashtag RGB
hashtag chroma and there's a jiff too
with all the LEDs behind that keyboard
just swirling around and that rainbow
marquee Ness and that's one of the
things that raised their fans point to
right from the get-go if you can't make
that freaking snake glow green then
what's the point man like so I mean in
terms of being able to carve out a
personality in a place where personality
is well appreciated where there's much
of it to go around with streamers and
other fans just being all excited about
gaming franchises and with a partnership
here with a ten-cent major games
publisher and in addition to being the
ubiquitous Chinese internet company even
being around this should be an
interesting launch to say the least um
and and now's the right time again just
to focus on gaming for that one extra
step eSports are starting to take off in
western communities we're seeing more
collaborative play and we're seeing
those pushes the experimental builds and
alpha builds on fortnight and pub G now
is the right time to try and lock a good
chunk of the market and build that brand
loyalty with gamers who are looking for
a premiere experience and a mobile
device on some of these titles he has
the right kit and johnny has the right
infrastructure to make an argument for
why someone should consider one of their
products and they're getting there all
around the world these days Russia lots
of Western Europe one of our YouTube
channel are says Xiaomi is officially in
Portugal now thank you for that and
again us in maybe late this year early
next year so
lots to evaluate right there meanwhile
in Brazil we got moto g6 fever going on
here especially if this color of the
invite being green and all the
wallpapers and the Moto g6 renders being
green oh my god that's something
happening - that's that's that's great
I'm wondering in 2018 how you feel the
Moto G which is supposed to be the the
one and only mid-range er like this is
you know great value for buck um how
it's evolved over the past five years
now yeah no moto Motorola's strategy
here is a little concerning I I really
hope over this next year they take some
time to clean up these product divisions
the G Series is the perfect example of
brand bloat where I think for the g5 we
had four different flavors if I'm not
mistaken of the g5 - the g5 s the g5 s +
etc etc etc and it starts to feel a
little like you know like a bad revisit
of the early days of Street Fighter 2
and Street Fighter 2 turbo and Street
Fighter 2 the new challengers and Street
Fighter 2 tournament Edition and Street
Fighter 2 ultra we don't want that it's
really hard to communicate what the
granular differences are between those
various devices but I think Motorola
could do well really well with a four
gadget strategy entry-level with the e
super low power hardware big battery
done that part of the conversation has
been managed entry entry mid with the G
Series every kind of lifestyle daily
feature well serviced well taken care of
this this phone is going to have no
problems getting you through the day
stepping up to the X where we start
incorporating more premium options and
then Z is their flagship line I sort of
like how Samsung is treating their deal
with like the A's and the J's and
whatnot although like why should we
mention that Lenovo is even is cutting
Motorola down to the bone and even that
like they're they're cutting down into
the portfolio as well I mean we heard
that the Moto X series
at least for this year got cancelled so
you know if you have to resort yeah and
we look at some some huge opportunities
that I think Motorola might have missed
out on when we're talking about the
potential of something like an
entry-level pixel device next year
and the relationship that they had with
Google and the manufacturing partnership
that they had with Google and how the
Moto X became the project finder phone
you know moto still had the right DNA
but I feel the the move that we saw last
year was so with such product variation
such products tritation seemed like a
panic response we've got to put out a
phone for this market we've got to put
out a phone for this demographic we got
to do this we've got a slightly better
technology over here we've got you know
super cheap you know dual camera sensors
that we can incorporate over there and
instead of just buttoning down the
battening down the hatches and saying
this is our course these are our product
lines and being able to efficiently
communicate that to consumers I think
they kind of went a little nuts
if Motorola gets gets stripped and it
causes them to refocus and to you know
come back to some kind of sense in
product strategy that could be a good
thing unfortunately it's just all too
often we see we're gutting gutting a
brand like this often leads to you know
products that don't really seem to
inspire much consumer affection so it's
it's sticky but I'm always going to be
excited to see a new Moto G launch i
from the g4 I've been very impressed
with how they they talk in that 2 to
$300 price segment and how increasingly
it's one of the flagship devices that
you can point to you to say this is an
uncompromised experience for the price
point and ended there well joined by
honor like I don't think we'd have the
honor 7 that we do today if it hadn't
been for the Moto G 4 and g5 so those
types of companies competing in that
entry-level to mid range er space is is
always exciting to me to see what they
can offer consumers I'll just be curious
to see how the g6 joins that
conversation or if we're going to see
five different versions of the g6 that's
going to be a major fail for Motorola
Tiger came on the youtubes streetfighter
to you ultra X thank you is the best
game of all time I personally like to
refer to a long time la sportscaster
Keith Olbermann's references to you
ESPN tartar control well this is also
coming in from Renato Laporte using the
pn weekly hashtag do you think Willman
hello sorry well moto novo I don't like
moto novo I like Lenovo moto will moto
novo use the like a g6 song for its moto
g6 promotion sweet its kill that song
already like that's Oh see I was mad
that LG didn't do it I actually asked an
LG rep point-blank like why why did you
know that you like say like the verge
like the guys there whoever it was like
asked and they said oh we never really
thought of that we're going to take that
into consideration it sounded like they
were kind of yeah we're just gonna leave
now bye I got from the one LG rep that I
talked to you was like oh well you know
we don't we don't do anything like
what's expected so that would have been
expected so that's why we didn't do it
it was like I know you're just you know
covering but it it's just such an you
know what you can't afford to ask at
these you know I was gonna say there's
definitely a licensing issue there and
maybe Motorola won't have the cash
reserves to have an advertising campaign
with that song in it but just because
it's an obvious get doesn't mean that
that wouldn't have been been a fun
branding exercise a fun commercial to
put out there fine advertisement to put
out there we're to drive off all the
older people that want or the people
over 35 but even then I mean you make it
a punchy fun playful kind of you know
satirical maybe even commercial
utilizing that because it's so obvious
the thing is a g6 motorola isn't the
right you know you don't want an energy
levels of ice you know pimping out your
g6 plane you know like it's the wrong
fit but I see this look kind of hopes
that Lenovo will say like yeah let's
just license that song
and maybe like the g6 is that's all it
takes these days a good and rounded
processor and just like the basics it's
even faster than the genes explain that
used to fly in our ears I don't even
know what the g6 is aspects yeah I don't
know one way that I would want to know
if I were living out somewhere in like
maybe Four Corners area of New Mexico
Colorado Arizona and Utah or somewhere
that doesn't have Internet's that is
good at all would be on a rolling study
hall and I just you know given that
there is there some of uncertainty that
I've included it into I run now this
week I just want to end on a positive
note by saying hey get on you for just
making sure that kids are connected in
they're able to learn especially with
more lesson plans being digital and
having these teachers being able to take
advantage of that this is this is I
think a wonderful initiative and it's
one of those things that we can point to
as a data point which expands beyond
just education we start talking about
things like self-driving cars one of the
things that we can talk about is just
how much wasted time you have in major
metropolitan areas because of because of
commuting especially with the current
housing situation the way it is I mean
not even just for being productive but
stress and the effects of health on
sitting in a car at your redzone peak of
agitation because of traffic buzzing all
around you this is this is not a good
environment for evolved primates to be
and regularly let alone every single day
and the effects that it has on family
life on like I said on on health on
productivity you know even being able to
take that off of your plate and just
have some downtime or you know being
able to engage in a video call with
family and friends and not have to worry
about you know operating your motor
vehicle would be a huge get so this this
to me is is both encouraging because of
the actual educational Bennett
it's to giving students time to prep
into their day on their bus ride then
also time to unwind out of their day on
their bus ride is extremely compelling
and then hopefully we can expand that I
mean if we're raising if we're if we're
training kids the next generation of
consumers for this type of connected
lifestyle
hopefully that generational push in to
things like better better public transit
better commuting and better self-driving
cars will just carry over you know I
used to be able to surf the internet on
the bus when the bus would just drive me
I don't need someone to drive me but I
don't want to have to ride in a car
focused on operating that motor vehicle
when I could be more productive or I
could be healthier or I could be able to
keep up with my family and friends
better that to me would be a huge
benefit for our society indeed indeed
and with that out of the way all that
news done it's done it's finished over
it's over and it's uh it's now time to
record brains a bit here because we're
now transitioning into the big
discussion that we're gonna have here
with this piece from the Nation magazine
done by Marc Hart's guard and Mark
Talley by the way the Marc Hertz guard
appeared on the NPR program produced
here in Boston actually on points for
like 30 minutes talking about his piece
here definitely an interesting take and
on to some of the questions that were
raised with the callers there will
probably link to that after the show but
I want to just them I want to just start
off here with the start the basis of
this piece here because this is a
political politically progressive outlet
here but that doesn't mean that you
should you know great journalism comes
from both sides of the aisle or multiple
sides of the aisle should say and the
the basis here is you know not just that
cellphones are our cancerous and you
should stop using them it's not that at
all it's that the money that firms like
the CTIA or the GSMA or you know the
whole industry of the wireless industry
has put into the obfuscation of research
that links increased cancer risk with
wireless radiation it is astounding
you know the standing to the point of
even Big Tobacco trying to conceal to
the harmful effects of smoking which
they've spent billions of dollars on
hold back research but in trying to
confuse the discussion with
contradictory research it took us
generations of people to unravel just
how bad smoking really was for you
because there was a concerted effort by
the tobacco industry to muddy the waters
on certain pieces of research so for
every study that came out that said snow
smoking was terrible for you the same
time they were putting out their own
research in their own studies just to
keep consumers confused or divided and
this is something that we've seen happen
a play out in numerous industries in
numerous conversations you don't have to
prove the counterpoint you don't have to
lie or try and convince consumers that
you know this research is false or
faulty or anything like that all you
have to do is just keep raising the
question and all you have to do is just
keep the the the conversation you know
there are people on both sides and as
long as you can you can engage in that
kind of an information campaign what's
the quote from the tobacco industry no I
wouldn't know actually product yeah well
I mean just not not going into the
subject at all but with the global
warming that the common Authority a
number that they throw around is that
97% of scientists agree that there is
man-made effects to accelerating climate
change and yeah and me you know the
this course sounds like it's more like
even though half-and-half well so
because the thing is they won't ever say
that there's a percentage of scientists
who disagree it's just that there are
scientists on both sides of the debate
and then that makes it feel like if
there's some sort of parity in the
disagreement or that there's some kind
of bigger debate happening in the
scientific community when a majority of
scientists and this is also one of the
things that companies and corporations
can always leverage against the
scientific community in that there's
never a proper 100 percent agreed upon
fact lock it in rule when it comes to
the scientific process the the way that
science should work at its best is
everything should be an evolving
conversation based on the information we
have today and based on the research
that takes place tomorrow there should
always be a moving target and there
should always be uncertainty that's why
the the top order of trying to predict
the outcome of a situation in the
scientific community is called the
theory and that means something very
different to scientists than it means to
colloquial consumers you know we're
theory means guess too many people in
the scientific community a theory is the
highest order of trying to predict the
behavior of a system that's why we don't
call it the fact of gravity we call it
the theory of gravity we call it the
theory of relativity that isn't to say
that someone just guessed about gravity
one day and we just kind of all went
along with that guessed it's because we
have a very good working model of how
gravity operates in in our universe and
we can predict how things will happen to
a point where we can send rockets to
Mars and land rovers on the surface of
another planet because we have a pretty
good understanding of how that goes down
we can predict how planets will align
themselves over vast stretches of area
of distance and significant periods of
time so that we can we can shoot these
tiny little Rockets across our solar
system so I when we get into some of the
business practices because we'll dig
into this article in a little bit more
depth and it's a long article so we're
barely going to be able to scratch this
surface of what the nation is reporting
on here we're really just hoping to
raise this conversation with the people
who follow our show I we're seeing
similar practices which make me feel
that there's more there they're like in
the way that we would find in the food
industry in the tobacco industry and in
discussions on things like climate
science that makes me that that's very
unsettling and it's very concerning to
me as I've been a longtime advocate of
mobile technology I've been a longtime
proponent of the benefits of having
supercomputers in your pocket and I've
been one who's only casually read up on
the science and I haven't found anything
that I really found to be particularly
compelling while at the same time
there's been an obvious effort to
manipulate the kind of information that
I would have had access to and that
makes me more than just a little bit
upset well you brought up the the big
tobacco phrase the confusion is our
product there is an analog to that and
that was found in a 1994 paper from
Motorola that said you know that they
were trying to war game or they are war
gaming the narrative here are as markers
guard has put in multiple times an
untested public health factor here
didn't like when what was that like 1978
1983 like the first mobile networks this
is this Wireless radiation was not
really tested for its health effects
yeah and it took an up until a decade
until we had like the first real
lawsuits and the first real signs of
things
raynard versus NEC NEC produced phones
at the time and David Reynard was
stealing on behalf of his wife who died
from brain tumors a Lynx and the lodge
is linked to her mobile phone usage and
like the the test like the what's the
x-rays showed lots of
site activity from the play the way that
she held her phone so there was and from
that stemmed a whole bunch of activity
Congress was going to investigate but
more importantly the CTIA the the
cellular telecommunications and internet
Association was gonna say okay let's
fund a huge research project the dangled
the most money in that research field to
date in nineteen ninety five twenty
eight million dollars and they assigned
one of these uh you know corps leaders
these corporate things Jorge Carlo he
had led research studies into Agent
Orange dioxins and breast implants and
he was doing it with industry backed
money so we you know they feel he found
that there was little impact but somehow
through quite a few theatrics here in
1999 now part of this too was long
playing the game because you know if
you're able to exploit like grow the
economy of mobile phones then already
people are already dependent on mobile
phones and there's not much de you know
the win here isn't whether or not you
can instantly disprove the hypothesis
that cell phones cause cancer it's can
you delay the verdict on that for
decades and if you can delay for a
substantial amount of time then the
industry is still operating is still
growing and is still finding a consumer
base becoming hooked on these products
before you can get out whatever negative
effects there might be and at the same
time you can also be investing in
multiple other studies and multiple
other scientists and multiple other
research firms to try and have counter
information to when those initial
studies are produced so finding in 1999
that you know there was a positive
correlation with cell phone use and
increases in neural epithelial tumors
that's
there was an emphasis on children's
health because they're still developing
grains are more susceptible to this kind
of radiation they like Carlos circulated
a carlo circulated a letter to the CTI a
member organizations you know Atlantic
Bell and Sprint at the time others
included that and they should do the
right thing and then CTIA chairman tom
wheeler who would later become FCC
chairman later in the Obama years he
basically just shut it down
you know like he tries to discredit
Carlo in the media to great success and
back when the CTIA held its 2000
convention basically he he like sent two
bouncers to whisk Carlo in and out of
the convention to deliver like a
12-minute speech and he you know not
much was done like he made sure that
Carlo couldn't talk to journalists
before or after the event so there was a
lot of it's like that it's just one of
the like the tiny moments of drama but
it really you know encapsulate what
measures were being taken to protect the
you know the mobile industry's interest
at the time and so part of part of the
issue with this is we don't have an
infrastructure that's been around for
very long at the scale that we would be
fearful of I think a public health
crisis now we have a saturation point of
wireless technologies in in in first
world nations and we're seeing
tremendous ground being made up in
developing and emerging 3G and 4G areas
of the world - so the numbers on this
start to look a little scary because
none of them can really point to a
direct causation but we're seeing data
points that correlate with changes in
our industry we just haven't had enough
time
when I had a sit-down I recently
interviewed an audiologist about hearing
loss and over the last 10 years you
would think ten years is is a
significant amount of time to study a
trend but we're barely scratching the
surface on how consumer takes lifetimes
it takes lifetimes consumer media habits
over ten years is not enough data to
determine what the potential cause and
the potential effects of a new
technology might be and at the same time
technology is rapidly changing
so by the time you've even got like a
testing protocol lined up the what
you're testing for might not even exist
for the consumer sphere anymore so we
got a tweet from Renato Laporte how to
be honest how do you study something
like that you need a control group a
group that was never exposed to
electromagnetic radiation produced by
our devices antennas it really is
impossible to study this and if you're
doing that kind of a control sample
survey then yes that's true but that
means we need to come up with some other
methodology of testing this and some
other way of surveying this because the
answer well I guess we can't do anything
isn't good enough if the answer is well
we'll just wait for three generations of
people to come down with potentially
come down with terrible cancer in their
head that's not an acceptable solution
and from what the industry has been able
to enroll and Jules I'm sorry I've got
the article up but I can't find the
section on this when we look at the
division between studies backed by
independent research and independent
funding and studies backed by funding
that came from the telecommunications
industry what are the numbers or
something likes yeah yeah so Henry lie
was the I believe the University of
Washington professor that was looking
into some studies here 1990 through 2005
56% of the studies found an effects
between cellphone radiation and cancer
causing 44% not but when accounting the
funding source a 67 percent of
independently funded studies found a
biological effect 28% from industry
funded studies found a biological effect
so the majority of the industry funded
research found no link right and and
when we normalize for where funding came
from a significantly higher number of
studies are finding some link to this
type of concentrated radiation source
affecting DNA affecting the structures
in the ear and affecting the the the
blood-brain barrier which acts as a
buffer as opposed to studies funded by
the industry which find significantly
less causal or correlation between those
behaviors and those MEK yeah
and I got ad like the specific
absorption rate of that sort of
radiation those standards are pretty
much a self reporting exercise again
with FCC SAR SAR is there is not a
testing protocol that is implemented by
a neutral party for SAR so the specific
absorption rate the what we use to try
and put a number on the amount of
exposure exposure risk a consumer might
encounter is is only a self-reported
metric so that's like saying you know
going to Volkswagen and saying how much
how much toxic gas comes out of your
diesel cars and Volkswagen gets to tell
you oh it's fine
is a problem that we've also run into
recently and how an industry might
self-report on its own behavior and this
is also another example of if we're
going to really investigate the
situation here we need good good data
and good metrics on what the potential
causes are and I don't feel as
self-reported SAR is sufficient given
the current climate that were that we're
in and where we're going to go with the
future of things like 5g technologies
yeah especially when you're going up
there into the high like the multi gig
double digits gigahertz and you need
multiple transmitters to cover city
block that's more that's more of that
those waves going around in the air so
and considering that SAR like they've
been able to find that phone to skin
contact the SAR actually increases like
it's like it's like 20 times the the
limit in Europe maybe it's like 2 watts
you're getting 2040 actually when you
actually put contact into it so that's
you know that's one of the odd things
does this is something that we can draw
we can draw metaphors to other types of
exposure in sitting down with an
audiologist its duration and intensity
so it probably doesn't matter what
wireless technology you're utilizing if
it's 2g 3G HSPA LTE 5g that probably it
would be my guess and not a very
educated guess but it would be my guess
that the type of signal matters less
than the intensity the focus the
duration and the proximity and that
proximity and intensity are probably
linked logarithmically but the closer
you get the higher the intensity is
going to be and it's not going to be
directly a linear relationship between
distance and intensity just like with
audio if you've crammed in a driver into
your ear and you blast that sound with a
focus and with a seal directly into your
skull you're going to do more damage in
a shorter period of time than if you
listened on speakers that are well
balanced for your environment and you
don't have a lot of noise to overcome I
think we can we can point to a number of
those I take photo therapy for my
psoriasis so I have these targeted UVB
rays that if I get too close to my skin
with one of these mobile units I can
very quickly
deep tissue burn my my skin you know and
so the the proximity matters
significantly in the amount of exposure
and the intensity to that exposure and
if I back off like more
a foot I have it's almost a negligible
impact on my ability to treat my my skin
problems I feel that there is probably a
working metaphor for how data and
communications interact with the human
organism and what we need is an actual
grown up consumer health examination of
what that potential might be and we need
to start looking at those trends over
time and how those trends relate to
changes in consumer behavior because I
don't want to get to you know my
daughter's generation finding out that
the reason they all have cancer is
because we weren't diligent enough
beforehand and let's say that we spend
this money we spend this time and we
examine this infrastructure and the
cancer risk is very very low that's
still phenomenal data to help us build
on to the next generation of services
will be so much better prepared for the
next rollout the next implementation and
the next category of devices as we enter
into an age of personal area networks
full-body implementation of sensors and
smart trackers and smart diapers like
right we have smart typers now and
clip-on a clip-on sensors for babies we
should we should probably have a
conversation and I'm not saying that the
industry absolutely needs to halt all
progress until we come up with a
definitive answer because that's never
gonna happen
but we could still be creating
guidelines and trends now which will be
better
behavioral exercises for us later on and
speaking of those guideline and said
again the wireless industry has had its
hand in creating those guidelines or at
least tried to urge you know
organizations like the World Health
Organization in doing so one of its
former heads like it was the couple of
trade associates actually paid his
former employer and then the former
employer transferred that donation over
to at the whu-oh and there's you know
there's a lot of conflict going on but
when they met to discuss a study
concerning it was the Interphone study
concerning the
type of research there the industry was
able to secure a couple of firms for
observer status it had two experts on
the panel and more more professionals
just looking into the case and while
they weren't able to prevent it from
being classified as as a carcinogenic
potential or at least some sort of a
classification isn't the classification
in the division of 280 to be from
probable to possible
so the visible carcinogen as opposed to
be as a probable which you know the ups
of the stakes a little bit so and
there's word you know now that's from
scientists inside the circle that the
w-h-o could be looking at this
classification in reevaluating it this
year so that's and that's after research
coming out of the u.s. is a national
toxicology program as well as recent
necessary measures in France I believe
that discouraged use that discouraged
devices being on in classrooms and for
kids so there's more on this subject
that is being moved on in terms of being
more cautious towards the potential
impacts of wireless radiation so that
that could be something we've had a
number of different types of study and
cancer studies on things like types of
radiation non-ionizing radiation etc etc
none of this I really feel rises to the
level of you know lock your phone in a
Faraday cage and only use it in tiny
sparing you know usage but when we look
at an entire philosophy of mobile
data-driven lifestyle there are some
trends that I think consumers are are
starting to take a look
that in the health of a society in the
health of an individual and in the
health of an economy and I think this
just plays a small part in a larger
conversation about what is it that we're
trying to get out of our technology how
is that affecting our relationships how
is that affecting our physical and
mental health and how how best to go
about creating a community where we can
have conversations about best practices
and the behavior of the wireless
industry in regards to these types of
scientific studies which in the 90s were
trying to get a toehold on starting off
a conversation as to the potential
public health impact makes me nervous
when they're following the same kind of
information campaigns that we've seen
from the tobacco industry that does not
mean that cell phones are like
cigarettes
I provided they provided side at society
with many goods that into the permeation
of the internet in especially in places
where again home internet you know is
not is not very good at all so it's done
so much good it's a lot itself to cement
you know that sort of goodwill and I
still feel that there there are
significant benefits to our ability to
reach out and find digital communities
and to find friendships online and to
engage in commerce and to solve problems
that we have with things like health
care and education through the usage and
the utilization of this technology but
at the same time I feel that there are a
number of people who are like are likely
to complain about the etiquette impacts
the the distracted driving impacts the
the sleep impacts they have a whole
society of people that are finding it
more difficult to wean themselves off of
the more addictive aspects of this type
of technology and I do not feel that it
is sufficient to say you know we'll just
pick yourself up by your bootstraps just
get good or just don't be addicted to it
there there is a chemical process which
happens in the brain with pleasing
events that you know is very similar to
things like gambling
mechanics you can't just unwire the
human brains stimulus-response reward
system for people who are more
susceptible to this kind of behavior we
need to have a larger conversation about
about how we protect those of us who are
more vulnerable to this kind of this
kind of impact and we also at the same
time need to acknowledge like it's not
going away so how do we make it better
um that that's what I feel is most
upsetting about a lot of these
conversations is you know the cellphone
isn't going away we could prove
definitively that it absolutely will
100% cause cancer
that's obviously a specious argument
that I'm making right now obviously
there's no data or research to suggest
that but let's say we had it let's say
we had the smoking gun just like smoking
cigarettes didn't just go away
cellphones will absolutely not they're
just too useful but that would encourage
us to have that conversation on how do
we make them safer I mean physically how
do we build them to be safer and how do
we also just have that conversation
about human behavior so that we're
creating good habits around their use
maybe you don't need to have a glowing
rectangles shoved into your face seconds
before you turn off the light and try
and go to sleep we're already having
that conversation you know maybe maybe
it's not a good idea to put kids in
headphones at a young age because it has
a significant impact to their speech and
social development III had a wonderful
conversation with my audiologist talking
about that kind of you know pediatric
behavior and learning that cognitive
experience is woefully impacted by
locking someone up in headphones maybe
we need to have a conversation about
that it doesn't even have to be a you
know there is a smoking gun doom and
gloom 100 percent predictor on a cancer
recognized ohm or an ear health
mechanism or a heart health mechanism it
even just impacts the the daily
etiquette and society that we're all a
part of you know put your phone down and
experience this thing that's in front of
you right now and then get back to your
phone and figure out what you're gonna
do in your digital life to those little
moments those little breaks I think have
a huge contributing effect to how we
interact with each other and then
the focus that we have for interacting
with each other online indeed I think
that is a good place to at least pause
this conversation for now because
definitely more could be said on it and
and this is a the the last thing just to
wrap up because we got a number of
tweets coming in but this is from the
p-n weekly hash tag from Andrew says
slack a while ago I was considering
getting radiation shield for my phone
for when it's in my pocket after not
finding any conclusive evidence I forgot
about the whole idea
I wish the industry would dedicate some
of their research efforts to look at
these important issues and and I think
this is one of the things that makes me
most upset because I've been joining the
conversation and saying like hey I don't
see conclusive evidence to suggest that
there's a problem we're never gonna get
to a conclusion I feel like especially
in reading this this article from the
nation and again I'm taking it with a
little grain of salt because it has a
very obvious perspective I'm not going
to say bias but the nation is trying to
accomplish something with their
editorial structure and style in
collecting all this information but in
looking through the information they've
collected I don't find anything I don't
find anything wrong with the data that
they have it's just they're coming to a
conclusion on that data as to how it
pertains to the wireless industry but
for those of us that have been advocates
of mobile technology who have been fans
and enthusiasts of mobile technology I
feel like my conversations and
contributions have probably helped the
proliferation of mobile technology it
makes me upset to see the wireless
industry engaged in similar mechanics to
the tobacco industry in how this
conversation has evolved we will not
reach a conclusion on this for for many
years probably generations before we'll
have a conclusive data set that we can
point to to say yay or nay wireless
protocols can influence cancer that
doesn't mean that we should wait for
that you know if you're concerned and
you're looking at just changing your
behavior maybe you just don't keep your
phone in your pocket all the time and
you give it a little distance from you
you wear a headset or you know like you
just put in earphones and you don't have
the phone up to your skull all the time
if you're concerned those little steps
or probably have some kind of influence
or impact without terribly disrupting
your digital lifestyle
III don't know about like radiation
shields or like can I make a Faraday
pocket like is something that will
perfectly contain of the electromagnetic
radiation and I'll just have like a
tinfoil sleeve in my pants like a cargo
pocket
I don't know about any of that but just
create like antenna extenders that go
away from your like very far out of your
body like well I'll have like backpacks
with like those CB radio like prongs
just flapping in the breeze behind us
that that's that's not what I feel this
is but to this to that same sentiment we
as consumers should be able to have
conversations with our elected officials
these are things were concerned about
these are things that we hope will be
examined but then also it can also be up
to us to start conversations about
changing behavior of not picking up the
glowing rectangle every single little
time we want that dopamine hit might be
all we need maybe that's just it in
terms of exposure is just a more
reasonable or a more managed approach to
how we utilize these products and maybe
that's where we start but to say I'm
we're not going to change our behavior
as consumers or as an industry until
there's a conclusion means that we risk
generations of people with significant
health problems to get to that point
it's a risk there's it's not a guarantee
that we'll see that but I'm of the
mindset that if you are proactive in
trying to protect a population of people
against a situation like that that's not
wasted effort if it turns out to not be
true that is actually still a benefit
because we will have more and better
information on how to make these
products and services if we are
proactive in our approach if we are
reactive in our approach then there's
the coin flip either it is a
contributing factor and we were reactive
and now we have to figure out what to do
with all this cancer or we were
proactive and oh there's no real big
of cancer but now we know and we also
know a lot more about how to make these
products and how to make them and
continue making them safely I feel there
is the for me the argument for being
proactive greatly outweighs the risk of
being reactive and and I hope you will
all join us in this conversation and
share your thoughts share your feelings
as to what what will make this situation
easier to share with consumers because I
think one of the things that's going to
be a negative with this nation piece is
the way that traditional media is gonna
cover it I feel there's gonna be if they
even cover it at all it's gonna be the
doom and gloom because your cell phone
and cause cancer find out news at 11:00
and you're like that's the wrong
platform that's the wrong way to have a
nuanced grown-up conversation about
potential health risks yeah indeed
and so with that we've come to the
conclusion of this episode number 299 of
the PocketNow weekly hopefully we have
something pretty special for you planned
for next week given that there's a
special number that we're coming up to
you but indeed so there's that I don't
