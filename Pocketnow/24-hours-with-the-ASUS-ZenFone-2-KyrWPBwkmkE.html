some of the most interesting
developments in today's smartphone world
are found in the mid range we've just
spent a little more than 24 hours with
one of the most interesting of those
developments so join us for our first
impressions of the cheap but
feature-packed
a Seuss zine phone - the first thing you
notice about the zenfone 2 out of the
box is just how hefty it is it masses
170 grams nearly as much as Samsung's
Galaxy Note 4 and with 5.5 inch screen
it takes up almost as much space in the
hand the styling and the rear mounted
volume keys remind me of the LG g3 while
the faux metallic finish and the plastic
battery cover evokes the brushed
hairline pattern of the HTC One assumes
the zenfone the ultimate balance of
beauty and strength but to be honest it
looks and feels pretty generic
thankfully you can swap out the battery
cover for something more exciting if you
want and while you do so take note of
the dual SIM slots and micro SD
expansion that make the zenfone so
versatile I'm happy to see I don't need
to deal with the top mounted power
standby key to wake the phone up a
double tap gets us right into the Zen UI
easily one of the most elaborate Android
interfaces I've ever used it retains the
familiar layout of Android lollipop but
makes almost every aspect customizable
from icon packs to folder styles to
keyboard sizes to scroll animations and
beyond
it also comes loaded with more bloatware
than I thought possible though including
virus scanners memory managers power
consumption watchdogs and just folders
upon folders of branded offerings some
of the software comes naturally swiping
down on the homescreen to deploy the
notification shade for example other
aspects like drawing a letter on the
glass to quick launch into a specific
app take more practice and the jury's
still out on the efficacy of the built
in RAM booster speaking of RAM our
review unit is the deluxe variant with 4
gigs of the stuff backing up an Intel
Atom processor running at 2.3 gigahertz
this hardware drives the software very
speedily from everyday interactions to
graphically demanding games early
impressions of the pixelmaster camera
are good too despite its crowded and
somewhat
of an idle interface it's able to kick
out some solid photos in daylight mode
and our low-light tests are ongoing but
encouraging not so encouraging battery
life display brightness and external
audio endurance has been an ongoing
challenge with our Android reviews this
year so we're loathe to blame the
apparently short battery life on the
zenfone 2 especially with its large
power pack
we suspect some third-party apps are to
blame for this we'll keep close eye on
it on the road to the full review in
other news the full HD IPS screen
doesn't get bright enough to overcome
direct sunlight and despite the
pronounced grill on the phone's backside
the speaker itself is tiny and tinny
it remains to be seen whether the
zenfone 2 s
299 for this model and 199 for the
stripped-down version can overcome these
shortcomings we'll have the answer in
next week's full review but considering
what it's up against at these price
points well like top guns maverick might
say I don't know I'll tell you tomorrow
but it's looking good so far - make sure
you don't miss it
