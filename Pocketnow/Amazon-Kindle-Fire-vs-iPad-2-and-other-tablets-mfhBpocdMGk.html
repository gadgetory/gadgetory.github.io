pocketnow.com and today we're going to
finish off our kindle fire review and
take a look at it against other tablets
in the market today so sit back relax
enjoy the show let's talk first about
the amazon kindle fire and the HTC Flyer
from t-mobile both of which have a
similar form factor and screen size the
one item that the HTC Flyer has over the
Kindle Fire is the inclusion of a
front-facing and rear-facing camera plus
the digitized pin functionality I also
like the way that HTC implemented this
back grip section not appear but down
here so when you're holding on to it
from this angle you've got a little
something to hold on to or even in this
format what I don't like although is a
neat function is this moving rotating
buttons here because oftentimes when you
rotate it here you're pressing a button
that you didn't mean to press thus
causing interaction that you didn't want
but otherwise screen brightness and
color differential not a whole lot of
difference between here this does have
an internal cell that radio so they can
access the internet without having
direct access to somebody else's Wi-Fi
whereas the Kindle Fire just has Wi-Fi
in it both of them scroll up and down
fairly smoothly although we're looking
at a slightly different formatted
version here between the two of these
the really haven't had too many problems
between the two devices I'm using a
different browser though here between
them the I haven't found a whole lot of
difference between the browser of the
Amazon silk versus say dolphin mini
which is what I'm using here on the HTC
Flyer what I have noticed though is that
in the update for the kindle fire that
just came out recently the screen
touches and presses and interaction have
been much smoother even to the fact that
I haven't really reroute advice since i
updated it to this latest version i
believe it's 621 so let's take a look at
another device here move on to the much
larger galaxy tab 10
one from verizon again inclusion of
front-facing and rear-facing camera and
a cell radio gives this some advantages
over the kindle fire it is noticeably
thinner than the kindle fire and feels a
little bit lighter in the hands mostly
from the way that the device is laid out
the button here again on the galaxy tab
does get in the way when you're turning
the device have a tendency to power it
off accidentally while you're typing
items this is a very fast device you can
see the scrolling is very smooth here
even on the default browser compared to
the stipe chunkiness here that we have
on the kindle fire but again this device
is morreion to charge a large tablet
whereas the Kindle Fire is definitely
oriented towards more on the book and
reading some video content that is
available through the Amazon service or
watching your own I haven't had too many
problems between the two but I begin it
as far as form factor is concerned I
would rather carry around a 7 inch
version for reading books but I would
rather have a large screen version for
viewing videos or reading large
documents large PDFs a lot of pinching
and zooming that has to happen on the
kindle fire versus a large 10.1 inch
device such as this galaxy tab and then
we move on to the big boy in the game
the ipad 2 versus the kindle fire again
we got front and rear facing cameras
although they're not very good the speed
at which the browser works is very fast
really the ipad is kind of the cream of
the crop here still in as far as
high-end tablets go regardless of what a
lot of the android tablets can do the
ipad 2 simply just works it just works
well and works efficiently and hardly
ever have problems with it but when
reading books on a 10.1 inch device such
as this holding onto the device even
with a case on it and it's a little bit
slippery here it while it's lightweight
and it feels nice in the hands after a
few hours of using it to read
it does become tiresome and the edges
have a tendency to start leaving marks
on the inside of your poems versus the
kindle fire which is very lightweight
and I do find myself using this device
around the house more for reading
purposes if I it's a book or a comic
book even though this is a better format
for comic book reading but as far as
ecosystems are concerned this is the
closest comparison the other two Android
about tablets we've looked at don't
really have an ecosystem to back them up
other than the Google package these two
are the closest because Apple has its
own built-in ecosystem for apps and for
video content books etc etc although you
can add in your own stuff crosslink some
of that stuff together and amazon has
its own back-end as well that allows you
to get access to books and apps and so
on and so forth and I tell you that the
that makes a large difference in what
people are going to think of the kindle
fire against the ipad there's really no
comparison here if you really want to
spend the money and you want a high-end
tablet it's going to last you for a long
time and going to just work well all the
time you're probably looking at the ipad
2 but on a budget or if you just want a
7-inch tablet the kindle fire does a
remarkable job for the money and most
people i've talked to have received
kindle fires over the last few months or
have you know seen them or touched them
that sort of thing have been really
impressed with functionality for two
hundred dollars versus the four to five
hundred dollars depending on what model
you know this is the Wi-Fi only model
this is Wi-Fi only as well so the
reality is if you got one of these in
your Christmas stocking kindle fire
thinking of you're going to love it if
you're a tinker and hacker there are
ways to work around it to add more
functionality or load up cm7 or even
they're working on ice cream sandwich
which is great but it kind of takes away
from what this device is intended to be
which is a simple consumable object
amazon has been very clear we've
mentioned this in the other
videos that is not intended to be
necessarily a tablet per se it's
intended to access content kind of like
what the iPad lineup has done and the
ipod touch as well so that kind of gives
you a clue on what to expect from the
differences between them in all I would
say that if you're in the market for a
tablet device in the holiday season or
even to the start of the year kindle
fire is an excellent low-priced
alternative to the ipad kind of market
that that's out there there aren't as
many good apps I just found one music
app recently and he wasn't even
compatible with the kindle fire for the
android market the ipad does that much
better on all counts but if you just
simply want something for reading and
for viewing invasion intent may be
showing off some pictures two hundred
dollars is not bad for a price for a
tablet that's built as heartily and
structurally sound as the kindle fire
and really again with that six point 2.1
update that recently came out this
device operates even more efficiently
than it had before and i can't recommend
it highly enough that wraps up our
coverage of the kindle fire specifically
in the comparison video if you have any
comments or questions please leave them
below and we'll try to cover them in
answers to those comments give us a
thumbs up if you liked this video and
