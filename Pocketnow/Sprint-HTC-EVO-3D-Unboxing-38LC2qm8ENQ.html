calm and this is the unboxing video of
the HTC EVO 3d running on sprint's 4g
wimax network so let's get to the
unboxing okay so we'll just cut open
this package here and hopefully they'll
just like up in the box and let's pull
out the device itself or the box itself
as I should say and let's see we have a
nice simple box it says evo 3d on this
side here we have the experience 4G and
HTC evo or 3d let's see on the back we
have the evo 3d a standard lithium-ion
battery AC USB charger 8 gigabyte
microSD card we have a getting started
and all those other great pieces of
documentation so I'll just open up the
box here and it's a multi colored box
that's pretty interesting almost looks
like stars or diamond shapes and we have
the device itself and I'm guessing that
the battery is already inside because it
feels pretty heavy and we'll just set
that to the side for just a second let
me zoom out for just a minute okay so
we'll open up this a little bit of
cardboard and our getting started guide
we have our USB wall charger and our
micro USB a charging sync cable
unfortunately there's no headphones or
anything else inside box so let's get to
the device itself I'll be interesting to
power this on and see how the 3d display
works um let me uh power it on and we'll
come right back so it has a really nice
4.3 inch qhd display that's a very high
pixel resolution and we'll get more to
that on the hardware review coming up
next so to compare this to a couple of
other devices we have a droid charge
right here and they're similar in size
it looks as though the evo 3d is a
little bit thinner than the droid charge
but we also have an hd2 classic hd2 also
a 4.3 inch LCD on this device and a
little bit thicker than the hd2 let's
compare to the iphone 4 much thicker
than the iphone 4 but of course this
device does have the WiMAX 4G for sprint
so it's a pretty reasonable to expect
let's see what else do we have we have a
samsung focus and a little bit thicker
than samsung focus but of course this
device does have that wimax as i said
before so this has been just a quick
video of the HTC EVO 3d on sprint's 4g
wimax network and the device does have a
dual camera on the back end let's see
how that works just for one second let
see if of course you won't be able to
see it on the camera but we'll see what
we can do and wow that's that's kind of
cool we'll see if it's just a gimmick or
if it's worth purchasing this device on
sprint's network and we'll be back with
the hardware and software reviews coming
up next thanks for watching
