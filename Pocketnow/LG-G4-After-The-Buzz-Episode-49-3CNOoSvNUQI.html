over and over new device comes out new
device gets reviewed new device gets
forgotten almost no one follows up no
one follows along no one sticks around
to see how well a gadget ages over time
because there's always something new to
drool over so let's do something about
it let's take a second look at one of
the few flag shifts left that still
takes the word expandability seriously
I'm hi Mary Bennett with pocket now this
is the LG g4 and this is episode 49 of
after the buzz
and the ever-changing world of flagship
smartphones the latest trend for 2015
was sadly too i phone eyes them which
means that a thin and light premium
design is far more important than a
feature of X smartphone replaceable
batteries took a backseat to a seal
chassis and if you crave more storage be
ready to pay for a unit that offers that
LG is one of the few knights in shining
armor that actually defined the trend in
a completely opposite direction the
lessons learned from the sealed and not
expandable optimus G&amp;amp;G - we're somewhat
solved with the g3 but we all know that
that particular phone tried too hard to
innovate and accomplished too little up
to the point where we were mostly left
already wanting to see the company
successor I was one of those people and
after watching Michaels review of the LG
g4 back in May let's just say that I
jumped on it as quickly as I could as a
result I've been rocking this AT&amp;amp;T units
in September and some things have been
great others not so much
the hardware story is that a pleasant
disparity this phone is not trying to
copy anyone and that's proven to be a
good choice for both feel in the hand
and variety like most American race cars
this design is both futuristic and
substantial the gentle curve on the
display is then augmented by the arc
design of its trim if you're not rocking
a leather back trust me you should i do
love the feel of the ceramic back at
times but leather does make or break
this device and it gives it a very
premium feel in the hand which is very
important for smartphones LG could have
followed others with the aluminum trend
but I feel that the LG g4 has aged
better than most of its metallic
competitors I've dropped this phone at
least five times on tiled floors and the
dents on the shiny plastic finish are
hardly noticeable the corners on the
leather back do show some minor signs of
wear and the ceramic fact that scratch
on the first day but you really have to
nitpick to notice this
and you can always just replace the back
for around $40 on Amazon that same
glorious aging can be said about the
quad HD display with quantum IPS
technology now see these aren't famous
for inky blacks but this display does
the best job that I've seen so far and
its color reproduction and viewing
angles are just gorgeous
gone are the over sharpening and
brightness issues of its predecessor but
not all the problems were solved
sadly visibility in direct sunlight is
still an issue and you'll notice that if
you use polarized sunglasses you'll find
yourself thinking that displays off
sometimes depending on the angle you're
looking at it from still the 73% screen
to body ratio of this 5.5 inch display
continue to make this one of the best
options if you're wanting the benefits
of a phablet sized screen on a phone
that still fits well in most hands and
that doesn't become a burn in your
pocket now the software experiences
where the not so much fits best if
you've noticed that I almost use none of
LG's proprietary widgets keyboards and
other features well there's a reason for
that
I do praise LG for building one of the
most customizable user interfaces in the
Android ecosystem from display
transitions to floating qslide
applications to the flexibility of a
keyboard you will most likely be able to
customize everything you want here
things like being able to call your
notification tray from the bottom
navigation keys is just plain common
sense and the same goes for the way you
can call on split screen multitasking
all this is great as added bonuses but
the biggest problem is LG's taste and
execution or lack thereof some of these
applications follow a very data design
language and others like the settings
menu are very well organized and it just
feels like if the user interface lacks
cohesion
then when you notice the very small list
of applications that can do split-screen
and the very limited tools that can
become floating windows and at times you
simply forget these features you're
there this lack of consistency and
availability really hurts the user
interface since people drift more to
third-party applications than the ones
that are built in about the only true
benefit of owning an LG phone in the
software front is aging as the g4
follows on the steps of the g3 and
getting the latest version of Android
before most of its competitors at the
time of this recording marshmallow was
already reaching devices in Europe and
this AT&amp;amp;T unit should follow very
shortly
using the LG g4 for the last three
months has proven to be both awesome and
frustrating yes the software will
frustrate you on the first day but once
you install your favorite widgets and
keyboard you'll actually like how fluid
the Snapdragon 808 performs on this
phone apps load quickly multitasking is
snappy and the added screen real estate
makes playing graphics and tons of games
really cool awesome can also be said to
describe the data speeds over LTE and
the call quality is also very good
through the earpiece for some the gentle
curve on the display adds comfort but
for me it was really the loudness of the
earpiece and colors agree about the
audio quality on their end the back
mounted speaker is a still placed in the
oddest of places and can easily be
muffled with a finger but as with the g3
it continues to be one of the loudest
out there that being said the word
awesome fits most in the camera combo
included here the primary 16 megapixel
optically stabilized shooter with F 1.8
aperture continues to be one of the best
cameras out there not just on the
Android front double tapping the volume
down button match with optical image
stabilization on three axes and laser
autofocus all contribute to making this
one of the fastest smartphone cameras
and the resulting photos are just plain
gorgeous
whether it's during the day or in a very
dim scenario this camera just doesn't
cease to amaze me
great color reproduction amazing results
over HDR and you also get a bevy of
manual controls if that's your thing the
8 megapixel selfie shooter is also a
shocker and especially with the amount
of detail that it's able to pull if you
remove the beautifying modes and yes
there is also a very cool built in
selfie flash software solution just this
Pleasant is how the phone is able to
capture light in video recording where
devices like the iPhone 6 were simply
ridiculed in filming this exact same
scene at night overall the LG g4 has one
of the cameras to beat in the smartphone
industry and this is one of the features
that will age best over the next few
months sadly that's the end of the
pleasantries though as oddly one of my
biggest frustrations has to do with the
fluctuating battery life some days I get
through the day just fine and then other
days like today the battery takes a
dramatic plunge unless I keep closing
the applications in the background yes I
know you can replace the battery but
this is rather sad given LG's legendary
work in building some of the best
batteries in the industry and it's
probably a software bug that could get
fixed with a marshmallow update you know
what sadly the biggest problem is that
LG decided to kill this phone rather
early
one of the things that made me think
twice about buying the LG g4 was the
lack of a fingerprint scanner at a time
when everybody is jumping in and I gave
it the benefit of the doubt and just
decided to give the phone a try just
about two or three weeks before LG
decided to launch the LG b 10
and yes everything that the LG g4 didn't
have is now brought to you by the v10
and I guess that sad note is the best
way to end this after the buzz episode
of the LG g4 at this time even with all
the cool things that this phone brings
to the table
it's rather pointless for you to invest
in buying it if you can get the better
features of the LG v10 surely you miss
out on the leatherbacks and a couple of
other things but the idea of investing
on a flagship phone have mainly to do
with getting more bang for your buck and
if LG came to the conclusion that it
could do more with its newer v10 and
really who are we to argue otherwise
folks just like in the case of the g4
every other phone comes of age so stay
tuned to the next episodes of after the
buzz coming very soon while you're at it
