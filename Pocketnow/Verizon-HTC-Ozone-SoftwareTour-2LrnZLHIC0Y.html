pocketnow.com in today we're going to go
over the software that's included with
the verizon HTC ozone the verizon HTC
ozone runs windows mobile 6.1 and
verizon hasn't done very much to
customize windows mobile 6.1 so you
essentially get all of windows mobile
6.1 standard plus some applications that
they've added which we'll go over when i
see will show you what programs there
are on the device so on the today screen
you've got the familiar windows mobile
6.1 standard scrolls through item
thicker so we've got the phone here the
next the calendar i haven't hooked up
with my Exchange ActiveSync account and
it shows you your next appointment if
you go to the left you can actually
create a new appointment going down you
can go through your unread emails and
actually scroll through them if you
choose you can actually see your
messages and read through those messages
and then hit the return key and it will
bring you back to the today screen same
here with your HTML messages you've also
got a text message functionality which
allows you to do text messaging video
messaging and picture messaging to the
next function is the weather gives you
the five-day weather and the next one is
your internet explorer so Internet
Explorer is the updated internet
explorer from Microsoft which does
support YouTube so if we bring that up
on the site that's
configured by default is the windows
live site but we can go to menu here and
go to web address and if we clear out
the web address and put in YouTube and
then select youtube com it'll bring you
back to the mobile YouTube and we will
be able to play some videos from that so
here you have Quentin Tarantino's
filmmaker advice click on that right now
we are using the eeo network so scroll
up to see the screen and you can see the
screens actually please go so so it's
definitely watchable it's a very nice
added functionality will come back to
the today screen and you've got your
profile where you can actually scroll
through calm manager ringtone for
windows mobile background image can
change that and the task manager which
is allows you to close programs so it's
a nice feature there on it also has a
wizard that helps you set up the email
accounts to gmail you've got visual
voicemail which is a verizon specific
application then you've got your
bluetooth allows you to easily set up
your bluetooth headset wife i'd set up
your Wi-Fi connection set your wallpaper
ringtones and some device tips that they
provide and allows you to remove this
getting started feature which is
you know if you're not this is your
first time with a smartphone this is
quite handy and has a lot of good
information so then that takes you back
to the clock so under the start if we
look at the program's you've got your
standard messaging calendar contacts
Internet Explorer's windows media player
we've got Office Mobile with Excel
OneNote PowerPoint and word come back to
that activesync of course Adobe Reader
the light edition voice command which is
a great little application which is tied
into the phone button down here audio
booster your call history the camera
which is a 2 megapixel camera it takes
ok pictures clocks and alarm the comm
manager and the modem link so that you
can actually use this phone for
tethering RSS hub quick GPS which is a
the a GPS functionality so that the GPS
function kicks in faster because it
helps it get help it does get help from
the cellular network and that's what a
GPS is all about it's a combination of
using the GPS chip that's on board with
the cellular network to get the fastest
of position information speed dial
here's visual voicemail verizon gives
you a mobile IM application i actually
installed thing which in my next video
will go over in terms of using the gps
mobile email which is a service that
verizon provides to get linked all your
email accounts together VZ Navigator is
verizon's gps application allows you to
navigate
eight and gets you turn-by-turn
navigation then you've got a couple
games bubble breaker and solitaire and
your system tools clear storage which
allows you to reinitialize the device
the sim manager which allows you to copy
the contacts from the included sim card
and the task manager so you know this is
a very full-featured phone and again you
know very tough to be for 4999 with a
two-year contract and that's really the
key in this platform it's a 528
megahertz processor it's the same base
hardware design for the snap although
obviously it's customized for the evo
network and it also has a GSM built in
so although the the core processing
engine is the same it's really a
different phone because it's customized
for verizon and the fact that they
wanted it to be a world phone which is
another appealing aspect to this phone
so that's about it for today and I'll be
back to test out the switching out the
SIM card to an AT&amp;amp;T sim card and also
looking at the GPS chip since this is
one of the first phones that comes
unlocked from verizon will be using the
bing application and see how well it
works that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
