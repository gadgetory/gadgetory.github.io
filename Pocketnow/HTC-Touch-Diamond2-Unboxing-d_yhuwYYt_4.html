pocketnow.com
and we're really excited to bring you
the unboxing of the HTC touch diamond2
this is gonna be a very hot device this
year not only in the Windows Mobile
world but in the entire smartphone world
this is the successor to the HTC touch
diamond2 best-selling windows mobile
device of all time so we're really
really excited to finally get the chance
to unbox this so let's do it I'm
expecting a really fantastic unboxing
experience HTC really goes out of their
way to make that so lots of bubble wrap
here it's much smaller box than the the
Touch Dimond and the touch pro let's see
here touch down into a very small box
just has a picture of the device on the
front see what else it has around the
box
not much just some specifications on the
back so we know this has at 528
megahertz processor we know it has a 3.2
inch WVGA screen which is as high as
Windows Mobile will allow you to go
anyway so let's get to the actual
unboxing well I'm actually surprised the
unboxing experience is kind of boring
it's it's actually a cardboard box
inside of here alright so we'll take a
look at the device in a second let's see
what we have in the box we have a
battery which is of size 1,100 milliamp
hours and HTC claims to have made big
strides in battery life on the touch
diamond2 so although this is a small
battery it apparently has really good
battery life let's see what else we have
syncing cable using HTC's proprietary
jack which will actually work with off
your mini USB stuff then we have some
headphones which is good
extra stylus it looks like this is the
magnetic variety just like the Touch HD
and the touch pro then we have the
charger of course and the rest of that
and it actually looks like there is a
little compartment up here that contains
more material let's see what we have in
here so we have a nice screen protector
so that's good we have some warranty
information accessories I don't see any
case which is pretty unfortunate manual
Quick Start Guide which is in C not in
color just comes surprising and some CDs
all right so let's take a look at the
device Wow it's it's much smaller than
it appears in the pictures and the
pictures it actually looks quite large
but it's quite a petite device look how
it fits in the hand it's got a 3.2 inch
screen really high resolution it's quite
thin they took away the diamond faceting
on the back and now it's just a
completely smooth surface which is quite
interesting and of course it feels very
high quality it's an HTC device mm
interesting so let's compare two other
devices I think the closest comparison
would actually be to the touch HD
because they both have very high
resolution screens they're both candy
bar like devices and the diamond 2 is
much less narrow it's a tad thicker and
not as tall so definitely a more
pocketable device one of the big
problems with the touch HD is it's so
wide it's got a huge 3.8 inch screen but
it feels quite big in the pocket and
let's take a look at how it compares to
the iPhone which has a larger screen the
iPhone has a 3.5 inch screen and the
touch HD of course or the touch diamond2
of course is 3.2 inches let's see how it
looks to the last generation HTC Touch
pro and the 2.8 inch screen is gone I
don't think HTC is going to do any more
devices with that small of a screen and
of course it's much thinner than the
Touch pro2 so that's it for the unboxing
of the HTC touch diamond2 first
impressions so that quality is fantastic
it's a lot smaller in hand that it
actually looks in pictures now this is
actually the European version it will
work in the United States but you can
only get edge data you can't get 3G and
you can use it with t-mobile or AT&amp;amp;T
anything that has a SIM card really if
you want to touch diamond2 of your own
