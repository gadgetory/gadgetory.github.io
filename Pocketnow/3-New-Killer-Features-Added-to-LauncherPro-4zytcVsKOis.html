not long ago I showed you a really cool
launcher app called launcherpro now back
then it was in version 0.5 beta let me
tell you it's come a long way let's go
take a look at some of the new features
okay this is my android it's a nexus one
running android 2.2 and what I've got
running here is the launcher pro app now
a launcher app is basically everything
you see here it's all of your icons it's
the ability to have wallpaper in this
case a live wallpaper your shortcuts
over here and then your app drawer all
of that is your launcher now there are
lots of launchers that you can get just
go to the marketplace and search for
launcher in fact you should be able to
find launcher pro available for free in
the market as long as you're running
android two points somewhere now i don't
want to go over everything this launcher
does so i'm just going to hit on three
things just to try and keep this video
at a reasonable length so the first
thing i want to show you is scrollable
widgets now you're familiar with widgets
they're informational areas of the
screen here's a news widget that rotates
through some news items here's a clock
and weather widget as well the time and
the weather and then my pure calendar
widget which if you look right here it's
got a few days worth of calendar
information on it now your calendar has
a lot more information than just a few
days but when you combine an advanced
launcher like launcher pro or ADW
launcher which is just another launcher
app along with apps a ridgid rather that
are scrolling aware you can scroll the
information in your widgets so in this
case i can scroll through a whole bunch
of calendar items just at the flick of
my finger without having to wait for my
calendar app to open so that's really
cool really nice again you've got to
have a launcher that supports it and you
have to have a widget that supports it
and turn on that ability in both of them
a little bit complicated but I'm sure
you can figure it out next I want to
show you let's scoot back over here to
this screen I want to show you my
shortcut bar fact let me rotate my phone
up this way and zoom in a bit now this
is just basically where your where your
doc lives and up until recently you've
had your launcher
Trey if you will just a little little
grabber that you'd grab on Android 1.5
and six and pull it up to view your app
drawer in later versions you know you
don't have to pull it up you just tap on
it and it opens but what you'll notice
here is I've got a whole bunch of icons
on either side of it two on each side
and these icons are configurable you can
set them to be whatever you want but
what i want to show you here is i can
scroll side to side and get a whole new
set of shortcuts so i can put my most
frequently used apps down there and this
will let me rotate all the way through
or i can go to side to side it's just a
loop through so that's really cool you
can add any number of stuff down here to
your otherwise unused space now froyo
help to occupy that space a little bit
over here on the sides it had screen
indicators to let you know which home
screen you were on just in case you got
lost because you can have a whole bunch
of homescreens now so that would say you
know there's four screens over that way
there's another two screens that way and
you're on the middle one you know or
whatever well this will let you do that
as well you can set this icon and this
icon or really any icons for that matter
to be a screen indicator just like on
froyo but you know I don't like that I
know pretty much what screen I'm on and
I can always view all of my screens all
at once which I showed you in my last
video so I just occupy those with
frequently used things so that's cool
and it's feature number two feature
number three is really where this starts
to shine it's the only launcher app that
I've seen do this so far you'll notice
my gmail icon over here has a little red
one next to it or a one in a red circle
now what that's telling me is I have one
unread gmail item if I had any missed
phone calls I'd have a little indicator
over here telling me how many missed
calls I had there and if I were using
the stock messaging app for my text
messages I could have the same thing to
show me how many text messages I have
waiting now i use google voice and there
isn't a shortcut icon that has that
feature built-in yet though I do have a
feature request put in with the
developer to let me do that
so that's really neat you can see at a
glance hey I've got this many things of
this type to look at and I can
prioritize what I do now right now
you're thinking but Joe we've got this
entire area of the screen which is
devoted to nothing but you know what
notifications they call it a
notification bar you can grab on it and
drag it down and check and see what
notifications you have and yes you're
right but let me show you what you can
do let's go in here to the menu and I'm
going to zoom back out a bit so we can
see a little bit more of the screen here
we're going to go into the preferences
and then the preferences we're going to
go into the appearance settings now
first thing you'll notice is over the
last version we have a lot better
organization of all of the configuration
settings I really really like this let's
go right into it you'll notice here we
can hide the notification bar so let's
go ahead and check that and let's go
back home and you'll notice now up on
the top if I can actually press the home
button I no longer have that
notification bar up on top now there's a
lot of stuff that the doc doesn't show
that was up there but you know there
might be widgets that you have on your
home screen that show you that
information that show you you know if
you're on Wi-Fi or if you're on 3G or
whatnot so there's stuff that can
replace that if if you've got it there
so you don't have to have redundant
information which I really like but one
other thing is I've noticed that in some
of the apps that I use I'm starting to
see some burn in at the top of my screen
of that notification dock because it's
it's a white area with black text so
it's really high contrast and I am just
like in the old CRTs I'm starting to see
some burn in you can't see it here and
it's really not a big deal but if you
want it to get that that possibility of
burn in just out of your mind just for
peace of mind you can do something like
that and of course if you decide you
know I don't like it that way and I want
it back you can go back into your
preferences and unhide the notification
bar and there you go it's back there for
you so there
tons and tons and tons of other things
that have been put into this app since I
showed you the previous video but if I
were to show you and we're already
looking at a seven-minute video here and
you guys have already told me that's a
long video to show you anything more
we'd be looking at a really long video
so I'm going to turn you loose and let
you go out to the market search for
launcherpro all onward download and
install it it's free so you don't have
to worry about it and try it out if you
like it great go ahead and start using
it start exploring and tell me what your
favorite new feature is that you found
just put that in the comments to this
video or to the comments of the video or
the comments of the article and let me
know what you think you can always
switch back if you don't like it just
uninstall it and you're back to your
stock launcher and tell me what you
think do you like the app are the things
that you like that aren't included and
if so what and of course if you like
this kind of video give it a thumbs up
if you aren't already subscribed to our
video channel you really owe it to
yourself to do that for all kinds of
reasons I'm not going to go into it
because I'm out of time and then of
course share this with your friends on
Twitter and on Facebook if you have any
questions at all leave me comments below
