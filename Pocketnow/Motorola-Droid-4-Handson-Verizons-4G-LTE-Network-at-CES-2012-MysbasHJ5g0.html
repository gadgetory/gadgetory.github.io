pocketnow.com and we've got a demo of
the motorola droid 4 from Verizon so
Ryan's gonna shows the phone around so
tell me about it all right the new droid
4 by motorola so the cool thing on this
is 4G LTE is now coming to the droid
factory so you've got 4g LTE speeds and
you've got this amazing fibro keyboard
so great option for people who are
looking for a physical QWERTY keyboard
in an orgy LTE device from aspect
standpoint you've got a 1.2 bigger hurts
dual-core processor and one gig of ram
so it's lightning fast zips through the
web zips through applications
everything's opens really really fast
looks very snappy I look the design yes
as you move through you can see
everything everything's really crisp
really clear it's moving through
applications as you're opening up
applications let's see here without
voice command is not all that
interesting but camera so we've got an
eight megapixel camera right very snappy
to launch the camera absolutely yeah so
everything happens really quick
everything's really you know the
graphics you can see how everything kind
of snaps into place that version of
motive war looks really really good yes
a bunch of cool widgets you can move
between home screens really easily that
way custom widgets that are built in
see what else we've got so one of the
cool things and similar to the razor
you've got this thing if I can find it
smart action so what this does is
basically you can set different
conditions so say when I leave the
office and a text message letting
everybody know I'm on my way oh so its
senses when you leave the office that it
sends the message it can do it based on
time and day based on your geography and
can do it based on certain conditions on
the phone so let's say my battery's
getting down a little low yeah good
battery life on this phone but as it
gets a little lower maybe I want to shut
down the bluetooth maybe we want to turn
off data push so my email is not syncing
constantly so i can get additional
battery life so a great really cool
feature that they've built in here okay
let me see the design I mean yes we've
got a chrome lining very nice yep and we
take this off know right thats that
stuck on there so you can kind of see
here's the 8 megapixel camera here 1080p
visit the video resolution ya got your
USB charger and your HDMI out here
and you know really just you know we
kind of rounded off the edges let the
light around it seems really back
lighting they're really fast really easy
to type on the keyboard okay this is
probably one of the most anticipated
devices of the year you guys have leaked
it so much and we haven't got a device
until now so a lot of people are really
excited about it now aside from that
performance wise and everything is Scott
it's at running still gingerbread er
that we have ice cream sandwiches this
is gingerbread 23 okay no announcements
at this point around what's happening
with the ice cream sandwich no slightly
soon most likely soon okay and well
