claimed that it rivals even high-end
computers at least in theory and the
Rubin talked essential phone expansion
and bug fixes for the camera and Apple
reveals more details on the capabilities
of face ID I'm high metal Iveta and yes
I know that this video is gonna be a
little late it's been crazy this Friday
with our Galaxy Note 8 review which is
coming tomorrow
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 the device has just gone global
in 42 markets as of today is launching I
have a couple of friends that have
already bought it and yeah our review is
going to go live tomorrow with a lot of
details over our final impressions so
far it's gonna be really hard for me to
move away from that phone and obviously
you know the way competition goes today
we're also the pre-orders of the iPhone
8 iPhone 8 plus Apple watch Series 3 and
the Apple TV the new 4k one and yes I
was up at 3 a.m. pre-ordering and well
it actually ran out of stock quite early
actually a couple of hours after though
there still are variants that are
available which pretty much makes us
think in the case of the iPhone 8 that
there are people waiting for the iPhone
10 I just wonder if there will be enough
of those now let's discuss the essential
phone Andy Rubin was recently on reddit
on AMA answering a couple of questions
over antenna things starting with
obviously the performance in the camera
and the rumen claims that there are
software updates coming to improve the
experience those of you wanting the
essential phone on other carriers
Verizon is currently in certification so
that should come soon there's also
expansion to other countries and for
those of you complaining of the lack of
a headphone jack I still want to verify
if this is real but apparently they're
working on a way to adapt it to the pins
at the back that's gonna be interesting
but hey if they figure it out why not I
suppose a spotlight back to Apple and
face ID we get more details over the
capabilities first of all you don't have
to worry if you're wearing sunglasses
apparently face ID is going to be smart
enough to notice that the second thing
is that you will only be able to set one
face for iPhone so
sharing of your iPhone's face ID sadly
or actually good and in other cases for
those of you worrying if you're gonna
get mugged or something with your new
iPhone and they're gonna ask you to use
your face to unlock the phone and then
steal it apparently if you press all
buttons at the same time you will be
able to trigger an emergency mode where
face ID will not work I just wonder if
that's actually the best thing if
anything but hey we will be testing all
of these features whenever our review
units arrived and finally the very
interesting news today have to do with
Apple's a 11 Bionic chip and its
capabilities apparently it was placed on
benchmarks today and well the numbers
are so staggering that the report even
claims that it rivals the 13-inch
MacBook Pro and I
I don't trust benchmarks I know that is
BS in my opinion obviously even if the
numbers are true that doesn't
necessarily mean that the capabilities
are that good still apples a chips have
proven to be really leaders over the
past couple of years it just makes me
wonder in today's question if this
amount of power in a processor is enough
to get you to buy iPhones does that mean
that you would consider these or would
you stick to Android in my case I love
apples performance when it comes to
gaming particularly I do enjoy it a lot
when it comes to iPads but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion friends you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
before the video was filmed the photo
was I'm talking about comment subscribe
to our channel as well for more videos
