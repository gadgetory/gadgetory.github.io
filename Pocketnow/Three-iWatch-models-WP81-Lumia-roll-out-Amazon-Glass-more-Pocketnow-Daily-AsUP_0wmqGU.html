three i watch models Windows Phone 8.1
update along with the Nokia Sian update
reaches loonies today and what does
Amazon up to next is it snatches a
google glass project leader I'm hi mera
neta and when you buy a pair of Amazon
glasses just to buy more amazon stuff
this is sparking out daily the official
news today are really cool as Windows
Phone 8.1 along with smoky cyan up they
finally reaches Lumia devices as of
today it should be rolling out in the
next couple of weeks to everyone but
those of you in Europe should probably
start trying to update your devices as
of today as obviously the servers are
going to be jammed at some point and
even though it's hard to predict how
this will work for us carrier models of
Lumia devices hopefully we all won't
have to wait much another interesting
news HCC's chief marketing officer Ben
ho has decided to resign the company and
he is giving his duties a chair Wang
even though he's gonna stay in the
company for a little bit why was this
criticized HCC's marketing campaign
specifically like the here's to change
campaign where a lot of us didn't really
understand what HTC was up to and
obviously the company has seen that 1
billion dollars in Robert Downey jr.
wasn't really worth it so obviously we
should expect different marketing
tactics from HTC coming soon the company
is seeing some profits lately so
hopefully this will be some good times I
think the company is making some really
good changes now one tip that we
definitely cannot understand as the new
rumors of a samsung galaxy s5 Neal
remember the galaxy note 3 neo which was
a watered-down version of the note 3 and
even though we already had the galaxy s5
mini then there is the galaxy s5 Prime
and then there is the galaxy s5 and
regular and then the active we don't
really understand what the foot of the
neo is apparently this is for emerging
markets it will have a 720p display
along with the lesser specifications
everywhere though again these are just
reports I wish I can tell you to stay
tuned but it's just not worth it now
some other very interesting reports
coming from Taiwan are of Apple working
on three i watch model
you have heard it too but now apparently
there are 3 a 1 point 6 inch model a 1.8
inch model and the other one is another
1.8 inch model that will have a sapphire
display family all three models will
have curved OLED displays and hear this
they will have touch ID as well
according to the rumors as the company
is investing our new technologies in
order to allow for something so small to
fit on a wearable obviously it's hard to
tell we will see these products coming
this year as some people have assumed
that the products won't be ready until
next year still let's see obviously it
makes sense for a 1.6 inch model for the
female crowd and we haven't really seen
this from Android where are the pebbles
so see how this goes and finally for the
very interesting news of the day my god
amazon we really don't understand what
the company's up to lately they say they
weren't gonna work on tablets and we got
the fire they said they weren't gonna be
working on smartphones and we got the
fire phone and now the company has
snatched one of the leaders of google
glass fabric parviz he is now being
hired at amazon and even though we don't
really understand what he is planning to
do in the company we do know that he was
working on these new contact lenses that
actually were smart so yeah this is a
very smart dude we don't really
understand what amazon is up to next but
that leads you to the question of the
day what do you think about Amazon's
hardware products lately are they
enticing for you are they interesting
for you because in my case you know the
fire phone looks cool so the kindle
tablets but the problem is i don't want
a product to just buy amazon products i
don't find the point in that what do you
think leave us a comment down below tell
us what your thoughts are on this
because i don't imagine buying glasses
just to buy more amazon products what am
I going to get a barcode scanner friends
es you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video with
spill mushy follow what I'm talking out
on comments start changing channel as
well it also follow me on Twitter high
mileage quarter iveta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
