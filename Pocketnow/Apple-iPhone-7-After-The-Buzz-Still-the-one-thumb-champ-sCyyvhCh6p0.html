everyone scrambles to unbox it then
review it and after a couple weeks we
all move on to the next new exciting
gadget though how a phone ages is as
important as that initial out of the box
experience so let's do something about
that nearly ten months ago Apple took
the wraps off the current generation of
iPhones and the consumer response has
been somewhat mixed there's no
questioning that this is one of the best
selling phones of all time but in a
climate where people are holding on to
phones longer and the emotional high of
buying a new phone is waning investors
demand growth while the premium market
is plateauing this generation of iPhone
served is something of a disruptor to
the traditional iPhone release schedule
we've come to understand how has this
handset held up against more exciting
evolution from Android competition it's
time to take a second look at our iPhone
7 after the buzz there's always a little
disclosure which has to happen when
talking about iPhones I rarely use one
as a daily driver coming back to the
smaller iPhone 7 I've been using this
phone mostly to track iOS beta progress
which we'll talk about a little later in
this video for my current production
schedule Android allows me to get more
of my work done even up to editing and
rendering videos my most consistent uses
for iOS recording with my sennheiser
clip Mike and facetiming with family on
iPhones and iPads still for those short
stretches I do leave the house with this
phone I genuinely miss having smaller
phones in my pocket a g6 or si can feel
small for the amount of screen they
deliver
but neither truly approach the
diminutive stature of the iPhone 7 I'd
happily trade a little extra girth for
more battery but aside from an iPhone se
there really isn't a better premium one
thumb experience available on the market
today circling back to FaceTime I found
myself in the odd position where though
I use Android personally and that's
unlikely to change anytime soon
I've been recommending Apple more to
others mobile hardware has become
impressively powerful so increasingly
software support is critical as we
interact with future
services even a $200 phone is incredibly
capable but in Android land
I've been bothered by the lack of
support facing most phones after the
first year it's really not okay to look
at a market where we spend hundreds of
dollars on products which are ill well
after 18 months especially looking at
consumer trends where we're all holding
on to phones longer than in the days of
ironclad two-year contracts
I personally flip phones aggressively so
I'm willing to put up with the
compromises involved but when helping
other people spend their money aiding in
a purchasing recommendation this point
has become a more important note to
underscore when I give advice and one
service which shows off my current
Google frustration perfectly is
communication apps I worked hard to get
people using hangouts only to see oh
wishy-washy Google shift strategies on
me when my grandmother easily picks up a
tablet to FaceTime that's an actual
solution I can recommend without having
to walk someone through finding a
third-party app that is valuable maybe
the biggest sin of the iPhone 7 is that
we didn't really get in I phone 7 we
kind of got an iPhone 6s - I'll sure
they changed the camera housing enough
to make us all have to go out and buy
new cases sure we got new versions of
black as color options but those aren't
really enough to make us feel like we
got a proper new phone Apple has
successfully migrated this logo from
geeky tech brand to lifestyle fashion
brand so we should grade them
accordingly this iPhone did a poor job
in eliciting the emotional response of
getting a new number
iPhone if we were judging a fashion line
jewelry or purses this would not have
been heralded as boundary-pushing
fashion-forward Haute Couture it's a
fine device bringing many significant
improvements to things like speaker tech
and lifestyle durability but that's not
really sexy - the new form factor the
new screen the new design that will be
sexy Apple as a victim of their own
success produced something here which
felt derivative but the biggest gripe
over my time using this phone has
been the headphone dongle which I lost
and I haven't been motivated to spend
money on replacing it I absolutely abhor
the terrible seal and noise reduction of
the Apple earpods ein so I've not
bothered with the air pot my iPhone 7
used recently with a pair of LG tone
Bluetooth earbuds I'm sad on a personal
level as this logo once represented
class-leading consumer audio and now I
have an iPhone which I can't use with my
favorite headphones this didn't feel
like progress when the phone was new and
it still doesn't feel like progress
today
what does feel like progress though is
using the iOS 11 beta I don't know that
I've ever been as excited for an iPhone
update as I have been using this
software we'll be taking a more detailed
approach to iOS 11 in a separate video
but quickly discussing some highlights I
personally enjoyed coming from Android
and using things like widgets the new
layout for the control center is
definitely busy in a way we would
consider uncharacteristic for Apple but
converting this into a one panel
solution instead of swiping for media
controls is a quality of life
improvement I support Apple has largely
lagged behind Google in areas like file
management iOS 10 helped improve support
for third-party cloud apps and iOS 11
continues that with a hub for file
management it's still not nearly as
seamless as what we can do on Android
moving around media but this is a
terrific step in the right direction
lastly I'm actually rooting for Apple
over Google looking at the future of
video creation and distribution this
iPhone 7 can now shoot 4k video using
h.265 compression that's a geeky speak
way to say we can capture the same video
quality in roughly half the file size
we're talking about expensive premium
phones we should be looking at the
top-tier quality settings for photos and
videos the main issues voiced with UHD
video it takes up more space on the
phone and that affects data plan usage
when sharing those files we can solve
those problems with better compression
and our phones are more than powerful
enough to use that new compression by
comparison
minute of 4k video from an iphone using
h.265 produces a smaller file than one
minute of 1080p video from an LG G 6
shooting h.264 why aren't we all using
this well Google doesn't want to pay the
licensing fees which are expensive so
instead they're creating a competing
video codec which probably won't be
ready for primetime until well into 2018
I've been working with h.265 video since
2014 and we're still waiting for Google
to figure out a solution here Apple is
the only company with enough leverage to
force this issue iOS 11 joins ZTE and
Huawei in using this space-saving video
codec for now instead of native support
we're looking at on device transcoding
when uploading to YouTube unfortunately
those uploads are currently only HD but
still this is handled more seamlessly
for the consumer than the fixes users
need to implement on Android but I've
rambled on enough let's wrap this up
10 months later where does that leave us
with the iPhone 7 I just can't make the
switch for every little thing I like
about iOS and every gripe I currently
have with Google there are still a few
key areas that keep me using Android I
know folks might be wanting more
benchmarking in this after the buzz but
the main takeaway from me using this
phone it's forced me to examine my
mobile philosophy compare my wants
against my needs I want a smaller
premium phone but I need to be able to
get my work done reviewing Apple gadgets
continues to drive my internal conflict
over what I want for the future of
mobile technology at the same time as
I'm unimpressed with this design and
bothered by the headphone situation
I'm also elated by upcoming improvements
to file management and video compression
so would I buy an iPhone 7 today no no I
really wouldn't the competition is
currently more exciting and we all know
a big hardware changes on the horizon
arriving with the next iPhone we should
also get some good deals on current
handsets
the only time an iPhone ever really gets
a price cut there's just too much to
gain by
eating for the next iPhone to be
released my iPhone 7 doesn't get to see
much real-world action I'm still more
inclined to walk out the door with the
se but revisiting this phone has made me
really anxious to see where i OS might
go next
I just hope Apple doesn't completely
walk away from folks who still care
about using their phones with only one
thumb as always thanks so much for
