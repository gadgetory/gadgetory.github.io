learn more about its update policy works
bring new data on what to expect with
the iphone 6s camera and we were of
certain issues when factory resetting
your Android phone I'm Hyneman iveta
back for some more action and some
better quality beer this is parking out
daily the official new should have to do
with Apple as a the company has just
changed the title of Jonathan Ive in the
past he was senior vice president of
design now he is a chief design officer
for the company and it's pretty much
just official izing what he already does
he's in charge of design and everything
from products to apples a spaceship
campus to the company's iOS and even OS
10 and so many other things so yeah it's
just pretty much making things official
we just wonder what that will mean for
Apple product going forward now they're
very concerning news have to do with the
Apple watch as if you remember the
company pushed the software update to
watch 0 s 1 point 0 point 1 and it
brought some book fixes but it seems
that it did cripple some things and
we'll just promise you that it will
monitor your heart rate every 10 minutes
as a way to give you accurate data over
how your heart is performing and how
many calories you're burning but it
seems that users are complaining that
after the update some of them don't get
their heartbreak echt 48 hours in some
cases and even though that hasn't been
the case for a review Apple watch here
yeah buyers beware have a look at that I
let's talk about the iphone 6s and
iPhone 6s plus one of the biggest
concerns two weeks ago where the rumors
that Apple was apparently going to bring
a smaller sensor or the same size sensor
for more megapixels apparently we're
getting an upgrade to 12 megapixels but
the sensor was going to keep the same
size as the 8 megapixel sensor on the
iphone 6 of the problem but that is
obviously lesser quality images and very
bad low-light performance reports claim
that Apple is once again going to
partner would so need to fix that
apparently we are getting an RGBW a
camera sensor here which will bring
white pixels in addition to the other
colors and that will apparently boost
the image quality at night obviously we
will have to confirm if that's going to
the case but reports claim that this was
actually planned for the iphone 6 and
was held back as soon as sony could fix
the quality so let's see what we get by
the end of this year and I know guys
let's move away from the Apple news
let's start talking about Android but
these are not actually good news as the
kempers university just conducted a
study on 21 different Android phones
that we're using versions of the OS
version 2.3 up to 4.3 and what they
notice is that you don't really wipe
your data when you wipe your data
apparently certain OEMs are not applying
all the drivers required on their
proprietary Android skins in order to
make sure that your data is being white
with a factory reset now the OEMs are
not provided the data was not offered
sadly we can't tell you which OEMs are
having this problem but yeah it seems
that whenever you factory reset your
Android phone there is all types of
personal data for measurement just to
text book just to even tokens from your
google account so make sure you have a
look at that before you bestow your
phone to somebody else or sell it and
finally for the very hot news of the day
as we get closer to google i/o in the
next couple of days we get two new leaks
of what to expect for Android M first of
all it seems that internal code shows us
what the probable name of Android M will
be and it's gonna be complicated
apparently the code is M and C which
means macadamia nut cookie or macadamia
yeah macadamia nut cookie and it's just
so difficult to pronounce that yeah
that's probably the artist name ever why
don't they think about Android mint or
something like that and in addition to
that we've got other rumors that claim
that Google is making it official
that'll have a specific policy for
software updates specifically for Nexus
products and seems to the company is
going to guarantee just two years or
software updates and then three years of
security patches which is really
interesting and all this leads me to the
question of the day if you have to pick
the name for Android M meaning yeah it's
macadamia nut cookie or what name would
you give it what name would you prefer
and please bring out some names here I
don't like pastries so I don't really
have an opinion here but leave us a
comment down below what is your case
bren-ji know the drill if he wanted the
news earlier before this video was
filming sure you follow us on parking
out comment subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well it followed me on
Twitter Jaime underscore de Rivera
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am Hyneman Rivera
