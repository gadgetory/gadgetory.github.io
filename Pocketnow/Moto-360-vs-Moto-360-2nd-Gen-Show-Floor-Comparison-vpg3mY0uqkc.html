generation of the moto 360 smartwatch
here at Aoife 2015 in Berlin now it's
time to take a look at exactly what's
changed from first wave to sequel
i'm michael fisher with pocket now with
high auto huesemann behind the camera
this is a show floor comparison of moto
360 versus moto 360 second gen Motorola
broke the mold with the original 360
developing a simple SmartWatch with a
circular display and the cleaner casing
than most of the competition with the
second generation the company's goal was
to make the 360 better resemble a
traditional wristwatch than an accessory
for tech fans this is something we've
seen from other companies this year as
well the result is the added lugs at top
and bottom which initially I was quite
opposed to since almost every SmartWatch
has lugs of a similar design I thought
adding them took away some of the 360s
unique look and I still think that to a
degree but they also bring benefits
instead of having to use a tool to swap
out the bands as with the original moto
360 these can easily be changed with the
flip of a switch and without the weak
points at the corners in the new back
casing the glass should be less likely
to crack as it often did on the older
generation the design has also been
refined on the back cover overall which
is nice even if you don't see it all
that often as you may have already
noticed there's an even more major
Hardware change here the new Moto 360 is
offered in two sizes both the
traditional 46 millimeter diameter and a
minimized 42 millimeter variant it
doesn't sound like much of a difference
but in person the 42 millimeter offering
is substantially smaller and it also
accommodates narrower bands the bands
are newer colors of the existing Horine
leather and metallic offerings with a
wider style selection that you can
browse in moto maker each size offers
new color options and allows you to
localize those colorization x' to
different areas of the casing and you
can apply a textured finish to the bezel
now as well the varying sizes also mean
varying battery capacities over the
larger version of the second gen watch
and you'll be getting 25% more battery
you go over the smaller one and you're
taking a 6% reduction this is compared
to the first gen but then you're also
getting a smaller display so
it might even out speaking of display is
we're only talking to modest increase in
pixel density 13% going from the first
large watch to the second it's a 28
percent jump if you choose the smaller
watch and yeah the flat tire is still
here if you care about that kind of
thing and it's still IPS a little
disappointing if you wanted emmalin--
but look at the difference in available
brightness here and part of what made
the old Moto 360s display look a little
grainy and inferior I realize now is
it's dimness and the new hardware
corrects for that while also allowing
for an always-on ambient display mode to
turn it on and off you use the crown
button as before and it's been relocated
to the two o'clock position from 3
o'clock
are there other differences here totally
we could talk about little software
tweaks like the fact that the UI changes
color every time you charge it or the
performance improvements the new
Snapdragon 400 processor brings over the
old Texas Instruments OMAP but that's a
level of detail we'll save for the full
comparison later on in the meantime
what's new here on the show floor since
we first went hands-on with the new 360
is that I've warmed up to it quite a bit
it's not a ground-shaking reimagine
ation of the Moto 360 and to be honest
it might not be worth it's a $300 price
tag if what you're looking for is the
cheaper 150 dollar first gen model but
at this point it sure does look like a
pretty nice refresh and it does feel
better on the wrist we're on our last
day of coverage city for 2015 in Berlin
