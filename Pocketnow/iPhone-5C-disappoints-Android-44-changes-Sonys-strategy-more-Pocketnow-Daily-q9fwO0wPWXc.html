photos emerged sony smartphone strategy
seems to focus on anything the United
States an apple seems to not be happy
about their iphone 5c sales I'm hi Mary
meta and I'm skipping the beard jokes
today because I ran out of them about an
hour ago celebrating this is out
daily listeners day off with some
official news as those of you waiting
for some hot Xperia bones from Sony to
reach the United States well your wait
is over but not really for good reasons
Sony CEO just came on record to state
that they're staying away from the
United States in Chinese market for the
time being as they're focusing on making
the Sony smartphone brand popular in
Europe and other markets because the
United States and Chinese market seem to
be too complicated for Sony at the
moment which is you know I don't know I
don't know if it's a smart strategy or
not but or any of you actually looking
out for the Xperia z1 for example it was
a comment and if you're still wondering
exactly how many tablet-optimized
applications are there for android
tablets well as it turns out google's
gonna make it easier for you because
they've just launched a new section in
the google play store with
tablet-optimized apps which is awesome
considering how long it's taken Google
to get enough applications for this to
actually be worthy of showing still for
those of you that want that Twitter
application sadly that is still it
exclude them to the note 10.1 so anyways
speaking of Google we've got some leaked
photos of Android 4.4 KitKat running on
the Nexus 5 and to make it even more
interesting we get to learn about the
features that are coming in the
operating system apparently it'll be
easier to launch the camera from the
lock screen there is more integration to
NFC apparently for payments and you will
now be able to launch Google now without
necessarily gesturing anything just say
ok Google and apparently the phone will
respond and apparently there are some
other enhancements here and there though
it's obviously hard to tell exactly how
many are coming in the operating system
so please stay tuned and hopefully we
will be getting something in the next
coming days now let's talk about that
Nokia Lumia 2520 Windows tablet which we
finally get a press render of and yet it
looks like a bloated Lumia which is
actually good but even more interesting
we get some dates and pricing
apparently it'll be launched in
mid-november for verizon for five
hundred dollars yeah windows RT for five
hundred dollars again and then obviously
on the other hand apparently we will be
getting an AT&amp;amp;T variant that should
launch shortly after the verizon one for
the same price so five hundred dollars
for Windows RT tablet Microsoft you're
not really getting this are you and
finally for the interesting news of the
day it seems that Apple is not happy
with their performance at the iphone 5c
in sales according to some trusted
sources Apple was churning as many as
300,000 units a day during the first
days of launch and now that's obviously
dropped 150,000 units but that's
actually because they were expecting for
that drop and not really because they're
selling more bones so you know it's kind
of interesting apparently this source
also states that we will be seeing a
price crop in the iphone 5c soon because
of this which is you know interesting
but you know that leads me to the
question of the day would you buy the
iphone 5c of the price dropped in my
particular case honestly i feel that the
difference the price difference between
the 5s and 5c that hundred dollars was
too little to justify not going for the
5s and that's really what killed the 5c
so yeah price drop would be interesting
probably one hundred fifty dollars off
the current price unlocked obviously
probably free off contractor at least
450 bucks or something I don't know
rebates whatever but definitely that 5c
is not really worth what Apple is
selling it for so leave us a comment
what do you think friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news first
