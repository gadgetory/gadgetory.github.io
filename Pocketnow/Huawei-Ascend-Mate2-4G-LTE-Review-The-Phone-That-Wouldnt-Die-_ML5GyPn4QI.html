I've been using this smartphone for two
days straight
if you're an American this behemoth
is probably alien to you just like
pretty much every other smartphone from
this Chinese manufacturer can very long
battery life and a very low price tag
finally make the name Huawei mean
something to us buyers let's find out in
our video review of the ascend mate to
4G LTE yeah that's a mouthful of a title
but anything less would seem somehow
inadequate for a beast like this at 202
grams it masses more than almost any
other device in its class and its
footprint makes every other smartphone
look puny by comparison
what's more none of its hardware
features have been scaled up which
amplifies its perceived size the tiny
camera lens sits adrift in an endless
expanse of textured soft touch the
microUSB port looks infinitesimal on the
wide strip of glossy plastic along the
bottom one-handed use is basically
impossible still Huawei uses the extra
acreage to its advantage the device is
relatively slender for its size at nine
point five millimeters with a removable
cover that grants access to the microSD
card and SIM slot and the front side is
dominated by an IPS display that takes
up almost 80% of the face with nice
color saturation fair viewing angles and
a very bright backlight and like
everything else on the phone the screen
is huge at 6.1 inches
yet for all its size the ascend mate 2
is not so beastly on the spec sheet with
this phablet it's more size of the boat
than motion of the ocean the Snapdragon
600 is good but not top-of-the-line the
display is only 720p which had six
inches isn't the sharpest and both
onboard and extendable storage is on the
low side this isn't so much a flagship
smartphone as it is an oversized
mid-range er that's true in software too
with a slightly dated Android 4.3
sitting under Huawei's in motion UI
which is a mixed bag of course
aesthetics are subjective but to our eye
the rounded corners and bland colors
lend the phone and all
infantile feel there are typeface
spacing issues in folders and in
designing its widgets the company seems
to have forgotten that it's built a
six-inch phone here look at the FM radio
widget it's huge for no apparent reason
same for the clock which is so big it
can't even be centered on the screen and
this isn't hallways fault but so many
Android apps still can't properly take
advantage of a screen as large as this
on the brighter side the big canvas
doesn't totally go to waste
the Wow button sits in a corner of your
choosing giving you one touch access to
navigation keys and popover apps gesture
based motion controls are available and
so is an easy mode for those who want an
idiot-proof experience on a huge screen
there are also really nice touches here
and there anytime you get an alert from
a newly installed app the phone lets you
choose right in the notification shade
whether you want the app to be allowed
to send you notifications and there's
all kinds of optimization tools if
you're worried about what apps are using
too much data there's a whole section
for that a phone manager gives you
automatic cleanup for memory storage and
a block list for harassing messages or
calls but the most powerful
customization goes to the core of this
device the ascend mate 2 is all about
endurance
this phone guards its battery more
jealously than any other every so often
you'll get a notification that a certain
app is using too much juice you're given
the option to shut that app down right
away the power saving hub gives you
three distinct usage plans and also a
monitoring screen with a list of issues
you can optimize you'd expect all this
from a device with a tiny power pack but
with a 3900 milliamp hour reservoir this
phone is basically all battery to put
that in perspective it's basically the
same capacity as Google's Nexus 7 tablet
it's so big in fact that Huawei expects
you to spread the wealth plug in a micro
B cable and you can charge other devices
from your phone if instead you keep all
that power to yourself you'll be using
your phone for days with moderate to
heavy use including mobile hotspot and a
fair amount of Netflix we got 44 hours
of use in our first charge with
eight and a half hours of screen on time
that kind of endurance on a smartphone
is almost unheard of and the company
deserves real credit for that
achievement it set out to create a phone
that would last a weekend on a single
charge and even if its solution is
inelegant it succeeded elsewhere
performance is more middle-of-the-road
this version of the ascent mate - is
compatible with both AT&amp;amp;T mobile and
preloaded with those carriers APN it's
unlocked out of the box and our testing
on AT&amp;amp;T went well in Greater Boston and
New York City over both data and voice
connections it's mighty awkward talking
on a device as large as this though and
the noise cancellation is nothing
special so you won't miss much by opting
for a headset instead fortunately this
speakerphone though located back aft is
large and plenty loud for gaming which
gives us no trouble with most titles by
the way and also for media playback
though it's a touch softer with Netflix
finally there's that 13 megapixel 1080p
camera
we've got more samples and a video reel
in the full review at pocketnow.com but
this shooter is safely described as
average in good lighting and a little on
the noisy side when the lights not so
good the viewfinder is bare-bones but
you've got the usual offerings of HDR
panorama and a handful of effects and we
do like how the software senses night
shots and automatically brightens the
image though not enough to make this
devices stand out it's real set off is a
four centimeter macro mode which won't
blow your mind but it does let you get
closer to a subject than some other
phones to the camera up front is a 5
megapixel module with the wide-angle
lens for selfies or GRU fees a term
which will never catch on that describes
group selfies it's nothing we haven't
seen before but it works as advertised
we still have some concerns about the
assent made to 4G LTE concerns which go
beyond that lengthy brand name there's
no clear guarantee it'll ever get timely
software updates for one thing and
that's troubling also for just a little
more you could get a Nexus 5 with a more
powerful processor and the guarantee of
long-term support directly from google
but $299 unlocked and contract free the
ascend mate 2 is an outstanding value if
you're looking for a smartphone that can
double as a tablet and last for days on
a single charge while it's at it for
huawei it may not be the blockbuster
that'll stop Americans from wondering
who are they but it's a good step in
that direction be sure to read our full
written review linked in the description

mate 2 and check out our other giganto
