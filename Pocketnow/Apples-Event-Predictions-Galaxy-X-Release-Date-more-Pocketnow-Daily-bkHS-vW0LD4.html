names and major changes for existing
Apple products welcome just showed off
that it can reinvent wearables from a
new approach to the architecture and we
got confirmation that the one plus 60 is
going for an on display fingerprint
scanner I'm high metal Yvette I live
from San Francisco after the Qualcomm
Snapdragon wear 3100 was announced this
is parking out daily powered by qualcomm
the official news today begin with this
the fact that I was part of the Qualcomm
Snapdragon wear 3100 announcement in San
Francisco there are some very
interesting things being announced here
by the way the processor is somewhere in
there there's a new co processor inside
that allows three things that are
important the first one is that OMS can
now create their own sport profiles the
fact that battery can go up to 30 days
now if you only leave it in watch mode
and the reason why you would care about
that is because now the new watch mode
which is the third thing pretty much can
be activated all the time because again
it doesn't depend on the core processor
that allows for wear or us to run we'll
definitely be giving it a try and
letting you know how it goes
now let's talk about oneplus the company
has surprised everybody with the fact
that we are getting an on display
fingerprint scanner on the oneplus 60
and also it seems that we should set our
calendars for October 17 because
apparently this is when we're gonna get
the new one plus 60 you have no idea how
much I'm looking forward to the news
we'll see what happens at the end now
let's talk about iPhones and political
drama with Donald Trump as he recently
tweeted that if Apple wants to stop
complaining about tariffs in order to be
able to build iPhones in China and
import them to the United States that
the smartest thing to do is to actually
build the iPhones in the United States I
think Trump doesn't really understand
that that's not the only expense but
then again yeah it seems that that's the
only way for I don't know mobile
products to get less expensive we'll see
about that I'm not saying that it's a
it's a bad thing it's just anyways
there's a little it's a lot more
complicated now let's talk about Samsung
as the company CEO recently teased a
couple of things the first is that for
those of you that are looking for a
foldable display on your phone
apparently this is gonna be teased very
soon in the develop of conference
and then we should see the first product
at CES and also that the company wants
to focus on less expensive products
getting great flagship features so yeah
at the time when phones are getting more
expensive apparently Sammy wants to play
ball everywhere and finally the hot news
today I have to do with Apple Minh Chico
teasing what to expect for iPhones we've
got some crazy price tags that started
eight hundred bucks for the iPhone xc10
see that sounds crazy the ten as
apparently is the other name for a
thousand dollars or more and then
obviously the 10s plus or whatever that
thing is going to be called the more
important is what else we're getting
seems that Apple watches are going full
ceramic and we're so close to the event
that makes sense that this could be
probably happening in addition iPad pro
is now going full USBC and the 12 inch
macbook that's going to be announced it
apparently is going to be a pro but it's
know in the comments what do you think
is there any of these products that
entices you for me again it's ipad pro's
that's what i like the most but leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion you know one of the least
appealing issues with existing
smartwatches is that they don't look
like watches at all they're always off
the new Qualcomm Snapdragon wear 3100
platform brings a new architecture that
allows enhanced ambient mode this means
your screen is always on without
worrying about your battery life and
without sacrificing the aesthetics of
the watch phase follow the link in the
description below to learn more about
why it is so cool friends again if you
want to get the news earlier follow us
on packing out are kind of descriptive
both our channels English and Spanish
for more videos like this one and follow
me on Twitter Jaime underscore to get
our on Instagram and hyemi better please
give this video a thumbs up if you like
what you saw I'm Jaime metairie that I
think so much for watching we'll see you
