Android is affecting the iphone's growth
when those phone 8.1 improvements get
fully detailed which include developer
interaction and the obama administration
isn't happy at all with Samsung's recent
selfie I'm high memory that I and given
the fact that it's Friday but I don't
mind doing selfies with anybody samsung
but not for free this is pocket now
daily let's go stay off with some
official news as one thing that has not
taken off his wireless charging if you
think about the fact that you have to
buy a separate accessory for something
that you already get an accessory for
that it's kind of odd but Nokia thinks
that they should push the way this is
going to happen so they are going to
bundle wireless charging ports as of the
Lumia 930 you can expect that for free
and hopefully they do that with future
flagships and other OEMs do it as well
for it to become ubiquitous now let's
talk about Windows Phone 8.1 is more
details emerged as we now learn that for
example applications will back up their
data on one drive which is awesome
that's probably one of the coolest
features that's coming but even cooler
is the fact that now developers will be
able to respond to your feedback when
ever you don't like something in an
application oh that's directly and it
doesn't hinder apps but anyways we get
more details like the description they
are a lot so I can't mention them on the
video that's how about HTC is very
interesting we get more reports that the
company is now working on a new
butterfly device which is the last
verizon droid that we saw really
interesting as apparently this phone
will not bring an ultrapixel camera
apparently we're getting a 13 megapixel
camera on this phone which makes you
wonder what exactly is HTC doing with
giving lower tiered or not so important
phones the cameras and then you get the
ultrapixel camera that everybody hates
on the One m8 so we should expect this
phone to launch soon though we don't get
any details yet let's go strip here for
full details on specs now as the trial
of apple vs samsung continues where the
coolest things is that you get internal
documentation and emails and one very
interesting one is the apple sales team
manifesting that they were extremely
worried about android specifically
because you get larger displays and
expandable storage and a lot of stuff
you don't get on the iphone and
according to the sales team they're
extremely worried on the iPhones
performance in the future as the
has sold better year-over-year
quarter-over-quarter but that doesn't
mean that it hasn't or will not find
better competition going forward so
winter sugar for the full story on what
to expect from this trial as it gets
hotter and hotter by the minute and
finally for the very interesting and
dramatic news of the day the Obama
administration seems to be upset over
the recent Samsung selfie that was
silently a selfie as a Red Sox players
IV thought these are fine David Ortiz
recently asked President Obama for a
selfie as the Red Sox were getting
commemorated over the fact that they won
the World Series and President Obama
said yes but eventually he figured out
the fact that what these was being
sponsored by Samsung now what these are
nice that Samsung asked him to do the
selfie but still he got the tweets and
everything but that is a question of the
day what do you think about Sam cigs
recents marketing with all this selfie
thing that happened at the Oscars and
now with the Obama picture in my
particular case hey if it'll get them
tweets it'll help them cell phones and
why not I think it's cool but anyways
leave us a comment down below and
hopefully Samsung will provide better
cameras for selfies right and friends

earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone it's a
little mushy follow us on parking out
