unboxing an iPhone hasn't really evolved
much since the days of the iPhone 6 from
the full white on the 6 to some color on
the 6s - a new approach now showing the
phones back with the iPhone 7 plus if
you watch Juan's unboxing video of the
iPhone 7 you pretty much got the full
scoop
I didn't even hold off on peeling off
the plastic since that would pretty much
just be repeating the obvious for
context purposes we've got the same
stuff here being a lightning cable a
wall charger literature that now
includes references the 3d touch and the
new home button and the new pair of
lightning air pods with a 3.5 millimeter
adapter the main story here is the
unapologetically large iPhone 7 plus in
its full glory this is actually my first
of two units and I chose gold because of
how fond I became of the gold Nexus 6p
it might just be me but at first glance
this tone of gold seems a bit more
subtle than last year's color which is
actually what I like the most the second
unit arriving and around the week or two
is the matte black variant for a
follow-up now one of the main reasons
why we chose two devices is because many
of you will order the starting-point 32
gigabyte variant I've never been able to
survive with base storage so we thought
the most objective way to review this
phone is to experiment life on base
storage by the way disclaimer the last
32 gigabyte iPhone I had was the iPhone
4 and iOS applications have become far
more complex over the last 6 years or so
the other experiment is that this is
actually the first time that I'm forced
to use the plus as my daily driver yes
I've had a few plus review units but
then I would fall back to the smaller
iPhone for ergonomics and the main
reason why I chose to go plus this year
is because of my disappointment with
battery life on other phablets in the
market which sadly apparently only a
positive story with the plus variants of
the iPhone and I say apparently because
our review period has just gotten
started our 24 hours video will be live
tomorrow and we'd love to know what else
