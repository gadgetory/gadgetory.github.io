ago and before we bore you with a full
edition of Google of the bargain out
daily let's just talk about it
separately I'm high- a tie with pocket
now and these are our first impressions
of everything we considered hot from
google i/o
google i/o was kicked off by the company
CEO sundar Pichai and it was rather
interesting to hear about the company's
history 17 years ago 300 million people
were connected through computers now
it's 30 billion people out of which
fifty percent of these come from mobile
twenty percent of the search securities
come from voice and that was the perfect
segue to the hottest news today and I
know it's odd for me to start with that
but everything else wouldn't make sense
it was google assistant mainly the fact
that this is actually for the first time
a true assistant somebody or should i
say something you can actually have a
conversation with you get asked
different questions it could interact
with you it has full context of where
you are what you're asking about and
search purities you've done in the past
it's actually in a way your own google
as sundar mentioned that at the event
it's something that actually is tailored
to you probably the coolest thing about
this is that it's not limited to just
search queries it's limited to a ton of
things and obviously it's a work in
progress sarah tells you it's at the
divil assistant but this is ten times
bigger than Cirie we don't even know how
Apple plans to compete with this this is
probably the best way that an assistant
should have been approached from the
start but obviously the technology was
in there and we can't wait to see what
we get later this year now even though
we didn't have many expectations for the
whole internet of things and googled the
company is planning to take over your
home they were actually candid enough to
say that Amazon pioneered this with the
echo and now they came up with Google
home it's a speaker it can actually play
music for you true but this speaker uses
the google assistant to be able to be
useful to you so for example if you want
to control the speakers in one specific
room or in all your rooms you can do so
through google cast if you want to watch
a specific video on a specific
television you can do so through google
cast if you want to ask it questions
about your schedule or whatever you want
depending on whatever you offer control
for you could pretty much use google
home to be able to do this and obviously
you can set up as many as you want it is
a very interesting product we obviously
don't know a price tag we don't know
will be launched but it's definitely
something that would make you want to
not just by Google home but to have
chromecast on all your TV's chromecast
Audio and all your speakers and just
have everything connected in a very
convenient way and yeah believe it or
not Google just launched another
messaging service it's called google
allo it's supposed to compete in the
certain degree with whatsapp you connect
it through your phone number but it's
got some added benefits like for example
the fact that it focuses on your
expression like for example you can add
different sizes to text in order to
imply that you're shouting or whispering
you can also use google assistant with
smart replies for example you're leaving
the sub well you can't really text at
the moment it's smart enough to detect
what photos have been sent through the
conversations it's smart enough to
detect smarter ways to respond to
whatever is within the conversation it's
really smart you can use Google
assistant in addition to that to be able
to book movie tickets open table
reservations it seems extremely
promising mainly because of that Google
assistant connection we can't wait to
see what we get there but Google duo is
the other application it's pretty much a
FaceTime competitor but smarter it's got
this knock knock feature that actually
allows you to see people that are trying
to connect with you just to add a little
more anticipation to the video call
looks really nice it was also designed
for lower bandwidth and it's smart
enough to adapt to it let's just see if
that actually works now let's move the
spotlight over to android starting with
Android wear 2.0 it's a major change
it's coming later this year the whole
idea here is that third-party
applications will now be able to be
native for the operating system in
addition these third-party applications
will be able to add information to your
watch phase you want your fitness data
everything sort of like complications on
the Apple watch only this seems to work
better there's also some added
additional benefits with for example
fitness addition to communications you
now get a keyboard for messaging etc it
seems very promising but another major
deal was made about Android VR the fact
that Android and smartphones will be
optimized for VR
the fact that there will also be
standalone VR headsets with the
inclusion of a controller that can track
where ever you're pointing at the fact
that you now don't need to exit the VR
environment you have access to a full
version of the google play store with
envy are to be able to communicate
applications will be enhanced for VR and
content will also be enhanced for BR in
a very cool way again other things that
we cannot wait to see with Android in
obviously one of the hottest news for us
today was Android and Google even
explain why it launched it early for
developers there were so many changes
that the company needed to offer it for
developers early and that's great we see
support for Vulcan for gaming which is
great file based encryption as well but
Android n is mainly about productivity
mainly about making the life experience
better for the user when interacting
with Android starting with multi window
support picture and picture support even
though apparently that's only coming to
Android TV which is weird but yeah you
can now even the correct whatever you
want to receive and notifications from
the notification tray and just a lot of
different little things like for example
being able to switch between
applications from the multitasking
button quickly just double tap it and it
will switch you around obviously Multi
Windows support is what we care about
most and even though you think that this
looks a lot like marshmallow or lollipop
there is a lot of change within the
operating system to make it more
practical from the way it installs to
the fact that you don't have to wait
after you update the operating system
you know that Android updating window
apparently that's going away but anyways
there is a lot to look forward to we can
not wait to show it to you right now
that the full beta is available but hey
it leads me to the question of this
video what was your favorite
announcement at Google i/o today where
are you looking forward to the most I'm
not gonna lie to you for me it's google
assistant I feel that Google just pretty
much shot Siri they just pretty much
destroyed everything that Apple started
with Siri and just taught Apple how
digital assistants should be but
obviously we have to try it out leave us
a comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion
