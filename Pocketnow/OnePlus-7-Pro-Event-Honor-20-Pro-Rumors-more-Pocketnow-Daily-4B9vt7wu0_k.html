confirmed for an event to happen very
soon and we've got rumors on
specifications rumors on the honor 20
keep getting strong as we might seem to
get another camera monster here and it
seems that iPads might be able to
support mouse input very soon but not in
the way you think I'm Jaime Rivera and
well I've spent all day assuming that
it's Friday and that's dangerous when
it's barely Tuesday this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
Sprint and AT&amp;amp;T and the fact that both
companies have reached the settlement
over Sprint's lawsuit about AT&amp;amp;T
providing misleading advertisement with
5ge turns out we don't know if there was
any sort of monetary agreement here what
we do know is that AT&amp;amp;T will continue
using that 5g evolution as they call
this the first step to 5g because
they're letting consumers know and what
areas there is the first step which is
such an irony because I've got 5ge on my
AT&amp;amp;T SIM card and my data speeds here
are trash and obviously because there is
a certain drama when it comes to one of
the foldables that just got launched
which I'm about to return the biggest
question is what will happen to the mate
X will there be delays according to
trusted sources no Huawei is still on
track to launch the mate X in June we'd
have no specific sets to win but that's
gonna be rather interesting as we do
hear that the galaxy full is going to be
delayed a couple of weeks but if you do
the math of a couple of weeks that's
gonna be before June so let's see how
that plays out now let's talk about
iPads and the fact that Apple wants you
to believe the Beast Pro devices are
good to replace a computer so certain
degree for more most people they are the
problem is the interface obviously you
have to be touching the display for
certain things and so we've got rumors
that Apple is apparently working on
having Mouse support on iOS but the
funny part is it's not a wireless mouse
apparently it's USB mouse and it's
mainly as an accessibility option which
you wonder exactly what Apple is doing
here but stay tuned we'll see how that
goes
now let's move the spotlight over to the
honor 20 as we're expecting an event
in May and we've been covering some
rumors over the reasons why this phone
matters particularly the fact that this
is apparently a p30 Pro in almost every
way except the price tag apparently
we're gonna get the same cameras 48
megapixels 20 and 8 apparently we're
getting the care 980 processor in
addition to a good display the
differences are mainly going to be that
instead of four cameras you get three
and apparently there will be a pro
variant of the honor 20 and a regular
variant whatever the case may be
obviously we are going to be covering
this live we are really looking forward
to this launch we'll see what we get in
the end
and finally the hottest news today have
to do with the oneplus and the fact that
precedent ation has already been sent
out for an event to happen here in New
York on May 14th and the event doesn't
hold anything one plus seven throw or
get ready for seven and fast and smooth
and all the slogans I mean we pretty
much had Peter Lau the other day on
record stating that yes that we would be
getting a device that was more expensive
with higher specifications and then
apparently there would be a lesser
variant or
either whatever the case may be let us
know in the comments down below I mean
what do you think one plus seven Pro
would you be willing to pay more money
for a more powerful one plus device or
would you still go for the you know the
one that's still powerful if they
launched the second variant that's
probably not as fancy looking but you
know what I mean
because in my case I think that I would
trust oneplus to go a little higher on
specs and pay a little more money and I
would love the fact that there is still
the option to go cheap but that's just
me leave us a comment down below we'd
love to know your opinion friends again
