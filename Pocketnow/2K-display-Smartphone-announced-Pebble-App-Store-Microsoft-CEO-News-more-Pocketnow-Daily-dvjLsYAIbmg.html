got announced today Microsoft seems to
plan to announce their CEO until next
year and if you're wearing a pebble
smartwatch things might get even better
very soon I'm hi Mary vet I and yeah I
told Microsoft to wait until next year
I'm not available right now I have to
film these videos but this is pocket now
daily let's search the office of
official news as those of you that
thought the 2k displays we're not going
to happen this year well think again we
have the vivo xPlay 3s smartphone for
China which sports a 2k display and some
very awesome specification snapdragon
800 processor 3 gigs of RAM aside from
the fact that it also has a 13 megapixel
camera and a fingerprint scanner and to
make matters even better it costs only
five hundred eighty bucks unlocked and
even though we won't see this phone here
soon apparently it will be available for
CES 2014 so stay tuned for that will
definitely be looking out for it and
speaking of 2k displays a company that
was planning to be the first company to
bring the first smartphone with the 2k
display and is actually late as meizu
we've been waiting for that phone for
quite a while and as it turns out the
company has just announced that they are
planning to move into the US market
apparently they're going to be using CES
2014 as their platform to announce their
products so it's great to see that there
is more competition and it's great to
see that will probably get a lot more
innovation than just from the current
big tiered companies that we already
know so let's see how that goes CES 2014
will definitely be interesting now let's
talk about Microsoft as the company has
finally announced Xbox video for Windows
Phone this is something that a lot of
people have been waiting for you will
now be able to access your movies from
your xbox library to your phone
something long overdue but the problem
is that currently you're limited you
can't really access HD content well you
can't access HD content you just can't
really see it in HD which is odd since
most Windows phones right now have a
720p display but anyway stay tuned this
will probably get better and hopefully
we will be getting more storage options
for feature Windows Phone since 16 gigs
for a movie is too little now let's talk
about Microsoft does the company has
just laid it flat we're not getting a
CEO announcement until next year and
this is kind of obvious i mean we're at
the holiday season the company is pretty
much wrapping up the end of the year and
obviously the new CEO will want to start
fresh with a new
year bully hopefully we'll be getting
this announcement probably at CES room w
see we don't really know it most
probably a microsoft event of its own
but it's definitely clear that we're
gonna have to be waiting in let's just
hope they call me up soon I mean I'm
still kind of waiting and finally for
the hot news of the day those of you
have been wearing a pebble smartwatch is
the beginning of time which would be a
couple of days for me the company has
just announced that they will be
launching an app store which will bring
free content initially and then
eventually they will be bringing paid
content though obviously they're working
with developers on the pricing scheme
and it kind of carries us to how they're
planning to do that with the limited
storage that's available on the pebble
but anyways that Lisa the question of
the day if you haven't bought a
SmartWatch yet what an app store make
you want to buy a SmartWatch is that
really something that you're looking for
in my particular case i bought a
SmartWatch because i needed a watch and
it didn't make sense to not go spartans
they're already available but leave us a
comment down below honestly for me an
app store is not really that relevant
yet but let's see what they bring and
friends you know the drill if you want
to get the news earlier before this
video is spell retreat follow us on
parking our comment subscribe to our
youtube channel as well you'll also
follow me on twitter Jaime underscore
iveta please give this video thumbs up
if you liked what you saw I am hi Mary
better thank you very much for watching
we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
