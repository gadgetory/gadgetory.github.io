new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
I'm sure there's some follow-up coverage
but after that initial blast almost no
one revisits the device to see how well
it's aged because we're all on to the
next big thing already so let's do
something about it let's have a look at
a device after a couple of weeks after
release and what it's not shiny and new
anymore
I'm high memory that I will pocket now
this is the LG g3 and this is episode 39
of after the buzz
it's been more than three months since
we last reviewed the LG g3 and at times
when Apple has decided to go big on
smartphones we're sure you're already
starting to wonder if the g3 is worth
considering after the buzz quick answer
would be absolutely and let me tell you
why that is if your respect head you've
probably already noticed that even with
the recent smartphone launches we've
seen none have surpassed the g3 and
anything this is still one of the few
smartphones in the market that offers a
complete non compromise experience for
the same price as the rest of its
competitors where competitors are still
doing 1080p displays the g3 does quad HD
where competitors are leaving out turn
features the g3 makes everything
expandable now if you're not a spec head
like me for example you'll notice LG's
attention to detail with its hardware as
was the LG g2 that I loved last year
this device is a phablet that doesn't
feel like a phablet nor was it priced
like a phablet the bezels are so small
here that you don't really feel like if
you're holding a 5.5 inch display and on
that note and gorgeous display as well
sure it is quad HD but even if you
wouldn't notice pixels on a 1080p
counterpart the color reproduction and
viewing angles are amazing even though
it's not as bright in direct sunlight
it doesn't feel a solidus last year's g2
but it is less slippery to the touch and
it is less of a fingerprint magnet with
its brushed aluminum finish even though
well that's faux aluminum finish it also
handles dents better than most phones
that I've used making it look like new
even after so many months of use overall
if you're a spec obsessed or simply in
search for a non compromise experience
for your money look no further than g3
is a great option benefits don't end
with the hardware though as there is a
lot to say about the software after
three months of use last year I
recommended that you swap LG's
overbearing user experience with a
third-party launcher but this year
things have changed then for the better
LG not only decided to go for a more
minimalistic design but it decided to do
so without leaving its roots and giving
you the most customizable Android
experience I've ever seen for some of
you these may be gimmicks but for
they're not in my opinion certain g3
features should come standard across
Android like multi window support or
customizable Android buttons or extra
spots for the dark for you to add more
applications and folders or even having
a button for the notification tray at
the bottom instead of having to reach
for the top or pressing and holding
settings tar goals to take you directly
to these settings I could go on into
more detail or what this phone can do
but I'd rather you take a look at
Michael or Taylor's review since we're
still running the same version of
Android here what's important is that
ever since I started using this phone I
haven't found anything significant to
complain yes you might notice that the
launcher redraws itself here and there
after you unlock the phone certain times
and yes the text for third-party
applications may look fuzzy because of
the 2k display but these are not really
deal-breakers for most of these the same
can be said about actively using the g3
over time I've loaded this phone with
everything but the kitchen sink and it
feels just as fast and responsive as
when I unboxed it
this particular AT&amp;amp;T variant comes with
three gigs of RAM and one thing that
I've noticed is that applications take
less time to refresh when you multitask
and that has to be because of the added
RAM this allows this phone to play any
game like a beast even when it needs to
push more pixels in the average
competitor pushing those pixels should
affect the battery life but just like I
admired the g2 for its battery
performance last year the g3 is just as
good if not better well the rents on
AT&amp;amp;T cell team that worker here in my
local HSPA+ network I've been able to
push through more than a day with a
single charge that network performance
has been just it's good for data speeds
as well and phone calls sound ok even
though callers that sometimes tell me I
sounded muffled depending on how I held
the phone now what was a true shocker
for me was the speaker I hated the
speakers on the g2 but the 1 watt
speaker is probably one of the best that
I've heard in the industry even if it's
backfiring that says a lot now the
optically stabilized camera at the back
is also good and notice I say good
not great compared to other cameras with
optical image stabilization but okay
during the day colors look accurate
which is really what matters but they
don't have that added top that most
competitors have I honestly prefer
accuracy and I also value speed for
taking a shot and that's where the g3
excels with that laser focus sadly I do
value low-light performance as well and
this is where the g3 shows that it's
just an OK camera last year's g2 did a
better job in this department but the g3
results look washed out and sometimes
reddish but the true tone flash included
doesn't prove these results which are
close enough though who wants to use a
flash right so bottom line what I still
recommend that you buy an LG g3 after
the buzz as I mentioned earlier the
answer is absolutely it's hard to find
the phone that's right for everybody
these days and I feel the g3 balances
this best if you're a speck head these
are the best specifications and if
you're not this phone also offers one of
the best Android experiences we've
tested this year once you match this
with the fact that you're buying a
phablet that doesn't feel like a monster
and at the price of a smaller flagship
and I don't think there's any room left
for discussion surely this is not an
aluminum phone like other competitors
but honestly who cares what really
matters is that it looks like new after
extensive use and that it performs well
after extensive use as well and this has
been proven today my congratulations to
LG for yet another successful story much
better than the g2 last year that's it
for episode 39 F after the buzz with the
LG g3 thank you very much for watching
