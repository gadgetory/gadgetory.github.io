pocket now calm the HTC hd2 has been a
tremendously popular device in fact it
sold out three times in the u.s. so HTC
a very smart company decided to make a
another version of this called the HD
Mini
it's basically a smaller more petite
version of the HD 2 but it still has
similar characteristics it's running on
Windows Mobile although it's windows
mobile 6.5 point 3 it's got a capacitive
multi-touch display and a very thin form
factor so we're going to take a look at
the HD 2 mini in an unboxing starting
now alright so let's unbox the HD Mini
and sorry in advance if you hear some
construction equipment right now they're
doing some work outside of my window so
let's get to the unboxing so here's the
box check this out it's a play off of
the HD 2 which has this sort of outline
of the device and it's trying to imply
that the HD Mini is like the HD 2 but of
course a lot smaller I'm very clever
there so let's take a look around the
box in order to look at the specs very
small box similar to all the newer HTC
devices with the slide down here and
let's zoom in on the specs and take a
look this is running a slower processor
than the HD 2 so it's got a 600
megahertz processor windows mobile 6.5
point three this is HTC's first Windows
Phone with this particular version of
the operating system it has 384
megabytes of RAM 512 megabytes of ROM
we're gonna do a direct comparison with
the HD 2 so you know exactly how they
stack up it has a smaller much smaller
3.2 inch display and it has a really
interesting resolution that we haven't
yet seen on Windows Mobile so its HVGA
which is 480 down and 320 across I'm
really curious to see how third-party
apps works with that and of course this
is not a u.s. 3G phone if you're using
this in the US you will only get edge
data so let's take a look at the tiny
hopefully tiny HD Mini alright let's put
this off to the side and look at the
battery it's yellow
the coolest parts about the HD Mini is
that HD SC designed the back battery
cover when you lift off the back battery
cover to be beautiful so we've got a
yellow battery here which is of size
twelve hundred million powers
decent size and let's see what else we
have on the packaging probably the usual
HDC stuff got the warranty quote pilot
live 15 days for free and it looks like
the usual stuff what is this this is
different
I'd have to take a look at this huh Wow
a new kind of plug from HTC I assume
that this will fit on this this plug
right here wow that's really really cool
this is a new plug from HTC very slender
it looks like you turn it check it out
awesome I like that and of course we
have the charging cable and the
headphones stuff that we've seen before
get this out of the way and take a look
at the HD Mini it is indeed very mini it
is much much much smaller than the HD 2
and there it is
let's take a look around the device
we've got a nice chrome strip up there
very nice touch a capacitive glass
touchscreen these buttons are completely
flat in the front very interesting fact
with these industrial-looking screws
let's take off the back battery cover
which actually comes off like you would
find on the palm pixi I'll show that in
a sec so I think you sort of peel it off
ok I figured it out there you start from
the top and check this back out it is
yellow awesome looking very very
impressive we typically don't see so
much fanfare back here but HTC wanted to
make the experience of looking at the
back battery cover as interesting as
looking at the front of the device
pretty cool so I put the battery in
there and the SIM card and all that and
talked about the device later it looks
like it pops in bottom first snaps in
and again this is just like the
pixee which has a similar case design
but of course it's ugly back there
pretty cool so let's take a look at the
HD mini next to its big big brother the
HD - not that much resemblance actually
where you see the similarities is the
the buttons down here are the same
although they're not raised on the HD
Mini the HD Mini is actually thicker
than the HD - and also on the back
we don't really see any similarities in
fact we don't get a flash on the HD Mini
and we get to see that larger HTC logo
HTC is going with a bigger louder brand
on their newer devices and you can
really tell the difference here feels
very petite in hand
reminds me of the HTC touch the original
touch let's take a look at it next to
other devices like the iPhone and let's
look at it next to advice like the HTC
Touch pro2 also known as the rhodium so
the HD Mini is in fact a mini we've got
a lot more coming up on this if you like
the video be sure to give us a thumbs up
and we'll be back soon the hardware tour
software tour and other parts of the
review that's it for now on the HD Mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
