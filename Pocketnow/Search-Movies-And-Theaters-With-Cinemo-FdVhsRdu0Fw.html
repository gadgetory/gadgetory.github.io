pacquiao calm and today I'm going to
show you a new program that will let you
select a movie in your area and the
program is called cinema and it is free
and i'll post a link on pacquiao calm as
to how to get this when i'm done with
this video so from the start page you
won't actually go to settings and you
need to select your zip code and the
cool thing about this is it gives you a
number pad so it's pretty easy to type
into so i'm just going to select my zip
code and it saved so from the movie tab
I can select any one of these movies and
the cool thing about it is is it has
flick scroll so that's a neat feature so
if I select Adventureland the first
thing you'll notice it says rated R and
the length of the movie it says one hour
and 46 minutes so if I select that it'll
give me even more information so i can
click on that neat thing is it also
gives you a picture of the movie
advertisement so it gives me the crates
rating which is a b-plus and the users
which is a as well as the theaters in
which is playing in my area another cool
feature about this is it gives you the
showtimes and contact information as
well as the address so i can just close
that and i can click on the theater tab
and this would give me the theaters in
my area and i'm not sure exactly how far
from the zip code that i put in but i
think it's about 10 miles so if i pick
winning one of these theaters it'll show
me which movies are playing at that
theater and that's pretty neat so I can
just click one and see which ones are
playing so the box office tab is pretty
neat because it will show me movies that
have been released within the past few
weeks the program is called cinema and
it is much easier to use than any web
search like if you were to use internet
explorer or opera to go to yahoo or
something in search for movies it's also
a lot faster than using live search for
the windows mobile program but
unfortunately this program only works in
the United States so for international
users I guess you're out of luck thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
