time it's got its crosshair set on
Windows Phone let's see how the two
flagships compare I'm Michael Fisher
this is PocketNow
and this is blackberry z10 versus Nokia
Lumia 920 we've already compared the new
BlackBerry 10 platform to Windows Phone
8 in an earlier video and we have much
more blackberry content at pocketnow.com
so follow us in the links in the
description below so you don't miss any
more for this comparison we'll be
looking at four broad categories
hardware software ecosystem and camera
diving right into the hardware the
differences are significant between
these flagships and blackberry was going
for thin and light with its z10 and
Nokia was definitely not the Lumia 920
is larger in almost every dimension most
notably it's ten point seven millimeters
thick to the z10 s nine millimeters the
Lumias added bulk is significant
especially since the 920 is 47 grams
heavier than the z10 we've talked before
about why the lumia 920 is such a tank
there's good reasons for it and it does
tend to make the windows phone feel more
substantial in a reassuring way but
there's no getting around it it is
definitely the bigger of the two devices
the design languages almost couldn't be
more different
blackberry z10 is an aggressive
collection of all most brutal sharp
right angles and a no-nonsense exterior
very reminiscent of products from the
Motorola Droid family the similarity to
the iPhone 5 is there but it's not as
pronounced in person as the z10 is
considerably larger than the Apple
device and it's much more rough in terms
of tone in short the z10 looks like it
means business which is probably what
blackberry was going for the Lumia 920
conveys an entirely different feeling
and not just because our demo unit here
is white rounded corners dominate the
hardware from edges to buttons to the
camera bezel the curved back even
carries a non-threatening nickname the
nokia smile the design language here
says piece of art that's also a smart
phone whereas the z10 conveys the exact
opposite message practical differences
abound as well the BlackBerry z10
features a room
1800 milliamp hour battery and 16 gigs
of on-board storage expandable up to 64
gigs additional with microSD the Lumias
2,000 milliamp hour battery and 32 gigs
of on-board storage are each bigger than
the blackberries but they're also non
removable and non expandable so it is a
less versatile device by the way we're
still doing endurance testing on the z10
but early indications show that
investing in a spare battery might be a
good idea as far as the heartbeat is
concerned both phones are running on a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor but
the BlackBerry packs 2 gigs of ram to
the Lumias single gig it also features a
micro HDMI port if you want more wires
in your life whereas the Lumia features
wireless charging ability if you want
fewer finally the display on the windows
phone is a 4.5 inch panel - the
blackberries 4.2 inches they're
identical in resolution so pixel density
is slightly higher on the blackberries
smaller screen but the BlackBerry screen
is also a tad dimmer than the Lumias and
it doesn't feature the Nokia's 60 Hertz
refresh rate otherwise the screens
deliver similar performance both indoors
and out but the BlackBerry doesn't
feature Gorilla Glass protections so
watch out for drops the profound
differences in hardware also carry over
to software as well we covered this in
our BlackBerry 10 versus Windows Phone 8
video from Toronto but in brief the
similarities on the lock screens don't
carry over to the OS blackberry 10 is a
highly gesture based OS with swipes in
and out hidden side and top panes and
even a gesture based unlock from the
home screen most significant is the
messaging experience probably the best
feature of blackberry 10 featuring an
integrated list of all notifications
from almost every app on the device
along with peak functionality that
allows you to check what kind of
messages are waiting for you without
leaving the app that you're currently in
and of course there's the spark of the
iconic flashing red blackberry light
Windows Phone navigation is similar with
the familiar scrolling and swiping but
there's very little gesture based input
that means the OS is simpler to use with
a less burdensome learning curve and
visually the modern UI design language
is much cleaner than black bear
is offering Windows Phones lack of a
unified Notification Center will annoy
you if you want an aggregated list of
what's new but if you prefer a
glanceable look at alerts without having
to jump into a hub Windows Phones live
tiles do that better it all depends on
your own workflow and style BlackBerry
edges out Windows Phone in terms of a
unified search typing a search term
shows every instance of that term on the
device and also lets a user jump out to
various internet search engines and
searchable apps as well most of that
functionality is available on Windows
Phone as well but in a very
compartmentalized experience searching
for people requires you to search the
People Hub searching for email happens
in the email app searching for an app
requires you to hop on over to the app
list pressing the spyglass key lets you
search online etc again it's just a
different way of doing things which one
you prefer is up to you personal
preference will also dictate what
keyboard you prefer we've always loved
the Windows Phone typing experience and
that's especially true on the luxurious
and spacious keyboard of the Lumia 920
its responsiveness is great and it's
autocorrect is outstanding but it's also
quite conventional blackberry by
contrast opts to save you time with a
different approach an aggressive
predictive text scheme that floats words
up under your fingers as you type right
under your fingertips it takes a lot of
getting used to and it's practically
useless in high-speed two-handed typing
but if you're pecking out a text with
one hand it's pretty handy and it's
quite responsive in its own right
speaking of responsiveness it's always
good to have a quick look at browser
performance while these devices are
almost on even footing in terms of raw
responsiveness scrolling and resolve is
pretty fluid on each the BlackBerry
offers additional support in terms of
Flash on heavy pages though like the
pocket now front page it does stumble a
bit more than the Windows Phone browser
and it needs to load for a bit longer
there's clearly some optimizations still
needed here speaking of optimization the
last point we'll touch on in software is
stability and here a windows phone
doesn't just take the cake it devours it
gives you the dirty plate and then runs
away
laughing blackberry 10 is a very
cool new platform but it's also very
young and we found many of the bugs
you'd expect from such a youthful device
everything from GPS not resolving to
data failing with a full signal to
strange minimized card views of the
screen to being unable to return to the
home screen at all taken together the
quirks of BlackBerry's new OS
significantly diminish the overall
experience we're sure they'll be
corrected shortly but for now Windows
Phone 8 definitely wins as far as
stability and reliability are concerned
both Windows Phone 8 and BlackBerry 10
launched without an excellent assortment
of apps but Windows Phone has had quite
a head start on growing its selection
while blackberry boasted 70,000 apps at
last week's unveiling many of these have
been ported from Android and the
experience is less than stellar the
nicely designed blackberry app world
does in fact have some big-name titles
with more coming but as of now they're
few and far between in their place are
knockoff titles often with poor review
scores Windows Phone might still be
fighting tooth nail for apps but it's
finally got some momentum behind it and
we're seeing a lot of big-name
developers bringing their titles to
Microsoft's platform that's further
augmented by Nokia's enhanced exclusive
apps for phones like the 920 which make
it even better when you consider the
hardware support for the Lumia line in
terms of wireless charging audio docks
and so on it's pretty obvious that the
incumbent Lumia 920 has the edge in
terms of ecosystem for now we'll have to
wait to see how quickly blackberry is
able to build momentum of its own though
before we pass judgment overall the
Lumia 920 has made a name for itself as
an excellent camera phone on the basis
of its 8.7 megapixel PureView camera
with optical image stabilization and
it's well earned the Lumia camera is one
of the best we've used on a smartphone
despite its occasional softness and
focus and it's somewhat bare-bones
viewfinder software the lenses offered
by Nokia and others really do a good job
of enhancing its aftermarket value as
well the BlackBerry z10 s camera is also
an 8 megapixel shooter with back side
illumination but it doesn't deliver the
depth or the sharpness that the 920 s
camera does in still shot comparisons
shots often come out darker and hazy ER
and of course there's no hardware image
stabilization to speak of it's not a bad
camera by any means it's just not in
this
league as Nokia's premium PureView
module we'll have video impressions
shortly ultimately if messaging is more
important to you than apps if you value
fluid multitasking and enhanced search
over glanceable information if you're
willing to slog through the bugs and
weirdness that characterizes a new OS
and you need the old-world enterprise
support only blackberry can provide the
z10 is a good choice for you if you
prefer a more established operating
system with a stronger ecosystem a rock
solid and stable interface backed up by
hardware that includes one of the best
smartphone cameras around the Lumia 920
will probably be a better fit
folks that's going to do it for our
BlackBerry z10 versus Nokia Lumia 920
comparison feel free to follow us in the

tuned for a full BlackBerry z10 review
coming in the days ahead and thanks for
watching we'll see you next time
