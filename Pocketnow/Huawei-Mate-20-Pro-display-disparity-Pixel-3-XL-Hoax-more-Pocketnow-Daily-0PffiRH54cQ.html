everybody I'm interrupting the PocketNow
daily just for a second to remind you
about the PocketNow weekly our podcast
hosted by yours truly and brought to you
by of course pocket now and
xda-developers
you can tune in every single week either
here on youtube live on fridays unless
otherwise stated or you can make sure to
be subscribed to the podcast using
whatever podcast application you like
tune in to hear the ramblings of people
like myself Jaime Rivera Jules Wong
Brandon Minutemen special guests and
maybe some of the podcasts might be done
in special places you can also get into
the conversations by using the hashtag
pn weekly over on twitter and on social
media so go ahead and fire up your
podcast app and join us on the weekly
that's it for me here I'm gonna go ahead
and pop it over back to Jaime wait at
leaks of the front panels of the may 20
and me Tony Pro that shows notches and
screen resolution looks like the Google
pixel 3 Excel leaks were just a hoax
according to some speculation and the
nokia Penta lens phone is back at it
again and now we hear the camera
features I'm high memory data and now
you won't have to joke about it it is
Friday but I can't celebrate as I've got
work and then we've got travel which is
awesome this is Fargo now daily so the
official dish that I have to do with
deals to a certain degree those of you
that want the galaxy note 9 and want the
dual sim variant or just let's even
forget about the case of the dual sim
because it's 859 bucks for all color
options and again it also has dual SIM
options now there is no word on this
eBay seller when it comes to warranties
we do see color options and definitely
it won't work on Sprint or Verizon or it
might because it's got the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 845 that's the case now let's
talk about that Penta lens Nokia as we
spent a long time in the bargain our
weekly today discussing the whole design
of the camera whether it's real or not
we hear that one of these cameras is
gonna blur things out the other one is
gonna do telephoto functions and for me
it just looks like the weirdest case of
design ever that I really doubt will
ever happen but then again I'm hoping I
am wrong because if they could pull out
the banana phone they could do this too
now let's talk about Apple when it comes
to iPhones we're so close to the event
that obviously rumors are
going to intensify we heard rumors of
the device gaining USBC and it will sort
of USBC to lightning you're still gonna
get Lightning charging but faster
charging through USB see to the adapter
at 18 watts that's all great but then
again technology's not gonna change
they're just keep in mind again it's
probably the best time to buy a new
iPhone if you're in the market swap has
got some really good deals are also for
those of you that currently have an
iPhone definitely the best time to list
your current device before the event to
get the best resale value can learn more
about that in the description now let's
talk about Google in a very interesting
turn of events as a Google is already
prepping for its event that's now
official for October 9th
we are definitely hoping that we can be
there covering it live but it's
interesting that apparently the company
reached out to another channel front
page tech I loved their work and well he
reached out to get certain to access the
footage that would mock up the pixel of
the design that we've seen leaked and so
it turns into this conspiracy theory
over the fact that we just went through
the whole mission impossible thing in
Russia now apparently this probably
points out to the fact that if they want
footage that marks the design of the
pixels it's because it's probably a hoax
hard to predict we're still close to the
event we'll see how that involves and
finally the hot news today have to do
with the Huawei made 20 May 2000 Ventus
on the 16th that is official as well in
October we are definitely going to be
covering that but if you remember for
the launch of the May 10 we were sort of
disappointed with the May 10 having a
better screen than the May 10 Pro so now
we hear cases like for example that
we're gonna get the May 20 ma 20 Pro
with a better display on the May 20 Pro
but a larger knotch and we still don't
know exactly why there's going to be a
larger not could it be that we've got
better facial recognition whatever the
case may be let us know in the comments
what you think look at the leaks of the
panels let us know do you like the
design of that tear drop on the regular
May 20 is that larger not going to pull
you away from the May 20 Pro because in
my case and
I honestly at this point I really don't
care leave us a comment down below we
would love to know your opinion friends
again if you want to get the news
earlier follow us I'm talking out on
comment subscribe to both of our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one you follow me on
twitter hi managers go to get on
instagram at high meta meta please give
