new features to expect we also get some
photos of a possible nokia SmartWatch
and leek design mockup show LG's
flexible smartphone I'm hi not any
better and I guess the thing for 2014 is
going to be phones that actually can't
sit flat on the table this is pocket out
daily let's start stay off with some
official and actually awesome news as a
cc is keeping their promise they are
launching Android 4.3 to the HTC One and
the Sprint customers are the first look
you wants to get it but still this shows
that HEC is getting their act together
when it comes to software and it also
means that they're also going to be
working on android 4.4 which is just
around the corner as well so get your
phone updated now sweetie of android 4.4
we've also got some leaked screenshots
of what to expect and first of all
aesthetically it looks a lot like jelly
bean so don't get your hopes up but
apparently we will be getting new
features for example focused on payments
also America support built-in and even
printer support even though I don't
remember what was the last time I bought
a printer still we also get apparently a
dramatic overhaul in the camera UI
though it's still hard to know exactly
what we get as long as we get a better
camera in the future Nexus smartphone we
don't care so let's see what we get now
another company that's making headlines
along with Google is a sous as we've got
some more leak paperwork that confirms
that the company is going to be behind a
nexus 10 and not Samson this year that's
actually good I mean to transform our
lineup from masseuse is awesome and
hopefully we do get that keyboard dock
as well but not everything is good news
because we love the nexus 7 that we got
this year but it seems that we won't be
getting in a sous Nexus 7 next year as
the guitars is reporting that they're
having a lot of struggling with the
amount of tablets that they're actually
building so let's see how that goes as
well now if you thought that the only
company that was not building a
SmartWatch was Nokia well think again
we've got some leaked parts of a
possible SmartWatch since these parts do
not belong to a smartphone and as it
turns out it seems that this SmartWatch
will not have buttons anywhere so it
just seemed that this will be a very
interesting device somehow let's just
see what Nokia brings to the table is
obviously Microsoft is in to become a
more of a products company and obviously
Nokia is there
ticket to get there and finally for the
hot news of the day we've got some more
credible confirmation that LG's building
a smartphone with a flexible display but
we heard about the LG z line up and
apparently that's actually gonna happen
later that's going to be more of a
high-end line up apparently bind
November what we're getting is a G flex
smartphone and we've got some mock-ups
and everything which you know point to a
device that will keep the same
specifications of the g2 which is
actually great and only bring a curved
display but yeah this is just the curve
display and we've seen this on the Nexus
S of the Galaxy Nexus so you know that
leaves you to the question of the day
are you interested in a curved display
on a smartphone is that really a point
that you're looking for in your next
device you know in my particular case
back when I had the Galaxy Nexus even
then I didn't understand the ergonomics
behind it I would never stick the phone
to my face just to keep the face oils
away from the display and having to
clean it later so I really wouldn't buy
a phone just for a flexible display and
if you think about it I mean I hate
phones that wobble on a table I like for
devices to stay flat so leave us a
comment down below do you want a
flexible display or not friends is
always for an earlier scoop of
everything's happening in this one phone
and tell miss you follow us on
pocketnow.com and subscribe to youtube
