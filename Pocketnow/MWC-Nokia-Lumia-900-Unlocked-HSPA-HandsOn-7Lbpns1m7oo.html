parking out common we've got none other
than a nokia lumia 900 which is the
hspa+ version or europe that he'll
probably somehow be available in the
united states hopefully most probably
well vocus said this was an exclusive
for AT&amp;amp;T but you never know in the
future this is a flagship smartphone
it's got all the nine yards that you're
expecting from a Windows Phone 1.4
gigahertz volcom Snapdragon processor
we've also got 512 megabytes of RAM
we've got 16 gigabytes of on-board
storage although only 14.5 gigabytes our
user accessible it's the same nokia
lumia 900 that you already saw at CES
thank God nobody's pulling it from my
hand this time but hey looking at it
we've got it available in three colors
we've got the white bottle the black
model and the Zion model there is no
pink color for this phone for some
reason but so far it's a beautiful phone
front-facing video camera we've got the
speaker grill here we've got all the
accessories slots here obviously the
micro is the the micro USB sorry
connector got noise cancellation 3.5
millimeter headphone jack 8 megapixel
call sighs camera lens optics with a
flash gear volume up and down and then
we've got lower power
okay we've also got the camera button
here at the bottom the speaker grill
here and then we've got nothing on this
side so far the device is as snappy as
you'd expect it's a flagship phone in
every single way I mean
aside from the fact that it's got
everything that we're expecting from
Windows Phone obviously the iconic
design from nokia is skier i mean if we
would tell you which windows phone out
there is a good option for you to get
mango wise hey I definitely say that the
Lumia 900 is the way to go if you're not
on AT&amp;amp;T and you want to get this Lumia
900 this is a great phone what's it
going to be priced at
for 80 euros here in Europe that's going
to be six hundred and something dollars
almost seven hundred dollars if you want
to get an hspa+ version of this phone
it's available it's going to be
available soon so again this is high
memory better from parking out calm
nokia lumia 900 probably your next
smartphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
