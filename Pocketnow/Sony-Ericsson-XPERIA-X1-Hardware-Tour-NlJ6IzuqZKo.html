pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour for the sony ericsson xperia x1 now
the x1 will come in a few different
variants this is the x1 I meaning that
it has 3g bands for AT&amp;amp;T in the United
States so I took my AT&amp;amp;T sim card put it
in the device configure itself and
within a few moments i was using AT&amp;amp;T s
3g hsdpa network so let's take a look at
the device to start its a mix of metal
and plastic which is really nice to see
we have brushed metal on the front if we
look closer in at the top we have an
ambient light sensor and we have over
here and we have over here a
front-facing video camera if we go to
the bottom we have a few different
buttons so right here is the sony
ericsson xperia panel button and we'll
talk more about that in another review
we have a call start button and a left
softkey to the right of that we've a
call end key an ok button and a right
softkey now unfortunately we don't have
a start menu button which is very
important if you're using it with one
hand here in the center we have an
optical joystick which you can use kind
of like the epics and the samsung epix
and the samsung omnia although it
doesn't have a cursor it allows you to
swipe your finger to the side to move to
the right or if you're on a long web
page or if you're on a list you can kind
of move your finger like this but you
also have the option of the standard
d-pad surrounding the optical joystick
here so that's really great on this side
of the device we have the mini USB port
which is used for syncing and charging
sliding over to the right we have the
speaker we turn over to the bottom we
have the lanyard loop on the other side
we have the camera button pressing it
lightly one time will focus the camera
pressing it all the way down will take
the picture I've been over to the right
we have a volume up and down rocker on
the top we have the standby button and a
3.5 millimeter headphone jack which is
really great ok let's take a look at the
back the back is covered with also a
piece of metal the brushed metal which
looks terrific up at the top here we
have a flash for the camera which is 3.2
megapixels let's take off the back
because that is where
the micro SD card slot is hiding here it
is unfortunately it's under the battery
cover but it's easy to get to the
battery is 1,500 milliamp hours which is
a pretty good size and should give us a
decent amount of battery life ok let's
take a look at the keyboard the keyboard
is spring assisted it has that arc
slider design to give you a better
viewing angle although the angle is just
slight a few degrees let's take a look
at the keyboard close up the keyboard is
a four row keyboard it's not like the
touch pro which has a dedicated number
row right at the top the numbers are
embedded in the letter so if you want to
access them you have to press the blue
button here and then the numbers like so
the spacebar is super oversized it's
it's the width of five keys i'm curious
as to why they did this the keys are
kind of flat although they have a little
bit of a ridge on them if you can see
that to help you feel for them so far
I've found this keyboard to be as easy
to type on as the HTC touch pro it's not
amazing but it's definitely pretty good
and then we have a start menu button
here for quick access to that on the
bottom right corner we have an ok button
and that's pretty much it in terms of
buttons for usability we don't have a
right or left softkey so let's talk
about the screen it's three inches
diagonal and the resolution is wvga so
that's 800 down and 480 across that's
the maximum or allowed by Windows Mobile
much higher than any other phone out
there including the iphone the screen is
not flush and some people were
complaining about that though the first
thing I noticed about the screen when I
turned it on was that it had a really
high sensitivity and I think it not
being flush has something to do with
that because the layers that need to
press upon each other to register a
screen press are now closer together
because it is recessed another good
thing about the screen is that it has a
nice ledge on the right side so that if
you're if you're moving scroll bars or
you're trying to grab a scroll bar with
your finger you can rest your finger
against the ledge and easily find the
edge of the screen so that's it for the
hardware tour on the sony ericsson
xperia x1 next up we're going to talk
about the panels i know a lot of people
have questions on how they work and what
they actually do
