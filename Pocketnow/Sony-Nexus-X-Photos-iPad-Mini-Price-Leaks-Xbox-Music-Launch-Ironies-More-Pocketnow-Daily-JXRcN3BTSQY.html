ipad mini pricing gets leaked an Xbox
music goes live tomorrow though not for
everybody you think I'm high metal
Ravana extremely relieved with these
Sony Nexus leaks and this is fucking out
daily yes believe it or not at the sea
massive Google listens to complaints the
first photos of the Sony NEX is X have
just been leaked and X will most likely
stand for xperia it looks nothing like
the current generation Galaxy Nexus or
the LG Nexus 4 that's Malik but that's
actually a good thing we don't know
anything about specs but it's great to
see that there will be one more phone in
the Nexus program hopefully I just
wonder why that back looks a lot like
mega made remember spaceballs now the
ipad mini pricing has just been leaked
in some store retail information and it
ranges from 250 bucks to 650 the
interesting note here is that there are
four different variants for the Wi-Fi
model and another four different
variants for the cellular model which we
still can't make up its LTE or not now
the sad part here is that that
entry-level device starts at eight
gigabytes which is disgusting but again
these are just leaks and spring which
makes for the United States
third-largest carrier was recently
purchased by Japanese company softbank
for staggering 20 point 1 billion
dollars in 90 pocket change this gives
the company seventy percent control over
sprint though we still don't know how
that will benefit you as a customer
obviously we'll know more about that by
late 2013 so we'll keep you posted and
yes we go hands on the lg optimus G
variant for AT&amp;amp;T which honestly makes me
change my mind about LG if you watch
Michaels unboxing you'll notice the
device is really stunning on video so
make sure you hit the link watch the
unboxing and there's more coverage
coming up so leave us a comment in case
there any specific tests or comparisons
that you'd like to see and finally for
the contradictory news of the day
Microsoft is releasing Xbox music to the
public tomorrow it'll obviously work on
the xbox 360 Windows Phone 8 and Windows
8 you'll get a subscription-based
service for a fee you can also get ad
buy subscriptions on Windows and you'll
also get a pay by SARM service now get
this there's an ios and android client
coming later this year but no if you're
a
those customer for Windows 7 or Windows
Phone 7 customer you won't get access to
the service you're stuck on zune and
that leads me to the question of the day
how do you windows phone 7 or Windows 7
customer feel about this how can be that
iOS customers and Android customers are
getting it but current windows customers
don't leave us a comment down below now
if you want an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and tablet world make sure
you follow us on pocketnow.com please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm prying that'll be
better thanks for watching
