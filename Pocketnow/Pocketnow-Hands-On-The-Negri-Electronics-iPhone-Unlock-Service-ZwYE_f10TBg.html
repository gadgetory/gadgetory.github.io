carrier unlock for any iPhone on any
carrier stick around for our next pocket
now hands on it's been almost six months
since the last time the dev team was
able to unlock any other base band after
the release of iOS 4.1 on devices like
the iPhone 4 so the question is if you
have an iPhone 4 are you going to be
able to unlock it or not well I'm home
it'll be better and we're going to talk
about our video hands-on for pocket now
working on the grill electronics new
unlock solution through email which is
the same way you unlock pretty much any
other feature phone blackberry in the
market so stick around and we'll show
you how it works because yes it does
work so the honest with you this is
practically the easiest way to unlock
your phone ever all you have to do is go
into the Makri electronics website
purchase a service four hundred and
seventy-five bucks and then follow the
instructions at the bottom to get the
email for them and send it to them 24
hours later you get an email from them
with the confirmation that your iphone
is unlocked then it gives you
instructions to connect to itunes now
you'll notice that my device is
currently locked on their iOS 4.3 point
one and it's currently an AT&amp;amp;T device
that's on baseband 02 1004 it's the old
baseband because i use the punch to a
jailbreak so i'm closing in to show you
that this is an ATT purchase device and
well I just follow instructions I just
connect to itunes after I get the email
and it's supposed to unlock the device
just like it unlocks the factory
unlocked devices from the UK or Canada
so voila the device is unlocked as you
can see it's as simple as that now we're
going back to my device and you'll
notice that we already have another
carrier at the top and if we go to a
value see it's the same device iOS 4.3
point 1 the same base vando to 1004 and
if they're having signal issues that
usually has to do with jailbreak
jailbroken devices so my advice to you
is first try to reset your network
settings and see if that works and that
doesn't work like in my case my advice
to you is just remove the jailbreak
restore your device to factory settings
and it's a little tricky of your using
the punished or snowbreeze so i do
promise i'll upload another video to
show you how to get that done but for
now you'll notice we're going back to my
device it's already been restored we
already have the new carrier
the top of the signal bars working at
its iOS 4.3 point 1 it's the new modem
firmware 04 1001 and the unlock was
permanent it is still there it does work
so the question now is is it worth the
money well 175 dollars may be a bit
pricey for many but if you think about
it it's really not a bad option first of
all what you have left is the way for
the Deaf team for another six months
with your iphone for being stuck and
then not figuring it out not nice second
of all you get the Gimme sim card
that'll cost you 75 bucks just one
hundred dollars off and you'll have to
be playing the rain dance with airplane
mode every time the device gets reset
not really convenient and you can also
get into trouble with that emergency
dialer your third option is that you
find an unlocked factory unlocked iphone
4 on ebay for as much as a thousand two
hundred dollars not cheap at all from
Canada or the UK and then your last
option is that you do what I do you look
for a subsidized device for two hundred
three hundred dollars or you can also
find those on ebay still locked but
they're still available there for 600 or
700 dollars depending on the capacity
and then you pay the $175 and you'll get
a factory unlock device that won't cost
you more than a thousand dollars in our
opinion the degree electronic service is
worth the money and it's worth the peace
of mind of having your factory unlocked
device forever so in our opinion we will
recommend it so thank you very much for
watching I'm hind that I better remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
