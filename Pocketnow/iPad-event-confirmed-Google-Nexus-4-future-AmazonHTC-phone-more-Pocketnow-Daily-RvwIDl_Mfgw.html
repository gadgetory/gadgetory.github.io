ipad event October 22nd northbridge talk
about the nexus for sticking around
another year as a budget variant an
Amazon and HTC seem to want to build
their own smartphone together I'm hi
Mary vera and let's just pray that this
is not the HTC second because the HTC
first was a really bad flop this is
pocket out daily let's first day off
with some interesting news as Microsoft
seems to be an expert at bashing their
own products a high level marketing
executive has just come on record to say
that he acknowledges why the surface RT
flopped according to him it was
confusing for people to detail the
difference between the surface on T in
the pro and therefore they didn't buy it
which is really not the reason the
reason why the surface RT flopped is
because it was trashed it was a terrible
product all together with a beautiful
design sadly that was the problem from a
software company which is such an irony
but still let's see how it fares with
the surface 2 and surface pro two of you
call it that way because obviously money
is going to be where their mouth is now
let's talk about Amazon and HTC and no I
don't have these two companies wrong
they are working together on building
their own smartphone and apparently the
project is so advanced that they already
have a working prototype out there
though we still don't know if this will
be more of an Amazon Kindle phone and
just the kindle phone or if this will be
like the HTC first where you could turn
off facebook home at some point whatever
happens whatever comes out of this
apparently this will not happen this
year sadly so stay tuned for the news
now let's talk about the google nexus 4
and i did not get the number wrong
apparently the company is working on
keeping this phone for another year and
making the nexus 5 the high-end model at
a steeper price and then the nexus for
the budget model the current two hundred
dollars that we currently find it which
is actually bad news because we can
understand what the whole idea is since
we already have the Google edition
phones that are crazy expensive so where
will the Nexus 5 fit in this equation
hopefully these reports are wrong and
fake because apparently the Nexus 5
what's being priced cheap so let's see
how that goes nokia is up nexus we've
got more reports of what to expect from
Nokia's event on october to
second it turns out we're not just
getting a phablet and the tablet and a
laptop probably the company is also
working on the Nokia guru or ruler or
whatever you want to call that thing and
this is a music player like the ipod yes
apparently Microsoft is back added
trying to figure out how to make the
zune work only with a different name and
a different company different branding
and obviously different Hardware even
though the zune was actually a beautiful
product so stay tuned and let's see what
happens on october twenty seconds even
though i think somebody's about to steal
their thunder and finally for the hot
news of the day we have press
invitations for apple's october twenty
second event and yes the dates match
note is event so now you understand
where I'm coming from with their tablet
large but as it turns out we are
expecting iPads at this event to be
exactly i've had five the ipad mini 2
and we are expecting the ipad 5 to look
like a bigger ipad mini with iron specs
and then we expect the ipad mini 2 to be
the same thing though we've got some
conflicting reports of a Retina Display
coming to the ipad mini 2 we'll see how
that goes but both products will
apparently have touch ID which is
interesting since the iphone 5c doesn't
so anyways that leads you to the
question of the day what are your
predictions for this ipad event what do
you think we'll be getting in my
particular case i do hope you know i do
hope that apple gets it that we want to
write the display on that ipad mini
because if not i am just going for the
ipad 5 for the convenience of the retina
display not really because I want that
bigger tablet but leave us a comment
