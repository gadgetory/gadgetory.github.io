should too
i'm joe levi with pocket now let's unbox
t-mobile's Kyocera hydro life our
friends over at t-mobile provided this
unit for us so we could kind of test it
out and show it to you there's a kind of
a look around the box barcodes all over
the place on this one
nice little velcro enclosure and some
marketing materials now this doesn't
have a real easy way to get into it so
we're gonna try and be as stealthy as we
can so in a nice plastic case you got
the phone we'll open that up there is
the phone we're gonna set that aside and
look at everything else that comes in
the package little piece of cardboard
there t-mobile SIM shows you how to
activate and there's a very crinkly
package of manuals some more manuals a
micro USB cable here isn't gonna come
out very easily not very rugged they're
just your standard cable I had to dig
all that out because that's the battery
that we're gonna put in here in just a
minute
that's all sealed up then of course our
charger and we'll get a reading on that
show you just how how much it is so
looking right down in here we can see
that this is DC 5 volt at 1500 milliamp
s-- or 1.5 amp so it should do a pretty
decent job charging
here's the device quick look around that
nothing on the side over here is that
for a Qualcomm 3G 4G branding and
printed into it no buttons kind of a
chamfered edge here that then blends
into the back the back is cracked open
just a little bit so we can get access
to the battery compartment a little
easier we've got our camera speaker
flash volume up/down buttons over there
down to the bottom we've got our mic
micro USB up at the top our power button
another mic and our headphone jack kind
of a nice plastic chrome around the
bezel and then the back is nice textured
and grippy I really like this so we
should see quite a bit of impact
resistance and well it's not gonna show
a lot of a lot of use up front we've got
our camera some branding no t-mobile
branding on the device ironically and
then our capacitive buttons down here on
the front let's go ahead and peel the
screen protector just like that and pop
the battery in there now we've got room
for our sim in here we've also got room
for a micro SD card stacked on top of it
and then the battery we're gonna go
ahead and put both of those in right now
alright so in fact there is a little
tray here you just stick your fingernail
in there and pull that out once that's
done you can your sim in it again this
is not a nano sim and from there just
slide it in and it clicks in place micro
SD card that's right on top no tray here
just line that up and it slides in no
click on it however but if you need to
get it back out it's just a nice little
tug with your fingernail because it
exposes that little ledge for you just
make sure it's all nice and even right
there across the top once that's done
we're going to put the battery in now
this is a two thousand milliamp hour
battery put that right in there it's got
a little pull tab here for you to get it
out in the future and then our rubber
gasket
that seals up around everything and put
that in backwards of the way that we
took it off and it snaps down in place
okay so you want to take a little bit of
time and make sure you get this all
seated properly I'll do that off camera
if you don't get us seated down real
good that you're not going to have that
waterproof rating that this device is
well-designed for so make sure you stay
tuned we'll keep you up to date with how
this goes on our Twitter feed throughout
the week and of course more information
in a video that we're going to follow up
with a little bit later on we're gonna
take the Kyocera hydro life through its
paces this week and let you know in an
upcoming video what the final results
are make sure you subscribe to our video
