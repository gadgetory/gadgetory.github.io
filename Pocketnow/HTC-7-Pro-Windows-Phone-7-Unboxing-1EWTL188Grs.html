calm i just got in HTC 7 pro right here
and it's still in a box so guess what
we're going to do okay first off let's
look at the box a little bit we've got a
nice full color picture of the phone
with this little peek of the keyboard
sliding out over here is nothing really
back has some stuff we got windows phone
logo you can see 7 pro up there so let's
look at what we have here you got one
gay hurts when it's phone 7 8 gigs of
this internal storage 512 ram 576 ram
blah blah blah through 16 inch screen
and european 3g beans and wrist is now
standard stuff okay so let's open this
careful not to cut yourself and how does
it open
so there we go there's the device pretty
good let's peel some of the soft all
right we'll just put that aside for now
how to get started little booklet that's
nice contact us quick guy warranty I
don't know what that is little HTC
sticker here's our USB I mean charging
port
we got and afters here headphones same
as usual earbuds in a clip and that
looks like the micro USB cable care
about those look at this real quick so
here's the device oh not only does it
spring slide open spring tilts to that
is very cool okay so obviously we want
to compare that to the touch pro touch
bar to rather and here we go breathe
similar screen size the seven pros a
little bit longer look at thickness the
Sun pro might be a little thinner their
keyboard the touch pro 2 has a pretty
amazing keyboard so hopefully they
brought some of that awesome keyboard
nest to the Sun pro looks like these
buttons a little flatter will check that
out soon I mean well let's compare a
little bit more with the size here's the
hd7 it sees similar design but uh
obviously the hd7 is bigger screen and
thinner
the back on that pretty nice and just
will show the n8
and I guess we'll look at the samsung
vibrant a lot thinner anyway that's our
unboxing of the HTC 7 pro stay tuned for
more that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
