but they put companies like ZTE into a
position to bring modern mobile
technology to the masses at affordable
prices I'm high as a human reporting for
pocket now and we're at CES 2016 taking
a look at the Grand X 3 and the avid
plus from CTE starting off with the more
budget minded of the two devices the
avid plus is a no frills product that
ZTE is targeting for first-time
smartphone users and its 5-inch 854 x
480 LCD display and 1.1 gigahertz
Snapdragon 210 SOC reflect that
positioning there's not much to it save
for a few small touches like Wi-Fi
calling and microsd expansion for up to
an additional 32 gigabytes of storage
but while its design and performance
don't evoke much excitement its price
point might just win you over while the
exact number is still up in the air we
were told to expect sub $50 territory
when it hits t-mobile and MetroPCS later
this year if you're looking for
something a little fancier the cricket
bound Grand x3 might be more suited to
your liking at 129 dollars the x3
features a 5.5 inch 720p display a one
point three gigahertz Snapdragon 210 and
USB type-c with Texas Instruments grab
it charging on board the design is
surprisingly nice with a lightly
texturized backing that's reminiscent of
one plus is sandstone and rounded edges
to the display dubbed the infinity edge
and for fans of the hi-fi audio
experience on last year's acts on the
Grand X 3 features dolby audio for
high-quality sound ZTE lists the MSRP at
129 dollars though ultimately the final
price is up to cricket will be launching
the phone later this month both phones
are currently running android 5.1
lollipop but we've been assured that a
marshmallow update is already in the
works if you like this video and want to
see more coverage from CES 2016 this is
