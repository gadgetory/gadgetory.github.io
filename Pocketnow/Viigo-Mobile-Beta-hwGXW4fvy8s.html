paki medicom and today I'm gonna show
you Vigo mobile for your windows mobile
device and this is actually a beta
program and i'll post a link and park
another comments how to get this and
what this program is going to allow you
to do is get news and all your weather
sports stocks shopping entertainment and
everything up to date on your device and
and it's a pretty useful program to get
up-to-the-minute news and weather and
sports and all that great stuff so i'm
just going to go to some of the features
and cost to get RSS feeds so going to
that so i want to look at some of the
RSS feeds i have saved here I've
packing.com and go here and look at some
of them so as we see we have some from
today and some from yesterday so if i
wanted to read one of the articles i can
look at this so look so you got the HTC
hero unboxing and it will just come
right up and it actually it's pretty
fast and it's very easy to input
different websites as a RSS feed as well
so we'll just go back and go to audio
and podcasts i don't know if i have any
saved in here just um some generic ones
i have some CNN and ESPN and go back to
that and go to weather and check the
current forecast and right now it says
it's 91 degrees in seattle so it is a
pretty scorching hot week this this past
week so i'll just go back and check the
sports so if you have any favorite
sports teams that you want to check Leah
I just have some baseball and basketball
teams let's see here of course there's
no basketball during the summer but
that's cool and check on current scores
and there haven't been any games
recently so we'll just go back and check
our check our stocks and finances so if
I want to add a channel I can just click
here and i can add different channels
and there's so many on this vigo beta
for windows mobile devices it's just
unreal how many applications and
different websites are actually tied
right in and also go to local interest
so if i want to check what's go
on my area I want if I want to see what
which traffic is like and go check the
current traffic conditions so I can see
that there's a quite a bit of traffic
actually I'm took me about two hours to
get home today which wasn't too much fun
you can also go shopping so if you
decide to shop on your windows mobile
device I have a mobile software program
here so this is a mobi hand and you can
check out free software new software and
it will just give you a little article
and I think you've also give you a link
to download them it's actually pretty
useful because that you can just
download directly from here so who needs
to use marketplace when you have this
program and check entertainment news not
too much going on so just go back and
check flights and travel this is
actually pretty cool if you are check
flights and travel and this is pretty
neat because you can check up you can
search by flight number or you can
search for a flight in your area so if i
want to i saw effluence saved right here
so just seattle los angeles and it will
update and show me different flight
numbers and it will give me all the
flight times and all the flight
information as well as if i click on one
of these it'll also show me what
aircraft is taking off and what kind of
aircraft it is so we can just go back
there's also another link for politics
but that's probably not too interesting
right now and also options so i will
post a link on pocket another comment so
how to get this this is v go mobile beta
and the developer does say that there's
a little bit of glitches but i haven't
noticed any when i've used the program
