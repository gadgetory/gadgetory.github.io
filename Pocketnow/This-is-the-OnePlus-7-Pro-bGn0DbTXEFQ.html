company's latest and greatest flagship
killer that this time is not just here
to compete with specs and the price see
every previous one plus I have reviewed
or compared as one because the
shortcomings were always something you
could forgive for all the specs you
received for the price tag but what if I
told you that part of that has changed
what if the specs were still powerful
the price was still aggressive and yet
most of the things that we felt were
missing were finally addressed actually
you're gonna hear the word finally a lot
in this video um he might've even I was
pocket now and let's dive in in the past
the narrative of oneplus was always to
never settle but that wasn't really the
case either features were missing or the
camera wasn't really there or the design
followed trends no one was really asking
for the oneplus 7 pro is all about
walking that talk in addition to
bringing its own unique features and the
experience really begins with the
unboxing now disclaimer my review kit
will come with more stuff than the
experience you'll have our box included
a new one plus seven Pro the new bullets
Wireless two and a warped charged car
adapter which I've actually been looking
forward to along with the usual cool
cases that one plus sells for very
little money inside the box of the
bullets Wireless we have two headphones
front and center and below our ear
cushions for different sizes a red case
that I've come to love and a USBC small
cable for charging since they are warped
charge capable and as for the car
adapter we have the advantage that it
doesn't just bring the warp charger it
also includes a USB a two USBC cable in
one plus fashion as well as for the one
plus seven pro we start with literature
a clear case covering it all along with
a sim ejector tool the device below a
warp charge 30 adapter and a USB a two
USBC cable below allow me the honors to
remove this plastic
and sorry guys I know that this is a
screen protector I'm just not a fan but
I know that some of you are so it's
great that it's included really it's
hard to deny just how gorgeous this
device is at a glance we've got three
color options mirror gray and almond
that will launch later and this nebula
blue that's currently my favorite thanks
to its matte finish it is curved all
around the camera hump is not really
intrusive and the buttons are placed
where human hands can reach them and no
worries the beloved mute slider is here
for added convenience what I find the
most striking is the display no bezels
no notches just the curved and fluid
display as the company is calling it
this is a six point seven inch AMOLED
panel finally making the jump to quad HD
plus resolution we have srgb DCI p3 and
even HDR 10 plus support all on 600 nits
of brightness it's one of the first
ohlet's to bring 90 Hertz refresh rate
for those of you interested in gaming or
just a more fluid experience I'm
honestly more about just how immersive
it is thanks to its great color
reproduction and the fact that the
company is also finally making the jump
to stereo dual firing speakers tuned by
Dolby Atmos for those owls in the crowd
there's a new night mode 2.0 that
filters out and more of the blu-rays
from the display and it can get us
darkest point to 7 nets for added
comfort and then for those of you
readers in the crowd the black-and-white
reading mode is here making a return as
well as for the reasons why notches
existed aka the selfie cam well there is
a new pop-up camera at 16 megapixels and
f/2 aperture the company claims that the
mechanism has been tested 300,000 times
which amounts to 150 times a day for up
to 5 years
and there's even free fall detection in
case the phone slips off your hand when
it's extended the speed of the pop-up is
fast enough for it to even support face
to unlock in 0.65 seconds like I really
have no complaints with it my biggest
concern when I saw the leaks of the
scanner module was water resistance I
know of no other
with moving parts that claims this but
oneplus has assured that this device
retains the same experience of previous
generations to keep it safe I'll just
call the splash proof those of you
looking for a more convenient approach
to unlocking the phone the on display
fingerprint scanner has been improved
now with a thirty six percent larger
sensor and unlocking the phone in just
0.2 one seconds and since we're talking
specs as expected we have a powerful
Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 5 6 8 or 12 gigs
of ram 128 or 256 gigs of ufs 3.0
storage a larger 4,000 milliamp hour
battery warped charge 30 that takes the
power pack from 0 to 50% in 20 minutes a
new x-axis haptic vibration motor for
better interaction Wi-Fi AC bluetooth 5
and all the LTE bands you can think of
like seriously everything but the
kitchen sink is here and then flipping
things around we have three camera
sensors and these are finally all
cameras like real ones not just step
sensors we have a sony IMX 586 primary
at 48 megapixels at 1.6 aperture and
support for an insane 1.6 microns
through pixel bidding below it as an 8
megapixel telephoto with 3x optical zoom
f 2.4 aperture standard microns and oh
is and above it yes believe it or not a
16 megapixel ultra wide at 117 degrees a
field of view F 2.2 aperture n-no oh is
there are new enhancements like
nightscape 2.0 and a smarter approach to
HDR plus in video we have support for 4k
at 60 frames per second 1080p super
slow-mo at 240 frames per second 720p at
480 though the selfie camera only
supports 1080p at 30fps we'll report
more on the experience with the cameras
as we get closer to comparisons in our
full review but so far our first
impressions are very positive
oxygen OS jumps to version 9.5 point 2
on top of Android 9 PI and keep in mind
this phone is on the list for the cube
beta as well
the experience has been fast and fluid
as we've come to expect from oneplus and
obviously the 90 Hertz only makes it
even better this is seriously one of my
favorite user interfaces probably better
and more stock Android than even the
pixel and it now includes improvements
like a screen recording feature in case
that's your thing and probably my
favorite changes this new Zen mode for
digital well being it forces you to
spend twenty minutes of phone free time
that you can't cheat have you enabled us
you won't be able to switch it off even
if you reset the phone overall I have to
say my first impressions are not that
this is a phone that cuts corners we
have gorgeous hardware no compromises on
the display the best specifications
great software and a complete camera
combo seriously the only thing this
phone is missing is wireless charging
which has warped charging as a solution
in addition to good battery life and
obviously the lack of a headphone jack
now the thing is when the starting price
is just 669 and you can get a pair of
bullets Wireless two for just $99 you're
looking at a full-blown flagship with
wireless headphones for nearly the same
amount of money as an iPhone 10 R or a
galaxy s 10 e those are actually gonna
be some hot comparisons that are coming
very soon yes this is a t-mobile
exclusive in the United States and
there's even a trading program for those
of you wanting to make the upgrade I'm
personally very impressed but we would
love to hear what you think let us know

oneplus 7 pro in the comments down below
