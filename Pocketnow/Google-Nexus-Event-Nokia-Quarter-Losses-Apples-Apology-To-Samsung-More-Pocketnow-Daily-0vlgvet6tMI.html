29th event nokia's quarter results
disappoint a novel has to publicly
apologize to Samsung I'm hi Mary Vera
wondering will all be on october twenty
ninth and this is sparking out daily
that's right believe it or not a UK
appeals court has just determined that
apple's accusations against samsung for
copying their products isn't true as a
result Apple is forced to push ads on
their UK website and probably elsewhere
apologizing to Samsung for the
accusations talk about a way to bite
your own bullet but I was expecting a
little more drama probably building some
Samsung license plates or something for
a year now Nokia on the other hand isn't
having so much fun the reason porter
results were just published an aside
from losing 750 million dollars they've
also dropped Lumia sales by thirty
percent now this is completely
understandable because we all know that
current Lumias won't be getting windows
phone 8 so I know a lot of loyalists
just moved away and waited for the Lumia
920 to come out but again they're
waiting for windows phone 8 which
couldn't come out any sooner now Google
has finally done a logical thing that I
don't know why other companies haven't
done before I think only Amazon's
figured out the fact that we need a wish
list and google has brought a wish list
now to the google play store just think
about it how important is a wish list
what do you do to remember all the apps
that you want to purchase during the
month whenever your paycheck arrives I'm
always running them down so the updates
should be available for your phones and
tablets right now and check it out now
acer has just announced their 7-inch
tablet competitor to go against the
google nexus 7 that's called the acer
iconia tab a110 and bring some decent
specs along with android 4.1 jelly bean
out-of-the-box and retails for 220 bucks
in the united states now sadly we've
never had good experiences with acer
tablets in the past so if i were you i'd
wait and see give it a try first and
finally for the competing news of the
day google is just sent out press
invites for an october 29th event to be
held in new york city and focus on
android and yes believe it or not that's
the same date that Microsoft is going to
launch Windows Phone 8 in San Francisco
kind of coincidental but hey google is
planning to launch their
Nexus are probably Nexus devices in this
event and will be there to cover it live
that leads me to the question of the day
what would be your dream Nexus device to
be launched in this event in my
particular case I would love an HTC j
butterfly Nexus device so leave us a
comment down below and if you want an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow was on Parker
now calm please give this video a thumbs
up if you liked what you saw I'm home
every better thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
