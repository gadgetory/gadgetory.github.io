is somehow a fair comparison instead
it's interesting to see how far we've
come in the course of a year and to try
and predict how Apple might respond what
passed for a large-screen device in 2016
against Samsung's latest and greatest
each company representing the others
nemesis and how that draws these two
closer together as competitors here's
our quick hands-on comparison Note 8 vs.
iPhone 7 plus brought to you by deep
brand the node 8 looks like it should be
bigger than it actually feels in the
hand like the si+ before it and delivers
a shocking amount of screen opposite the
iPhone 7 plus which has always felt
somewhat wider than it really needed to
be while we can praise Samsung's
manufacturing impressing with nearly
flush dual cameras it is an odd design
choice to call attention to the camera
housing with this abrupt black bar it's
somewhat Mars the otherwise pretty glass
on glass construction these two
companies have reached parity on water
resistance and Samsung's implementation
of that dual camera shooter represents a
nice tik-tok improvement over the zoom
trend started by Apple adding Hardware
stabilization for both sensors is
exactly the kind of evolution we were
hoping for and the software processing
is more in line with our favorite blur
features from Huawei Samsung of course
called out the headphone jack
courageously keeping a true-blue audio
standard alongside wireless charging and
iris scanning it's a formidable feature
package and everything in the kitchen
sink phone opposite a more streamlined
all-rounder consumer device for all the
bold claims the note arrives as an
expected phone Samsung made the right
play in our opinion to operate on the
conservative side this year wowing with
a new display and backing off more
outlandish tech even if that means
continuing our least favorite
fingerprint sensor placement but this
means there's room for Apple to deliver
a fresher feel Apple fan compared
against samsung fan the next generation
iPhone will feel like a startling leap
compared to its predecessor the node 8
won't feel quite as revolution
when held up next to its large screen
siblings may be most critical Samsung
might have done Apple a favor when it
comes to pricing holding just below a
one thousand dollar price tag gives
Apple some justification for why a
next-gen iPhone can be priced
significantly higher than previous
iPhones whether we rationally agree with
the value proposition there's a huge
emotional factor at play with the
perceived status of a lifestyle
accessory samsung's tone for this launch
event was appropriately focused on
loyalists note fans and artists but in a
world full of larger screens and taller
aspect ratios Apple has plenty of room
to respond more than just the collection
of specs and improvements how do you
think Apple will announce the next
iPhone likely the most radical design
shift we've ever seen from Cupertino and
free of any baggage like a recent phone
recall will Apple push a more aggressive
message do we expect a price tag to
match a regardless of your team iPhone
or team galaxy you'll probably want to
keep that expensive premium phone
