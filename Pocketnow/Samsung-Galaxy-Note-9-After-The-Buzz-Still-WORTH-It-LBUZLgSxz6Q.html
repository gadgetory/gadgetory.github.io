the media after the review period is
done there are a few that stand out
gadgets that people still talk about
months later some that we even decide to
hold on to his daily drivers and then we
get to see aged over time the Samsung
Galaxy Note 9 is one of them as we get
closer to the next Galaxy unpacked it's
only fitting that we revisit the current
phablet King and tell you how well it
aged and if it's still worth it to
consider nearly a year later I'm high
memory better with pocket now and this
is the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 after the
buzz coming back to the samsung galaxy
note 9 for a few weeks to get this video
prepared left me with a question I'm
wondering if this is the Last Samurai
galaxy notes meaning the last of its
kind to be a true no holds bar flagship
see that's how the Galaxy Note began it
was the phone that had everything and
sometimes even more and it did so for
four generations but then it spent
another four generations being just the
Galaxy S with an S Pen and it wasn't
really until this Galaxy Note 9 that the
company returned to its roots
it's a civ they finally listened to
customer feedback this ended up being my
favorite phone of late 2019 mainly
because it had everything but the
kitchen sink now notice that I mentioned
a period and we'll come back to that for
now the whole reason for this video is
to tell you how this phone has aged and
I'm gonna tell you this much samsung has
really impressed me with the hardware
the company doesn't really advertise
stuff or materials on its note but I
sometimes wonder if there are this phone
is a tank it's been nearly a year and
out of which I used it non-stop for four
months and change and it looks and feels
like new even after the on and off
comparison periods that I came back to
it like with the Galaxy Note 8 I don't
know what it is but I've left no
scratches on the display or the back and
I even feel that the oleophobic coating
has improved on this generation and all
the while only
thing this phone with a similar bumper I
finally used to be a smarter solution as
you lose the bulk and get the grip
needed to have the curves not make the
phone fall off a table Samson was smart
enough to not only improve the
ergonomics on the fingerprint scanner
and on the placement of the power button
but also in giving you other ways to
access your phone through the force
touch home button then even the more
accurate and secure intelligent scan
this made the experience of using the
phone a bit more bearable but I will
admit there were cases where it was not
the volume buttons for example proved to
be unreachable even if I operated this
phone with my left hand and the only key
that I found too easy to press was the
only one that I never really wanted to
press yes you guess that that's Bixby
and yes I know Samsung wants a piece of
the digital assistant Pi and I also know
that Bixby was created by the same team
that created Siri that's all great the
service is actually not that bad there
are some benefits to it the problem is
how annoying it is whenever you press
that button regardless of its benefits
you end up wanting to switch the whole
service off that being said to be fair I
know that this phone is not the most
ergonomic out there but I've learned to
make peace with it and it's mainly
because there are a ton of benefits to
owning a Galaxy Note aside from being a
powerful flagship this phone intends to
replace your notepad and for this you
need a good stylus a decent sized canvas
and it also has to last all day for me
Samsung nailed it I have to admit this
is the first time that I've actually
used the s-pen as much as I have on a
Galaxy Note and it's not for the reasons
you think it's not because of the whole
Bluetooth functionality and being able
to remotely operate your phone and the
camera shutter no it was mainly because
of the peace of mind
battery life on this phone has been epic
Samsung's pushed through a four thousand
milliamp hour battery was an important
move but I also have to praise the rest
of the internals and how they
contributed the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845
maybe more than a year old but it still
performs like a powerful and efficient
champ but I also feel this match with
enough RAM and storage for me not to
really feel that I needed
or it was total peace of mind right down
to the essentials like water resistance
and fast and wireless charging and
speaking of the canvas what can I say
the six point four inch AMOLED display
continues to beat even newer ohlet's
thanks to its color reproduction and
accuracy and sure it might look a little
dated thanks to the top and bottom bezel
but I kind of like this approach more
than the interruption of a punch hole I
remember that the only thing that I wish
its predecessor had were dual firing
speakers in order to complete the
content consumption loop and Samsung has
delivered with this generation just fine
like the fact that you can glide through
menus very quickly and another thing
that H well to a certain degree is
software believe it or not this phone
receive one UI even before the Galaxy S
10 launched which is a true record it's
not really what I'd call my favorite
approach to Android but there are things
I praise on a phone this large it's
genius to have a user interface that's
designed for better one-handed use
buttons at the bottom where they should
be in navigation elements where your
hand can reach the only problem like in
the case of the Galaxy S tennis that
only one UI is designed this way every
other Android application will mostly
have the buttons at the top which
totally defeats the purpose
still this is one of those devices where
I truly appreciate custom software
because it's really there where a
Samsung Galaxy Note becomes a note I
love things like the quick actions menu
to launch apps that take advantage of
the galaxy note once deployed and then
there are apps like right on PDF that
are so essential for me that I even
prefer signing documents on a Galaxy
Note over an iPad pro I also love how
third-party applications have improved
integration OneNote for example now
activates the eraser whenever you press
the button
seriously the s-pen tip and the form
factor of this phone made this feel like
that pocket notepad that you want to
carry around and that every now and then
you use to take notes I actually did so
particularly when the screen is off but
then again not everything was perfect
there were applications that were cool
to have but I have to admit I never
really used the remote shutter being one
of them and sure you can use your S Pen
like a sort of a mouse
to navigate around the phone but the
fact that the experience varies
depending on whether you're using
Samsung applications are not mitad
something that I usually forgot was
there
I feel Samsung's Galaxy store should
have a section for apps enhance for the
s-pen in order to help people find more
uses for it than doodling on the go or
for screen off notes I really only have
two major complaints with one UI mainly
being number one the fact that even if
this phone is powerful it sometimes
feels slower than the average Joe and
it's not because it's stuttering it's
because there are so many unnecessary
animations if you launch a game the
phone performs great but really
navigating between menus can sometimes
be cumbersome and then the second reason
is mainly because discerning users are
the main target for this phone and at
the moment of this video this device
still does not have the 1 UI update that
includes the camera night mode that a
lot of people received more than a month
ago other than that there's really not
much to complain about the camera
specifications are all still on par with
current phones and I love how the
company has toned down its saturation
and give you more natural results colors
are on point
low-light performance is great and
that's even when scene detection doesn't
always know that you need a little boost
I really only feel that the cameras are
dated in things like portrait
photography where life focus depends on
the telephoto and therefore forces you
to step back from your subject to get
the shot you can edit these after the
fact though so that's good and then I'm
video recording even if you have all the
latest standards of the galaxy s 10 and
even if stabilization is good I do wish
that we have super steady video on the
galaxy s 10 which depends on the wide
angle and I think that mentioning the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 is probably the best
way to end this video and conclude this
is actually the first time that I've
felt more compelled to using the Galaxy
S than to using a Galaxy Note in the
past that was always the fact that the
note would get the cooler features
before the Galaxy S but not this year
today the galaxy s 10 plus comes with
triple cameras a much lighter and more
ergonomic build a better display less
a better selfie camera with 4k video a
more secure on display fingerprint
scanner reverse wireless charging among
other things and this is the reason why
my stand with the Galaxy Note 9 was so
short this is the reason why I feel that
this might be the Last Samurai of the
galaxy notes I know that when I reviewed
it I said that finally the next best
thing is here but then the galaxy s 10
plus came out and I used it and never
looked back
do I miss the s-pen yes do I need an S
Pen over all the benefits the galaxy s
10 plus has no would I pay the same
amount of money for both phones oh no
definitely not the Samsung Galaxy Note 9
was great when I use that it still is a
great phone now but it was quickly
overshadowed by its own kin
it makes it hard for me to recommend
that today over the Galaxy S and if you
really want the s-pen I'd wait for the
note 10 to get the best of both worlds
but that also leaves me with a huge
question with all the rumours of the
Galaxy Note 1000 knee planning to kill
some bezels and add some time of flights
and if no Snapdragon 855 plus will come
on board
I feel the Vanguard days of the note are
over don't get me wrong I'm sure that
I'll try it and love it but the big
question is how long will it be my daily
driver before the other next best thing
launches later what about you what do
