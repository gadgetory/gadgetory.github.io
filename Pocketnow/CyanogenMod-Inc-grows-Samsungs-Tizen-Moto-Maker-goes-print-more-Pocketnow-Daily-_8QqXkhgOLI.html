order to double its size rumors have it
that Samsung Tizen phones are landing at
mwc 2014 and Motorola keeps figuring out
more waste to sell you their Moto X I'm
high metal ivetta and trusting your
Motorola forget about the magazine
covers just give me another three
hundred fifty dollar deal that I can
actually land and i'll buy your Moto X
this is out daily let's try off
with some official news as those of you
interested in trying something new
that's not blackberry or Windows Phone
or Android or iOS well Jolla smartphone
has finally hit the market make sure you
watch Michael Fisher's video on his
unboxing of the Jolla smartphone and
make sure you keep up with this full
review that's coming up very soon
obviously we are very excited to try
something new finally and speaking of
new platforms we've been waiting for
Samsung's Tizen platform for the longest
time and apparently we will finally get
our first smartphone at mwc 2014 and
Barcelona will definitely be there to
cover everything live but we're still
wondering what to expect from this
platform is Samsung planning to replace
Android with Tizen or whatever you know
with their whole app store involvements
and everything so stay tuned probably
that will be the case now let's talk
about motorola as apparently those of
you that were bold enough to order a
wooden Moto X you are in for a surprise
you won't have to wait 20 days for your
phone apparently the company has figured
out how to get the phone quicker to you
or they're not selling many of these
whichever which the case probably you'll
be getting the phone in the next couple
of days but even more interesting is
that the company is now apparently using
the january 2014 edition of Wired
magazine to showcase a way to have a
sort of a moto maker on paper watch the
video and tell us what you think of the
links down below and there are some
interesting changes coming to nokia with
this whole merger with microsoft is
apparently the company is now not only
keeping the numbers for their future
phones apparently they're keeping the
code names as well so for example that
Lumia 929 icon is apparently going to be
called the icon or some sort we'll see
how that goes and for those of you that
have been waiting for raw photography
and your Lumia 1020 the AT&amp;amp;T model has
just gone the black update so make sure
you look out for that as it'll obviously
give you raw photo support aside from
other goodies so stay tuned for that
and finally for the hot news of the day
those of you the thought that
cyanogenmod Inc was gonna be bogged down
by the whole debacle with the Google
Play Store well think again the company
has just raised 22 million dollars to
double its size so the question now is
what do they plan to do with that extra
amount of people are they planning to
just grow or are they planning to
actually bring other projects into the
market and what that leads me to the
question of the day what is your
favorite third-party rom you know custom
rom is it cyanogenmod is it any other
raw on your android phone leave us a
comment down below in my particular case
i have actually only use antigen mod and
I like it a lot so it was a comment does
what you like and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video with spill
make sure you follow us on parking out
our comment subscribe to our YouTube
channel as well can also follow me on
Twitter Jaime underscore to be beta
please give this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am high metal you
