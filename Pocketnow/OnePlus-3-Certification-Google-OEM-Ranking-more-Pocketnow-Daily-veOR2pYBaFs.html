we finally see certification documents
lenovo just made it official that
absorbing motorola wasn't the smartest
deal and google might soon be entitled
to call out OEMs for sucking at software
updates I'm hi Mary vera and yeah I know
that the upload times have been crazy
guys you have no idea how hard it is to
upload a video here this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
deals those of you in the market for the
blackberry prive this is probably the
right time to buy but not at your
average retailer ebay now has the
blackberry prefer just three hundred and
eighty dollars and this is a trusted
seller you have to remember that this
phone costs more than seven hundred
dollars when blackberry announced it a
price tag we never really understood so
this is the time to move and speaking of
deals verizon has just decided to bring
this major promotion for the HTC 10
those of you interested the device is
currently a hundred dollars off and if
the HTC 10 is probably a little too
expensive for you well there are also
some legacy devices that are also part
of the deal with a hundred dollars off
as well you can learn more in the links
in the description now a company that is
not really celebrating that much is
Lenovo and particularly with its
approach to Motorola the company has
just announced its quarter results major
losses nineteen percent mainly because
they barely sold almost 5 million units
within three months which is a crazy
downfall in sales but indeed I wonder
what exactly was Lenovo expecting when
they pretty much ignored carriers with
the launch of the new Moto X and pretty
much every other product that they've
announced let's hope that this probably
teaches them something but hey Lenovo
world is coming up soon can't wait to
see what comes next and for those of you
that still want that sandstone back on
the one plus three well we now have
certification documents from Tina the
one plus three is currently being
certified and yeah we get that metallic
back which I actually like a lot this is
obviously a matter of taste hopefully
there are a couple of variants but it
seems the one plus three is adopting
that design and the specifications that
we've talked about can't wait to see
what we get soon and finally the very
interesting news that they have to do
with the Google's future approach to
you how OMS handles software updates you
know that Google has been loosely
handling how OMS handle the operating
system when it comes to android but
that's mainly because android is
supposed to be open meaning OEMs can do
whatever they want with it but
apparently google is now going to be
publishing rankings over which
smartphone OEMs do the best job and this
is just odd because the largest
smartphone OEM that sells android
smartphones is samsung and it's also the
most terrible so those rankings are
going to be awesome but it leads me to
the question of the day what do you
think about these rankings do you think
that this is the only thing that google
should do or do you believe that google
should do more in my case I do believe
it should do more but as we've said at
the pocket and weekly podcast sadly this
is the name of this is the way the
animal works whenever you make a
operating system like Android this comes
with the territory sorry find it very
hard for Google to be able to do
anything else leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
