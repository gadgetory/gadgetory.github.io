recently but Samsung isn't staying still
in the battle for Windows Phone 8
supremacy we've been waiting for this
one for a while so let's get right to it
I'm Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is our unboxing and hardware tour
of the Samsung ativ s the ative s was
the first Windows Phone 8 device
officially announced but it's one of the
last to launch in 2012 still late is
better than ever and Samsung's doing
something different with Windows Phone
is chewing the brightly colored approach
of HTC Inoki afor a more toned-down
aluminum silver color despite this being
one of the larger windows phones
available today the box is very small
and simple with the product showcased up
front and some specs on the back and
just to go through them very quickly
Windows Phone 8 is the OS of choice this
is an HSPA+ device an 8 megapixel camera
with a 2300 million power battery the
familiar Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 CPU
running at 1.5 gigahertz
HD Super AMOLED display Full HD video
record and playback and of course GPS
and then the usual gamut of specs down
there let's go ahead and pull the cover
off we've already cut the seal and there
is the device front and center occupying
the entirety over the front of the box
go ahead and pop it out there I'll take
a look at the device in a second but
right now let's just see what's in the
box see if there any surprises in here
various startup guides from Samsung
legal notices paperwork and so forth an
international charger because this is an
international unit or a European charger
I should say USB cable and the looks
like the same Samsung earbuds that we've
grown to know and either loved or
loathed depending on your attitude that
much else going on in the box so we'll
put it aside and we'll come right back
to the device here now before we get to
a hardware tour let's go ahead and pull
the battery door off one of the big
selling points of this device of course
that you can do that it is not a
non-removable battery the battery cover
itself feels an awful lot like the
galaxy s
it is very very bendable it is a very
obviously plastic this is not metal
though it appears to be metal thing so
that finish which we'll come back to in
a second but anyone familiar with the
Galaxy s3 is a battery door will be
familiar with that under the battery
cover here is that 2300 milliamp hour
battery along with the micro SD card
slot that supports micro SDXC for
enhanced capacity
there's the SIM card slot there
underneath the cover
not a whole lot looking different looks
a lot like some other phones there's
that 8 megapixel camera lens let's pop
that battery door back on and with the
battery door reattached we can have a
look at the outside of the hardware here
and kind of take it in a samsung calls
the achieve s a new smartphone for both
work and entertainment delivering a
premium Windows Phone experience there
obviously targeting this at the prosumer
market and that shows in this kind of
understated refined design with a
hairline metallic finish reminiscent of
the galaxy note 2 but as you can see
it's a slightly different color it's a
little brighter than aluminum silver
that was called out on the box it looks
very very nice in person the device is
eight point seven millimeters thick
with a nice metallic looking bezel
encircling the unit and a very classy
looking recessed speakerphone
arrangement on the back here
the ative s weighs 135 grams which is
the same as the galaxy s3 but because it
lacks the s3s
teardrop shape it feels different in the
hand a little more of substantial now
the highlight of this device is under
the screen protector so let's go ahead
and take that off nice and that
highlight is the largest display on a
Windows Phone 8 device a four point
eight inch HD Super AMOLED panel at 720
by 1280 resolution delivering 306 PPI
now if those specs sound familiar they
should that's exactly the same as on the
galaxy s3 it's easy to see why a lot of
people call this phone the Galaxy s3 for
Windows Phone as you can see our first
boot is complete so we can go ahead and
take a little bit of a hardware tour
here volume keys mounted on the left
side of the device as you're looking at
it not where they are where we've gotten
used to them on the right hand side
adjacent
the power button so that's an
interesting little variance on the usual
Windows Phone formula volume down volume
up nothing else on the left side on the
right side the power button mounted very
very high up on the device not at the
midpoint where it was moved for the
Galaxy Note 2 makes sense because this
is not a phablet the 2 stage camera key
is located down in its usual spot and
its responsiveness right out the gate is
a little bit mushy er than we're used to
on other Windows Phone devices down
below the display you'll notice another
distinction Samsung has retained their
favorite physical home button here but
it is flanked by capacitive back and
search keys and around back once again
we're looking at that fancy speakerphone
grill under the Windows Phone logo the
camera lens with flash and little
call-out for its resolution up top
headphone jack noise cancelling mic and
qualcomm call out sticker on top which
can be removed and will be and down
bottom the microUSB port and primary
microphone guys we're gonna get to know
this device very well over the course of
the next few days but in the interim
this has been your unboxing and first
Hardware tour of the Windows Phone 8
device with the largest display on the
market currently the Samsung ativ s keep
it locked to pocket now in the coming
days we're gonna have a lot more
coverage on the atif s including a
comparison with the Lumia 920 and our
full review treatment coming very soon
