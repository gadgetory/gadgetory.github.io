a rebrand PureView for their smartphone
cameras and leak Sampson roadmaps
underwhelmed I'm primary vetta on a diet
for 30 minutes from coffee this is
fucking out daily analysts are always
filling our days with numbers and such
as the case of the recent reports that
confirm which is the most used operating
system in the US market drumroll if you
thought this was Android you'll sadly be
disappointed because apparently iOS is
being used by 51 percent of the market
and it just next to wonder since
recently LG took the crown as the second
smartphone manufacturer in the United
States taking the crown from the iphone
so which number should we believe and
speaking of iOS for those of you that
didn't know that there's a backstory
behind Siri well there actually is from
its origins as a military project to the
fact that you can later download it from
the App Store's a simple app service
that you can use well the rest is
history is apple bought the company
eventually but then you really know that
Verizon was actually in line to buy the
service at some point and the purpose
was to install it in every droid in the
market but for those of you that
remember Sarah wasn't actually working
on Android as it was working on the
iphone so the rest is history for now it
just begs to wonder of Apple wouldn't
have been better off without Siri I
actually do enjoy it but I don't know
about you and for those of you that were
left drooling over the Galaxy Note 8
rumors that we published yesterday well
we're set to disappoint if there's a
leak road map that shows that the device
will be just another Android tablet with
galaxy no capabilities there's really
nothing special about this tablet aside
from the fact that it will have the
adequate size for a galaxy note device
meaning you won't be getting the x and
o's 5 octa processor in this device at
least we were thinking that all Galaxy
devices in 2013 we're going to support
this new processor but apparently this
device is not going to include it so
we'll keep you posted most likely mwc
will be the day where we will know more
about this device and for those of you
diehard fans of the Nokia 808 PureView
and the concept of a better camera on
the smartphone that was later trashed as
a brand with the Lumia 920 in the fake
ad debacle it seems the note is already
working on actually rebranding the real
808 PureView as a concept or at least
the 42 megapixel camera now the
interesting point here is that these
unconfirmed sources are saying that it
will be called Nokia EOS and for those
of you that know EOS well that's the
same branding that canon uses in there
can be SLR cameras like the one that
we're using to film this video the
question is when will we beginning this
new Nokia EOS rebrand and will we be
getting that same 42 megapixel camera on
smaller smartphones like the Lumia
branding we'll keep you posted on that
and finally for the hot news of the day
recent leaked images of the HTC m7 also
brought the images of HTC Sense 5.0 and
to be honest with you there's a lot to
look forward here I mean it looks a lot
more than ballistic and less fluffy than
previous versions of sense and it begs
the wonder of HTC just wants to work on
making everything more efficient and
less again fluffy so that leads me to
the question of the day what are you
expecting from sense 5-point know when
you prefer more fluff or less fluff in
our particular case we just want
something that works well and it
launches fast and hopefully HTC Sense 5
point no will bring that to the table so
leave us a comment down below and we'll
keep you posted at mwc 2013 if you want
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow us on Parker

up if you liked what you saw I'm high
