well I'm hi I'm Eddie that huh this is
fuckin now and I guess it's time for
another pocket now the durability report
this time with the iPad air let's start
with a couple of disclaimers I have
owned this iPad air ever since launch
date so that means I've been using it
for the last couple of weeks I have
owned every iPad that's been launched
ever since then I've had one up to the
iPad Mini without the Retina display and
so far I will admit that I'm not really
a tablet fan but I do feel that Apple
figures it out best when it comes to
tablets I'm not saying that iPads are
perfect I'm just saying that these are
the tablets that that the most from my
lifestyle obviously your mileage may
vary now that being said I do baby my
devices I don't throw them on the floor
I don't drop them that just doesn't
happen to me I don't buy cases but I do
make sure that whenever I carry them
like my laptop I do have a sleeve for
its backpack I do have a sleeve for this
iPad whenever it's been carried on the
backpack as well so even though I don't
baby them while I carry them with me I
do make sure that I do take care of them
all the time so I would consider myself
to be a good user I haven't really had
any problems with any of the iPads that
I've owned in the past and yes I will
admit that one of the biggest reasons
when I got the iPad air was because I
loved its build quality I fell in love
with the iPad Mini up to the point where
I turned it on and didn't see a Retina
display and the biggest reason why I got
the iPad air was because I wanted that
design with the Retina display and this
was the first tablet to offer it so yeah
I will admit I am happy with my purchase
of the iPad air so far now sadly not
everything has been perfect you will
notice that one of my biggest problems
with the iPad air and this is actually
the first time that I've ever had a
problem with an iPad is these two marks
that I have on the display which could
be dead pixels or any sort of problem of
the display now that being said I don't
use screen protectors I again I don't
really know what happened I haven't
dropped this tablet yet and the only
reason why I use this smart cover it's
not really because I want to protect the
display because again I haven't really
had any problems with it for me the
biggest reason is just to have something
to stand the iPad whenever I want to be
using it on a table but again not really
for screen protection so I'm really
annoyed at the fact that
have no clue where these marks came from
I really don't know what happened I have
nothing in my backpack that could have
ever you know leveraged this problem so
I really don't know what's going on with
apples in cell technology on these IPS
displays now another issue that I've had
with this tablet is with the Shatford
edges I do not know where these two
dents on the sides came from with the
iPad Mini I've held it for a year and I
have not had any issues with the metal
but then on this iPad again I haven't
dropped it and I have two dents on the
side and it could be that within the
backpack it probably hit something while
I was driving probably the backpack
shifted from side to side it was
probably when I was traveling over here
I still do not know where there's dents
came from but this just proves that this
tablet was probably made with a thinner
sheet metal to keep the weight down when
compared to the iPad Mini because again
I've treated the iPad Mini the same and
I haven't had any issues now interesting
in the case of the iPhone 5 in the past
we did see that the chamfered edges were
having a lot of trouble but since I got
a second lot device in the case of the
iPhone 5 apparently they used the
tougher sheet metal for that phone and I
didn't have any problems with the
Shatford edges so it could be again that
this iPad Mini is just using a thinner
sheet to keep the weight down which is
rather unfortunate now that being said
there is an advantage to owning Apple
products if you live in Europe or in the
United States and that's the fact that
there is an Apple store with a Genius
Bar and the good thing about this Genius
Bar is that in the case of these smarts
in the display which I still haven't
figured out where they came from
or in the case that you have a single
line scratch in the display these things
are covered by the warranty all you have
to do is set up an appointment at any
Genius Bar in an Apple Store and they
will swap this product for free I've
done it in the past with a scratched
iPad that a friend of mine had I took it
to a store they swapped it immediately
they give you a new product by the way
they can't just replace the display
which is actually a good thing so we
could say that Apple does offer a
solution if you're having problems with
the display in any way just take it to
an Apple store and swap it and even
though I'm not in the United States
right now I'll have to wait for this to
happen I'll have to put up with these
two marks so far at least I know that I
have that advantage in the future so we
could say that these are points in favor
of the iPad or if you could say so oh
well we could say that my experience
with the iPad
has been positive when it comes to the
experience even though I'm not really a
fan of iOS 7 on a tablet again the
design of this tablet is beautiful the
feel of this tablet and the hand is
great but sadly it seems that the
product is not durable enough and even
though there is a solution just go to an
Apple Store and swap it really I don't
live in the United States I don't want
to have to go swap it I would rather
have a product that doesn't have these
issues so again it took me a usage
problem it couldn't be so please leave
us a comment down below my question to
you is what problems have you had with
your iPad or have you had prompts with
the display have you had the same
problems with dents that you don't know
where they came from please leave us a
comment down below and share your
experience obviously I'm gonna have to
wait till my next trip I think it'll be
when I go to MWC in Barcelona where I
have to go to an Apple store and swap it
but leave us a comment down below tell
us your experience with the iPad air
again mine has been mixed so far I love
this product but I don't know what's
happened to it I haven't had these
problems at iPads in the past that's it
