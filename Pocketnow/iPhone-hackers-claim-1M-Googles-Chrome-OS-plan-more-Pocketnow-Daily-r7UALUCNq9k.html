to show how to remotely jailbreak iOS 9
Google clarifies that Chrome OS isn't
going anywhere right now in Apple's new
patent shows us for such technology on a
keyboard I'm Jaime meadow Iveta and I
think Tommy Hilfiger needs a donation
they're running out of shirts that I
like this is parking out daily official
news that I have to do with Google as if
you remember the major rumors right now
was that Chrome OS was going to be put
to rest and merge with Android and vice
versa particularly because of what
happened with this Chromebook pixel see
but as it turns out there is a blog post
on the chrome blog obviously and right
there Google is claiming that Chrome OS
is not going anywhere it does have a lot
to learn from Android and vice-versa but
we will be seeing more Chromebooks going
forward and then other news come from
Google we had rumors that the company
was going to start its own retail store
in New York City because it wanted to
sell you know Nexus smartphones in
addition to its Chromebooks and yada
yada yada but we've got trusted sources
claiming that apparently that New York
City space that it had prepared for that
is going to be used for something else
from Google but something else so we
don't know exactly what they're gonna
plan to do with this retail space but we
should learn more going forward maybe
you thought that for such technology was
done with 3d touch on the iPhone in
addition to what we have on a MacBook
trackpad and yes the Apple watch well
Apple has just pended a four touch
keyboard and the idea here is that well
yeah if you press hard enough you'll get
other options with the keys but we
wonder exactly how Apple plans to pull
it off with people like my brother who
hits the keys like crazy there are other
people that do that let's just see what
they end up publishing here and for
those of you that were not enjoying that
flickering disco effect that the
Microsoft Surface book cabinets display
Microsoft this just launched a software
update with firmware updates that fix
that in addition to other problems that
even include the surface pro for not
exactly sure how long it'll take for
that to deploy to all devices but
definitely look out for it as yeah
flickering displays on a tablet or just
killing it finally the very hot news
today has to do a security startup
called zero diem
zero day hope you get its rhodium they
published this bounty for a million
dollars if there was ever a hacking team
that would be able to well hack into iOS
9.1 9.2 beta by sending a remote script
and having people fall into a fake
website and apparently there is such a
team they figured it out and the
runner-up team is actually also making a
little money because they were rather
close purpose here is that yes iOS 9.1
and 9.2 beta is taxable remotely and I'm
not in tethered way up to the point
where the user doesn't even know that
he's being hacked and if you're
wondering exactly where that million
dollar is coming from well there seem to
be a couple of government entities that
are actually paying for this so it does
lead me to the question of the day how
sensitive is the information that you
keep on your phones do you feel that if
you were hacked there was important
information of you that could be exposed
in my case yeah I think that everybody
does but leave us a comment down below
we'd love to know your case friends you
know the drill if you want to get the
Missouri or before this video was filmed

out comments this rep change your
channel as well and follow me on Twitter

Instagram behind the green data please
