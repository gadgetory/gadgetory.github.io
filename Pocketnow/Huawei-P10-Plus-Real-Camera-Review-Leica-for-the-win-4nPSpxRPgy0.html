camera improvements for huawei partnered
with Leica in producing dual sensor
cameras for phones the p10 plus follows
on the heels of the mate 9 with similar
sensors software and specs these are
some of our favorite shooters especially
for creating photographic stool images
so should the P in p10 stand for
progress buckle up folks we have a lot
of ground to cover and I'm going to move
pretty quick the p10 plus represents
evolution bringing mate features to the
more fashionable line of Huawei phones
specifically for the camera the plus
shares the same sensors same megapixels
and mostly the same feature set the
single Hardware improvement over the
mate and smaller p10 camera are wider
apertures now opens to F 1.8 up from F
2.2 which we've seen since the p9
starting off with exposure in saturation
Huawei is subtly but noticeably pushing
into more i pleasing territory over the
mate nine similar setups deliver a bit
more saturation this is gorgeous for
greens blues and earth tones but can
sometimes be an issue with warmer colors
most phones have issues with reds for
example and the plus is no exception
pushing brightness and color to a point
where these flowers start to sizzle the
built-in tools to reduce saturation or
somewhat severe instead dialing back the
exposure a half stop does more to
preserve detail and arrive at a more
accurate color with wider apertures
metering becomes a bit more important
letting the phone decide produces more
clipped highlights than we would prefer
but tapping on the center of this flower
to engage the spot metering balances the
brightness out better in delivering more
eye candy the plus airs warmer with
white balance than previous Huawei's in
warm California light we can expect a
bit more of a glow in afternoon shots
and shaded shots avoid the trap of
arriving too blue like the increase in
saturation it's not always the most
accurate but it's not overly aggressive
or destructive happily these cameras
still deliver terrific dynamic range
purposely over exposing a shot by two
stops and taking the raw file we can
easily walk that back to recover not
only all the texture in the walls but
also most of the detail in the clouds
shooting raw is an excellent safety net
and the p10 plus delivers
top-tier performance here looking at
JPEGs this dual sensor approach has a
lot of Merit instead of two separate
cameras every single photo these sensors
work in tandem to capture more light and
paint in more detail like as design here
produces still images unlike any other
phone we've reviewed and even in high
contrast situations detail and clarity
are wonderfully captured it's a shame
most people share photos through heavily
compressed services like Instagram as
the full resolution shots can be
stunning taking a quick tour around the
app layout is very similar to the main
nine the main composition window is well
featured and gestures slide to the left
for various modes like panoramas
slow-motion in HDR sliding to the right
lands you in menus and settings this is
a phenomenal attempt at turning a phone
into a rangefinder camera and users have
tremendous control over photo output
video settings are a bit lacking
compared to the current champ LGV 20 and
the p10 + looses the directional
microphones found on the may 9 but the
biggest issue facing consumers is
navigating this app there's a lot of
stuff to control so there's a bit of
muscle memory to train in remembering
where all of these settings live and we
still run into a few control
frustrations like disabling the zoom
when shooting raw maybe instead this
pop-up should alert the user that raw is
disabled when zooming but still allow
the user to perform the action they
wanted - just a thought but I digress
and speaking of that zoom the plus
employs the same over sampling trick to
create a full resolution photo from a
crop on the image sensor it works well
enough getting you closer to your
subject but users should still expect
some image degradation huawei's dual
sensor solution isn't like apple or LG's
with different focal length lenses so we
don't see any advantages when changing
the field of view close focusing
distances on par with other flagships we
get a really pretty bouquet when working
at macro distances when looking at the
difference in aperture size the plus
produces slightly softer backgrounds but
the differences between the plus and the
mate 9 or the smaller P 10 will be
difficult to distinguish even when
really digging into some pixel peeping
especially when considering the very
good software blur mode bouquet on the
plus isn't a significant advantage when
discussing image sensors this
for folks who want more info we produced
a separate video last year where we
compared the p9 with F 2.2 apertures
against the galaxy s7 with an F 1.7
aperture for a more in-depth look at
smartphone aperture and vogue a blur
which is linked down below this video
now a happy improvement over the mate
9ro focus performance is noticeably
improved there's still a pulse as the
lens shifts but the focus lock arrives
faster even when shooting video it's not
a pretty slide into focus so you
shouldn't expect a rack focus effect but
it's snappy and it's accurate Huawei
also takes another step towards
improving HDR content most androids
treat HDR like a shadow brightening mode
and all too often this kills highlights
but we see some improvements here over
previous phones in not overly boosting
bright sections of your frame for a
phone which already excels at producing
contrast II images these HDR
improvements can help balance out some
high contrast situations but panorama
performance is still just upper mid pack
carefully scanning the street scene we
see a number of stitching errors in the
power lines depending on how busy your
shot is exercising more care and
rotating your phone can help but we're
all just going to own 360 degree cameras
anyway right no just me okay now I hate
taking selfies but the shooter on the
p10 is better than average a lot better
than average now also branded as a Leica
camera output is solid and the beauty
mode filtering has been enhanced to
include bouquet filtering and better odo
mode skin blurring a video from this
front shooter is also more than adequate
for sending a fun message or doing some
light vlogging all in all a very nice
effort from Huawei for my least-favorite
phone photography feature now moving to
low-light the increased aperture size
did not drastically change background
blur and my prediction was we'd only see
modest improvements to low-light
performance and that's where I was wrong
the wider iris for the lens lets in
enough light for us to see lower ISO
settings and faster shutter speeds for
similar exposures the plus is easily
capable of producing brighter images
with less noise per exposure than the
smaller p10 night shots are colorful
lively and really showcase light cos
Street and candid photography heritage
as a point of discussion many people
have criticized the output from Huawei
phones as being too grainy which is
actually a feature and not a bug like
engineers have consistently pointed to a
little grain as one of their methods for
making phone output feel more like film
it's not always the prettiest when pixel
peeping but you shouldn't be doing that
anyway shame on you look at the whole
composition this is purely a subjective
assessment but personally I feel this
texture helps create an organic sense of
action or movement that this moment was
alive frozen in an instant in this image
the practical side of this discussion
not allowing the little extra grain to
remain means we aren't hitting photos
too hard with noise reduction tools that
can blur out detail or create watercolor
like splotchy photos the plaza also
features a dedicated monochrome mode
using that secondary sensor that you can
see the perspective switch from the RGB
to the black-and-white camera monochrome
is a captivating way to see the world in
capture images so including a dedicated
sensor just to capture these shots fits
right in with like as imaging history if
phones are going to replace standalone
cameras for most consumers always going
to make sure you're well prepared for
nearly any photography situation
shifting over to moving images the Mait
9 in Ultra HD video for huawei the p10
continues that though it's difficult to
see any significant improvements over
last year's phone this camera produces a
very high quality video though when
handheld it's a busy image where we can
easily see hand movements on the whole
video exposure and saturation will
closely resemble still photo performance
but only the RGB sensor is used so video
won't have the same textural quality of
still photos it should be reiterated
that this system shoots UHD video using
H at 265 compression this means we
arrive at final sizes nearly 30 percent
smaller than the UHD video produced by
an iPhone 7 but Google does not
currently support this video codec
because of licensing issues h.265 is a
boon for file sizes and bandwidth but
it's frustrating that google photos
won't alert you that your videos are not
being backed up again google's oversight
here so h.265 is a bitch
here to work with but every format shift
comes with some kind of teething pain we
have a separate video also linked below
this review for folks interested in how
they can edit or upload these videos and
now we can move on in video we can also
take a better look at stabilization it's
terrific for still photos but video
looks busier than many competing devices
taking down to HD video we can also
employ software stabilization but the
combination of lens warping hardware and
software scanning produces an unsettling
pulse to video output which is more
destructive in my opinion than just
dealing with the slightly shaky er
Hardware only stabilization plus once
you get used to UHD video this 1080p
output just feels dull and lifeless the
p10 does not inherit the directional
microphone array from the may 9 but
these mics are still terrific performers
handling wind and traffic noise above
our freeway test well enough falling
behind HTC and LG Huawei has a performer
easily capable of running with Samsung's
and iPhones
lastly looking at slow motion Huawei
captures a respectable 120 frames per
second video but converting it to slow
motion in the phone we lose a ton of
data reducing overall quality
substantially it's a shame we go from a
40 megabit per second video to 5 megabit
per second video if you can edit the raw
video directly say from a computer
you'll end up with a nicer image so
let's wrap this up where does that leave
us with the cameras on the fall way p10
plus in our review of the phone we
offered the prediction that there
wouldn't be a significant difference in
overall performance between the p10 and
the p10 plus on the whole we were
correct these sensors are too small to
see a tremendous difference in bulk ik
but we were pleasantly surprised to see
a more significant change to low-light
performance the mate 9 wasn't a
low-light slouch but the P 10 plus is
now a top-tier night performer Huawei
remains one of our top recommendations
for still photographers this is
exceptional performance with incredible
controls moving beyond just trying to
impress consumers with Auto processing
flashy saturation or increasingly juicy
HDR settings this is now a worthy
platform for composition and near
professional results if we can't get
phones with larger image sensors
Huawei's dual sensor approach is the
next best thing where there's room for
improvement is on video performance
where this phone becomes an upper mid
pack performer great video quality at
smaller file sizes but we'd appreciate
more manual controls a return to the
directional microphone array and
smoother stabilization folks this is an
easy recommendation and it's an early
frontrunner to make our end of your best
camera list likely its toughest
competition will come from whatever
Huawei releases in the next mate as
