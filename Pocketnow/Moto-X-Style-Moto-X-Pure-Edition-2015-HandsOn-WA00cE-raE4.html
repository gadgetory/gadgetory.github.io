provide the fastest Avenue to consumers
at the best price
that's the question Motorola put to
itself when commissioning the new Moto X
style or Moto X pure edition if you're
in the US and the company invited us to
New York City for a quick look I'm
Michael Fisher with pocket now and this
is a hands-on with the all new Motorola
MOTO X you know what this phone reminds
me of the old Palm Pre 3 I know it's a
stretch but stick with me if the pre 3
was a scaled up pre 2 which itself
wasn't inflated first gen pre and
physically that's what the Moto X style
is it takes the best elements of its
predecessors and scaled them to a larger
size same curvaceous in hand feel same
reassuring heft more massive than ever
at 179 grams same characteristic finger
dimple same extensive customizability on
that subject we have new options in
Motorola's custom moto maker suite
including a silicone rubber soft grip
backing material Saffiano leather from
whore weaned and the traditional wood
grain options as well the metal accent
on the back calls out the primary camera
it's got a 21 megapixel resolution with
an F 2.0 aperture and dual tone flash
and Motorola also said that it collects
more light is faster to focus and
capture and produces more accurate
colors than its predecessors it's still
no optical stabilization or full manual
controls here but motorola did add a
wide-angle lens and a flash to the
5-megapixel selfie shooter around front
thankfully it's pretty unobtrusive
software on the camera viewfinder looks
much the same which you'll either love
or hate
I asked Motorola's s VP of Sales why the
company opted to go bigger yet again
with the formerly petite Moto X his
answer more and more people are using
their phones to watch movies and browse
the web so they decided to include a
panel that would make that look good
we're talking quad HD resolution here at
5.7 inches just shy of the Nexus 6
screen size
now that sounds ridiculous and you'd be
forgiven for thinking this thing's got
to be a behemoth but actually not so
much motorola has gotten the screen to
body ratio on this sucker to 76 percent
so the result is a phone that's big but
it's not as big in the hand as it
probably looks on your screen
we'll have to see though whether the
3000 milliamp hour battery is enough to
power it through a cold day especially
given the switch from AMOLED to IPS LCD
for the display technology frankly I'm
concerned motorola has made big promises
in this department before and while the
inclusion of turbo charging is nice the
lack of any kind of wireless charging is
I think a big oversight on software
almost nothing has changed we've still
got an ear stock build of Android
lollipop with the traditional moto suite
of enhancements that means you can give
your phone commands without touching it
it can read your texts aloud to you and
you can dictate replies and moto display
is back to complete with its IR sensors
so you can wave a hand over the phone to
see your pending notifications it's all
great we love this stuff you find it
very useful but Google stole or adapted
most of these features for the Nexus 6
so it would have been nice to see
Motorola give the new Moto X even more
standout capabilities the Moto X pure
Edition will come in 16 32 and 64 gig
options and you can also opt to add
microSD support and Moto maker which is
a nice extension of that service
powering everything is a Snapdragon 808
processor at 1.8 gigahertz backed up by
three gigs of RAM the Moto X pure
Edition will go on sale this fall at
Motorola combis Viacom and amazon.com
and get this it starts at $399 unlocked
that's a crazy low price point for this
kind of device with these kinds of
customizations and it's possibly the
biggest indicator yet of how mainstream
manufacturers are being forced to adapt
to a new reality in the smartphone space
whether the Moto X pure Edition will be
worth it remains to be seen but given
its unique combination of features
customizability and price
I think it stands a chance of being one
of the most significant smartphones of
the year when it launches this September
