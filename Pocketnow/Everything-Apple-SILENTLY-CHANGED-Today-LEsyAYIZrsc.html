products being too expensive well the
company has a ton of changes on their
websites that pretty much address that
we have some new features and leaks for
the Google pixel for Excel on Android
cue and Samsung just put out the Galaxy
Note in teaser that tells us that the
phone is going to be more than just a
phone I'm high memory data and grab some
popcorn there is a ton to cover
particularly with Apple that's rather
interesting this is parking out daily
the official news today begin with deals
if you're in the market for iPads I'd
recommend you go to Amazon there's
currently a couple of deals where you
get up to 250 dollars off iPad pros my
favorite is the iPad pro 11 inch but it
doesn't really matter which model you're
getting to learn more about that in the
description but Apple made a ton of
changes starting with their
back-to-school deals which are famous
every year this time you're getting up
to $200 off in the case of MacBook Airs
or MacBook Pros and you also get a pair
of beats which have nothing to do with
back-to-school but anyways you can learn
more about those in the description and
bear with me in the last segment we'll
cover everything that Apple change was
just a lot now as we move the spotlight
over to honor particularly because of we
know how much this whole Huawei debacle
has been affecting every single brand
that's into the Huawei portfolio but
still it seems that the company is still
planning to launch the successor to the
apex rumored possibly than 9x which is
that entry-level smartphone that's well
designed than well price $250
was the price for the 8x and we had
really great specifications in design
now we've gotten rumors that the 9x is
gonna bring a new caring 810 processor
that is apparently slated to compete
with the Snapdragon 730 and the thing
about it is apparently the price is not
going to change meaning 250 bucks for a
processor that's actually mid to
high-end the 730 that's what it competes
with and so yeah we've got something
that competes with that at 250 bucks
with a possible launch end of July
that's gonna be rather interesting we'll
keep you posted
now let's move the spotlight over the
Samsung and the Galaxy Note 10 we see a
new teaser in Asia for what to expect
for this phone and it's interesting
because of one
see look Alex Ino 10 is obviously that
smartphone that can do more meaning the
Galaxy Note lineup but the thing about
it is this teaser points to the fact
that we have too many devices we've got
a laptop or a computer we've got a
tablet we've got this in that and
Samsung is trying to offer us according
to the teaser one product that's gonna
be able to do everything meaning the
Galaxy Note to be able to replace your
computer replace your tablet replace
your laptop and that's a really tall
order obviously again the Galaxy Note
has been able to do more but not
everything that it's been able to do are
things that you will use constantly so
let's see how it goes we'll keep you
posted unpacked is just a couple of
weeks away and how about if we talk
about fight for the feature digital
rights advocacy group that currently
requested a nationwide ban on the use of
facial recognition because it affects
your civil liberties as it stands your
current smartphone has two facial
recognition and there are a ton of other
facial recognition features that are
currently being used for law enforcement
and the thing about it is what we've got
cities like San Francisco and Somerville
in Massachusetts are already banning for
law enforcement agencies to be able to
use this to be able to find you and to
track you into everything and it's a
rather interesting article that I highly
recommend that you read mainly because
of yeah it's a good question do you
think that law enforcement should be
able to use these things against you or
to use this to track crime because
obviously there is a positive sense to
the fact that if they're trying to find
somebody that's a true delinquent and
sure why not but what about the rest of
us that are not not out to do something
wrong that's a rather interesting topic
that we should actually consider
discussing further probably in the
podcast we'll keep you posted but yeah
what do you think should happen and how
about if we talk about Android q and a
recent post on xda-developers on some
new capabilities obviously dark mode is
one of the major features that's coming
to android q I'm currently using it on
my pixel 3 XL that I've been testing the
beta but that's all fine but you know
that when you boot up your pixel right
now you get a white launch screen with
the Google logo and
apparently even that is going to dark
mode now obviously we're currently on
beta five there is more to come we're
still not exactly sure when the final
version of Android q is gonna launch but
obviously we'll keep you posted on that
but yeah it seems that even the boot
logo is going to be changing and finally
the hottest news that I have to do with
Apple because in addition to the fact
that we've got those back-to-school
deals the company just relaunched a ton
of stuff they killd products out of the
blue and they did a ton of this silently
like there's no official announcement so
bear with me as the changes are rather
significant let's start with the fact
that the 12-inch MacBook you know that
new MacBook yeah that product is now
dead or let's call it this continue to
released we don't see it on Apple's
website anywhere so long lived that new
MacBook that I'm now happy that I didn't
buy a couple of weeks ago actually
wanted to get me one really the new
entry-level is now the MacBook Air and
it's actually got some upgrades like the
true tone display and a better starting
price of 1099 in addition to a new
higher tier model that goes up to one
terabyte of storage and then there are
the changes to the MacBook Pro where the
non touch barbarians is now dead or sort
of dead see all models now have a touch
bar but now you've got two variants with
two Thunderbolt 3 ports starting at
$12.99 and then two models with four
Thunderbolt 3 ports starting at $17.99
all models are quad-core processors but
the clock speeds are significantly
different and then probably the most
interesting changes for those of you
looking for upgrades as Cupertino is now
dropping the price on those across the
board so to give you an idea and the
past if you wanted to get four terabytes
of solid-state drive on a macbook pro
that was costing twenty eight hundred
dollars in the past
yeah those got cut in half the $1400 and
no for those of you that think that this
is also bringing the new rumored scissor
keyboard switches yeah we're still stuck
with the improved butterfly mechanism
but Apple has also confirmed that even
those that have issues will get free
replacements and yes I wish I could tell
you that we've got discounted prices on
iPhones but no those retain the same
price so yeah tons of changes obviously
we're close to a possible iPhone refresh
in September so it's interesting that we
get the Mac refreshes now
meaning I don't think that we're gonna
get that butterfly keyboard switch
anytime soon but anyways in today's
question let us know what do you think
about the changes do you think that
Apple is making enough changes or do you
think that they should also bring
discounts to their iPhone lineups cuz in
my case I think they should I mean Apple
lives on iPhones and those are not the
ones that are getting discounted or at
least not from Apple let us know what
you think about that in the comments
