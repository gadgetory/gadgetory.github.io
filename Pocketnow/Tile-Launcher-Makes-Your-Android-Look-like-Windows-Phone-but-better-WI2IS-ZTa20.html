that their smartphone looks depending on
what platform that may be easy or not so
easy to do but we always want to refresh
things on Android that's not difficult
especially when you're running tile
launch or beta I'm Joe Levi this is
PocketNow
let's go take a look this app is called
tile launcher and it tries to emulate
Windows Phone 8 with its nice tiles you
can rearrange them you can resize them
you can do all kinds of stuff with them
you can put widgets in here you can see
that I've got widgets down at the bottom
I've got widgets over here pretty much
the only thing that these tiles don't do
is animate like Windows 8 live tiles but
you can do a whole bunch of other stuff
with them adding tiles as simple as
coming in here let's take our barcode
scanner drop it right there if I want to
modify that I can tap it and resize it
whichever direction I want to go I can
move it by long-pressing and moving it
around I can tap the wrench icon to go
in and change the name if I don't want
this to be barcode scanner if I just
want it to be nothing put a space in
there I can change the background color
or image to whatever I'd like let's do a
different color in here choose a color
and then tap on the color picker let's
choose that bright lime green and save
that and now I've got it and I can do
lots of stuff if I want to change some
of the settings launcher settings in
here
general lets me change the theme from
light to dark icon pack I've got all
these kind of built-in if we want to
change to an iPhone like theme you know
an Android phone running a Windows 8
like skin with an iPhone icon pack you
know you can do that with your workspace
you can either show or hide the launcher
you can define how many screens you want
how many rows on those screens when you
get over here to tiles you can change
the background transparency of them all
kinds of fun stuff you can even
change whether you want this to scroll
horizontally or if you want it to scroll
vertically so I've got mine so it's
scrolling up and down rather than
side-to-side now I can also set up
another screen that has favorites on it
I haven't done that and I of course can
customize my wallpaper this also switch
over here looks pretty good on a tablet
the first device that you saw was my
Nexus 4 this is a nexus 10 much larger
you can see with horizontal scrolling
setup if I want to add something again
let's just do a quick widget ad here
let's add another analog clock just
because we can and we'll put that right
there we can even move that off to the
side a little bit so now we can see it
just peeking in off the side really kind
of cool it's currently in beta it's
available either from xda-developers as
an apk or from the Play Store we'll have
a link for you over at pocketnow.com
it's not as feature fill to some of the
other launchers that you may know of but
hey you know it does exactly what it's
supposed to it's quick it lets you do a
really neat kind of Windows e or non
Android you look on your Android powered
device I think it's kind of neat and I'm
probably going to run this for the next
couple days what do you think about it
head over to pocketnow.com and let us
know your thoughts in the comments over
there and you know while you're at it
why not tell your friends about pocket
now on Facebook or Twitter on Twitter
we're at pocket now it's for pocket now
