for an October launch if she sees
possible new flagship codename man-mate
reaches rumor mill and Nokia zoom
reinvented event is just a day away and
will be there live I'm hi Mary vera and
I really am hating digital zoom right
about now this is out daily
let's are they off with some product
announcements as t-mobile has downloaded
official that their Nokia Lumia 925 and
their Sony Xperia Z are now official on
the carrier as of July seventeenth
prices and descriptions in the links
down below but more interesting is the
fact that the company has now announced
a new jump program where you can take in
your old phone and they'll give you a
new one but obviously there is no free
lunch out there on the planet so you
obviously have to pay a couple of bucks
every month for this phone that you
trade back in but it is a cool deal for
you to be able to swap your phone for a
new one right now let's move over to LG
s we've got some press renders of the LG
g2 and we've also got a video of the
phone that's running on the sprint
network so let's just hope that that's
not an exclusive deal but a cycle that
we've also got a tipster confirming that
we are getting the LG Nexus 5 based on
this g2 being launched in october so
let's see how that ends up because so
far that LG g2 looks kind of very nice
now let's talk about the motorola topic
that's got everybody board we've got the
first press renders of the motorola
droid ultra line up yeah it's not just
the phone it's actually a line of
benisse phones come to supersede the
razr HD lineup and razr m so much so
that they look identical to last year's
phones but aside from that there is this
clear pixel technology that sounds like
ultra pixel and the whole idea is that
it will bring better low-light
performance to these cameras so stay
tuned for whatever these phones are
launched sometime within the unicorn
apocalypse happening in 20-25 let's
switch the spotlight over to HTC as the
variance for verizon of the HTC One has
now hit the FCC and no stop asking me if
I know when it's going to be launched
sadly we don't have any specific dates
but aside from that rumors have already
begun of the HTC code
m8 and for those of you that remember
the code name of the HTC one was the m7
so this is the new flagship that's
coming from HTC sadly we don't have any
specifics detail specs anything
apparently this will just be the
successor to the HTC One and we'll
probably see it by the beginning of next
year so stay tuned for rumor mill is it
has just begun for this phone and
finally for the hottest of the day
Nokia's zoom reinvented event happens
tomorrow July eleventh at 11am eastern
standard time in New York City and it
does prove to be a hot events the
company keeps boasting about the zoom
capabilities of this 41 megapixel camera
coming to the Lumia 1020 or 909 we don't
know what the name is gonna be but our
own Adam Lane is gonna be at the event
covering everything live and we are
going to have a live hangout a special
edition of a pocket now live we are
going to be discussing everything that
happens in the event as it's happening
obviously opinion everything please join
us at the Hangout links in the
description for you to join us as well
and well that leads me to the question
of the day what are your predictions for
this event obviously the leaks have been
so big that I don't think there's
actually room for much prediction unless
you don't know it could probably
surprises aside from that 41 megapixel
camera aside from that movie 920 design
what else could we be getting in this
new device could we be getting new hot

current Lumia devices leave us a comment
