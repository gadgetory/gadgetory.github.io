monitor an auxiliary monitor for your
laptop or for your smartphone let's go
take a look so first let's take a look
and see what comes with the on lap smart
monitor this is the 13.3 inch version
and it's 16.9 I've already opened it up
a little bit because well honestly it's
a little bit interesting I'll go ahead
and take a look at it
got some nice fingerprints on there for
you but overall very nice very smooth it
looks essentially like a huge tablet but
without any battery in it this funky
little space down here I'll show you
what that's for in just a minute
and this really really stiff hinge right
there
now there's a mounting bracket that you
actually take and you put on your laptop
and on the back of your laptop screen
essentially this slides down into it
locks in place and then it pivots open
and now you've got a secondary monitor
right there on your laptop really really
kind of cool but you know where's the
the power plug and stuff that that comes
with this well that's where things get
interesting hey you see that little guy
right there there are some putting that
down and out of the way there are some
connectors that come with this there
right down in here move that out of the
way too so you can see I haven't even
unboxed this yet go ahead and open this
one up and right here is a little
connector that plugs into that funky
little port and then an HDMI cable and a
USB cable or USB that's kind of
interesting
let's open up for the other one and this
one is well the same type of connector
that goes into the back of that monitor
and then a standard monitor port not DVI
and then another USB connector so what's
going on with this USB
that's how it's getting power that's how
it's powering up the monitor but if it
does that then really can't we just turn
this into a big screen for our
smartphones you bet we can let's go get
some hardware so let's see how this
whole setup goes together
first of all off camera I've got my
power to USB plug plugged in I've got
the on lap monitor plugged into that to
get power and you can see down here
maybe you can see it down here my power
is on there's a little amber indicator
light I also have my USB cable that I'm
now going to plug into my Samsung
branded HDMI adapter so we're gonna plug
that in that adapter is now powered up
and it's ready to go next I'm going to
take the HDMI cable from the monitor
plug it into the adapter and that's good
to go
and last I'm gonna plug this into my
Galaxy Nexus and that's good now if we
take a look right here on the screen in
just a minute it's going to go through
an auto detect and it's detected DVI at
640 by 480 that's not the high
definition that can be cranked out over
the the Galaxy Nexus right here but it's
probably the best you're gonna get so
we're gonna go ahead and scroll up and
down and you can see I've got some
jumping Asit kind of goes away when and
when we're not looking at stuff on the
screen that's kind of a little bit of a
bug with the YouTube player so don't
don't pay too much mind to that let's go
ahead and see how it looks let's search
for pocket now and see if we can find a
good video to play so here i've got the
pocket now MWC bloopers video let's go
ahead and launch that thanks just a
minute to stream will turn our audio up
now you'll notice it's playing really
good screen looks a little bit crisper
cleaner truer colors down here on the
the Galaxy Nexus as compared to the on
lap but that's really not a big deal if
you're not comparing them side by side
but you'll notice there's no audio I've
got this thing all the way cranked up to
the max there's no sound well there is
the sound is going out through the HDMI
but the monitor doesn't have any
speakers so I can't hear anything
not a problem one extra part and that is
speakers go ahead and plug those in and
now you can hear it in this case I've
just plugged in some headphones so I've
got my little earbuds right there this
could be you know desktops speakers it
could be whatever
now I'd recommend that you go with a USB
connected or a USB powered speaker so
you can just plug that into your USB hub
that way you only have to have one plug
to to worry about and it'll work great
so now you can see if I'm showing off
videos youtube netflix on Google Play
you know whatever I can
very nice down here on my monitor or
rather on my phone
but if I want to share it with friends
it's so much nicer to share this on a
much bigger screen and it's relatively
easy to do once you've got all the right
connectors and have everything kind of
plugged in the right way but now you
know how to do that now the on lap is a
13.3 inch diagonal monitor it has a
sixteen by nine resolution to it go
ahead and turn that off because it's a
little distracting the audio at least
like I said the colors are not quite as
crisp or true as they are down here on
the phone we could tweak with brightness
a little bit to at to see if we could
bring that down but overall it looks
fabulous it looks absolutely fabulous
there on the screen now this is
something that you could very easily put
into a backpack take with you camping
take with you you know on family outings
or whatnot and of course you can also
plug this into your laptop as an
auxiliary monitor there and do a dual
monitor configuration which i think is
it's probably it's true intent so let's
talk prices USB cable came with your
smart phone no problem no price there
your powered USB hub like I've got off
camera is going to run you anywhere from
five to probably around twenty bucks
depending on how many ports you get this
little adapter here this is Samsung and
branded it's gonna run you anywhere from
about fifteen to thirty dollars
depending on where you get it and the
the packaging that you get this was the
retail packaging so it was closer to
thirty bucks the ones that aren't in
retail
packaging that are in Ã´m packaging are
closer to two fifteen or eighteen
dollars plus shipping so the monitor now
the monitor comes with the stand it
comes with the connectors it comes with
everything that you need to get started
it's going to run you about two hundred
dollars and it's going to be available
on Newegg around the middle of April so
we'll go ahead and give you a link to
that so you can pre-order if you want to
very very cool we'd like to thank the
guys over on lap for sending this to us
we've got some more links that we'll put
in the the footer down at pocketnow.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
