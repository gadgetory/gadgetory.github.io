pocketnow.com and this is a software
tour of the acer neo touch s200 which
has a 1 gigahertz snapdragon processor
running on windows mobile 6.5 so you're
really going to get a feel for how fast
those devices once we kind of run
through going through some programs so
let's turn on the device and right away
you can see acer's home screen which is
basically a simple program launcher a
simple icon launcher and these six icons
can be changed and quite simply you tap
on something and it opens or you can tap
on the gear in the bottom right corner
to change any of the shortcuts so we tap
on one of them go to change the shortcut
and we can substitute another icon and
press the check mark when you're done
very simple it doesn't have much utility
because you can't see your next
appointment you can't see the weather
it's just a program launcher but on the
other hand it's very simple and it
probably doesn't use as much battery
life as a lot of the 3d interfaces you
see out there the spinning cubes and the
rotating screens and all those things
that look nice but actually use up a lot
of battery life so the minimal design is
appreciated the button to the left is
actually a button that launches the
start menu which is actually a nice
touch because it helps with one-handed
usability when you're walking down the
street you don't have to take out your
other hand to hold up the device to tap
up here you can just use your thumb to
quickly access the start menu and flick
through and then the button to the left
of that is the lock button for Windows
Mobile which will just take you into the
standard lock screen that we've seen
before okay so let's draw into the start
menu a little bit see what we have some
of these things I've added such as opera
mobile beta skyfire it doesn't come with
another browser to use such as opera
mobile which is unfortunate because even
if you install opera mobile 9.5 which is
free you don't get the accelerometer
support so turning the device over the
landscape won't flip the screen over so
let's take a look at what we have
there's a program called agenda which is
actually a calendar program that works
quite nicely so it's quite simply a
calendar we can click on any day and see
what's going on that day
we can tap on it to get an extended view
and then we can press the + button to
add a new appointment and we're taken
into a nicer looking finger friendly
interface to enter in a new appointment
you can still get to the standard
windows mobile calendar but I think this
is a nicer change to what we're used to
so let's close that go back into the
start menu here are something social
networking which is really just a portal
to four different social networks so we
can go into the facebook application
which is just the standard windows
mobile facebook application we can go
into the youtube program and we're going
to show that in a sec you can log in
with blogger you can log in with Flickr
and that's that's pretty much the extent
of the social network program it's
really just a launcher to get you into
the various programs go back in the
start menu of course we have the
marketplace multimedia let's see what's
in there we have album which is a thurs
HTC like album to access your pictures
okay so we can take a look at the
gallery we can click on a picture
accelerometer works in this screen we
can flip to the right although not as
smooth as an HTC device it's probably
just a software issue then we tap on the
screen and go back and we can get it
back into portrait pretty fast screen
rotation speed and let's go back into
that screen that we were in multimedia
so we was streaming players so that we
can access streaming video content we've
camera and we have an FM tuner and of
course you need your head set connected
to get that to work and there's the FM
tuner okay let's go back in see what
else we have if we go into preferences
we can change some system settings
different than what you get in the
standard settings menu so we can go to
wallpaper for example and change the
wallpaper of the background that you see
in the icon launcher on the main screen
so we can go to let's say this purple
one and click ok and here is the
wallpaper that has been applied very
nice let's go back in the start menu see
what else we have here microsoft myphone
you get some widgets that are common
windows mobile 6.5 like ms and weather
and msn money
office mobile and let's take a look at
the on-screen keyboard let's go into
word mobile and I'm going to start a new
document and if you've used windows
mobile before you know how long this
takes watch how fast it is on the
Snapdragon extremely fast about one
second we're usually it's about three
four or five seconds on other devices so
the keyboard is okay it's pretty good
let's do it let's do a little test here
it does have word correction although
there's no way to really turn that off
unfortunately let's take a look at the
landscape keyboard a nice wide landscape
keyboard there's not tactile feedback
like you get on some HTC devices but I
think with some practice it's a it'll
turn out to be a pretty good keyboard up
there with those from HTC acer's
keyboards in the past haven't been too
good but this one has a nice layout
large buttons you get the hover like you
have on the iPhone and HTC devices and
the word suggestions are usually pretty
good let's go to utilities see what we
have there getting started search phone
this is all standard windows mobile
stuff memory optimization this is a sign
of low quality software look at this
acer has been using this memory
optimization tool and all of its devices
and there's still this comma in the
wrong place why don't they change that
it must be a simple fix but perhaps not
there's a very low quality piece of
software that I wish acer would finally
update basically it allows your device
to automatically reset itself on a
regular basis to clear up the memory a
pretty good idea but the interface is
very ugly for that program so let's go
back into utilities and this kind of
points out one of the flaws of windows
mobile 6.5 the program launcher doesn't
stay open so I'm continually having to
go back but that's not an issue with
this device it's with windows mobile 6.5
in general and then we have a simple
backup utility that allow you to backup
and restore your phone just to make sure
that you have everything backed up now
let's take a look some of the system
settings so let's go into system and
let's see much memory we have right now
so right now about 100 mega
it's free we've got about two or three
programs open it's pretty good it's not
as good as say an HTC touch pro2 or
touch HD but it's plenty of program
memory to work with okay let's see what
else we have a utility for a gps a
program that lets you have magnified
icons in the title bar and so if i tap
up here i go to the Wi-Fi manager or the
communications manager and that just
happened because I tapped on where it
says h4 hsdpa and yes I'm in the US on
AT&amp;amp;T getting hsdpa because in my area
they have the UMTS 1900 band which is
really great if we go into backlights
points out another problem if you have
it automatically adjusts the backlight
by light sensor look how sensitive it is
the polling frequency is way too high so
you'll get the backlight switching
brightnesses on a regular basis whereas
on an HTC device or a samsung device the
pulling frequency is lot lower so that
you get a smoother transition also they
have this setting which doesn't make
sense all do detect back backlight by
battery level so the idea here is that
you if you have a full battery you'll be
at full brightness as you go down to
sixty percent fifty percent forty
percent battery your brightness will
follow which just doesn't make sense to
me so I really just leave the brightness
on a constant sort of right in the
center and click out of that and finally
let's take a look at that YouTube
application that's built in it's all the
way down here at the bottom so we can go
to the top rated videos wherever hsdpa
right now and what we can do is flick
through a picture or flick through the
thumbnails and if we find one we like
and tap on it we get this nice little
animation and then the thumbnail goes
full screens is buffering and video
playback is very smooth
so overall the software on the acer neo
touch s200 is pretty minimal which is
good considering the easter devices of
the past had so much software and
bloatware that at the end of the day
there was a very small amount of program
memory left the Snapdragon processor
absolutely makes things a lot faster
flipping through various screens and in
day-to-day usage it feels like a very
fast and snappy device we're going to
leave it up to the benchmarks to see
exactly how fast this is we're going to
do some tests with video performance and
that sort of thing be sure to check
pocketnow.com for the full review the
full wrap up of the acer neo touch and
if you're looking for an acer neo touch
s200 of your own to buy but now shipping
at clove coat UK for only about five
hundred dollars and those of you in the
market for an unlocked smartphone know
that that's a pretty good price for
device that has such a cutting-edge
processor included so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
