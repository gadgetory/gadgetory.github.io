see the iPhone Edition on the event
you'll probably have to wait a little
longer
Google is reportedly showing some
interest than pulling HCC out of trouble
and it seems that the Galaxy Note 8
facial recognition is actually not as
bad as we thought
I'm hi meta Rivera reporting from San
Diego I don't know exactly when this
videos gonna go live but we're trying
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with good products at a
good price tag as currently the Huawei
band 2 pro is for just $69 on Amazon and
the reason why this matters is because
the more I test huawei products when it
comes to fitness the more I notice how
much they get how things should be done
I mean this is one of the few platforms
that actually supports a training zones
etc you can learn more in the link of
the description even though we're rather
early believer now we already have
companies claiming when the snapdragon
845 will be available from Qualcomm and
which will be the first product to use
it turns out that xiaomi is already
claiming that the me 7 will be the first
device to have it sometime whenever that
happens the funny part is we know that
samsung pretty much always does this
exclusively for a little while so let's
see if that actually works
and speaking of samsung we've got some
very interesting developments when it
comes to facial recognition i'm not the
kind of would recommend that even though
i've been testing it on the LG v 30 and
it is really state-of-the-art and good
but one of my biggest concerns is always
how you can fool this service i've got
kids that look a lot like me and it
turns out that well people have been
testing it with photographs and it
doesn't unlock like we've seen in other
cases in the past so it does seem like
if this facial recognition is actually
really good obviously we will be testing
it during our review with the Galaxy
Note 8 and speaking of the number eight
how about if we talk about the iPhone
eight right now we don't know if it's
the iPhone edition the iPhone eight
let's call it the iPhone edition we've
got more sources claiming that because
of the numerous delays in manufacturing
with this state of the art latest and
greatest iPhone turns out that even
though you will be seeing it announced
on September 12 it won't be available
along with the iPhone 7s 7s plus or
eight eight plus whatever the number
are going to be so yeah the flagship the
best of the best is apparently going to
be announced but you're gonna have to
wait and we're not exactly sure how much
you're gonna wait and according to the
source even if you do wait there are
large possibilities that you won't be
able to get one just because of the
demand expected in addition to how much
of a constraint it is to build them and
finally the very interesting rumors that
they have to do with HTC and Google
we've been hearing the drama of HTC just
losing money for years and we heard the
rumors that the company was going to
sell its VR division and then didn't
want to sell its smartphone division but
as it turns out we've got sources
claiming that Google is one of the
companies interested actually the
company interested and given the
collaboration that Google and HTC have
been doing over the last couple of years
with the case of the pixel it makes all
the sense in the world for both
companies to actually come up with
something really cool the problem is and
I'm gonna leave it to the question today
I mean do you trust Google in charge of
HTC because absolutely every company
that Google has acquired like in a case
of Motorola has ended up coming up with
something disastrous not saying that
devices within the Motorola and Google
tenure were bad
it's just Google didn't really market
them it was I don't know I think it
could have been done better leave us a
comment down below this is one opinion I
can not wait to read from you guys
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get the news earlier before the
video was filmed well I wasn't firing
out our comment subscribe to our channel
as well for more videos like this one
you'll also follow me on twitter i'm
andras Corvette on instagram at home
it'll be better please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
I am hiya medley but I think so much for
watching we'll see you tomorrow
