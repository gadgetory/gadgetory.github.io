pocketnow.com and ten years ago we
published our first smartphone review on
pocket now calm now before that we have
been covering mostly Pocket PC stuff so
this device is the first one that has
attempted to combine the power of the
Pocket PC with a mobile cell phone so
let's take a closer look so first off
let me talk a little bit about 2002 this
was a time when everybody was carrying
you know a PDA on one hand that would do
all your contacts syncing your calendar
keeping track of that kind of thing your
email most of them didn't have internet
access though so we had to sync it with
a computer and this device is the
compact I pack Pocket PC H 3600 this
came out in 2000 and it was one of the
most powerful powerful pocket pcs of the
time color screen hardware buttons
little speaker down there and what we
have here is the Compaq gsm/gprs
expansion pack which slides onto the
device it's kind of tight there but you
can see it slides in like that and that
adds cellphone functionality to this
extremely powerful Pocket PC extremely
powerful for the time I gotta remember
this is a time when Apple was making
iPods you know that were just a hard
drive with a little greyscale screen and
the click wheel that and you know played
mp3s and that's it I have something
interesting about this design since this
PDA Pocket PC was never designed to be a
cell phone there's no speaker up here
and there's no microphone well there's
actually is a microphone but it's for
voice recording and it's up there so the
expansion pack has another speaker back
here and then a microphone down here so
what you have to do is you have to use
the screen to select your contact and
call them and then hold it to your head
this so it was like the back of it was
the phone alright next let's take a look
around the device and maybe you can turn
it out now another interesting thing
about this is this PDA was actually the
first device manufactured by HTC who is
a really popular right now so 12 years
ago
pretty nice device alright let's take a
look this is the Compaq PDA part we have
a light sensor ambient light sensors
this is the power button that is a
microphone and we have hardware buttons
which were great shortcuts for launching
programs that you used often you don't
have to touch the screen or anything
just press the button and here's the
d-pad so that goes each direction and
there's actually speaker built into that
which is quite innovative at the bottom
we have a power charger plug and we have
Aperta we have a proprietary connection
slot these were very popular
ten years ago Apple never got around to
switching to standard connection types
just mini USB and micro USB here's a
reset button so I can get the stylus out
let's look at the Styles first there's a
button to release the stylus it comes
out of there that's a reset button for a
in case it freezes up and over here we
have a internal battery switch so you
can shut that off to keep it from
completely dying and losing some of the
memory or also if you need to do a
really good reset so back at the top we
also have an infrared port this was
something that we use to transfer
information like contact cards documents
but also to connect to other cell phones
for a dial-up internet access
and here's a 3.5 millimeter headset jack
and we have a voice recorder button this
is good for recording notes later on it
was also good for doing voice command
and whether I've expansionpak on here's
our phone speaker and the phone
microphone and the power blend LED
indicator and up top
is the phone headset jack with a 2.5
millimeter headset jack and this is a
little tray for the SIM card see that
goes in there of course we got a
protruding antenna and another charging
port this includes a secondary battery
along with more memory and software for
the phone so when it plugs in and
actually installs the software alright
so let's see if we can turn it on oh by
the way it also come with a docking
station those were popular one time
these are little stylus holes and a
connection for charging as well as
syncing with your PC something you don't
see anymore so let's go to plug in
I just tap the screen to set up now ever
since I dug this out some of these black
spots started appearing I think the
screen is dying this was your first
setup
you can see how quick it is now it's
recognizing the the expansion pack
however the expansion pack battery no
longer takes a charge and no longer
powers on so unfortunately I won't be
able to show the telephone interface
that installs when you add the expansion
pack because it doesn't work anymore
there you go and here is Pocket PC 2002
which was later renamed to Windows
Mobile you can see the theme says mobile
and we have a today's screen with your
widgets and that will provide all sorts
of different information so let's go to
start here's our Start screen up here is
going to be the recent programs and we
have bunch of programs there that can be
customized let's go to settings
unbuttons we can change what each button
does log control and under menus we can
change which programs appear in this
Start menu
oh and also the new menu so when we have
that we got really easy to tabs to
create a new file or document or contact
or whatever let's go to today's screen
here's where we can choose different
themes and here's we can choose
different today's screen items so
third-party developers can install any
kind of today's screen item they want
which will show whatever information you
want to have there
so here you see we have 32 Meg's of
storage and this is a 2002 version of
Pocket PC
fortunately the expansion pack is no
longer recognized because it doesn't
work anymore
and here's our memory that's how much
storage we had on this device so you
couldn't fit them that many mp3s but we
had storage card support
if the expansion pack was working you
see two batteries here and we have
infrared connections internet connection
to a Vigo which was a way of cashing
websites to the device so that you
didn't have to be connected all the time
here's your calendar we have icons at
the bottom for choosing between the
views and we have little menus context
there's your keyboard of course you can
choose any kind of keyboard here
email combined with GPRS expansionpak
I had Wireless email anywhere that there
was GPRS reception now this browser is
based on a I II for and at the time it
was really the only browser the only
mobile browser that actually supported
HTML everything else was a whap Wireless
Application protocol notes are great we
can do handwriting recognition
of course tasks tasks
now since this was originally running
Pocket PC 2000 and it was upgraded to
2002 we're missing a few of the programs
that were available for 2002 but we
still have Word Excel infrared receive
there's your File Explorer which also
supported networking so I could go right
to a network path
there's your calculator and games of
course
and down here we have a universal search
searches all data or you can choose
different types of data to search and
there's your active sync which was
capable of doing wireless sync over
infrared as well as Wi-Fi
and exchange think with the schedule of
course a lot of these features are not
available on most of today's smartphones
now here's a new calendar appointment
and here's something interesting this is
the notes of the calendar appointment
and I can actually write in the notes
and that would sink right into Outlook
and what's more hey this is a voice
recording that will sink right into
Outlook as an attachment in the notes
field
there's your audio file and that's going
to be saved with the appointment
handwriting recognition doesn't work
very well let's choose the phone
there that's better
notes and audio attachments in the
calendar appointments something nothing
does today
what's that you want to do it for a
contact as well no problem voice
recording hello there you go that's
within a contact
now unfortunately we're missing the mp3
player the video player all these things
could have been installed if I hooked it
up to a computer that was old and it was
also capable of ebook reading audiobooks
pretty much anything except for most of
the new apps that never existed back
then
GPS navigation worked fine with this as
well if you have a Bluetooth GPS
receiver you notice this doesn't have a
camera and does not have Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi built-in but those could be very
easily added with the expansion packs so
that's the gsm/gprs expansion pack for
the compact I pack Pocket PC from back
in 2002 I was really excited about this
device because it it was really the
first time we had a really well
integrated PDA and foam which later
became smartphones so I hope you enjoyed
this video and give us a thumbs up did
and that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
