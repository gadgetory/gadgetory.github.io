a battle royale
well no but it is time for a comparison
of all the videos we're going to be
putting together here a pocket knife for
the 1+3 one of the most interesting
questions that we like to look at is
should you upgrade for oneplus fans if
you're coming from oneplus one well that
makes a lot of sense this is an easy
phone to recommend but what about if
you're coming from a oneplus 2
we're often reluctant to recommend that
one year upgrade so is the oneplus 3 a
compelling enough option for us to
change our tune now starting off with
design and build quality I think I like
the oneplus 2 a little bit better
especially how it feels in the hand the
review unit we got was this sandstone
back cover it's a really nice grippy
textured material and if you've followed
any of my reviews in the past you know
personally I'm a big fan of that sort of
metal edge with grippy backplate
combination I also like that the oneplus
2 is a little bit thicker that extra
casing helps prevent the camera module
from bulging up out of the back of the
phone and one last personal preference I
do like it when the controls for a phone
are on one side we've got the power
button and the volume rocker on the
right side of the phone now when these
buttons are properly delineated your
thumb has easy reach to control the
power and volume but really this is a
photography thing I really like when the
buttons are on one side of the phone
because when the phone is mounted in a
cradle or when you're trying to do a
ground-level shot all of your controls
are easily reached I can power the phone
on or I can change the volume or use the
the volume rocker as some kind of
shutter or zoom control I don't have to
reach under the phone or do anything
funky for that and then on a
ground-level shot I don't accidentally
depress the volume rocker or
accidentally depress the power button if
I'm bracing the phone against the ground
the 1+3 is certainly an attractive
device and really it makes more sense to
have this aluminum unibody frame than to
have a removable backplate which you
can't even get to the battery on this
phone but it's just lacking the charm or
a style and I'm not a big fan of the
camera module sticking out this far from
the back of the phone now oneplus is
addressing this with these little clip
on back plates and that's kind of fun
they even have one which resembles the
sandstone feel from the oneplus 2 it's
just not quite as elegant to solution
when it's just a part of the phone and
this thing is just sort of clipped to
the rear now both of these phones are
very similar in the hand
I do like the slightly more rounded
corners on the one plus three over the
sharper corners on the one plus two if
you have smaller Hobbit hands like mine
you've got to brace into the pad of your
hand it's a little bit nicer it's a
little bit more comfortable especially
when you're trying to reach around on a
5.5 inch screen and that gets us into
the tech on board and immediately you're
going to notice that slightly more
saturated OLED screen over the LCD IPS
on the oneplus 2 we have had some people
sharing concerns about the pentile sub
pixel arrangement on the 1+3 now in
daily operation I can't say it's
actually impacted my usage on this phone
text in fine detail still looks pretty
good we're talking about a 1080p display
at a 5.5 inch diagonal this is not the
highest resolution or most pixel dense
screen that we've used over the last
couple months when used at the distances
you normally keep your phone from your
face I think it's going to be fine where
we do have some early concerns those
when we start looking at VR applications
where you're using magnification on
parts of the screen we already don't
have the most pixel dense screen and
then you're shoving this thing as close
to your face as you can but once you
start looking at performance it's just
no contest the 1+3 just stomps all over
the oneplus 2 no big surprises we're
looking at a Qualcomm 820 processor over
the Qualcomm 810 now I know there's been
a lot of software optimizations or
probably some hardware fixes that went
into this version of the 810 as opposed
to the earlier releases from last year
but performance just still hasn't been
as consistent as we hoped it would be on
that chipset it's not the fault of
one-plus
we're really pointing this one at
Qualcomm I find when using the oneplus 2
and any other Qualcomm 810 powered phone
I just run into more consistent
situations where the phone has to catch
up to what I'm doing or it just feels
like it's underperforming or it's
catching up or lagging in situations
where I really feel it shouldn't be this
is actually most noticeable on the
keyboard where there's that significant
delay between entering and text and
having it actually populate the field
that I'm trying to use all phones can
get bogged down as you're using them but
I find I have fewer instances of those
sort of obnoxious catch-up points when
I'm using a Qualcomm 820 powered phone
over a Qualcomm 810 yeah I'm going to go
ahead and snap this on I really want
that sandstone feel on the back of the
phone and for all the optimizing we've
gone through on the Qualcomm 810 the 820
just runs
so in our anecdotal early testing we've
been getting better battery life on the
oneplus 3 it's been a nice double whammy
it's more powerful and it lasts longer
tastes great less filling and knowing
that the one plus three is a little less
compromised I looking at the future of
mobility payments and having an NFC
radio on board yeah I feel that was a
significant misstep on the oneplus 2
especially if we're talking about future
proofing a device using it for multiple
years add to that some subtle but
noticeable camera improvements and
believe you me we've got a mega camera
review planned for this bad boy coming
out soon it just adds up to an overall
better smartphone experience but I
really have to take it back to that
usability discussion
those little lags those little twitches
those little stutters now there's been a
lot of discussion about the RAM
management issues facing this phone and
it is sort of odd to see a company like
oneplus do the same thing that Samsung
did with the galaxy s6 we've got all
this RAM but we're not going to let you
use it because we're going to try and
preserve battery life for the audience
of people who are likely interested in a
phone like the oneplus we can safely
assume that's probably not the best
course of action even accounting for
that misstep it's just those little
transitions animations menus that load
quicker text fields that populate faster
that makes this feel like a nicer phone
to use so we should probably wrap this
up it really shouldn't come as any
surprise that the newer phone
outperforms the older phone but if
you're on a 1 plus 2 should you be
looking at parting with your cash to
move up to a 1 plus 3 in the past for
other manufacturers we've been very
conservative about recommending those
kinds of upgrades looking at a galaxy s6
to a galaxy s7 do we really feel enough
has changed to warrant the cost of
buying a brand new phone it's a much
more difficult argument to make when
we're talking about six hundred and
fifty dollar plus devices you start
cresting that $700 price point on a
phone and if you're not on some kind of
leasing program gets a lot more
difficult to say you're really getting
your money's worth you're flipping your
phone every year but looking at this
phone and knowing that it's only $400
it's an easier pill to swallow walking
away from the branding the flagship
killer the never settle slogans
there are definitely compromises to be
had and they're going to be trade-offs
when you move from one phone to the
other like maybe you like the casing
material
or you like the screen quality those
types of things are going to be very
granular and very specific personal
preferences for everybody out there
but when viewed as an ecosystem of
products the 1+3 feels a little bit
better future-proofed than the oneplus 2
if you have the means and you understand
the trade-offs the the compromises at
play here this one's been a little bit
easier to recommend that one year jump
as always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
our full coverage on the oneplus 3 be on
the lookout for that real camera review
because it's going to be brutal and hit
that thumbs up button for a little extra
positive reinforcement for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos Bagnall you can chat me
up on Twitter and Instagram as some
gadget guy and I will catch you all on
the next comparison</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
