2019 and even though the company left a
lot of headlines with their Nubia Alpha
back at Aoife the company has just
proven that they've got a lot more
coming in store we've got the red magic
March the Nubia X I'm gonna be event
with pocket now let's go hands-on I mean
let me begin with the Nubia X because
honestly even though this product was
announced a little while ago I hadn't
had a chance to play with it and this is
seriously something cool this is the
first phone that started this whole
trend of innovation that is now coming
to other devices that we've seen over
the last couple of weeks but like the
yotaphone with its rear panel being
eating this device fits a 5.1 inch 720p
mo LED panel the screen is tucked under
24 and 16 megapixel cameras but you can
use her both selfies and as well as
landscapes and the front side has a 6.2
six inch 1080p IPS panel with 96% screen
to body ratio because you don't need a
selfie camera at the front you can swap
between using either side by just
flipping the phone or by squeezing the
capacitive fingerprint sensor if you
don't want the switch the screens all
the time that squeezed gesture makes
sense for locking things down software
also allows for different applications
to be used on each display another neat
trick especially for gamers is that the
other display can act like two buttons
map to certain locations of the screen
you're looking at for internals we've
got six red gigs of ram up to 512 gigs
of storage and there's the qualcomm
snapdragon 845 processor on deck oddly
enough there is no headphone jack but
we've come to get used to that but we're
not used to seeing as an infrared sensor
which is also included in China price
rating just started five hundred dollars
and go all the way up to seven hundred
and thirty depending on what you pick
we're waiting on more details for a
global launch though unofficially we're
told to look for something even more
interesting in the near future now for
those of you gamers gaming phones are
all the while right now and no
has already shown us one product but now
we've got the red magic Mars and it
doesn't just matter for it being another
gaming phone my god the price tag is
crazy but let me just begin telling you
what's cool about it as well look in the
case of the Nubia X we've got a qualcomm
snapdragon 845 grand potential that goes
up to ten gigabytes while storage maxes
out at 256 gigs there's a 16 megapixel
camera at the back and an 8 megapixel
selfie shooter but those may matter less
than the beautiful LED stripe of the
back it's got all the customisable
patterns that you'll need for 18 million
colors yeah I know you've got a switch
near the top to turn on gaming suite
enabling 4d haptic sensors grant
priority and processor overclocking the
heat ship put to work the vapor chamber
cooling system as well as dedicated air
channels for additional support the
company tells us that this should keep
performance at top levels for 70% longer
than a phone without the system Nubia
really seems to like incorporating
capacitive sensors to its devices though
they've put to shoulder sensors for
screen mapping it's sort of like making
them into triggers on your console
controller what's most shocking though
is the price tag we do have a u.s. price
that starts at just 399 for the base
model advancing into models that go up
to 450 or 550 dollars depending on your
specs
we should be getting retail availability
very soon let us know what you think
about these two new Nubia devices
honestly I am very impressed ever since
the first device that I reviewed from
this company obviously the new via alpha
we're still waiting for that I was
supposed to happen in q4 2018 hopefully
MWC you never know let us know what you
think in the comments down below and
while you're at it make sure you follow
us on social media subscribe to both of
our channels English and Spanish for
