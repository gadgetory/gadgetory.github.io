pocketnow.com sprint is really pushing
the 4g function of the evo 4g and
rightly so it's the first smartphone in
the United States to have 4G data but
our question is does for cheap really
matter well in this video we're going to
try to answer that question let's get to
it okay so I'm going to start off by
talking broadly about 4G and then i'm
going to show you 4g i have 4g in my
area i live near philadelphia so i can
actually show you what it's like to use
this device as it was intended and by
the way if my voice sounds a little
raspy i'm just getting over a cold so
hopefully my voice doesn't break up too
much so 4g generally speaking is the
next evolution of cellular data we have
3g 3.5 g and now we have 3g which is
built on clears wimax network to put
this into some context on your 3g phone
that you have on AT&amp;amp;T Sprint Verizon
t-mobile or any other global carrier you
probably get speeds between 1 and say
two point five megabits per second
download speed now if you are at home on
a Wi-Fi router you would probably get a
maximum of maybe 10 to 12 megabits per
second if you had a very fast connection
on the other hand sprint 4G can do a
theoretical 10 megabits per second so if
you put it into the context of what I
just said that's like having a Wi-Fi
connection wherever you are which is a
pretty compelling prospect but as we're
going to discover later it's not so
simple and it doesn't really work so
smoothly and easily and it's not that
fast yet so what I'm going to do now is
cut to some speed benchmarks that I ran
around my town to try to get the fastest
speed possible on sprint's 4g network
then I'm going to show you a web
browsing session over 4g i'll be back in
a sec okay so before i show you some of
the speed so that I got a note on the 3g
4g and Wi-Fi connections because
obviously that's a lot to handle for a
device let me tell you how the evo 4g
doesn't the device always will favor
Wi-Fi first
we'll go to 4G second if you have it
turned on here and then 3g left and it
switches very seamlessly between 4g and
3g ifm so that is not a problem so i've
been using two different benchmarking
software versus the speedtest net
application and the other one is the
extreme lab speed test but let me show
you what I got from speedtest net I
think this is one of the most reliable
benchmarking tools I'm going to go into
results I've run a ton of tests and the
fastest that i have found was right here
for megabits per second up or down i
should say and one megabit per second up
and then was this was really in the
heart of Philadelphia I had three out of
three four g bars right now I have zero
out then now I've 14 g bar and so to me
this really represents the real world
maximum that is Kate that is this device
is capable of right now sprint says you
should be able to get up to ten or even
three to six I'm not seeing I'm not
seeing six I'm not seeing a five I am
seeing for megabits per second and it's
always about one up on average it's
about three and if you think about that
again in context of what you get over 3g
it's not that much faster right now and
perhaps Philadelphia has slowed 4g but
that really doesn't make any sense so
that's what we're dealing with now I
want to show you the hotspot application
since I do have a little bit of 4G maybe
you can get a feel for how fast it is
this is a $29 per month feature this is
a demo unit so sprint has added this to
this device and I've got it set up I put
a little password I'm going to turn this
on it's very easy to use but to bring
out my iPad and show you the speeds i'm
getting over 4g you can see i am over 4g
a very limited signal right now but
let's jump over to the ipad okay so here
we are on the ipad mmm reading the New
York Times here so I'm going to go to
settings and change my access point to
evo here it is
and over here on the EVO 4G it just said
one connected users and so it's going to
connect right now and I'm going to go to
that speedtest.net application see how
fast the speed is here on 4G we're still
on 4G we're kind of varying between zero
bars and one bar so really won't
represent how fast it is but again I
just show you some some speed benchmarks
that did let's see what we get nothing
too great and again this is one of the
problems with 4G is if you have zero
bars or one bars or two bars you're
going to get slow speeds compared to 3g
if you have you know one bars or two
bars or three bars that's depending on
sort of the granularity of the signal
strength you get a pretty fast 3g signal
you need to have a full 4g signal to
really tap the speeds of the network so
i'm going to jump to a video now where i
do have a pretty full signal and we're
browsing the web want to jump to that
now all right so we've got a relatively
strong 4g signal here right now two out
of three bars actually just had three
out of three bars want to show you what
it's like to browse the web first let's
do a quick speed test and we just
actually went down into 3g and this
actually happens a lot for no reason a
good 4g signal will go down to a 3g
signal and so we're only going to get
about one megabit per second but a
cancel this and hope that it goes back
to 4G okay so we're back in 4G let's go
to the other speed test application
really would love to benchmark this with
you watching okay so we've got a very
strong 4g signal here we should really
get to see how this thing can do my
guess is we're going to get this is this
is good so we got about 3.1 megabits per
second that's pretty representative of
what you're going to get over 4g in most
cases and about 1 megabit per second up
let's get out of this and jump into the
web and see what it's like to browse the
internet / / 4G if the internet icon
wants to respond all right here we are
on once again we've been bumped down to
3G so let me put in
okay now calm here and maybe will if you
will switch back so over 3g it's pretty
darn fast let me go into landscape just
going to jump around and hope that we're
going to go back into the 4g so i'm
going to zoom in a little bit tap on
that headline all right and finally
we're back on 4g i went to the settings
and i saw that it dropped off keeps
doing that let's go back into the
internet and hopefully we can get it so
that we're on 4g for a while so right
now we're on 4g loading pocket now calm
and let's put it back into landscape so
it's it's fast it feels as if i'm on a
Wi-Fi connection rather than a cellular
connection so let me go to engadget.com
see how fast that comes up okay so we
got the mobile version let's jump down
to hopefully the full version that
option is here it is down here to load
the full engadget experience mmm alright
so it's going to load the main engadget
page that you get on the desktop let's
see what that looks like and how fast it
loads so again it's not super ultra fast
it's like you're on a very fast cellular
connection or kind of slow Wi-Fi network
that's pretty much what it's like so
before I answer the question does 4G
matter let me point out three weaknesses
that I see of sprint's 4g network right
now that is keeping me from really
loving this 4G thing number one the
signal reliability is not as great as it
is on 3g for example i'm walking down a
city block on 3g on my nexus one or any
other phone and from block to block i
have a consistent signal if i started
four bars i'll probably be it for bars
by the end of the block on 4g that's not
the case reliability of the signals not
so good i need to get the start of the
block with three out of three
at the end of the block i'm at zero bars
so that's problem when problem number
two is that the speeds aren't that fast
right now and I've tested this you saw
the benchmarks in the center of
Philadelphia the fastest i saw was about
four megabits per second which is about
two times faster than the 3g speeds
approximately that's significant but not
not amazing problem number three of the
4g network is that it's not ubiquitous
it's not even close to ubiquitous as 3G
has become so I think that where we are
going is obviously towards a future
where every handset every smartphone has
super fast wireless internet so you can
get downloads as fast as you would get
on your desktop computer video chat
becomes possible on a lot of other stuff
that we haven't really even seen you but
right now with the 4g network in its
infancy it really doesn't matter that
much i have to tell you that using a
nexus one over 3g and an EVO 4g over 4g
feels about the same there are very few
instances where I'm like oh wow that web
page loaded fast or wow I really
download that attachment so much faster
it's just not that much of a difference
right now so does 4G matter I'd say
right now it does not matter the 4g is
somewhat any novelty really a marketing
point that sprint has added to the evo
4g 4g has a bright future there's no
doubt but right now it's a novelty
