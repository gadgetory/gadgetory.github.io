intera comm and this is the software
review of the motorola droid x2 on
verizon and this device has a dual core
processor and we are also running
android 2.2 along with the newer build
of motoblur so let's get to it so many
users in the past to really dislike the
motoblur user interface but this newer
version is much easier to use and it's
similar to an android vanilla build
opposed to other builds in the past on
less advanced phones so let's go to some
of the widgets here we'll just start
here and we'll choose some of the
motorola widgets that come on the device
so here we have some buttons in which we
can change some radios on and off we
have contacts date and time GPS toggle
of course is another radio button our
messages news and some of these other
information such as weather and stuff
like that and let's see what else we
also have sticky notes and we have
another cool one in the android widgets
let's go back to the android widgets and
we can actually update news and weather
directly from here and we can even have
some of our bookmarks lower those at let
me check here again think they're in the
here we are bookmark widget which is
pretty cool because you can add your own
bookmarked widgets directly from the
home screen so if you go to a website
that you want to view a lot all you do
is click on one of these widgets and it
will launch that website so it's a
pretty neat feature to have directly on
the home screen so now we can just go to
some of the live wallpapers and there's
nothing to original for the droid x2 the
only thing we have is the generic
android live wallpapers they come on
pretty much every other android phone
out there that comes with 2.1 or higher
so let's just get out here and we can
view some of the other wallpapers let's
see here these are other ones that come
with the droid x2 and there's just a few
other graphics um synonymous with the a
droid product line because the droid
product line is somewhat kind of a dark
and of course we all know that
lucasfilm's and George Lucas is behind
the droid name for verizon so we just
get
here let's go to some of the
applications so we'll go down here and
we have an alarm and timer it's a little
bit different than what comes on a stock
Android device pretty similar but a
little bit different we have our alarm
hairs we can set alarms we can also go
down to the menu button and we can hide
the clock if you'd like you can also
change some of the settings that's what
a timer and I changed a timer if you'd
like for cooking or whatnot so let's
just get out of here and we have Amazon
Kindle which allows you to read amazon
books directly from this I droid x2 so
if I go in here I don't have anything
synced up right now but we'll just see
how it works of course it wants to input
our information so that's something you
will have to try out if you decide to
get this device we have our browser
which does have flash 10.3 right now we
have a reskin calculator which is pretty
similar to the stock android and if i
turn it sideways it does give me 80 I
thought it would give me a scientific
elit see or vans panel so uh not too
advanced but a pretty nice I guess if
you're going to do some quick
calculations we have our calendar which
will sync up with google calendars and
here we can use some are our events and
we can also add other things to the
calendar directly from here and it will
sync up with google if you assign it to
let's see we have our camcorder which is
a pretty nice camera this device is
capable of recording up to 720p HD
resolution and it also will Geo tag your
photos and your videos directly from the
camera application so here we're on the
video camera and if I like I can just
switch it to the camera right here and
we can view some of the effects that
come with this droid x2 so here we
probably can't see too many great things
just aiming at the bottom of this table
here so a few other effects we can just
go back we noticed a zoom in and zoom
out and take a photo unlike the droid x
which had a dedicated camera button at
the top we have this on screen camera
shutter button right here so let's just
go back to the applications we have our
contacts so we can view all of our
context one nice thing about this is it
we go to the dialer we can start dialing
a phone number and it will start it'll
bring up the phone number because it has
smart dial so it's
nice feature to have I'm surprised that
other Android devices don't have this
which is a very nice feature to have in
specific here and make a phone call and
then you call a lot instead of having to
search through all your contacts so
let's see what else you know we're DLNA
which is a nice great thing to have if
you like to watch videos or upload media
directly from your device or download
things to your device from your network
drive so here we can play media if I'd
like let's see if it will work so I need
to connect one of my media servers let's
see here and just choose this and put a
video all video let's see if there's
nothing on the device right now but you
get the gist you can also connect this
to an xbox 360 and play media directly
from the FR on the xbox from the droid
x2 we have our email with many different
clients in which you can set up so we'll
just leave this loads with all these
clients in which can set up and you can
also specify which one do you want if
you have all the settings for the server
to the email client so the emergency
alerts which doesn't really have
anything on there right now we can view
our files directly from the device so we
can view the internal phone storage we
can also do SD cards let's go here see
if there's anything have no photos on
here right now but you can see how it's
easy to search through your files and if
you've noticed the screen transitions on
the droid x2 are very quick and we'll do
some benchmark tests at the end of this
little review here we have FM player of
course we will need a headset plugged in
in order to use the FM antenna and let's
see it doesn't come with this headset
which is a little disappointing but it
is nice that you are still able to have
the FM radio so let's see here we cannot
change it to let me go back where was I
at ok go here it also change it to the
speaker so you can listen work right
there from the from the speakers in the
back of the phone so just get out of
here we have our gallery which I don't
have any photos on here right now but
it's a little bit different than the
actual stock Android gallery we have our
camera roll we ever my library off
online so we can upload or download
photos from various
minus sources such as a Facebook or
Twitter or whatnot we have our friends
photos and we can also access our DLNA
servers directly from the gallery
application we have our Gmail which we
probably all seen before we have google
search which is a pretty basic and we
can search for web pages or not find
things directly from there we have our
Help Center which does give nice guided
tutorials on how to set up the droid x2
and also answer some common questions if
you have some questions about this
device I'm go to instant messaging and
there are three instant messaging
clients to choose from we have aim
windows live messenger and yahoo
unfortunately don't have facebook I am
are some of those other ones we have
google latitude which is just other
layers on the google map so let's just
wait for this to load so here we have
google latitude and we can connect with
our friends and view our friends
directly from our google maps
application so let's get out here for
just a second we have let's valve 2
which is just a demo game and I've
showed this before on other devices we
have google maps which we just saw but
we can view it again we can change the
layers i would go up here and we'll
choose a satellite layer and google maps
is really nice now especially on android
devices because you're able to get the
3d city views and we can also get the
street views and all those other great
things that are associated with google
maps we have the android market which is
similar to other android market markets
on other android devices except we have
the verizon vcast apps so from here we
can view all the dedicated verizon apps
and we'll just go back and see what else
we have we have my verizon mobile which
will give you some account information
we have google navigation which is a
very nice application it's probably what
makes Android one of the best platforms
to have is just the way that everything
is integrated all you have to do is
search for something call them to make a
reservation let's see we're calling a
restaurant you just make a reservation
get the address type navigation and go
directly to their and it's a really
quick and that that's probably the best
thing about android is the way that
everything is integrated into each other
we have our news which is a motoblur
application here we can view some of our
news and can scribe to other things who
like just go back news and weather which
is an android
ab wait for that to load so here we can
view our weather and our top stories and
some other interesting news out in the
world right now so let's see what NFL
mobile unfortunately the NFL isn't going
on right now but when they start their
new season this would be a great
application to have if you are a
football fan so we can view some news
and videos scores let's go apparently
I'm too fast for this device so let's
see just go back let's see here what
else do we have the other little videos
and whatnot and it looks like it's going
to try to play a video right now so the
video quality is really great on this
device it's are pretty fast right now
I'm connected to a Wi-Fi connection will
just get out of here and go back to some
other applications need for speed shift
which is another demo game and I'm not
really going to go into that right now
we have google places which is a nice
app if you want to find something in
your area and it's a great if you just
want to explore nearby let's say you are
in an unknown area and you want to find
something to do all I do is explore
nearby and find something to do it's a
pretty great application to have on any
Android device click office which allows
you to view app you documents directly
from the droid x2 and we can also update
and explore the let's here we have
anything on the SD cards tray probably
nothing so we'll just get out of here
and quick office is a nice application
if you just want to view some documents
we have our settings we're going to it
just a few seconds skype mobile and as
you probably know verizon has teamed up
with skype to have a integrated system
on their android devices and this a
skype application is a great thing to
have if you're in another country you
need to make a phone call or something
like that or if you just want to make
some phone calls and you don't want to
use your minutes you can use a the Wi-Fi
on your device so we're scatter there we
have google talk which allows us to
connect to our gmail or google contacts
directly from this application
unfortunately we can't make phone calls
with this particular version we have a
task manager which is nice to have on
any device especially one that is so
power hungry like the
droid x2 here's we can end applications
we can also set things to auto end if we
have an application we can set it to end
after two minutes or just go there we
have our tasks so these are a list of uh
I guess events that you wouldn't do or
something like that task that you would
have and you can set them by priority
and you can also update them directly
from this application so cal have text
messaging which is just a similar text
message so here we have one then I
signed up for NFL mobile alerts or just
get out of there voice commands which is
a built into this particular device it's
different than the voices through call
work so that's how that application
works was like no and we'll just get out
of here we also a voice search like I
said before and this is a nice great
application and another great thing that
makes Android so awesome so we'll just
click here pocketnow calm and it looks
as though it found exactly what I was
looking for so launch the browser and
it's a nice great feature to have on any
Android device so we'll just go back
home to the last few applications we
have here we have visual voicemail which
i don't think is set up right now I
don't know if it'll work over a Wi-Fi
connection either so we'll see if this
works so I have no voicemails and I can
call my voicemail and I can also
subscribe to visual voicemail let's go
back and we have YouTube which is our
final application that's brought on this
particular device and all these
applications unfortunately aren't able
to be removed unless you root your
device which is pretty easy to do and i
will post a link on the pocketnow.com
website is how to root this droid x2 so
let's go to some speed tests and we'll
be right back okay so we'll run the
quadrant standard benchmark and we'll be
right back after this is finished okay
so our benchmark results i should
mention that i did end all of the
applications that were running I got
2545 which is a pretty fast device in
here you can see the nexus one with
android 2.2 it's a almost double the
speed as the nexus one so let's do
another one I will do smart bench 2011
so we'll launch that application ok so
our device on smart bench 2011 got 2344
on proc and productivity index in our
game index we've got 2508 so a pretty
quick device let's see what's comparable
to that all these other ones have 1.5
gigahertz so it looks as though the
other one with a 1 gigahertz a processor
let's see the first one is right about
here it got 3,000 and around the same
for the game score so we'll do linpack
finally so on linpack we got 36.9 96
mflops in 2.2 7 seconds so that's very
fast of course this device does have the
dual core tegra 2 processor running at
one gig yards processing speed so it is
a pretty quick device so let's go into
some of the settings here so we can
change many settings and let me go down
to about information and oh I didn't
want to go there let me just go back ok
so where are running android 2.2 point
to which is the latest Froy you'll build
unfortunately this device doesn't have
gingerbread but hopefully it does get
updated in the near future can also go
back we can change some other settings
in here we can view the HDMI location
normally other great features that
android 2.2 has to offer so this has
been a software review of the motorola
droid x2 and if you like our videos make
sure you give us a thumbs up and also
leave comments down below in case you
missed it you can check out the unboxing
link right about here and you can check
out the hardware tour right about here
and stay tuned for the final review
