pocket now calm the Samsung Galaxy Nexus
and the iPhone 4s are two of the hottest
smartphones on the market right now and
in this video we're going to put them
head-to-head in a comparison let's get
to it okay let's get started with
pricing and availability the iPhone 4s
is available on a lot of carriers around
the world specifically in the US it's on
Verizon Sprint and AT&amp;amp;T for $1.99 $2.99
or 399 depending on whether you want 16
32 or 64 gigabytes of data space you can
also get it as an unlock device and
choose your own carrier of course you're
going to be running around $600 or more
for that privilege the Galaxy Nexus is
only available as an unlocked GSM phone
right now shipping in Europe you can get
it at clove code UK for example for
around $600 it will work on t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T in the US but a version for Verizon
is coming it's going to be a little bit
thicker but it will have LTE support and
the thinking on that is that it'll be
$299 after a new two-year agreement it's
likely that the Galaxy Nexus or in fact
likely it's it's most likely that it'll
be coming to the US as an unlocked phone
just like it's unlocked in Europe so you
can choose your own carrier and again
we're talking about 600 bucks for the
privilege of owning the Galaxy Nexus
let's talk about hardware on both of
these devices very very different
hardware in terms of feel and thickness
and screen resolution start off with the
iPhone we've got that 3.5 inch screen it
is 960 by 640 resolution making for a
pixel density of 326 which is the
highest pixel density of any phone out
there even the Galaxy Nexus which has
that full 720p display 1280 down by 720
across it's a four point six five inch
screen you might be thinking bigger is
better for screens right well some
people don't agree with that on the
iPhone the 3.5 inch screen means that
you can reach any part of the screen
with your thumb with one hand on the
Galaxy Nexus unless you have very big
hands you're not going to be able to
reach the top of the screen with one
hand thus requiring you to take out
in hand not that big of a deal but some
people really appreciate the one-handed
usability of the iPhone but also there's
a lot of people that are saying hey the
screen is just way too small on the
iPhone when you play video when you play
games it just it really lacks that that
largeness that you get with the bigger
screens of save the galaxy nexus so
let's turn them over to the side here
and take a look at hardware at its
thinnest point the Galaxy Nexus is
thinner than the iPhone and its thickest
point down towards the bottom it is
thicker than the iPhone so depending on
what part of the phone you're looking at
of course we've got this curved design
the Galaxy Nexus the iPhone for us is
just 2 wafers of glass in between some
metal let's turn over to the Mac we've
got an 8 megapixel camera on the iPhone
4s capable of shooting 1080p video wait
until the end of this video and you can
see 1080p samples from both of these
devices we've got a lower SPECT camera
here 5 megapixels on the Galaxy Nexus
also capable of 1020 p video and you'll
be the judge of which takes better video
we've got the speaker back here got the
speaker on the bottom on the iPhone and
going over the other side basically the
same kind of thing volume rockers are on
the same side on both of these devices
inside we've got a Apple's a5 dual-core
1 gigahertz CPU with 512 megabytes of
RAM inside of the Galaxy Nexus we have a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core CPU from Texas
Instruments with 1 gigabyte of RAM this
particular model is the 16 gigabyte
model but of course you can go to 32 or
64 gigabytes Galaxy Nexus this is the 16
gigabyte model and that's really all you
get you don't even get microSD expansion
so if you want more you can't have more
in terms of the actual design of the
devices we've got a large predominant
screen on the Galaxy Nexus no buttons
the buttons are built into the screen of
course on the iPhone we have the the
home button here the quintessential home
button for all I Oh s devices both have
front facing cameras proximity sensors
and light sensors which you get a little
bit different on the Galaxy Nexus and
you can see it blinking here is a
notification LED which tells you when
you have missed calls miss emails and
that kind of thing very useful so you
don't always have to turn on your screen
too
see what's going on on your phone in
terms of 4G the iPhone 4s is capable of
HSPA+ on AT&amp;amp;T on the other CDMA networks
of course you get EVDO Rev a Galaxy
Nexus can also do HSPA+ so really the
playing field is level here until you
get the LTE version of the Galaxy Nexus
which should be extremely fast on
Verizon's network so you know this story
here we've got iOS 5 here and Ice Cream
Sandwich Android 4.0 android has always
been about customization so you can go
to a variety of home screens up to 5 you
can't choose if you want to have more or
less it's always 5
you can add dynamic widgets that show
you battery life or your next calendar
appointment or the weather or stock
information on the iPhone it's still
icons and icons and icons you can make
folders but you can also make folders
now or you've always been able to make
folders on Android now they operate in
the same way that it does on iOS so we
click and drag and a little folder will
appear just like if you were to do
likewise here it kind of folder appears
and there you go so homescreen
interfaces they look similar although of
course with Android you can add lots of
widgets to your heart's content and you
can make you can install a third-party
launcher and Android can't do that in
iOS unless you jailbreak both of these
devices now have notification trays they
slide in from the bottom this was
possibly a ripoff of
Android when Apple decided to do the
slide down notification chain although
you could argue how else can you make a
notification shade of course we get that
here in the on the Galaxy Nexus here but
we can selectively remove notifications
you can do that by group when you have a
lot of notifications in iOS if you want
to access more apps in Android 4.0 of
course you hit the app tray you can
swipe to the right page to the right in
iOS of course you have to have all your
apps on the home screen there is no app
tray you just put your apps there you
can organize them into folders put them
away on different screens but there's no
way of really hiding apps that you don't
use they're always there in your face ok
so let's go back and talk about web
browsing performance very important both
of these devices have clear cache we'll
make sure that the programs are
out of memory here so we'll swipe that
away double tap and make sure that
safaris out of memory let's see which
opens faster that's always good to see
okay pretty much equal there so let's do
that and we'll go to pocketnow.com again
all cash has been cleared see which gets
there faster okay
iPhone 4s slightly faster both are very
smooth moving down the page you get to
see how the higher resolution screen of
Galaxy Nexus makes it possible to see
more on the page at one time so we've
got four stories here and we've got one
two three four five we've got much more
than four stories there so let's go to
the bottom hit desktop version lots of
images here a lot of content let's see
which gets there first over the same
Wi-Fi network by the way screen
brightness is set is the same the iPhone
4s one there let's pinch to zoom pinch
to zoom very smooth on both slightly
choppy here there's a lot going on on
the the pocket now page with lots of
images let's slide over here to this
story up here that cleared up will let
them go at different times
okay we can move down the page can zoom
in pan around let's open up the Galaxy
Nexus review which has a ton of images
so let's see which device can handle all
of these images better and while it's
loading let's see what happens we get
checkerboards here or really a blank
screen now everything is there but for a
while on the iPhone 4s kind of blanked
out from it so you couldn't see anything
let's check screen like that let's check
screen rotation suite see which can
rotate quick more quickly kind of get a
head start there on the Galaxy Nexus do
it again exact same time even with the
animation on the iPhone 4s a little bit
faster on the iPhone 4s so not that much
of a difference let's go to another
website and then we will jump into the
next test okay let's jump into another
page this time let's go to Engadget here
okay Galaxy Nexus was first there go
down the page faster scrolling on the
Galaxy Nexus let's try to hit the
desktop link can't really pinch to zoom
on a mobile site at the same time again
another page with a lot of images a lot
of complex code let's see which handles
it better kind of move down the page
while they load about it ty they're
really both of these devices are very
capable web browsing machines both are
very smooth although with the Galaxy
Nexus you just get a lot more because
the screens much larger and you have
more pixels on the screen to work with
you can also choose that full screen
browsing turned on on the Galaxy Nexus
which gets rid of this bar at the top
granting you an even bigger view of the
web alright for the next test here we're
gonna go into YouTube YouTube has been
cleared for a memory on both devices
let's see which opens it up faster boom
okay it looks like they were about at I
their iOS actually brought it forth
faster but the content didn't load as
fast as we have in the Galaxy Nexus so
let's actually search for say Galaxy
Nexus
we're going to click on the first video
we see here in which see which starts
playing first boom starts off in
landscape here looks like it was first
on a Galaxy Nexus as you can see of
course with the larger screen on the
Galaxy Nexus you just get a much larger
view you don't get black bars on the top
but both are playing the video back very
very smoothly they were within seconds
of loading but gotta say definitely a
much better video experience on the
Galaxy Nexus so let's get out of this
test ok so the next thing we're to
compare is the screen obviously both of
these have very high resolution screens
the pixel density is higher on the
iPhone 4s meaning if you take a little
square that's one inch by one inch in
you account of the pixels you have a
higher count but on the Galaxy Nexus you
just get higher resolution more pixels
overall we've also got two different
screen technologies here we've got Super
AMOLED HD from Samsung and apples what
they call Retina display which is an IPS
LCD panel which is lit differently it's
a different screen technology completely
than AMOLED which results in in some
cases act more accurate colors but you
also get washed out blacks blacks aren't
truly black and we're going to see that
in a second but what's immediately
apparent here is that because there are
more pixels on the screen on the Galaxy
Nexus we can read more at one time but
what happens when you get close in on a
letter and we did a whole video about
the 720p screen on the Galaxy Nexus
we'll put a link up in the video so you
can check that out but let's get really
close and look at the text on the iPhone
4s you can hardly see pixels in fact you
really can't see pixels it's just
extremely crisp and clear on the Galaxy
Nexus it's also extremely crisp and
clear but since we're comparing these
two devices it's a little bit less so
it's the pentile sub pixel configuration
makes it so that some pixels are
actually shared among each other whereas
on the iPhones Retina display each pixel
has its own sub pixels just thus
generating a smoother looking image so
both are very nice in terms of the
display but if
if you're if you want the best in terms
of text on the screen
definitely the 4s is the winner there
we're going to go to Safari now because
we have an image that we're going to
show you we're showing you this image
because it's got a lot of color you can
look at the difference in color but it
also has a lot of detail when we zoom in
so here we're going to zoom in on the
center and you can be the judge of which
has better color you could say that the
screen on the iPhone 4s might look a
little bit washed out some people don't
like sort of how whites and blacks are
very true on the Super AMOLED screen
it's a matter of personal preference and
which looks better to you but if we zoom
in to the detail Russia zoom in a little
bit too much you can see that both do a
really good job at recreating the detail
it's just a matter of how much you get
to see on the screen at one time and the
lever level of contrast and color that
just looks good to you so both these
devices do a very good job we tend to
think that the AMOLED screen does a
better job at making colors pop because
of that high degree of contrast and
let's see which of these devices does
better with high FPS gaming we've got
asphalt 6 loaded on both let's launch
them at the same time they're out of
program memory all right a little bit
faster with the load on the iPhone for
us let's get these into a position where
we can compare them kind of side by side
all right they're both loading
get past the screen
down the iPhone 4s a little bit faster
with the loads touch to continue looks
like I missed a touch there okay yeah
Mini Cooper always a good always a good
time going to Nassau normal race
again mini-cooper let's see what else we
got here we'll just pick the Mini Cooper
hit race at the same time see which gets
through with the load first
all right here we go
Galaxy Nexus faster load there
it's getting pretty loud I'm gonna see
the video let's just move past these and
race it's gonna be a little bit of the
different in terms of the controls here
we go
playing three different games here so if
I'm crashing into a lot of things you
can probably see why you should be able
to get a sense for nicely not steering
properly on this side you've got to get
a sense for how the FPS look I should
probably learn how to drive okay now
steering it is impossible to play two
games at one time and so the lesson
there was don't play two games at once
on two different phones it just doesn't
work the gaming experience was
definitely better on the Galaxy Nexus
because you get those really sharp
colors because of the great contrast and
also because of the larger screen makes
the game more immersive the iPhone 4s
seemed to be a little bit faster in
loading the game and it was tough to
tell we'll have to go back and watch the
video to see which one seemed to have a
higher amount of frames per second which
is always important when doing 3d gaming
so that was a comparison between the
iPhone 4s and the Galaxy Nexus two very
different devices with their own
strengths and weaknesses we're going to
add to this end at the end of this video
some 1080p video samples so you can add
that to the comparison and determine
which of these two devices does a better
job at filming high-definition video if
you like this video please give it a
thumbs up and stay tuned for that video
comparison right now so we are recording
video HD 1080p video on the Galaxy Nexus
on the iPhone for us at the exact same
time the phones are literally stacked
next to each other so you're seeing
almost the same thing probably not
exactly the same thing we're just
looking at some plants right now so you
can get a sense for how things look and
then we're
move to this other plant over here kind
of move around a little bit so we are
recording video HD 1080p video on the
Galaxy Nexus and the iPhone for us at
the exact same time the phones are
literally stacked next to each other so
you're seeing almost the same thing
probably not exactly the same thing
we're just looking at some plants right
now so you can get a sense for how
things look and then we're going to move
to this other plant over here kind of
move around a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
