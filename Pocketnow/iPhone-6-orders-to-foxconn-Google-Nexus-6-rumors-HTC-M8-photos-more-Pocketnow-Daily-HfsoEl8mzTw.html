6 units in 2014 according to Foxconn
rumors the google nexus 6 reaches rumor
mill as the LG g3 and a lighter form
factor and the all new HTC One makes
another camera appearance in high
resolution I'm hi meri beta and if I'm
not speaking Romanian just yet that's
probably because I need to decrease my
alcohol levels this is out daily
Romania edition let's start so they
offered some official news as HTC
continues with its entry-level focus for
2014 they've just announced the desire
310 in certain markets and lexical
description as this phone is entry level
but there's actually nothing entry-level
about it when you look at its design and
some of its specifications such as the
case of the desire 610 which we saw at
mwc 2014 a beautiful device that doesn't
have mid-range specs and mint rig design
as well but anyways apparently this
phone is making its AT&amp;amp;T is part of the
focus of HTC coming soon even though
this is part of efflux so we still don't
have any official word and if we want
more unofficial news the HTC m8 has yet
again appeared in front of the camera
this time in high-resolution photographs
and renders as well courtesy of epics
and so far it does look gorgeous now
let's talk about more unofficial news
that's kind of expected as Apple
continues to be disappointed with the
iphone 5c we know that the company
stopped their orders to pick a tron for
the iphone 5c manufacturing back in
december and up to this point the
company is holding 3 million units in
stock that they can't sell at the moment
apparently there are 2 million units in
factories and then 1 million units and
carriers that have not been able to be
distributed and this is just clear that
Apple does not understand the mid-level
market links to the description for
details and leave us a comment down
below tell us what you would do to sell
the iphone 5c beware apple now one thing
that apple does get right is their high
level smartphone as apparently the
company is expected to sell as much as
90 million iphone 6 units in 2014
according to some Foxconn rumors the
company is expecting these amount of
orders from Apple for this new phone and
just to give you an idea this is a
twenty-three percent growth compared to
last year's thirteen percent and this
does marked the fact that Apple is
expecting number one
tremendous growth and number two the
company would have to actually launch
this phone early for this to happen
we're expecting for the company to also
announce their new a8 chip and it's kind
of hard to pronounce that but let's see
if they really take advantage of 64-bit
processing this time now let's talk
about Sam chang and its gear lineup for
those of you that have been waiting for
the gear to gear neo or gear fit we
still don't have official date or
pricing but apparently the company is
planning to sell the gear to for 300
euros and then the gear fit and your
kneel for 200 respectively now this is
even more interesting as apparently the
company is planning to keep those
numbers for the United States and not
you know the converted number we're
actually talking about three hundred
dollars for the gear to which would be
cheaper than the galaxy gear and then
the same two hundred dollars for the
gear fitting gear neo now obviously we
still have to review this products
actually tell you they're it better than
the galaxy gear but actually almost
anything is better than the galaxy gear
before the software update so let's see
what we get these and finally for the
very interesting news of the day we get
some reports of the LG Nexus 6 and yes
LG s and LG will build this phone and
the reports are that apparently number
one the company is trying to launch this
phone mid-year which is interesting and
number two is that apparently this will
be a light weight version of the LG g3
that has still not been announced now
the question is what exactly do they
mean by light weight could it be that
it's a lighter phone and design or could
it be that it's slider on specific
ations it's kind of too early to know
that but that leads you to the question
of this video would you want different
changes for the nexus 6 what exactly
would you want for this phone because in
my particular case i'll be honest with
you the nexus 4 in the Nexus 5 weren't
really great phones even though they
were based off of great phones so I
would really want an HTC nexus 6 and not
something built by LG as again the
experience hasn't been totally positive
but leave us a comment down below what
do you want and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video was filming
