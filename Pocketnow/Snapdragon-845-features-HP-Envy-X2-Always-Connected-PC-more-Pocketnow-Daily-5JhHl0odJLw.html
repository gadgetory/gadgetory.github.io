joined forces the show is the power of
the always connected PC Qualcomm
announces the new Snapdragon 845
processor though details are coming
until tomorrow and iOS 11.2 opens the
door to Apple pay cash for the masses
I'm high metal Yvette I'm reporting from
a very windy Maui I have to close the
windows and everything but it's awesome
and we've seen a ton of awesome stuff
today
this is parking out daily as we try
every single day the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for the galaxy s 8 there are ton of
reasons why you shouldn't still a great
phone even though it's on its way out
the gear for two is now being bundled
for free if you buy the device from the
Samsung store and I've tried the gear
for two Pro it is definitely worth it
and yeah I meant the gear for two pro by
the way it is definitely a device that I
would highly recommend you get so yeah
it's definitely a good deal other
interesting news come at the hand of iOS
11.2 my iPhone 10 is currently updating
to it one of the major changes is that
Apple pay cash is now live it'll be
working in the United States for now
it's peer-to-peer cash you have to use
either iMessage or Siri and there are
certain limits that you can learn more
about and link in the description
definitely a good add-on to Apple pay
now serve up Samsung as the company has
just announced that it will begin
production of the 512 gigabytes storage
option for mobile devices now bear in
mind I'm not saying this is coming to
the galaxy s 9 apparently it'll take a
few months for the company to ramp up
probably too early for the galaxy s 9
but still the storage is going to be
available and you can expect companies
to charge a ton of money for it but hey
now let's talk about Qualcomm we are
here in Maui for their event we saw the
Snapdragon 845 processor though details
will not be provided until an event
tomorrow and we're actually not going to
cover that until a day later because I'm
pre recording the daily just to be able
to have it for you on time
so Snapdragon 845 will not be a change
in architecture it's mainly a change in
features in the past with the 835 you
could only record regular video and not
HDR video now you can in the past you
could only play it back you also get
enhancements with artificial
intelligence
augmented reality we've got gigabit
support in addition to more security but
most important more power efficiency as
well all these details again will be
shed very soon so far I'm extremely
impressed with what I've been able to
see and finally the very hot moose today
I have to do with the new Snapdragon 835
powered pcs they're called always
connected pcs and let us know in the
comments if you like this name I really
don't like it I wish they gave it
another name a more practical name like
I don't know a snap book because the
Snapdragon processor enables a ton of
things that computers can't do today
like for example be permanently
connected to the internet without
draining your battery that's the cool
thing about mobile processors we're
running a full-blown Windows 10 this is
not a baby baked version and if those of
you wondering third-party app support
there is this sort of emulation that
happens with x86 applications so it runs
everything just fine from the demos that
we were able to see it takes a little
bit to load applications but once
they're loaded they work just fine and
by a little bit I'm talking about an
extra second nothing really significant
now we saw the HP Envy x2 in addition to
the Nova go from a soos I'm really in
love with the HP Envy in particular
though I hate the fact that they called
it Envy and not just called it a new
platform because this is literally a new
type of computer 20 hours of battery
life is not more and probably the
coolest part the price tag we're talking
about a range between 600 and 800
dollars that's insane but it leads me to
the question today what do you think
about what god announced what the always
connected PC do you like them oh my god
in my case I already told these guys I
cannot wait to get that HP Envy x2 and
that Florin factor in general leave us a
