2 you already know that we're big fans
of its design but a curved display is
only half the story here the other half
is the self-healing back which LG claims
can heal minor abrasions in just 10
seconds
I'm hiya - Hugh smooth pocket now and
I'm about to beat up a perfectly good
smartphone for science last year we put
the original G flex through a torture
test to see just how well that
self-healing back holds up and in the
end we concluded that time heals most
wounds but since the resurgent back has
allegedly been improved in the G flex -
we thought we'd take another look now
before we start it's worth noting that
our flux due already had a small scratch
sitting to the right of the LG logo from
prior time with the phone this was the
result of simply handling the phone over
the past week something that should be
covered by the self-healing coating but
a lot of things can happen when you're
handling a smart phone especially if
you're clumsy or forgetful by nature and
we just wanted to see how far this
feature can go we've all accidentally
put our phone in a pocket that was
already occupied and more often than not
it's with something sharp like keys so
just like last year we threw the G flex
into a pocket with keys loose change and
a lighter before running around the
neighborhood a little bit - jumble it
all around the result was well to our
pleasant surprise the back seemed
totally unscathed and we even shook
everything up in a ziplock bag for
rougher tests and still nothing you win
this round
now surely you've taken out your phone
on the way of the car and casually toss
it into the passenger seat no well maybe
that's just us we simulated this a few
times and the phone held strong at until
our last take when it ended up tumbling
out of the car and hitting the pavement
to be fair this probably won't happen to
you often but it did save me a step in
recreating Michael's out of the car
spill from last year and still aside
from a little scuff on the bottom corner
our flex 2 is still looking bright and
shiny
this next one might not apply to you
unless you keep your phone in your back
pocket
but the curve on the flux almost
encourages it and I found myself missing
my back pocket on multiple occasions and
especially if you're out alongside the
sidewalk this could definitely be in
trouble the scuffs and marks we made
here weren't as easily faded as the ones
from before so try not to drop your
expensive phone lastly well this one
hurt you're probably not going to
encounter this problem but people are
gonna ask about it anyway deep scratches
cuts we took a knife to the back of the
phone to prove a point that just because
the phone is capable of healing minor
abrasions it's not gonna prevent major
ones please don't do this to your pretty
G flex in any case it's important to
remember that unlike that of its
predecessor the G flex 2 is back is
removable meaning that any irreparable
damage to the back can be remedied with
a simple swap just make sure to take
good care of the rest of the phone while
you're at it you've seen the abuse that
this thing can take but what about the
rest of the phone we've examined the
global annuus models of the G flex 2 and
many many more so be sure to subscribe
