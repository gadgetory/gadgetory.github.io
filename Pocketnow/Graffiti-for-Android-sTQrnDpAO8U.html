you know what most people out there
didn't start with Android they came from
somewhere well today I want to show you
something that you palme people might
like now on palm not webOS but palm way
back in the day to get text in you had
something called graffiti and graffiti
for those of you who don't know was a
text input method that let you put in
scribbles or scratches that were really
simple characters and you could use
these single stroke characters in most
cases to write on the screen and it
would be converted into text well that's
great I never could figure it out and
that's why I went with Newton but now
they have graffiti for Android so let's
go take a look okay
so what I've done is I've gone out to
the Android Market I downloaded and
installed graffiti just do a search on
graffiti and then I activated that as
one of my accepted input methods next
you need to select it so what I've done
here is I fired up Evernote and I opened
a new note now you can use any app that
has a text field in it we're gonna tap
and hold on that text field and choose
input method and this will show you all
of your installed and active keyboards
Android keyboard and graffiti in my case
we're gonna switch to graffiti and
you'll notice the keyboard was swamped
out with the graffiti pad now this
graffiti pad is divided into two areas
the letters and the numbers area and you
can see letters is quite a bit bigger
than numbers keep in mind that for the
most part when you're writing graffiti
you're writing in all uppercase with
some kind of special characters K being
one a being another these should be
really easy relatively quick single
stroke characters to write stuff and
once you get the hang of graffiti you
can be really fast at it so let me show
you what I mean we'll just do the
alphabet here really fast there's an a b
c d e kind of funny-looking f
a G like I said a G it needs that sharp
edge there you'll get an O lowercase for
H and I has a dot on top and you have a
J we'll do numbers over here 1 2 3 so
kind of cool now to switch back of
course all you need to do is tap and
hold and change your input method to
graffiti and your from graffiti rather
because we're into graffiti now to
Android keyboard and there you go you've
got your other keyboards so you can
switch back and forth and it's kind of
nice to have that quick way to jot
rather than just to come in here and
type if you want to write faster so
showing a little bit of a kick back to
the past
the graffiti input method I'm Jo for

methods on Android is pretty cool give
