pocketnow.com it's the same phone the
Nokia 808 PureView but it's a different
Park and we are taking a look at the
focusing modes and of course the
lossless zoom while recording video we
are out right now using autofocus and
let's zoom into something here this is
halfway there and this is full zoom and
just in case
autofocus doesn't work we can always tap
the zoom the tap to focus sorry and it
will be in focus let's get back to zoom
doubt mode and let's spin around and
some flowers here let's zoom in and
there we go this is as far as it goes
and let's zoom back full autofocus let's
see how it works I'm gonna step in close
to this tree with the leaves here and
it's doing okay but in case you want to
focus on a specific object you just can
tap the screen and there we go boom it's
in full focus and of course if you move
away of course
you either have to tap the screen again
like I will do right now or just switch
back to continuous autofocus another
focus mode is hyper focus which I will
enable just about now which brings
everything in focus from a certain
distance onwards but make sure you will
not do any close-ups with this mode as
it will fail to focus as you can see
right here in case you want to have a
close-up just tap the screen and there
we go
and let's see if we can zoom in some
more on this flower tap against the
focus and boom that's as far as it goes
there we go
focus is back this is too close so
probably we are 15 centimeters away from
the subject
we're crisp images so this wasn't on the
United Front pocketnow.com taking a look
at the focus modes and the lossless zoom
on the Nokia 808 PureView while
recording video thank you very much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
