calm we're going to take a look at the
facebook app for the zune HD so you can
probably get an idea of what Windows
Phone 7 series apps are going to be like
because there will be a lot like the
zune HD apps so here we are the home
part of the facebook app is our news
feed at friend requests reload button
and you can see all sorts of stuff from
your France right here is the
notifications and that'll show a red
number if you have new ones this is the
Settings button we can turn shake to
reload on so if I go like this it's
going to reload so you did that and
you'd have some new news feed items you
can also swipe like this with the status
updates and you can get the new photos
it's going to download some over Wi-Fi
and you see she posted some from our
blackberry so it's got a little black
buddy icon right there next is the one
person icon and that's me we have wall
info photos let's go to photos real
quick so these are my pictures that I
posted and I can go to that and see some
thumbnails and scroll through click on
one and unfortunately it doesn't oh yes
it does it didn't before okay you can
rotate and you can go to the next one
and I can tap on it and you're my
comments I can see the commons people
made and write my own go back another
thing that's cool is if I tap it I can
see all the people that are tagged here
okay so you can tell who they are
unfortunately you can't make your own
tags from here so let's go back to the
wall here's one that I posted yesterday
this is a status update that is a link
to the zune HD music that I'm currently
listening to so we post a nice little
picture of the album and a link so if I
clicked on that link or anybody else on
my Facebook friends click on it it would
go to the zoom net web site and load
this person's album and anybody can
listen to a preview of that song or any
of the songs and get an idea of what i
was listening to if you have a zune pass
you can stream the whole song from the
website or you can also buy it at belief
so this little zoom button right there
that's going to do that for me so right
now I'm listen to not without you or not
without yo and i can type something in
here and then post a comment along with
the link to that song if i just type in
this field that's just going to do a
regular status update over here is your
friends list and you can just search
that or sort it differently my picture
philos you to do
there we go still loading okay and you
can click on anybody and get to their
wall you also got the mail button
there's some of my inbox messages and
get your scent and you got your updates
so that's about it you can't upload your
own pictures this doesn't have a camera
anyway so that's okay and you can't tag
people yourself but that's okay but
everything looks quite nice alright
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
