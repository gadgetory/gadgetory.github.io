and one of my favorite things to do on
the iPad is play games I'm high outside
Houston pocket now and these are five of
the best iOS games you're not playing
starting the list with one of my
personal favorites bubble cloud planet
is a freemium game that feels a lot like
the old online yahoo games in my
childhood the premise is pretty simple
you start off with a grid of colored
bubbles surrounding a star in the middle
and use bubbles of the same color to pop
clusters until you reach the center
sounds pretty easy but the further you
progress the grids become larger and
more intricate with plenty of obstacles
that slow you down and more bubbles get
added to the grid as you miss shots yeah
it's sort of a mom game and the ads
between plays can get annoying but it's
crazy addicting and I've been hooked on
it for months next up is one more line
it's another game that's free to play
but ad-supported but thankfully you can
get rid of the ads for a small cost this
game tests your reflexes by making you
avoid obstacles of varying sizes as you
whiz by you can tap anywhere on the
screen to make your ship orbit the
nearest object changing its trajectory
but you'll want to be sure that there's
no other debris within the orbit less
your journey come to a shattering end
magic touch wizard for hire is another
fast paced game I'm recently stumbled
upon it's got a fun soundtrack and a
colorfully pixelated art style and it's
yet another game with a simple concept
that becomes increasingly difficult as
you progress I'm a pretty big fan of
that format as enemies descend from the
sky the balloons slowing their fall have
various symbols that you'll need to
quickly recreate in order to pop the
balloons and stop the enemies from
attacking you get extra points for
combos and it can get free crowd at a
time so you'll need to act fast if you
want to rack up a decent score pathogen
is a much more relaxed turn-based game
with a command and conquer mentality
there are different tiered cells that
you place on the board while playing
against an opponent see cells at the
lowest tier and they can be placed
anywhere on the board laying 1c cell on
top of another creates a b-cell and 2 B
cells make an a cell you can overtake
the other players cells by letting a
higher tier cell over theirs and
combining to a cell's will create a
solid mass that's no longer able to be
seized
destroyed once the board is completely
full whoever has the most blocks
occupied is declare the winner it takes
a lot of cunning and attention to detail
and it's a good way to keep your brain
stimulated throughout the day and have
fun in the process lastly I'll leave you
with one of my favorite games on the App
Store doge 2048 you've undoubtedly
already played 2048 before and threes
the game that arguably started it all
but if you like me have a love for
ridiculous internet memes and copious
amounts of Comic Sans this should be
good for a laugh every now and then save
for the animated tiles in the floating
text this game plays exactly like the
2048 you're already familiar with with
the goal of combining like tiles to
achieve the number 2048 and even go
beyond its good harmless fun and don't
we all deserve a break from a
seriousness of life at times if you know
of any other good games for the iOS and
I might have missed share them in the
comments below and get me something to
do over the weekend be sure to give this
video a thumbs up if you liked it and
subscribe to the pocket now channel for
more videos and your favorite mobile
technology this has been high on to
houston pocket now and until next time
I'm gonna go listen to some Rush and
play space invaders because that's what
the cool kids do thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
