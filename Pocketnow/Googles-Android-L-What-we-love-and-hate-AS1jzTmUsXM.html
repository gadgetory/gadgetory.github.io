important events of the year
particularly because we get to see the
next version of android and as expected
we did get Android L announced today and
it is hot there is a lot of great stuff
to talk about but if you don't want to
go through two hours of a keynote let's
talk about it I'm hi meri beta this is
pocket now and these are the things we
loved about Android L today and the
things that we feel Google should have
improved in Android L other things that
we love probably the hottest one is
material design and the reason why this
is cool is because this is Google's new
you are not just for android l and
Renault is gonna be just the initial
ticket to the way Google is gonna look
from now on we're talking about Chrome
we're talking about Google applications
the google UI and their web based
services everything is going to take the
paper elements that we see in material
design and even though some people are
criticizing that it looks a little
skeuomorphic i'll admit that it's
extremely extremely elegant it's what
we've been asking for from android for
years and yes it's definitely gotten a
lot more elegant with ice cream sandwich
and going forward but the android l just
looks amazing material design looks
amazing and it's great to see that
everything from google services to
chrome and to android is going to look
unique and unified and it's great to
know that whatever you see here on the
computer will look the same on your
phone that's great now one of the
coolest things about Android L is that
it's one operating system to rule
everything surely we still have Chrome
OS for the chrome computers and
everything is going to be Android just
yet but Android L will work on wearables
it'll work on tablets it'll work on
phones it'll work on TVs it'll work on
cars it is the same UI element it is the
same operating system only difference is
the fact that there are different form
factors and Android L will accommodate
for them there is just one sdk and
developers can take advantage of one
same UI one same user elements one same
design and then just port different
services like wearables like TVs like
everything it's great to see that Google
is using Android to expand its offerings
and I'll tell you this much Android L is
probably bigger than
we thought because we expected Android
to just be something that we saw on
phones and tablets but clearly Google
wants to use this and everything and
they have a right to it is probably one
of the greatest operating systems ever
built particularly for mobile and it's
taking advantage of everything in a very
unique way that's great now as a
consensus of almost everybody at pocket
now Android wear was the hottest thing
that was announced today we saw a
developer preview before but for the
first time ever we actually see Android
we're working on hardware and at a
school those moto 360 videos and demos
were just cool the watches are beautiful
specifically the Moto 360 WCR round
table and aside from that is the fact
that Google now finally is more useful
than it was before on the phone in the
past you have to pull your phone now now
you don't you can interact with your
SmartWatch and yes it is a problem
public etiquette that you talk to your
watch or that you look at your watch
constantly but still it is a more useful
way to have google now aside from the
fact that designs again are cool and the
fact that the whole you why is very
simplistic very useful and it allows me
to interact with everything on the watch
without needing to pull the phone out
again it is a different form factor but
a cooler one now sadly not everything at
the event was perfect and probably one
of the biggest disappointments is the
fact that the biggest problem with
Android is still a problem software
updates so garbage I acknowledged that
because they were not building a
vertically integrated operating system
it was complicated for Androids be like
other operating systems are and we do
understand that portion but the problem
is that it is extremely disappointing
for us to see these great features that
are coming in android l and this unified
UI and everything but not being sure of
our phones will be able to be updated we
can't my phones all the time and that's
just the case for everybody in the
market we don't know exactly how Android
L smartwatches will integrate with
legacy software or what the hurdles will
be here so probably one of the biggest
questions is why is Google not attending
one of the biggest issues why can't we
have a confirmation that our current
phones will enjoy all the great services
that we saw today that's probably one of
the biggest questions that we have for
Google why do we still have to deal with
this and
not necessarily a disappointment but a
lot of people ask us on Twitter and in
social networks what happened to Google
glass and Stephen Schenk even mentioned
this in our roundtable what happened to
their great accessory I mean they
mentioned wearables all the time not
necessarily just the SmartWatch isn't
still the biggest wearable the most
expensive one to $1,500 google glass
product was not mentioned that the event
last year there was a lot of fanfare
there were skydivers there were bikers
demling what Google glass can do when
today we did not see any updates today
we did not see if your investment for
fifteen hundred dollars will be worth it
eventually with this whole new google
system and finally there was one thing
that we were mixed about not entirely
happy but not disappointed we did get
hardware we did get the LG G watch we
did get the samsung gear live both great
smartwatches great designs we didn't get
any prices but apparently they will be
available later today though we don't
get any days for shipping the Moto 360
should be available soon but what is the
future of the Nexus lineup that's
probably the biggest question we were
left with we don't know what's the
future of the Nexus lineup the Nexus 7
has been historically launched at Google
I over the past few years and today we
did not get anything and actually these
tablets were pulled from the google play
store there is no stock available
anymore so we don't really know what is
the future of the Nexus lineup no
Android silver was announced we will
probably have to wait until the fall but
I guess probably the disappointment is
that we don't know what the feature is
just yet but that leads me to the
question of this video what do you think
Google did right with Android L and what
do you think Google probably missed with
Android L in our particular case
honestly we feel that Android L is great
it is the evolution of Android and its
greatest form we're just disappointed
that we don't get any hardware to play
with 64-bit processors for example but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think that's it for a quick rundown
of Android Ellen the things we liked and
didn't like about google i/o today make
sure you follow us on social media so
