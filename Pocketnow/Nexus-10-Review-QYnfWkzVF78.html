mobile tech in our lives comes in a few
different sizes we have four and five
inch smartphones seven inch mini tablets
and then the 10 inch standard or classic
size Google's just entered that 10 inch
space with their Nexus 10 let's go take
a look at it in our full review the
Nexus 10 is built incredibly well and
feels remarkably solid though only point
35 inches thin and 603 grams in weight
the tablet feels substantial in hand and
with its super grippy backing you won't
feel like you're going to drop it the
screen is fairly large at 10.05 inches
measured diagonally and has a very high
resolution 2560 by 1600 with a pixel
density of 300 PPI all powered by an
armed mal ET 604 graphics processor this
combination results in a gorgeous
display that presents vibrant colors in
deep blacks and makes text look almost
pixel lists for a very pleasant reading
experience bordering the screen are two
front firing speakers that are
remarkably loud and provide excellent
sound for playing games and watching
movies the Nexus 10 has a dual-core
Samsung Exynos 5 processor which is
based on arms cortex a15 running at 1.7
gigahertz and is coupled with two
gigabytes of RAM all in all we love the
way the Nexus 10 is built and its
specifications make it one of the
fastest tablets on the market and its
display is absolutely gorgeous though we
wish google would bring back the micro
SD card slot for external expansion the
Nexus 10 is one of the first devices to
run android 4.2 another flavor of jelly
bean being the Nexus device means the
Nexus 10 doesn't have any custom skin or
launcher then there aren't any
proprietary apps pre-installed
additionally future updates will be much
more timely since they're coming
straight from google no carriers to get
in the way android 4.2 brings multi-user
support along for the
I'd which is ideal since in real-world
use you're going to probably be sharing
this tablet with at least one other
person a family member for example
Android 4.2 brings an updated camera app
which runs very smoothly on the Nexus 10
taking photos even in photosphere mode
was extremely fast overall the software
experience on the Nexus 10 is buttery
smooth and everything you'd expect from
a flagship Nexus device benchmark scores
on the Nexus 10 or a mixed bag see our
full review of pocketnow.com for the
specific scores actual performance both
in everyday use as well as higher end
gaming are smooth and fluid with no
visible lag cameras on tablets are goofy
but the 5 megapixel shooter takes decent
pictures and even 1080p HD video at 30
frames per second tucked inside the
Nexus 10 is a 9,000 milliamp hour
battery that lasted over four and a half
days in our testing even with moderate
to heavy use gaming and movie watching
will drain the battery faster but
recharge times are remarkably quick so
you won't have to go without your tablet
for very long when it's tethered to your
charger since the Nexus 10 doesn't
currently come in a carrier version
neither LTE or hspa+ or supported so
Wi-Fi is vital as expected the tablets
Wi-Fi connects quickly holds that
connection reliably and is very snappy
supporting 802 11 a B G and n as far as
tablets go the Nexus 10 has a lot of
competition including not only other
androids but windows surface and iPads
as well in our testing the Nexus 10
scores 8.3 out of 10 losing only a few
points for the lack of an SD card and
some known bugs in Android 4.2 that
Google likely fix in an update and an
odd inverted volume button that works
exactly the way you'd expect in
landscape but it's upside down if you
ever hold your tablet in portrait our
full review of the google nexus 10 is
available over at
no calm there you'll be able to get the
full and detailed benchmark scores read
about some of our day-to-day use you'll
even be able to see some photo and video
samples and much much more if you liked
what you saw in this video please give
it a big thumbs up for pocket now
showing off the nexus 10 from google I'm
