company that brought us the Galaxy s4
and s5 active but it's always a little
strange to see a tablet built to
military specifications or almost i
michael fisher with pocket now with a
quick look at the Samsung Galaxy Tab
active Samsung consulted with a bunch of
Fortune 500 companies to cobble together
the tab active so maybe it's no surprise
that its specs don't light the world on
fire the tablet is powered by a 1.2
gigahertz quad-core processor
it's 8-inch display tops out at 720p and
its main and front cameras come in at
3.1 and 1.2 megapixels respectively a
galaxy note this isn't that didn't stop
Samsung from building in a capacitive
stylus or an extra rubber shell though
both of which come in the box of course
the people who are interested in the tab
active are the people working on the
docks and warehouses and for them
there's ip67 certification and enough
shock resistance with the rubber cover
on to withstand a 1.2 liter drop in
refreshing change of pace
there's no flap covering the USB port on
the bottom and the battery is still
removable and swappable with pogo pins
on the tablet sides for cradle charging
in the hand the active certainly feels
the part of the rugged handheld but then
again so did its s4 and s5 active
predecessors each of which had some
trouble with mild abuse during our full
review if the tab active ever comes to
the consumer market we'll look forward
to putting it through its paces
for much more vermi feh including more
