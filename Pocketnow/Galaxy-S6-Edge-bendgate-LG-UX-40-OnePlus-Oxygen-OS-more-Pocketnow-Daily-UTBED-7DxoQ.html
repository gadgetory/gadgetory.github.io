that's clearly coming to its LG g4 1
plus finally launches its oxygen OS for
the happiness of honey and Samsung is
now dealing with its own been gate
issues as well I'm hi Mary vet I wishing
you a Happy Easter for those of you that
celebrated for those of you that don't
ya today's Monday this is parking out
daily the official news today have to do
with one plus as the company has a tried
to fix the issues they left with so many
disappointments on March 27th because
they didn't launch their oxygen OS
there's now available for everyone and
yeah the update is as important as it
should be it is pretty much stuck
Android a version 5.0 in every way that
matters but with the added
customizability that one plus provides
like for example giving you the options
to move around the icons in the quick
launch tray in addition to other
enhancements there's a full video from
unpleasant links in the description so
far we like what we see other official
news have LG showing as its UX
four-point-oh in a video even though we
still don't have a phone to run it
because that will be the LG g4 that's
not yet official and this update is
really cool we're not really fans of
LG's you why when it comes to its design
but it's probably the most customizable
skin of Android out there and the
company keeps pushing it forward they
keep bringing this new you are with card
options for LG's different services in
addition to wasted drag and drop things
between LG proprietary applications as
well there's a lot to see again another
video in the description for you to
watch really cool now on negative news
that are still official sony just lost
another US carrier t-mobile is no longer
going to be selling the xperia z3 after
only five months of selling the phone
for reasons that are pretty much obvious
but we wonder if it has to do with the
xperia z4 that's being leaked for the
last couple of weeks by crazy more
importantly the cool thing about this
phone is that it looks pretty much like
a z3 in every way with the exception
that it refines design a step further we
wonder when to expect this phone
hopefully soon we continue to get rumors
of Google's mvn
project we don't know which is going to
be the carrier partner yet but we do
hear that Google is already in talks
with a lot of carriers with the concept
of looking for free roaming options now
the screamer t-mobile already does this
they give you free roaming depending on
the planet you get and apparently google
is mvno is going to try to do the same
thing give you free roaming we just hope
they do it better than t-mobile which
makes you remain stuck on edge hopefully
they'll do it on 3g and 4g connectivity
options but yeah it seems that that is
going to be one of the benefits of
Google's mb you know hopefully we will
learn more soon we are getting close to
Google i/o and finally for the news that
we were already expecting Samsung is
already getting some bad publicity when
it comes to the galaxy s6 particularly
with a been gate article from
squaretrade you know this company is an
insurance company and they publish this
video on how you can bend the galaxy s6
now keep in mind samsung already
published another video answering to
squaretrade and showing off how they
were applying too much force to bend the
galaxy s6 you could pretty much bend
anything with enough force and Samsung
just proved that yeah you can bend the
galaxy s6 edge but not with the average
of you know force that the average user
would use for everyday use I mean you
don't buy a phone to bend it and it
leads me to the question of the day what
do you think of all these you know Ben
gate rumors and news out there I mean do
you really believe that it's necessary
for Ben test to even exists a you know
in the public we're not talking about
companies that build phones because they
should test their phones for bending but
I mean what's the purpose of getting Ben
test that so much pressure when hey
that's just to get quick paid in the end
you really can benefit that way but
leave us a comment down below what do
you think and friends you know the drill
with you when I get the news earlier
before this video is spilling my chief
otherwise i'm talking about our time as
a short range of channel as well you
follow me on twitter hi man your
squirrel iveta please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw i am
paying that we better thank you very
much for watching we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
