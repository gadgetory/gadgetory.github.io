you begin to hit the scene motorola and
verizon team up for an october 18th
event for new droid and leaks now show
us what the galaxy s3 would look like
all this and more coming up right now
hello everyone I'm high never be better
with pocketnow.com and welcome to
android Revolution the show we talk
about what's hot and what's not inside
the world of Google's Android project
let's start this week off of what's hot
with so many Android smartphone or
release events every week we're kind of
in a need of a segment that only talks
about them so let's start with the fact
that motorola and verizon are teaming up
for n events on our tour 18th and all he
got is that def punked rhyme song well
not sure it rhymes but first of all it
says faster thinner smarter stronger
anyways well could this be the droid
razr that everybody's talking about
hopefully it is but hit us up on our
tour a team that will let you know if it
is or not and we also know that samsung
and google had to postpone their october
eleventh events because of their
mourning for Steve Jobs recent passing
we call it a really bold move from
google to hold that off because
obviously we all know it's going to be
really great news hopefully with ice
cream sandwich being released and also
the nexus prime or Galaxy Nexus or
whatever they want to call it so far
rumors have it that will probably be
released on October 27th in London so
we'll keep you posted all right and
speaking of Ice Cream Sandwich lots of
leaks are around of what we should
expect on probably october twenty seven
first of all we have leaks of how the
google music application will look
really nice and also how the Google+
application will most probably look so
hopefully that'll be the case but we
also even have images of what we
probably could expect for the google
nexus prime to look like and also most
probably the boot animation that we
could expect from that and hey we even
have a full gallery of screenshots of
what Ice Cream Sandwich will look like
hopefully so make sure you hit the link
in the description to look around and
see if you like it or not so far it
looks really cool and what rumors have
it that the google nexus prime or galaxy
nexus will be the first smartphone in
the market to be sporting a 720p HD
display so a lot of really cool things
are coming cross your fingers hopefully
october 27th out of the smartphone
releases for the week HTC's october six
event as we predicted was all about
Beats Audio so we got the HTC Sensation
XL which is pretty much the HTC
Runnemede that we leaked recently
and while it will be coming to Europe
and hopefully they'll come to our shores
eventually it has this massive 4.7 inch
display and Beats Audio just as I
mentioned so hit our website for full
details on specs and even some more
videos about it and amol verizon has
just officially unveiled their samsung
stratosphere which is their first QT LTE
smartphone a great specs device and also
it will cost 150 bucks after a
fifty-dollar rebates and also t-mobile
has also announced their mytouch and
mytouch q smartphones and while this
time they'll be powered by LG so far
their mid-range specs not really
something compelling but so far it looks
really good so hit us up and look at the
specs e of your interested or not some
really hot links going on in android
this week first of all we have the
leaked roadmap of what to expect for the
samsung galaxy s3 it's rocking a 1.8
gigahertz dual-core processor 2
gigabytes of ram 4.6 HD display that
means 720p and even a 12 megapixel
camera you bet that's going to be hot
and while Sprint's Motorola Admiral just
stop by the blurry cam office for a
picture and well it looks like it will
bring some sort of a hookup between the
blackberry keyboard and Android call
this the Pro Plus from Motorola coming
to our shores eventually for sprint and
while a weird name pi/3 9 200 HTC device
just hit the FCC and it has everything
to do with ATT in bands at least not
sure what to expect us there but a lot
of really good specs are coming so
hopefully they'll bring some beats audio
and probably some AT&amp;amp;T HTC rhythm I'd
love eventually hopefully and hey other
weird leaks have android sporting
blackberry messengers application and
while this is nothing new in the past we
also had windows mobile rocking
blackberry Connect which brought you
some sort of really different services
you know the rim is not only after
selling smartphones they're also after
selling software so that would be
interesting though we're not really sure
we will be willing to pay you know your
data plan and also some blackberry
services for Android not sure but at
least that would be better than carrying
an Android smartphone and a black bears
will work good point
that does it for what's hot let's
continue all with what's not we recently
got a hold of some android stats and
well guess what it has to do with how
many devices are currently rocking
Gingerbread and how many are still stuck
in Froyo or even Eclair that's right
Eclair on this decade it seems to be a
really bad and terrible result to see
that gingerbread is barely being adopted
by half the install base because it
seems that manufacturers and you know
carriers are actually not caring and the
problem seems to be that open source
doesn't prove to be a really good idea
I'd say nay but it seems that well iOS
and Windows Phone 7 are doing a really
good job importing the recent version of
iOS to most of their install base or at
least the current devices that are out
there and all you ask yourself the
question is it really making sense for
open source to be out there if carriers
and manufacturers are the only ones that
are being benefited a lot of people are
still stuck in Froyo and they really
can't do anything about it we're not
even covering how many people are
getting gingerbread recently because it
makes no sense Ice Cream Sandwich is
just around the corner and devices are
better barely getting gingerbread does
it even makes sense to buy an android
device from a carrier of the only way
you're going to get the hottest
smartphone OS from Android is buying
Google's Nexus devices really lame
that's it for today's show thank you
very much for watching I'm high metal
iveta remember to give us a thumbs up if
you liked what you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
