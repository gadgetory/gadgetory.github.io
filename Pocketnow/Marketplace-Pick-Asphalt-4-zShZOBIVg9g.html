Daniel Webster here from Park Metacom
and today i'ma show you a new game
called asphalt for elite racing okay so
the first option you have when you open
up the game it says do you want do you
want sound yes or no so I'm just like
yes because the volume is pretty low
right now so now you just need to tap
the screen to continue now you have a
few options you can have an instant play
it was just like she played the game
right off the bat career which will have
to play different levels to increase
your skill and unlock different cars
multi player which is actually pretty
neat because you can play your friends
over a Bluetooth connection so if I
click on that and click took multiplayer
race and you use Bluetooth we can
activate the Bluetooth and actually set
up a race with your friends so I'm gonna
go back and we know two options so we
can have them sound on you can also
change the gameplay so if you want it on
two km/h we can do that I'm just gonna
change it to miles you can show your
take down to take down as when you
crashed into another car and actually
get points for that go back you can
change the language display mode so we
can rotate it if we want it'll actually
look rotate to a portrait screen and
just go back to landscape this is a
little bit easier to play and go back to
that accelerometer off and reset game so
I'm just gonna click back we gots gonna
help information about and quit so I'm
going to go to instant play and it will
just take a second for the game to low
it's actually pretty fast click start to
continue and because I have the
accelerometer off I'm actually gonna
have to use the screen to drive so this
side of the screen is actually go right
and this side is to go left forward is
to increase speed so I'll need to click
forward first and then I can just steer
as you can see you'll want to collect
these dollar signs to get more money and
to stop just hold the bottom as you can
see the brake goes on and do double tap
actually causes the turbo to initiate
and the turbo will give you more speed
so it's fun on the non accelerator
version but with the accelerator on it's
a little bit easier to play surprisingly
you can also change the camera with
angles so if you want to be right inside
the cab
I can just click camera one and go back
and right now we're just directly inside
of the Mini Cooper their trip Brandon
will be happy to see that you go back
home can change the accelerometer to on
and this is much easier to play I think
with the accelerometer if your device
has an accelerometer we'll just click
back and now we can actually steer by
changing the position of the device now
if we want to stop all I have to do is
go up and the device will stop of course
we want to go faster so just move it
forward to actually go forward and go
faster to initiate the Nitro will click
forward again okay so then periodically
throughout the game you'll actually get
these little news briefs and then we'll
just continue to play so I'm actually
gonna go back get a main menu so this is
asphalt for elite racing and the game
does cost four dollars and ninety nine
cents under marketplace mobile so this
is a marketplace pick where we choose
some of the best and most useful
applications on Microsoft mobile
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
