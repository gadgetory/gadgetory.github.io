amount of zoom on Samsung devices in the
very near future if you're planning to
buy one of the upcoming iPads you'll
have to stick the bezels in touch ID and
it seems that we will have more than one
device from Nokia dem WC including a
punch hole I'm Jaime Rivera and I wasn't
asking for Monday was anybody asking for
Monday because I I wish we could have
skipped it this is party now daily the
official news today begin with deals
those of you in the market for a lot of
storage in an iPad and don't mind the
fact that it's kind of old the 2017 iPad
is currently for well it's like for 89
but that thing about it is it's the 512
gigabyte model the one they used to call
us well it was like twelve hundred and
eighty dollars you can learn more about
it in the description if you're
interested now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy M the m10 and then 20
just became official in India and
usually I won't cover these kinds of
phones but there's a reason why number
one specs are decent number two of the
visuals I mean that infinity V display
doesn't look bad at all three the most
expensive one retails I believe for a
hundred and eighty nine dollars that's
kind of crazy you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about Nokia
as there will be some presence from the
company and M the VC there always is and
now we've got teasers of what to expect
on one end it seems that there will be a
successor to the Nokia 1 which is their
entry-level that's all fine but then
we've got another teaser where we see a
punch hole and it only makes us wonder
if that's going to be the Nokia 9p
review that now has a different design
on the face because if you remember the
one that we saw had bezels let's see in
the end what we get are there could be
just a third device now for those of you
that are expecting major design changes
in iPads going forward it seems that
that's going to stick to the pro lineup
as a there is some information embedded
on iOS 12.2 that shows that the displays
of these new iPads will remain the same
bezels and either touch ID or a home
button I'm thinking it's gonna be touch
ID but whatever the case may be stay
tuned and finally the hot new stay have
to do with an uninspected twist as a if
you remember opal two years ago showed
us their zoo
mechanical technology for 5x optical
zoom the periscopic lens and everything
that was built by a company called core
photonics which is an Israeli based
company and the thing about it is that
Samsung just bought the company for one
hundred and fifty five million dollars I
believe and well we do have a teaser
that we're going to see something from
Oppo and I'm the VC so it makes us
wonder what the feature of that's gonna
be and what the feature of Samsung
Galaxy phones is going to be now with
this technology let us know in the
comments down below I mean what do you
think do you care about zoom technology
on your phone in the future or not
because I mean we've got the variable
aperture from Sami this makes a lot of
sense thing about it is we hear that we
could get up to 25 X zoom digitally
which is crazy but we would love to know
what you think in the comments down
below
