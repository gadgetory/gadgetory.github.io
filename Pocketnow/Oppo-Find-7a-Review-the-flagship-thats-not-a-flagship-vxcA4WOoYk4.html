on the scene but it's one that we here
in the US don't have a lot of experience
with this year it's announced two new
clan chips a high-end and low-end model
they are both fine seven and the find 7a
the letter of which we spent a lot of
time with is it worth the buy I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is our
for review of the Aqua fine 7 8 Appa has
been turning heads lately with both
compelling products and precision
calculated teasing of its upcoming
devices the m1 and fine 5 from the
Chinese manufacturer most notably proof
the Oppo could be rather competitive
with much larger more globally
recognized brands and now the fine 7 and
fine 7a are doing the exact same Oppo is
making a statement it's ready to take
its smartphone business to the next
level is the fine 7/8 that for the
company or will we have to wait on the
fine 7 or even its successor we spent
nearly three weeks using the fine 7/8
and this is what we found from the
outside the fine 7 a may not immediately
catch your eye
there wasn't much about its design that
makes it stand out at first glance it's
not unlike a more squared Nexus 5 and
even under closer inspection it doesn't
exactly look gorgeous especially not
after reviewing a phone like the One m8
this phone is precision machined that's
very clear but it's made mostly of a
matte finished plastic and has a very
stark appearance the face is almost
entirely black save for a really neat
notification LED which the company calls
skyline notification it's a blue light
that subtly oscillates with new
notifications and it's easily the
standout feature of this home's design
the edges are squared paired with the
large physical signs on the phone it
makes the phone somewhat difficult to
handle one-handed it measures one
hundred and fifty two point six
millimeters tall 75 millimeters wide and
9.2 millimeters thick and it hits the
scales at a hefty 170 grams
it doesn't nestle into the palm of your
hand like other phones despite the
curved backside that aside the phone
doesn't come light on specifications
even if it's the lower in counterpart to
the fine 7 it has a 2.3 gigahertz
quad-core Krait CPU and Adreno 330 GPU
which make up the Snapdragon 801 SOC 16
gigabytes of fixed storage with a micro
sd
our slot for up to 128 gigabytes 2
gigabytes of RAM a 2800 milliamp hour
battery a 13 megapixel primary camera
and a 5 megapixel front camera it also
comes with a standard subset of
connectivity options bluetooth 4.0 Wi-Fi
b/g/n NFC and varying LTE support based
on different markets and the display
it's quite gorgeous at 5.5 inches in
1080p resolution the IPS LCD is par for
the course for high-end smartphone
displays the colors are vibrant and
blacks are fairly deep side visibility
is acceptable as is contrast and the
display at 401 PPI is as crisp as you
can hope for unless you wait for the
fine sevens 2k display we have no major
complaints about this phone's display in
fact we really don't have any complaints
about the hardware or design either as
understated and bland as it may be it
may not stick out at all but it's not
ugly and it's built incredibly well at
the very least it feels worthy of a $500
price tag software we imagine will be
hit or miss for the mass consumer market
yup I find 7/8 comes running Android 4.3
beneath what Apple calls color OS
visually the software has a lot in
common with my UI or me UI a popular
Chinese custom Android ROM with a very
robust theme engine a very similar if
not the same theme engine is present on
the find 7a here you will find ample
ways to customize the appearance and the
experience of your device from a custom
lock screen to heavily customised home
screens icons and accent colors you can
change practically everything about how
the UI looks and feels which is nice
color on the find 7a also comes with a
ton of bloat not from any particular
carrier but instead directly from Oppo
out-of-the-box that comes with things
like sound recorder flashlight compass
Kingsoft office app encryption data
monitor power manager data saving guest
mode holiday mode permission monitor
block a handful of games and more there
are a lot of visual differences which
definitely contrast the typical
experience for instance the settings
application is pretty heavily customized
divided into three categories general
sound and display and even the home
screen has some non-standard
functionality such as exclusive spaces
the photo space allows you to take
pictures directly from the home screen
we're not sure how functional or helpful
this actually
access by pulling down from the top edge
of the display is a gesture panel it
allows you to draw certain shapes to
launch user definable actions worth
noting is that there's no shortage of
ways to wake up the phone those very
same gestures from the gesture panel can
also be used from standby mode to launch
you directly into various applications
double tapping the capacitive home
button will also wake the device and not
unlike touchless control the mode wakes
you can speak okay snap dragon to wake
the device and begin a Google Voice
Search
the software is elaborate and
feature-packed but that doesn't
necessarily make it great it's pretty
cohesive and refined but like some other
customized versions of Android it's
packed to the brim with features many
may never use and overall it feels sort
of sterile we're not moved or compelled
by it in any way on a lighter more
positive note performance is spectacular
a Snapdragon 801 as we've seen in the
past is an absolute beast it slices
through everyday tasks with ease and it
even powers through the most intensive
gaming without a problem we have
experienced a few performance hiccups
like some stutters on the home screen
and more aggressive app closing than we
experienced in the One m8 which has
comparable specifications by the way
power users should have no problem
putting the Oppo find 7 a through a lot
of abuse it's built to handle the
toughest of workloads
we had some trouble testing call quality
and data speeds on our us unit but our
editor-in-chief Anton used the European
model in his neck of the woods and
reports average code quality and data
speeds noting that the fine 7 a
comparatively offered a stronger than
normal signal than its competitors in
particularly problematic covered areas
without a data or voids connection we
had to turn to Anton once again for
battery metrics thanks to the large
display the 27 hundred million power
battery only offered comparable battery
life to devices like the One m8 or
galaxy s5 on light or moderate usage you
can expect a full day out of the phone
put on heavier days you'll need a
supplementary charge at some point which
is actually not a major issue the fine
7/8 comes with what Apple calls rapid
charge or 30 minutes can charge the
phone up to 75% it's fast and it's
something we're going to miss when using
other phones the camera is actually a
high point for the find 7a outdoors the
13 megapixel camera is capable of taking
really impressive images indoors it
struggles a bit
more often than not pictures taken in
dim light will turn out a bit blurry
with soft focus resting the phone on a
solid surface definitely helps but some
will still be littered with noise the
key feature of the camera however is
actually very impressive super zoom or
ultra HD mode allows the 13 megapixel
camera to take 50 megapixel images a few
weeks ago we uploaded a video showing
off the feature in short the 50
megapixel images often turn out better
than the standard 13 megapixel pictures
the fine 7/8 isn't the best mobile
camera but it's certainly a capable
shooter and Oppo super zoom mode is
something we truly enjoyed overall the
fine 7/8 is actually a very impressive
smartphone the Snapdragon 801 assure
stellar performance the display is
gorgeous the camera won't hit or miss
could be far worse and rapid charge all
but snuffs out any battery life issues
oh and that notification LED is just
sweet for $4.99 to find 7a is a great
smartphone the software may take some
getting used to for most but the
complaints are far and few between with
this particular phone the fine 7a and
fine 7 could be the phones to finally
put Oppo on the global smartphone map
