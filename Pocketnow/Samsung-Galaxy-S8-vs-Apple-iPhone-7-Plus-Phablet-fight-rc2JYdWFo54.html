brought to you by D brand the issue with
doing comparisons we're always working
with devices multiple months apart
putting latest and greatest up against a
phone released late last year which
should give you some indication as to
how this comparison is going to go but
if you were in the market to buy a phone
today these would be your options
starting off with design Samsung scores
an easy win here the s6 with Samsung's
first glass back phone but from then to
now we see more evolution than what
Apple has been able to accomplish over
the same amount of time the main
differences from the iPhone 6 to the 7
plus are new color options and this
bulging camera housing which would
likely force you to buy a new case for a
phone that is otherwise identical to the
older iPhone glass versus metal is still
a fun debate down in our comments owing
to personal preferences though I enjoy
metal backbones more than glass but I'd
still like to see any manufacturer
experiment with other materials for
premium devices carbon fiber Kevlar
ceramics the tech discussion between an
Android and an iPhone is always tricky
and specs mean different things for
different operating systems the iPhone
has always been able to eke out terrific
performance with less stuff packed
inside the galaxy packing cual comes
bleeding-edge chipset feels comparable
in daily use this isn't really a win or
a lot more this is the threshold we
should expect from premium handsets now
what's not a contest though is display
area the iPhone has a fairly mediocre
screen to body ratio especially against
the s8 where this infinity display was a
primary focus for Samsung this year
display quality is a closer fight though
where the seven-plus is one of the more
accurate LCDs we've reviewed and our
galaxy is a touch on the ruddy side
there's also a question about resolution
where the galaxy wins for having the
more pixel dense screen but it ships out
of the box with that resolution reduced
and it makes us question the practical
benefit of resolution density for
general consumers is 1080p all you
really need to bait down in the comments
Samsung's moved a few bits around for
this screen and the traditional home
button is gone in its place a software
home button with a pressure-sensitive
bit underneath the glass there's no
difference between a light tap or a hard
press that activates the vibration so
the iPhones approach to a button was
home button is more consistent and
maintains the feel of hardware better
apples touch ID is also more familiar
for the iPhone faithful with Samsung
moving the s8 fingerprint sensor to the
rear ergonomically I shift the galaxy in
my hand less to unlock so here I prefer
the occasionally smudged camera over the
greater likelihood that I might drop a
phone when using it one-handed where
Apple used to have a nice lead for
biometric security Android is largely
caught up especially for mobile payments
and third-party app support where the s8
takes the win is in greater flexibility
for securing your phone as simple or as
strong as you want from face unlock to
the fingerprint sensor to the iris
scanner encryption and passwords galore
you should be able to keep prying eyes
out of your more sensitive information
for big multi media focused bright
screen phablets the iPhone takes a win
for runtime in our battery tests the S
eights larger battery capacity closes
the gap well but Apple's smaller screen
and OS optimizations deliver noticeably
better efficiency the script flips on
recharging we're using the included
chargers the iPhone is one of the
slowest we've reviewed to top off the
fuel tank the s8 is a solid performer
here and offers wireless charging is a
fun perk now we have crazy in-depth
camera reviews for both phones if you
check out the playlist link in this
video's description you can see in-depth
performance and compare these two
directly as a quick summation core
photography performance for both phones
feel similar to their respective
predecessors the iPhone will be one of
the most consistent performers for folks
relying on auto modes has better HDR
output and better slow-motion video
the secondary zoom sensor is also a fun
feature in good light but not one that
will be relied on as a core photography
improvement the s8 takes the win for
low-light performance still has the
absolute fastest autofocus performance
we've ever tested and is a boon for
folks who want to dig a little deeper
into manual controls and options as the
better all-rounder for a larger swath of
our audience the galaxy takes a win here
and I honestly never thought I would say
this in a comparison against Apple but
the s8 also takes a win for audio we
enjoy the stereo speakers on the
seven-plus but the 10 year earpiece can
introduce some unpleasant highs in some
audio while the s8 is only a Mono firing
speaker it performs much better against
the iPhone
than last year's phones samsung also
kept the headphone jack and we're happy
to report this year
it delivers playback numbers right in
line with apples quality is the near
time so Samsung wins for the convenience
of not having to diddle a dongle and the
Galaxy arrives with nicer earbuds in the
box lastly it is important to reference
software I don't think anyone would be
surprised that the iPhone has the more
cohesive ecosystem Samsung's editions
provide terrific flexibility in
customizing but that also means Samsung
inherits some of the deficiencies of the
Android platform
one such deficiency that's been coming
up a lot with my family's messaging apps
just trying to set up a video call with
relatives almost sells iOS all by itself
that said the SA is an absolute
powerhouse for multitasking split view
and multimedia performance thanks in
large part to Samsung's customizations
and ditto ergonomic considerations we're
not only the width of the hardware but
software plays a part in making the
galaxy a bit easier to use on the go so
let's wrap this up where's that leave us
between the Galaxy S 8 plus vs. the
iPhone 7 plus we're giving the s 8 the
overall win here for pushing more
boundaries but the bang for buck battle
is a bit closer than we would have
imagined for all the talk of an Apple
tax $19 more will double the built-in
storage over NSA plus and these two
still reach parity on a number of
lifestyle features like enhanced water
resistance dollar for dollars you do get
more stuff with the galaxy but the core
feature comparison gets us a lot closer
than we would have thought so this
really sets the stage for Apple's next
iPhone we're seeing a general squeeze on
premium hardware we're sales at the high
end or plateauing and mid-range err
competition is fierce
rumors point to the most aggressive
hardware update and Apple iPhone history
but Rosso expecting
to match as luxury gadgets get closer
and closer to that thousand dollar mark
we'll be revisiting this battle later in
the year to see if Apple leapfrogs the
galaxy and how a future note might
rejoin the battle and of course we want
to hear from you what can manufacturers
do to continue encouraging consumers to
part with more and more cash at the high
end of this market share your thoughts
by dropping us a comment down below this
video
