pocketnow.com recently Samsung invited
us to New York to get some intimate
hands-on time with the Galaxy Note 2 so
we used it as an opportunity to compare
it against the galaxy note 1 to check
and see how the s-pen software has been
updated to make the s-pen more usable we
also wanted to test the performance of
the beast
of that is the Galaxy Note 2 with 2
gigabytes of RAM and a 1.6 gigahertz
quad core Exynos processor so we've
really wanted to test the performance of
the device and see if it's as amazing as
it should be so in this video we're
going to give you a closer look at the
Galaxy Note 2 before it comes out let's
get to it and so here's the note 2 and
sorry for the reflection or any other
kind of weirdness I'm actually doing
this on a chair because it's a better
background than a white table so let's
take a look at the note closely we've
got this really nice grey finish around
the outside and on the back you're going
to get that same fingerprint magnet
effect that you get on the galaxy s3
it's kind of a shiny coating that
definitely picks up fingerprints but
it's really handsome looking and this
Galaxy Note the Galaxy Note 2's feels a
lot more substantial than the original
Galaxy Note which almost kind of felt
like an experiment right because they
were taking basically what was then the
galaxy s2 putting it on a massive
display and making the screen resolution
higher and so what you got was kind of a
prototype looking like device in
retrospect where's the Galaxy Note 2
looks like a well-put-together package
it's very reminiscent of the galaxy s3
in fact let's take out the galaxy s3
getting told you there might be some
weirdness in this video because they're
kind of doing this away from everyone
else to get quiet yes I did just drop
the phone this is for all journalism
here here's the galaxy s3 2 very similar
devices we get that elongated home
screen button we've got the same kind of
coatings even the proc sensor and the
front-facing camera are in the exact
same location let's whip off the back
battery
cover here which is over here we've got
a 30 100 million power battery on the
original note it was just and I'm saying
just just it's huge 2500 million powers
kind of a similar configuration back
here to what you get on the galaxy s3 if
you look at the location of the or the
placement of the SIM card slot the Micro
SIM slot and also the micro SD expansion
slot now the screen on the Galaxy Note 2
is bigger by 0.5 inches per technically
its point 3 inches because the screen is
actually five point five five inches
making it approximately 5.6 inches and
it's a 16 by 9 aspect ratio it's 720
down there 720 cross by 1280 versus 1280
down and 800 across so it's lower
resolution but as you're going to see in
a second it's an improved screen so you
can't see pixels it's not pentile
anymore and now something that they did
because the screen is longer the device
itself is less wide it's kind of hard to
show you here with one hand but as you
can see it's about two millimeters less
wide but it's also yes so lightly taller
but barely
and slightly thinner you're not going to
notice the difference in thinness what
you're going to notice is the weight and
the feel and the kind of finished miss
if that's a word of the galaxy note 2
like I said it feels like in Galaxy s3
but a lot bigger so let's turn on both
devices here
both of these are Super AMOLED and we're
going to take a close look at the screen
different software here we've got
jellybean on the right I might have to
change the orientation of camera here
jellybean on the right and Ice Cream
Sandwich on the left I'm going to get
really close on the screen on he
actually let's move the Google Play icon
here on the pentile galaxy note you can
see pixels if we move over to the same
exact icon on the galaxy note 2 you
cannot see pixels it's actually a little
bit more blurry which is kind of a
strange effect kind of makes sense
because it's a lower pixel density but
technically the screen on the Galaxy
Note 2
is is better and Samsung claims it's
their best screen yet and you know it
does look really really nice both of
these screens are on max brightness
right now so you get that kind of really
nice really nice look and feel let's do
some basic speed test we're not going to
really get into it much until we get
this back in the pocket Neff Labs we're
going to launch the app tray and again
this is a little difficult with one hand
we're going to kind of flip around you
definitely get that jellybean smoothness
on the galaxy note 2 it's just a nice
fantastic fluidity if we bring down the
notification tray and that is a huge
jump going all the way up there this is
not a one-handed device no doubt about
it we get some interesting enhancements
up here if you pop out the Simchat sim
car if you pop out the s-pen so we're
going to do an emit you're going to see
that you can actually you get to see
some shortcuts here and we've got our
notifications here which you can swipe
off a screen one at a time we've got a
quick toggles up here as usual but yeah
this is definitely definitely jellybean
shall it be
okay so let's start with it turned off I
finally have two hands here that I can
use we're gonna turn it off and take out
the s pen the s pen start has been
improved so let's take a look at the S
Pen on the original note here
it's definitely thinner less tall that's
wide little less ergonomic and also
Samsung claims they improve the
rubberiness of the tip that's a word I
just made up so let's take a look at
some of the really cool features of the
S Pen let's go into this is one of my
favorite features we're going to go into
s planner
okay so here's s planner and here's a
really cool thing that you can do with
it if you go into edit mode you can
actually get a lot of those you can
actually draw on the calendar which is
super cool and of course this doesn't
really sync with anything so it's only
useful if you're using it on the Galaxy
Note 2 but it's just really cool to be
able to actually do that with a calendar
but you can't really do that on any
other device you can highlight stuff you
can circle stuff what happy face is when
you know various things happen that's
one really cool feature another cool
feature is that if we go into the email
app which is over here we can write
directly into emails so if we go to
create a new message and sometimes this
go down here can actually write into a
message or you can sign your name and
what this does is as far as I know it
converts it to basically an image so the
person on the other end will get an
image kind of like a digital signature
now there's a lot Samsung has done with
the hover capability now on the original
note you could turn on the ability to
see the mouse pointer right when you
move around on the screen but Samsung is
taking this a step further so for
example you can hover over an email and
if you hover a long enough you get a
little preview and this works in a lot
of different places like in the photo
gallery problem here is that you can't
really specify the time right so
sometimes it takes three seconds
sometimes you get into a good little
rhythm here and it kind of
opens up a lot quickly some other cool
things you can do is you can double tap
on the screen while holding the button
and get a note anywhere and this is kind
of like the pop-up view style thing
right so you can start you know you can
write you can go back to your home
screen let's say someone has called you
and you want to you want to write down
phone number you can kind of keep this
on your screen as long as you want or
you can expand and go you can go into
the full S note application which many
people are used to and close it from
there another cool thing that Samsung is
done we're going to go back to the email
app and we're jumping around a lot
there's a lot to show you
camera person might be getting heavy
hands another thing you can do we've got
to find an email with a link all right
we found the email with a link click on
the link and we've got this new thing
called web everywhere all right so if we
tap on that they have it always open we
will get an actual pop-up screen so you
don't have to leave the email
application let's say someone sent you a
link to somewhere you still want to read
the contents of the email you can still
do that but now you can have this
awesome pop-up view Samsung really
expanding upon this paradigm where you
can have information so presented on top
of other information which is super cool
now there are some other uses for this
hovering functionality and let's change
the keyboard so let's go to the they
were showing the website or chicag
because if you go to the web version
there's a problem right and this is this
is a problem inherent to all mobile
devices all of these are hover menus
that you can only use if you are on a
desktop computer but as you probably
have guessed if you hover the S Pen over
there you get that full desktop
experience which is something I've never
really seen before and it's really
useful to be able to actually interact
fully and this happens a lot restaurant
websites are really flash based content
where there's some sort of gallery or
something that you need to hover your
mouse on and now you can do it nicely
with the s-pen and of course we have the
other jellybean features like Google now
is here got project butter so everything
is quite smooth it feels nice there's a
lot to this phone there's a lot Samsung
is
to really increase the usability of the
s-pen we're going to have full coverage
on this device and talk about all of
those little things that it does because
right now I'm just going off of memory
and there are many other things that
this thing can do we're also going to
have a full comparison in the future
with the Galaxy Note so again we'll be
back soon if more that's it for now so
again we're going to have a lot more
coming up on the Galaxy Note 2 once it's
for sale once we get one here in our
control pocket now labs environment
where we can slow down a little bit and
really do benchmark tests and web
browser comparisons and everything you
know that we like to do on new hardware
but hopefully this gave you a better
idea of what's coming with the galaxy
note 2 because you're going to see a big
release of this device here in the US
and around the world
if you like this video please give us a
thumbs up and let us know in the
comments what you think about the Galaxy
Note 2 and whether you're going to get
one that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
