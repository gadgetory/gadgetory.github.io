pocketnow.com and this is the hardware
tour of that new acer tempo m900 this is
a very close competitor to the HTC touch
pro2 because it is a very similar form
factor there's a lot of similarities
there's also a lot of differences we're
going to cover all of the similarities
and differences in an upcoming
comparison check our Twitter for that
twitter.com slash pocket nail tweets
you'll know when it hits so let's talk
about the m900 the screen is 3.8 inches
diagonal across which is actually a
little bit bigger than the touch pro to
the touch pro 2 is a three point six
inch screen and by comparison the touch
HD actually has the same size screen as
the m900 and that's the largest screen
size that they make on mobile devices
right now until the toshiba tg01 comes
out which will have a four point one
inch screen this sort of form factor the
small cell phone like form factor really
only goes up to three point eight inches
and this is really the top here the
resolution is 800 down and 480 across so
that is wvga the greatest that Windows
Mobile can support and let's zoom in to
the top here up here we have a front
facing video camera and a light sensors
to the right of that you saw a blinking
LED indicator light there are actually
two one tells you if you have new
messages and the other one tells you if
you are charging your device it turns
red and let you know that it's powering
up the screen is totally flush it's a
very interesting looking screen because
it's a very shiny very reflective which
looks kind of high class at first but as
we're going to find out later in this
video and later in the review the device
actually has a cheap feel to it and I'll
explain why in a minute now if we go
down we see some hardware keys so we
have skol start we have GPS which is
configurable you can change it it just
launches Google Maps mobile we have the
fingerprint reader we're going to talk
about that a second to the right of that
is the button that takes you home and to
the right of that is the call end button
now what's really unique about this
biometric button is that it has many
different functions so you can use it to
protect your device when it goes on so
just anyone can't pick up your device
and use it you have to swipe your thumb
or your finger to get it to activate you
can also use it to lock all of your pin
information so your calendar and your
contacts and your email if again you
have this at work and you don't want
anybody to get into your stuff you can
lock the pim applications also this will
double as an optical mouse cursor
there's an option to change its function
to the mouse cursor so that you get a
kind of samsung epix like mouse cursor
moving around on the screen and it's
really great for one handed usability in
addition you can make it into an
eight-way d-pad which is really helpful
when you're going through web pages and
emails so you can just kind of brush
your finger around here not have to
touch the screen and scroll down in an
email really great addition I think and
we're going to talk about how well it
actually works in the review go over to
the side we have a charging and syncing
and audio port this is a mini USB we
have a scroll wheel which is always
always a welcomed addition and they
haven't been really adding these two
devices lately it's on the left side of
the device which is a little bit awkward
especially if you're right-handed but
this will help you scroll through emails
and that sort of thing to the right of
that is the external microSD slot which
kind of feels cheap when you lift up the
flap but it's good to see that we don't
have to lift up the battery cover to get
to the micro SD card slot as is the case
with the touch pro two on the bottom
there's a microphone on the other side
we have a camera button which is dual
action because it has autofocus to the
right of that is the software set whole
here is a hardware programmable button
that's automatically set to notes and
one thing you should take note of this
button feels very very cheap it kind of
sticks out unevenly just one of the
reasons why I think it has low build
quality and here we actually skip the
stylist stylist feels very cheap it's
collapsible it doesn't feel great like
it does on the touch pro 2 so there I
that we have the power standby button
and on the top it says gps now let's
flip over to the back on the back it
looks like there's a piece of brushed
metal and it's actually not in metal
it's a piece of plastic with brushed
metal design on it which still looks
quite nice we have a really interesting
looking area surrounding the camera here
it's a 5 megapixel autofocus camera with
flash and we're going to talk about
photo quality and video quality in the
review and then we have a big grill for
the speaker right next to the camera now
of course the m900 has a nice slide out
keyboard the spring assist isn't as
strong as it is on the touch pro two you
see I'm moving it up slowly and up it
caught right towards the top whereas on
the touch pro two I would bring it up
real slowly it kind of caught in the
middle rather than towards the top now
let's zoom into the keyboard and talk
about what you get on the keyboard the
keys are quite large just like it is on
the touch pro two and actually the
keyboard is about the same width as it
is on the touch pro two which is good
for people with large sized hands so you
can have enough room here the keys take
a little bit of effort to press more so
than the touch pro two there in an
offset pattern which is more ergonomic
there's an oversized space bar which I
don't know if it really serves a purpose
stuff to get used to typing in terms of
key layout we have some nice keys that
will let you not have to touch the
screen and keep all your fingers down
here we have soft keys on the right on
the left we have a start menu button
here ok button d-pad style buttons over
here so really good lending to usability
and not having to touch the screen
here's a big problem the period and
comma R require you to press the
function key to get to them which is
ridiculous I mean this is the most is
the most commonly used punctuation marks
and they are hidden behind the function
key very annoying but that's how they
design the keyboard in addition you have
to press the function key to get to the
letters here it's not like the touch pro
2 where you have a dedicated number row
at the top of course not all devices can
pull off something like that and if we
look closely at the keys we see that
they're kind of raised towards the
bottom which allows you to feel for them
while you're typing it's a pretty good
keyboard and we're going to have a full
a full opinion on the keyboard coming up
in the review on pocket now calm in
terms of in hand feel the m900 feels
large it like it should it's got a full
keyboard of course in a large screen so
it's going to feel large but in
comparison to the touch pro 2 actually
feels a lot more large even though it's
only a little taller a little
later and about a millimeter or two
thicker it's just because the touch pro
2 is designed so well that's very sleek
very rounded edges has a good weight to
it the materials feel very high quality
whereas in the m900 the edges are more
squared-off materials feel very
plasticky buttons jiggle all over the
place in fact when you press the ok
button in the upper right corner of a
program get a little play in the screen
here makes it feel low quality and if
you open up the screen you can actually
jiggle back and forth a little bit so
there's definitely a difference in the
in hand feel I really prefer that the
the in hand feel of the touch pro 2 to
that of the m900 but again the m9
hundreds of lower-cost device so that's
what you have to expect so coming up
soon we're going to talk about the
software on the m900 there's a ton to
talk about Acer's really added a lot of
stuff to this and we're going to talk
about the 3d interface the show
interface that ACR is added on top of
windows mobile and we'll be back soon
with that in case you mix the unboxing
video I'll put a link up on the video
right now so you can go and watch that
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
