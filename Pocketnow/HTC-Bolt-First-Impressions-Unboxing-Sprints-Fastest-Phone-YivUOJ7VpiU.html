HTC isn't quite done with 2016 and we're
taking our first look at this beauty the
HTC bolt is offering a curious
collection of components so let's get it
out of the box and set it up cracking
open the traditional HTC white flat
packaging we're greeted first by the
phone no surprises there under the tray
we have a little sleeve full of papers
will never ever read a Qualcomm quick
charge er to spec charger and a pair of
earbuds with a USBC connector on them
now the first boot was refreshingly
quick and SATA process was handled
quickly not having been on Sprint for a
while you forget about those PRL
notifications and updates once we're
through those we start with an odd pair
of home screens the second with a trio
of app shortcuts curious selections and
sloppy placement and wouldn't there
usually be another widget or something
for folks to interact with widgets and
wallpapers notwithstanding this is
familiar terra-tory blinkfeed returns
for a stream of news in addition which
feels increasingly redundant for folks
who have been using google now and after
a couple minutes setting up the phone we
got this annoying pop up can't get rid
of it we have to click on it and this
isn't really a deal I can claim my free
apps I can get Twitter for free thanks
HTC and Sprint first impressions in the
hand this hardware is why we like HTC it
really is a pretty phone it's a modern
look bold corners and sharp edges the
gentle curve from the 10 is gone for a
harder flat slab it's a very similar
profile to the pixel XL but thanks to
the hardware controls on the front this
bezel doesn't feel like quite so much
wasted space there's a mash up feeling
here smashing in HTC 10 and an a9
together this is also the first aluminum
unibody phone to have enhanced water
resistance in IP 57 is a nice step up
from previous HTC s no stereo speakers
here though just this bottom firing
audio and say goodbye to the headphone
jack one of HTC's strongest features the
bolt supplies a pair of USBC earbuds
that look pretty nice we'll have more to
say about them in our real audio review
a 16 megapixel camera is on tap with UHD
video and high-quality audio recording
there is optical image stabilization but
it looks like HTC is walked away from
laser assisted autofocus and that's
about where we need to leave it off for
now we have a lot of questions about
this phone a Sprint is using it as a
showcase for their LTE plus carrier
aggregation system we're expecting some
quick download speeds and areas with
good signal and we're looking to war
drive around LA to test some of those
claims also we're very curious to see
how this thing performs HTC had a tough
run last year with the early build of
the Qualcomm a10 so folks are surprised
to see HTC returning to that well after
how well the 820 has been performing
recently we're on the cusp of 2017
phones arriving with even newer chipsets
yeah we have a lot of questions and
we're sure you do too so don't be shy
