Pocket now was the Huawei honor 5x and
we received a killer little update this
year with the honor 6x so it only seemed
right I should tackle this review to
where 2016 will be remembered as an
amazing year for mid Rangers
it looks like 2017 is already off to a
strong start pushing a higher quality
experience to even lower price points
this honor was my backup phone for CES
and it performed admirably where my v20
was something of a production phone back
up camera and interview recorder I
ultimately relied on the honor 10
actually keep me in touch with the rest
of the PocketNow team on the ground
fulfilling fairly different roles it
really shouldn't come as a surprise that
the 6x outperformed the LG for battery
life not once did I have to top it off
during a busy and long day to stay in
touch we're hitting the lg cameras often
meant needing at least one recharge wall
on the show floor all around the 6x is
built nicer than its predecessor seems
can still be felt when running a thumb
over the phone but it's better pieced
together and less jarring than the 5x
though I wish the top and bottom rear
panels could match the metallic rear a
little closer in color personally I
prefer the look of the darker grey 6 X
with the black front bezels and some of
those material pieces look more
consistent on the darker phone rounding
the rear helps the phone feel a bit
thinner in the hand and the placement of
the fingerprint sensor is near perfect
for that on-the-go one-handed unlock not
only a quick performer for a budget
phone we still get all the bun tricks
like dropping the notification tray as a
gesture a 5.5 inch 1080p LCD is
respectively bright almost matching the
output of Huawei flagship like the mate
9 it was best in Nice AMOLED high
contrast mode but it's plenty readable
in all the direct sunlight for a 20-17
gadget we would have liked a USBC
connector instead of microUSB
but as this phone will battle current
Moto G's it's not too extreme a
compromise to make to save a few bucks
and what might be a challenge for some
though is the software skin
pre-installed my prediction from our
first look video we have been spoiled by
the mate 9 and the newest flavor of emui
the honor 6x takes us back to emu I
which also returns us to an odd mashup
of iOS style home screens no app drawer
with widgets cluttering up the
organization and a vertically split
notification shade you can install
another launcher like Google now or Nova
Launcher and there's some customizing
you can achieve with themes but we do
hope that we'll get emui 5 at some point
to return us to a more traditional
Android layout easily also expect some
value added bloat on this phone
booking.com CNN lyft TripAdvisor already
for you to uninstall if they aren't apps
you're apt to use and while the software
might turn a few folks off we can't
fault the performance the 6x moves on or
over to a cure in chipset away from the
qualcomm six one five found in last
year's phones now depending on the
benchmark you might use the keren 650
delivers around a sixty percent
performance boost over its predecessor
this is within spitting distance of the
Newark welcome 625 mid-range chipset and
is nicely competitive at this sub $300
tier the phone could still benefit from
a little polish in optimization however
a handful of my favorite apps do not
play well with this Kirin 650 like
onedrive or 8s 64 and while fine for
casual games more graphics intensive
fare will put a strain on this Hardware
so I was happy to see Marvel future
fight played respectively well when
turning down the graphics quality
settings garnering the most attention of
course is this dual camera setup
partnering a 12 megapixel main sensor
with a 2 megapixel companion Huawei's
dual sensor tech is formidable for
maximizing light and filling in details
the 6x is no exception
photo output punches way above this
price tag and we're really happy to see
nearly the same expansive list of modes
we would find on the more expensive
honor 8 including full-featured manual
controls and support for raw capture
through third-party camera apps
providing dual sensors means we also get
to play with Huawei's wide aperture mode
a smart software blur which delivers a
pretty bouquet to the backgrounds of
your photos output here feels a little
more artificial than on more expensive
always but you judiciously you can get
some great results out of it another
feature which punches well above this
phone
price tag unlike the like of branded
hallways the chicks act seems to deliver
more aggressive JPEG saturation but
overall we think this is a fun system to
shoot with once the user takes a minute
to acquaint themselves with where all
the settings live the weak link here is
video the honor captures a decent if
unremarkable 1080p without any hardware
or software image stabilization it's
fine with somewhat compressed output but
every video will be on the shaky side
it's one area where welcome 6:25 chipset
is outperforming this Kiran in providing
4k video capture audio playback on this
phone is also a bit weak speaker
playback is improved over the 5x our 6x
sounds less hissy but overall the
speaker's still on the tinny side
headphone output is somewhat poor though
below even the LG g5 a slightly higher
noise floor paired with a rather weak
amp means this won't be a budget
audiophile solution but at least Huawei
is consistent with their products amp
and DAC quality scale with price from
the cheaper honor through the Nova and
up to the mate 9 in this day and age
we'll still be happy to see a dedicated
3.5 millimeter headphone jack and it
will get the job done for most a
leestown tracking needs on inexpensive
headphones but the 6x struggled to drive
my $75.99 at maximum volume that brings
us to the battery where we've already
mentioned this phone is a strong
performer on our media test streaming 30
minutes of HD video over Wi-Fi at 190
Lux the 6x drained about 6 percent of
its battery right in line with most
Android flagship phones even though the
6x is still on Android marshmallow we
got very good standby time accidentally
leaving it on in my travel bag pack for
about four days after CES to find very
minimal battery drain recharge times are
somewhat slow however using the included
charger for 30 minutes only resulted in
a 22% top off no super charging here so
let's wrap this up
where does that leave us would be
honored 6x well what a great little step
up over last year improved aesthetics
and build quality more based storage and
a killer little camera at $250 it's not
quite burner
territory but it makes a compelling
argument for folks who want to save some
cash and own a new phone outright it
competes very well against established
players in this year like the 16
gigabyte Moto G 4 plus and the axon 7
minutes which is exactly the kind of
company we want to see on or keep for
their entry-level handset launching so
early in 2017
we hope to see this trend continue to
evolve bringing better experiences to
the sub $300 phone market as always
