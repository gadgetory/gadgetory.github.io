calendar appointment at the bottom nice
big clock to see and a lock up here with
number 14 says tap or slide if i tap
that it's going to show me a missed call
icon and email icon says 13 messages so
if i slide that it's going to go
straight to the email and here's the new
home screen this is touchflo 3d again
and we have a flip calendar we have a
nice blue logo in the background if I go
to the next one see our logo still still
appears here it shows throughout which
is nice and I your contacts can flip
through and as well as all people this
third icon there just like the touch pro
2 and other diamond two variations has a
facebook link so we can see also
birthdays and up here we can link to
matching profiles on Facebook see it

application icons and folders here

no weather showing up i'm not sure why
that it but you can navigate that pretty
nicely mixes stocks same as others

that flicks pretty well sometimes it's
lots of load and a guy your zoom slider
that works pretty well
after that and got music same as usual
looks like that library all nice blue
theme here
sometimes takes minutes lewd and it
should come up with album art
next is whether pretty much the same
just with their new ATT theme
and here's the programs tab you got
marketplace that's windows mobile 6.5
internet explorer Teeter windows live so
that's pretty nice and we also have our
new start menu ATT is customize it a bit
so it has four columns of icons as
opposed to three some other device tab
