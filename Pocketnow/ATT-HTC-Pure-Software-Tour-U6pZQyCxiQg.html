calm and we are here with the software
tour of the HTC pure on 18t now here we
have the new lock screen with windows
mobile 6.5 and you see you got your next
calendar appointment at the bottom nice
big clock to see and a lock up here with
number 14 says tap or slide if i tap
that it's going to show me a missed call
icon and email icon says 13 messages so
if i slide that it's going to go
straight to the email and here's the new
home screen this is touchflo 3d again
and we have a flip calendar we have a
nice blue logo in the background if I go
to the next one see our logo still still
appears here it shows throughout which
is nice and I your contacts can flip
through and as well as all people this
third icon there just like the touch pro
2 and other diamond two variations has a
facebook link so we can see also
birthdays and up here we can link to
matching profiles on Facebook see it
searchers are your contacts lists and
then search with your Facebook and
matched people up so that's nice to have
there's your favorites and your call
history as well back to touch flo 3d
next we have text messages email
messages same as usual there's a special
icon for eighteen t they made some
application icons and folders here
ctools shows up like that 18teen
navigator 18 to Wi-Fi this just goes to
a webpage
let's load in there about 18 to Wi-Fi
and so you got a bunch of things there
next is internet and we do have push
capabilities this opens opera next is
calendar and you can go to today there's
no weather showing up i'm not sure why
that it but you can navigate that pretty
nicely mixes stocks same as others
pictures still got the photo album and
that flicks pretty well sometimes it's
lots of load and a guy your zoom slider
that works pretty well
after that and got music same as usual
looks like that library all nice blue
theme here
sometimes takes minutes lewd and it
should come up with album art
next is whether pretty much the same
just with their new ATT theme
and here's the programs tab you got
marketplace that's windows mobile 6.5
internet explorer Teeter windows live so
that's pretty nice and we also have our
new start menu ATT is customize it a bit
so it has four columns of icons as
opposed to three some other device tab
and you see you got some 80 applications
there's an app center this will go to
looks like it's a widget so that's
loading Caroline
there we have the ATT medium mall and
what else we have
games 18t put a bunch of demos on here
some of those you need to register for
media web mobile video goes to website
there you have it
you can cue music and shop music music
sync XM radio you have on your music ID
and music videos oops mobile video ATT
Wi-Fi where I saw here are some more
apps news break that's good one ms money
widget mobitv online locker we can
mobilize another widget Weather Channel
I believe that's a widget maybe it is so
this is kind of cool
loading loading there
I believe that is a widget
so tools and you see you have FM radio
so that's good but this device doesn't
come with a headset so kinda need that
for the antenna let's ask them for the
headset but didn't come with one also
got streaming media equipped GPS of
course there's your search widget right
there in force recorder remote desktop
mobile that's good you can log into any
Windows desktop there's your ms money
which it so that's pretty much it good
device usual suspects in terms of 18t
add-ons and there you go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
