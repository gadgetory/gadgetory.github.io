offerings walking away from the
ultra-high-end but before we can gauge
whether this experiment is a success
we've got to get this phone out of the
box I'm Juan Carlos bag now for pocket
now and here's our first impressions of
the sony xperia x ah sony limping its
way back into the north american market
you'll notice the DHL packaging here is
our first review unit arrived DOA we
have to send a major thank-you shout out
to the folks at clove code at UK for
helping us out with a review unit to
start our coverage the box contents are
pretty conservative basically just
charger cable and origami practice paper
once removed from the packaging we're
greeted by an attractive slab of
smartphone tight angular corners with
nicely rounded sides Sony calls this
color black but in the hand it's ever so
slightly gray enough to look a bit
gunmetal it's a seriously clean look and
we appreciate the subtle badging walking
around the hardware we've got a micro
USB on the bottom 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack up top the left side is
home to the SIM card and microSD card
tray no pin tool needed to pop this tray
out and all the hardware buttons are on
the right side of the phone which makes
sense for a company so focused on
photography the back of the phone is
where we'll find the 23 megapixel main
camera with single LED flash the front
is where we'll find the 5-inch 1080p IPS
LCD flanked by front firing speakers the
selfie cam here is another pixel dense
shooter delivering 13 megapixel stills
and in a break from other manufacturers
the front top-left corner is where Sony
included the NFC radio it might make
mobile payments a bit easier to use this
on the top edge though this phone feels
great in the hand the metal back has a
satiny finish which doesn't feel overly
slick and though the forehead and chin
bezels are a bit thick most people won't
need to dance the phone around too much
to use this one-handed a first boot
happened delightfully quick I'm not very
well versed on the Qualcomm 650 chipset
but it moved us through the initial
setup efficiently we are happy to report
that whatever gremlins might have
plagued the last generation of Z phones
the fingerprint sensor on this X was
easy to set up and unlock this phone
reliably enough it's not the fastest
we've used to do in part 2 the combin
of power button press and fingerprint
scan but so far we haven't experienced
any wonky issues in operation there is
some value-added software pre-installed
minimized to a handful of Sony services
and some partner apps most everything
can be disabled but I'd really prefer
being able to uninstall programs like
AVG and the rest is just react limiting
to Sony design I haven't used an
experience ignition
happily Sony has taken a step back from
more deliberate skinning elements like
the notification shade and the settings
menu feel pretty stock but I am going to
have to tinker with this after our
arrangement probably just go back to
something alphabetized so how does this
thing perform with a 600 series
processor how does the camera stack up
to lower resolution competition does
Sony maintain its reputation for
top-tier audio well to answer all of
those questions you'll just need the to
back in when we deliver our full review
coming soon as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for our full xperia and hit that
thumbs up button for a little extra
positive reinforcement for pocket now
I'm Juan Carlos back now you can chat me
up on Twitter and Instagram and some
gadget guy and I will catch you all on
the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
