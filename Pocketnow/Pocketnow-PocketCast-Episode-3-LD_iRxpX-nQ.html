nail pocket cast and we're happy to say
that we are on itunes now hopefully the
next step is that we will be on zune
we've submitted our feed you'll be able
to get onto that soon and you know
download the pocket cast your zune or
your windows phone 7 right now you can
go get it on your iphone ipod touch ipad
fill in the blank so today we have three
people with us once again we've got Evan
my permanent copilot here say hi Evan
hey guys and and haven't and we've also
got Adam Lane who actually has been with
pocket now longer than any of us
actually combined he's been here since
the year 2000 or 2001 say hi Adam Oh
Adam knows a lot about about phones and
where you know we always benefit from
his knowledge of especially Windows
Phone he's been a windows phone user
from the beginning using windows ce e
devices when they couldn't even go on
the internet so he has a really
interesting perspective on on sort of
the mobile industry which is great
because there's a lot to talk about
today especially in dealing with Nokia
and the announcement that they are going
to choose windows phone 7 as their
primary smartphone operating system but
first before we get into that Adam
happens to be among the very small
number of people in the world that have
an HTC 7 pro that is like the you know
the form factor like the touch pro 2
running Windows Phone 7 has the
slide-out keyboard with the tilting
screen how is the seven pro Adam that's
pretty nice there's a lot of things to
like about it but there's some cons to
as well I really like the tilting screen
how it automatically fills up that's
something we haven't seen before right
and it's got the touch pro 2 keyboard
which is you know probably the best
mobile keyboard ever made it is yeah
it's it's slightly different the funds
are not raised as much but they still
feel pretty much the same so you get the
the great deal to that keyboard a little
bit less click
too so I have a question so it seems
that you can only get the screen in one
position when you slide it out it's
tilted up you can you tilt it and keep
it flat no and it just tilts to one
angle and that's what it is you can try
to tilt it down but it's going to pop
right back up I have a question too in
that vein and windows mobile seven right
now is mainly a portrait oriented OS so
so how does that work when when you're
flipping the keyboard adding a lot of
screens that aren't meant to be turn yes
that's one of the not-so-good things
about this so most of the places where
you're going to be inputting text will
rotate to landscape but things like the
home screen doesn't rotate and most of
the hubs don't rotate and there's one
place where it's really annoying it is
if you're searching for a contact in the
People Hub it does not rotate no yeah
you're going to type a contact name with
the keyboard slit out and landscape both
but the layout is still in portrait mode
which is really weird and annoying and I
guess I you know we saw that Windows
Phone 7 didn't rotate back a long time
ago when we were testing the LG Panther
I guess it doesn't make that much sense
i mean if you were developing the
software for windows phone 7 Adam what
would you have the the home screen do
when you slid out your keyboard I guess
it doesn't make sense for it to go into
for the whole screen of rotate yeah I'm
not sure it's hard to hard to say you
could either have it totally rearrange
itself so that maybe there's four live
tiles across the top row right but
that'd be kind of weird with it it would
be I don't the tiles just have their
their contents rearranged you know but
stay in the same place but have you know
the next shift and the images shift and
still have a landscape sliding from left
to right so that's top to bottom right
that won't really work on the longer
horizontal lot of tiles what made you
see how oh well maybe it's just the type
rotated right that can you know that all
the shapes would because that's the
biggest problem you have is is getting
these shapes to you know it's like a
puzzle is getting them to fit you know
nicely in both portrait and landscape in
and we hope you know we see that problem
widgets a lot on the Android is getting
them to work properly when when there's
a rotation involved so I think the best
situation when you have you know very
finite dumb shapes like this like
squares and rectangles is to just leave
them and and to have the contents of the
boxes changed John character you know it
would be more than changing just a text
you have to change the imagery to but
that's a cool group yeah so literally
the tiles are staying in place I think
what you're suggesting Evan but then
just that the text literally rotates 90
degrees or whatever it might be right it
would have to be a little bit more
complicated than that some of them but
that's basically what what just be I
mean I don't think would be super hard
to implement something like that one of
the one of the advantages to Windows
Phone 7 as I'm learning as i'm looking
into app development for a pocket nail
appt this year is that because it's so
standardized across all these all these
devices to make an app for Windows Phone
7 is so easy because you know the screen
size you know that the home screen is
not going to rotate and landscape
there's one icon size it's just it's so
much easier than Android where you have
to have three dimensions for splash
screens for icons and it's so it's I
kind of I kind of like that about
Windows Phone 7 that they kind of keep
it locked down it makes it a lot easier
to develop for hmm there were some
people would disagree with you that's
really very good so let's move on to the
next thing really big news this week
nokia held a press conference and not to
the surprise of the mobile world they
are putting windows phone 7 on future
nokia devices they're kind of putting
symbian and meego on the back burner
those Toby
creating phones with those I guess call
them legacy operating systems now but
their focus going forward will be
windows phone 7 and we were trying to
figure out if this is a if this is a
better situation for Microsoft or a
better situation for nokia what do you
guys think I think it's absolutely I'm
sorry to say something Adam oh well yes
I'm sure I'll go first yeah I think it's
a going to be probably a win-win
situation for both but maybe slightly
better for Mark stopped because if Nokia
is helping with this you know ecosystems
are developing a large worldwide
ecosystem windows phone is going to
benefit from that and anybody else who's
building windows phones will also be
able to tap into that new ecosystem what
what is this new ecosystem to keep
talking about for those that are
unfamiliar well nokia is gonna help you
know distribute the phones because they
have have a really big worldwide
presence right or they're also going to
add to the mapping capabilities which
you know bein is kind of not great at
yeah you know terms of other countries
so okay so Microsoft right now uses for
their Maps application use bing maps do
you know who whose map data that is I
don't remember exactly was it tell Matt
perhaps it's either navicat or come it's
not navteq because nokia Owens navteq
right okay and that's and that's what
they're bringing forward so they're
going to have navtex very robust mapping
suite of software and presumably they'll
be able to improve location-based
services Stephen Elop talks a lot about
lbs locations that I think that's
telling out to come out I believe right
don't know yeah telling that fur from
bing and isn't that that's owned by tom
tom
it sounds right I may be wrong on that
the nice thing about having podcast from
the computers you can put stuff up so
guys we keep talking and I'll check it
out perfect yes so so I mean nokia that
has a lot to offer Microsoft and
Microsoft is kind of the saving grace
for nokia because they are in a
situation where they need software with
an ecosystem as they like to say already
built so they thought about android and
they were talking about how they thought
about android but they thought it would
be a little bit too difficult to
differentiate and they very crowded and
dare we say fragmented market whereas
windows phone 7 it's still new it's
still fresh you've got a finite amount
of players and they feel like they can
make a difference and it seems like a
win-win here i think it might be similar
to what Motorola did cuz motorola was on
their way out you know they're in pretty
bad shape and then they went to android
which was unproven at the time you know
beginner and when they released their
droid that basically put android out of
that yeah they were they were running
out of variations of the razor and and
yeah you're right they they went with
they went with Android as they're saving
grace and they got in early too although
earlier than nokia is getting in here i
mean they they were the second if if i
remember the second android phone after
HTC's g1 it still took a year after the
g one was released do it yeah yeah I see
what you're saying so guys it's actually
tella Atlas the tampons and that is a
mapping data company yes but that's one
of the big to tell Allison yeah I guess
I'm very interesting and so the news
today we've been following the Mobile
World Congress news as our as our
editors on his way to to Spain the the
news was that Nokia hopes early some
windows
seven device this year which obviously
we we knew before there wasn't really
anything new in the press conference
they were just talking about some of the
reasons they went with Windows Phone 7
sort of what's going to happen to
symbian and meego and that's pretty much
it they didn't you know that we had we
see these renders of engadget leaked
these renders of pretty nice-looking
nokia devices running Windows Phone 7
although they they kind of look just
like an HTC mozart except the back as an
interesting contoured design and they
come in colors so that should be cool I
mean how can nokia make Windows Phone 7
hardware better cat you know the camera
is obviously more thing definitely the
camera and but what else here screams
they had that clear black technology
that they are aliens nice screams got
real life battery life they probably
know a lot about battery life hmm and in
general I mean nokia you know the
hardware is generally pretty solidly
constructed so i think we'll bring some
new materials to the table of just you
know that they're very good at design so
I think you know even with some of the
restrictions that that chassis one and
then you know later chassis to will will
have laid down I think Nokia will be
able to work within those to come up
with some some pretty cool some pretty
cool phones but the question is you know
are they going to be cool enough for for
them to to have a wide penetration that
that nokia has sort of enjoyed over the
last few years and then condense a big
question it looks like a don't be done
and I think there's there's a lot of
people that are angry than nokia gave up
cindy and there's people that like
Simeon rail you know they don't have to
buy a feature phone in order to use you
know the stripped down versions of
whatever asked 60 that are going to
stick around yeah well I'm not angry
because I was not a fan of symbian and
I think most Americans aren't a fan of
symbian because we never really got the
chance to use it but certainly Europeans
I have known symbian very very well
right I mean Europe just invested what
was it 30 million dollars in the simian
foundation to try to prop it up and now
and now a okiya which was kind of the
last corporate benefactor and it
basically turned its back so I don't
know I think there's going to be there's
going to be some repercussions that that
we haven't seen yet fair enough fair
enough let's move on there's a lot of
other mobile world congress news out
today's sony ericsson announcing for
devices that we knew about the Xperia
Play or let's start with the xperia arc
which we saw at CES super thin device
running Gingerbread and then they had
the experience lay which has been no
secret it's the sliding device that has
the PlayStation like controller or the
ps1 like controller and then there's the
xperia neo kind of a mid-range android
2.3 device and my phone is ringing curse
our podcast Ibaka Casper is live and
uncensored yeah I know that's why I'm
not going to cut this part out so so the
neo is kind of a mid-range android phone
and then finally the Xperia Pro which we
didn't expect to see at all it's i'm
going to call just another slide down
keyboard android phone and the keyboard
doesn't look that juicy um i wouldn't
say that we didn't expect to see it at
all brandon because we sort of suspected
that there was a keyboard version of the
love the neo coming along and and that's
kind of what this is so so we were
definitely looking for something like
this although although we weren't sure
that it would come at the show yeah
that's a good way of classifying it as a
neo with a slide-out keyboard
unfortunately it's using the the same
old one gigahertz snapdragon single core
cpu and even if they could be saying
that
you know the whole one gigahertz
processor like you know one gigahertz
ease and so last year no it really is in
fact I mean we're starting to specify in
our posts whether a phone as a single
core or dual core processor because hey
it's not dual core it's not cool but I
maybe I mean as far as i know you're so
all these new phones have single core
processors even the xperia play which of
course is a gaming handset should have a
dual core processor but maybe sony
ericsson realizes that hey you know
android isn't ready for dual-core
processors you know forget what motorola
and LG and Samsung are doing we're going
to stick with the single core until you
know android you also have to do a
little bit with pricing you know i'm
sure that that a dual-core processor
raises the price of the phone and they
probably want to make the play more
mainstream device yeah but you know yeah
i know what you're saying it would seem
that with a carrier subsidy it's going
to verizon that they'd have some wiggle
room to offer a more expensive device
with the dual core processor and it's
just pretty good i mean if it's a
difference of you know 100 vs $150 that
the you know for consumers those are two
completely different price points what
do you think what do you think the price
is going to be on the experian play on
verizon I think it will be hundred
dollars on your contract 100 is the new
200 yeah I mean you know 18 he really
said the vote pricing the inspire 4G
quite aggressively and I think unless
you have something to poor or you know a
very fast cellular broadband LTE or
hspa+ and you're not going to be able to
charge that $200 anymore and certainly
not not 250 air or 300 right right right
yeah I mean it makes sense that they're
sort of bumping down these single core
devices to the 100-dollar level and
anything thats dual core is going to
start off at two hundred and
and up from there as is the case with a
thunderbolt which of these uh which of
these Sony Ericsson phones do you find
the most interesting Adam probably the
Xperia Play yeah I've got to be a
slide-out stuff there everything else is
just or the same ok yeah basically I
mean like like we mentioned the ark is
going to be really sweet hardware it's
going to have Sony's Sony Ericsson's you
know you interface but of course you'll
be a bit of rooted and put on something
a little bit lighter by the way and
maybe you can look into this Evan as you
sit in front of the computer sony
ericsson ericsson was around a very long
time ago and i thought they were a small
player making feature phones before the
days of smartphones and then sony bought
ericsson are merged with eric sexiness
is still very completed its own company
sony ericsson is a joint venture between
the two companies so instead of making
their own self of both sony ericsson
have come together and you know and now
we make cell phones together by Harrison
still makes other products on its own
don't they make a cell phone tower
equipment and such yeah it's a lot of
like a back haul stuff first off I think
well there really a they're really
coming through with a lot of great
hardware I wouldn't be surprised if Sony
found a way to cut off the Ericsson part
because they're a very brand focused
company and sony ericsson is definitely
different than just sony ericsson brings
a lot of a lot of that interesting stuff
that that attracts europeans to the
table i think each are you think
Erikson's want to be the same you know
without the arabs and info ryan right
and then also today which is we're
recording this on Sunday februari 13th
the Samsung Galaxy 2 was launched at
Mobile World Congress and again not many
surprises here it's got a new version of
the TouchWiz interface to allow for some
really interesting ways you can
reorganize the home screens it has a 4.3
inch wvga screen kind of disappointed
here in a few way
is that the screen resolution isn't the
qhd that all these you know higher end
phones are going to have 960 x 540 kind
of disappointed that the the software
isn't terribly changed from what we saw
in the current generation galaxy s
phones but it's nice that they're
they're bumping the screen size it's
going to have a dual core processor
Samsung dual core processor 1080p video
capture which is quite new and sort of
the next cool thing in smartphones and
it looks how do you guys think this
thing looks I like it I'm sorry I don't
know I looking looking good 9.2
millimeters thick super thin indeed
which is going to be a pretty cool with
such a large device it seems to have a
big bezel on the top and the bottom so
having that thinness will be pretty cool
definitely thinner than the desire HD
also remember that you know it's
probably going to look a little bit
different in America then then this
version does as the as the other galaxy
s variants did you know from the GT
i9000 yeah it's gonna probably have some
chrome on it make it look more like an
iPhone yeah absolutely now something
that's a little bit confusing the
original samsung galaxy s that went to
Europe I never actually got my hands on
it so it has a menu button on the left
it's got a d-pad in the center and a
back button on the right I'm assuming
and the the galaxy s2 has the same
design I'm assuming pressing the center
button will take you home that's always
been my assumption that I had never
actually tried it out they modified that
in the US on you know off for carrier
devices they change that they took away
the d-pad they added four buttons
instead of these two so it's just
interesting to see that they're
continuing that sort of d-pad design not
sure many people use a d-pad these days
hey what are they good
take one if they could have the xperia
play that has plenty of d-pad options so
galaxy s2 this is a big deal and I'm
really curious if they're going to get
the penetration with this device that
they did that they did with the the
original Galaxy S getting it on all four
carriers I'm going to say probably not
because there are just so many other
good options for carriers to latch onto
I was agreeing to say anything well
bouncy ass was a huge hit so why
wouldn't the carrier want to want to get
the sequel and this is a way how to
phone you know I think it at least in
terms of design you know they really
they had a homer here it's just really
tight and this and this phone relates
very closely to the infuse which we were
trying to figure out where do you think
how do you think these two devices are
going to sort of coexist Evan well we
heard that the galaxy s2 isn't going to
be coming out until dude oh that's just
a rumor so you know they're there could
be a like you know a couple months
between infuse and you know if the
galaxy s2 comes out in Europe and doing
they're not come out in America or for a
couple months off of that so there may
be a good amount of time between the two
phones you know being on on ATT for
instance what were the specs on the
infuse it had a bigger screen and what
else but only a single core processor
idle swipe your ears yeah the one point
two gigahertz Samsung chips so that's
that's kind of interesting curious to
see how the galaxy s2 and the infused
benchmark differently because you've got
faster a faster single core in the
Indian fuse and then of course dual-core
1 gigahertz in the galaxy s2 but 4.5
inches still takes the cake as the
biggest non tablet smartphone so i'd
imagine scary but argue with that yeah I
don't the dell streak is too big to be a
phone i think a lot of people would
disagree with that that's just
when I think you can hold it up to your
face and talk to talk with their right
you can I mean it is a phone have you
ever seen a dell streak in person me oh
no have you Adam Oh best buy they have
them on display it's huge and I mean if
you're putting this thing in your pocket
then you've got really big pockets and
it's it is it's not comfortable as a
phone and you look like a moron holding
it up to your face because it has a very
thick bezel and it's not just a 5-inch
screen it's a 5-inch screen and a very
thick bezel so knowing that I think that
ATT could position the infuse is sort of
the the mega big screened phone and then
they come around with the galaxy s2 a
few months later saying kind of like the
infuse but you know smaller screen
faster processor newer software sure
sure that could be it so that is the
galaxy s2 let's move on from here we'll
talk about some things a lot of other
announcements happened in the in the
last week something I want to talk about
was the kyocera echo Adam and I were in
New York to see you know David Blaine
perform a crazy a crazy stunt Adam did
you figure out how he did that yet no
but think i read somewhere that he can
hold his breath for like 17 minutes it's
a world record Wow so let me just let me
just explain what happened for people
that didn't know so we're at the at the
sprint event New York City in the sort
of ballroom type thing and David Blaine
comes out in a tank full of water and he
stays in there for about 10 or 12
minutes and doesn't come up so you know
he's presumably holding his breath if
he's truly underwater and what he's
doing he's opening his mouth and fish
are swimming out he's opening a book and
fish are swimming all around him he
lights up a cigar underwater it's
obviously fake but it looked kind of
cool uh what else was he was checking
his phone what else was he doing in
there Adam already poured a glass of
wine he put just kind of floating around
in the water yeah yeah food sitting at a
desk yeah he's wearing us wearing a suit
sitting at a desk then he goes away and
then the president of kyocera comes on
the stage
dan hesse from sprint come on stage and
then it's always so funny how they try
to connect what happened with the
entertainment with what they're going to
talk about and they were you know and
they were like oh well David Blaine
likes to do more you know multitask when
things are difficult and the whole
purpose of the dual screen design on the
kyocera echo is to allow for what they
call simulcasting which is a novel idea
and curious to hear what Adam thinks
about it I'm going to just quickly say
that I think that if HTC were to do this
phone the Tegra 2 processor a gigabyte
of RAM to high-resolution displays and
beautiful hardware and by the way
kyocera didn't deliver any of what I
just said it would it would be an
awesome phone but kyocera they don't
have really well any experience doing
smartphones and there I think getting in
uh what's the phrase there there in
above their head maybe what do you think
I'm high I agree mostly it's a really
innovative idea and I'm not sure how
exactly to work with all the apps it
seems like only certain ones could
appear in opposite screens did you get
that feeling yeah that's definitely true
well it's only a couple of the built-in
apps will work in that in that manner
where you can move stuff from from one
screen to another or though you know
work in collusion with each other and I
think they said they will release an SDK
but that this phone is going to be sort
of you know I feel like a one-off and I
don't think that and there's going to be
enough interest in it for their trilogy
developers we don't probably be some you
know private developers people in you
know little communities and forums but I
don't think you'll see see a lot of
major you know commercial software
release for this yeah the SDK is a joke
and no one's going to no one's going to
use it except for as you imply kind of
you know developers on the side you just
want to mess around some clarifications
on how the software works and I think
this is one of the problems with the
echo is that in order to understand how
it
works you have to listen to someone like
me talk about it for two minutes as my
understanding and this may be wrong is
that any app can be shown alongside
another app but if you want to get a
special tablet like view they gave them
you know the email is a perfect example
where on one screen you get to see your
message inbox and on the other screen
you get to see an email preview those
have to be created within the operating
system they have to be coated from
scratch but but the cool thing is that
the native apps or the third party apps
you could be playing a game on one
screen while having your email up on
another or you could have YouTube up
while you're browsing the web and that
stuff will actually sort of function in
tandem I don't think I can play two
games at the same time though yeah yeah
there's some weird thing going on for
hibernation apparently when you go to
one app the other app will pause sort of
because Android just doesn't have the
capability to run two things at one time
it's a single you know it's not like a
windows or a Mac computer where you can
literally do two things at one time but
the the concept is just I love it I use
multiple monitors I know Evan does to
Adam do you have multiple monitors for
your computer kind of but ones of TV's
so it's just mirrored really all right
well I mean at least you know the
benefits so it's a tremendous
productivity booster to be able to have
email inbox on one screen and the web on
another screen for example and the same
thing is going to be the case with multi
screen smartphones I mean it's just it's
just such a great capability to be able
to see more at one time without having
to single task next we need one that
folds out with for a little space for
little screens yeah and another it'll
it'll it'll have the battery life of a
phone you find in your drawer from 20
years ago um it's so it was so funny
though Adam remember the president
kyocera or whoever whomever was
demonstrating it said we know that
battery is going to be a problem with
this and we were both thinking oh so
they come up with a new bat
technology or some way to increase
battery life and they said we're going
to increase we're going to include a
second battery and a second battery
charger so that you can swap batteries
in the middle of the day great solo
better carry another thing to carry I
mean I mean if you have to yeah it's
it's it's nice if they did that but I
mean this product is just becoming a
little bit too too complex and and
hopefully HTC notices how cool concept
this is and they do something with it
Sarah very complex it is it is I mean it
must have taken them a really long time
to do this in terms of the engineering
all right so let's let's move on to
let's see what day of the week was this
when we're talking about the the veer
and the pre three I think that was on
Tuesday is that right I think about a
birthday I think it may have been
Wednesday to your right it was wednesday
so really big news from palm this was
sort of a palm well we can't call Paul
many more if called HP this was HP's
opportunity to show that their
investment in in webos is going to pay
off and it's interesting that so many
people think that webos is a really
fantastic platform it's just put on slow
hardware with poor battery life and so
they come out with the beer which is of
course a microscopic tiny phone that is
supposed to be sort of the successor to
the pixi and then they have the pre
three which finally bumps the screen
resolution of webos so what do you what
do you guys think about these did they
it was this enough for them to do to
show that webos can be a competitor I
don't think so it seems like it's really
just more the same
not too much innovation there I see
people want a new form factor I mean
yeah the beer is a new form factor but
if people want to see something like
really sexy poem from HP pong you know
on the lines of the galaxy s2 or the
Xperia are for ya and I don't think
they're showing that yeah you know yeah
they bumped the resolution and and in
the process or whatever but it's still
basically you have the same phone i
think i agree with you guys totally i
think they spent a lot more time on the
on the touch pad than they did on the
beer and the pre three we're not going
to talk much about the touch pad because
we don't cover tablets but it's clear
that they may be sort of minor changes
to the hardware they they increase the
screen size the resolution it's got a
faster processor in terms of the pre
three but they didn't they didn't really
change the the software it's going to
come out with I think web OS 2.1 is it
2.2 is that is that what it's shipping
with ok so yeah and you know I I picked
up a palm pre 2 recently just that just
to have it around and I was looking her
well as fi just because you're so into
smartphones that that your your Bible
not even a cover for the site or
anything this just arrived yeah yeah
gotta have some perspective and after
coming from an android phone after
coming from an iphone or even a windows
phone I'm looking at the home screen and
there's five icons along the bottom and
I'm like gee I wish I could do something
else with this blank space now of course
the center area of the screen is used
for multitasking which is great but I
want quicker fast access to maybe a
widget or more than five well that's
actually five icons one of which you
can't change though it's only four icons
I would have liked them come out with
some new version of webos that really
pushes what makes webos great which is
multitasking but adds a lot more
flexibility in terms of ease of access
of applications and customizing
if they just are moving way too slowly
with that and and and the pre three is
not coming out till the summer really
come on I mean by the summer we're going
to have probably of quad core phones by
then we'll have the iphone 5 we will
have a lot of really good hardware we
still have ctia coming in in a couple of
months and there's new stuff coming out
and Evans going to be at ctia by the way
um yeah you're gonna have an interesting
point there i think this was the it's
might have been the first time i've ever
seen a company both both announced a new
phone and then also announced the
availability of its predecessor or at
the same event haha which a writer I was
just I was scoffing you continue please
yeah you know basically it was like you
know we have this great new phone coming
out and an ojeda's older phone that that
we announced like you know three months
ago and people have known about 4 45
months or whatever is finally on on
pre-order her starting next week or
something you know it's just it's sort
of ridiculous I've never never seen
anything really like it i think this
sort of it there's sort of stepping on
their own toes there and you know how
they can expect sales of pre to to be
all that creative the people who are
really interested in tamil ice know that
i'm sewing leather last know that if the
the 33 is coming out in just a column on
yeah it's it's a it's almost a bit of a
tragedy with the timing i mean if a
company gets timing wrong on a new
product it can be the difference between
its success and its failure i'm not
saying the pre three is going to fail
but by the time the summer comes around
what seems like a cool device today is
not going to seem that cool anymore
unless they price it very low or they
they do a software upgrade between now
and then but it's just it's it's a shame
that the veer will be cooling and it's
it's coming out relatively soon which
will be nice although there's no word on
which carrier is going to
severe but I think it just went through
the FCC and i believe it was with the
gsm bands so one would think it would be
either 18 tiara for tmobile probably a
PMT yeah not sorry about that um palm
veer or web web OS what was the HPV is
what they're calling it video playing
there yeah so we'll see what happens
with webos you know we like competition
and we wish for the success of webos
it's a great operating system and and
hopefully it will stand the test of time
so let us move on here so HTC is talking
about new devices on Tuesday at Mobile
World Congress we're pretty sure that
they're going to announce three
different products last year if you
remember they were they announced the
legend the desire and the wait is that
right yeah the legend the desire and the
HD Mini so kind of the number three
seems to work very well for HTC and this
year we think it's going to be the
desire HD to which should be awesome
their high-end flagship phone and then
the desire to which we've seen leaked as
the the saga and the Wildfire to which
will be sort of a lower end android
smartphone with probably a lower
resolution display we kind of have an
idea of what the specs will be like for
the desire HD two it's probably going to
have a dual core processor with with a
lot of RAM it's going to have a you know
the same 4.3 inch its screen that the
current desire HD has which is rolling
out across the world or at least to AT&amp;amp;T
tomorrow what did I or oats today
actually so if the desire HD two and
what we know about it is going to be
true I'm curious to what you think Evan
because you wrote the dear HTC please
step up your game article do you think
this is good enough for two thousand
yeah if the rumored specs turn out to be
true it it'll be pretty good it it
sounds like their stomach doing
bluetooth 3.0 which which I know a lot
of people are annoyed at considering you
know Samsung even algae I've been
incorporating that for a while I think
it has it's going to have a lot to do
with the form factor of the phone yeah
it seems that Samsung is able to pack a
lot of high-end features into you know
apparently the thinnest smartphone in in
the world at least up to this point so
HTC is not really able to do the same
and I think it's going to be considered
a loss for them hmm well we know we know
the form factor of the desire HD two I
mean it's gonna look like we don't know
what it's the desire to oh well I met
the desire HD two but I don't think we
do know the four back are doing well
it's going to be a slate device you know
it's going to look like this current
desire HD but probably thinner maybe a
thinner bezel and what else what I mean
that you know the specifics on that you
know the Devils in the details and
that's what it's really gonna come down
to is you know how thin is it you know
how how thin is the bezel you know what
did they do with the industrial design
what kind of materials are they using
today for real ass on it all these
things are going to be important guess
we'll have to see HTC your right is one
to bring forth some details hopefully
they're going to be more than just you
know you take off the back battery cover
and you see orange or yellow as they
dish with a lot of their recent devices
but the add the desire to it looks just
like it's and we have seen pictures of
this all over the place it's going to
look just like its its predecessor just
a little bit cleaner and so if that
trend continues then the desire HD two
is going to look very similar to the
desire HD but of course we will have to
see also with these new devices HTC's
going to talk about their new version of
a sense interface for Android I think
we're up to three
no no and we got a little tip about what
it what it will entail we think that
there might be something having to do
with transparency with with widgets
although that's less certain than the
redesigned application tray so you know
in HTC Sense applications you get the
little slider along the bottom an email
for example you can filter between
unread messages black messages and so on
in the application tray for sense
three-point oh you'll have presumably
three different options on the bottom
one is favorite applications ones
downloaded applications one is all apps
which is great because right now when
you hit the apps button it's an endless
list of apps and you know since three
point 0 will really really help with
that but what else could HTC due to
their sense interface have either of you
used there there's their interface for
Android I've used down the hero all
right that was a while ago that was the
that was the first gen of sense and how
about you custom rom but I don't
remember right how about you haven't
used have you sense yeah but a while ago
on on custom roms and on windows mobile
hardware sure well I've been a following
the the changes and since very very
closely and the difference between
generation 1 and generation to was that
with two you got some more widgets you
got ties to HTC Sense calm it was faster
a lot of marginal changes I mean nothing
really that significant they rearranged
the personalized menu so you can flip
through your live wallpapers and your
regular wallpapers like cover flow for
since three point oh I would love to
finally see an option to turn off sense
and I know they're not going to do it
but a lot of people really appreciate
sort of a clean light interface and you
can't turn off sense very easily there
are some workarounds you can use your
own home screen launcher for example but
then when you go into email you're still
seeing sense when you go into the dialer
you're still seeing sense it'd be nice
to see something different there
yeah you're right I don't think that's
going to happen yeah and and and along
those lines let's say that they don't
give you the option to turn off sense
they should have the option to customize
those little sliders along the bottom in
my email application I never ever ever
go off the first tab which is I'm
looking now it is just all or what they
call they just call it received and then
they have conversations favorites unread
marked meeting invitations attachments
come on I mean people really use a lot
of this stuff it'd be nice to turn off
certain you know elements to the sense
interface and even rearrange these
little buttons along the bottom but
these are just little wishes that I have
and they're probably not going to do to
bring those changes forward because they
want to control the experience and
rightly so so for you it's just taking
up space really yeah yeah it is and in
my mind I I think that means it's
slowing down my device it's probably not
true but when I see more stuff on the
screen i think my device is slower so
cool so yeah so that's Tuesday for for
HTC and then tomorrow or probably by the
time you're listening to this on on
Valentine's Day LG is holding a press
event they're going to talk about the
same devices they talked about at CES
but they're going to add the Optimus 3d
which was actually announced in a press
release today and we were talking about
this in the last podcast or pocket cast
about what a 3d display would bring to
the smartphone experience and we kind of
have an answer here it's going to do 3d
video and 3d images glasses-free which
said it should be pretty cool but it
doesn't look like they're doing anything
to the to the interface here in terms of
making it you know 3d capable
I don't know if we know that yet either
way we do know that it would be able to
teach you how to perform yoga so they're
going to they're going to pick up a huge
segment of the market that video was
hilarious did you see that video had him
oh this this girls are optimist 3g and
then she's watching a like a TV show and
she's like I don't understand this and
she takes out our 3d optimist and sets
it on the mat and silently images start
popping out and she's like oh now I get
it this is how you do yoga it's kind of
hilarious yeah I've gotta wonder though
I feel like this was rushed to the
market a little bit just to be the first
3d smart phone I could imagine that
playing video back is going to be a
little weird you know the glasses-free
3d stuff that's out there right now
isn't even close to ready huh so maybe
it's not the case if you're talking a
smaller form factor lower resolution but
I guess we'll have you seen I think you
have to remember too that that if you
look at LG as a whole as a bigger
company there they have a lot invested
in 3d you know not just on the phone
side but but especially on the TV sub
yeah on the home theater side so they're
they're going to want to to make that
whole experience around you know for
could you be able to bring 3d content
from you know from your from your
blu-ray player your TV to your phone and
and and so obviously I made part of that
is getting some some penetration with
these mobile devices too so you know
what they say no one's going to make
content for this stuff until they're so
I'm not some hardware out there and and
I think that's what they're doing right
now is just trying to get some you know
this stuff in people's hands even a folk
you said it's not a hundred percent
runny / for consumers or does not
there's not as many applications for it
as as there may be in a few years yeah
fat point I mean once they get this
stuff out there and I'm sure though
they'll release an SDK so the developers
can make 3d apps hopefully other
companies will follow suit but then are
we talking about multiple 3d standards
and multiple SDKs
will be pretty detrimental to the 3d
handset market yeah I think it will be
like different codecs you know me right
now you have quite a few codecs and
devices are partly judged on how many
when they can support and I can't go
probably the same for 3d good point good
point it's interesting to see how all
these companies that make more than one
product try to bridge together all of
their different products and you know we
saw this and we saw this this week with
palm talking about how palm does you
know tablets now and smartphones and
computers and printers and servers and
they want to link them all together and
then you know LG has similar ambitions
and it's it's interesting to see that
all of these electronic OEMs are doing
phones now and they're thinking about
ways to tie their stuff together but
then you get stuck in a certain
ecosystem and you feel compelled to buy
an LG TV or a sony TV so it works
exactly what they want I must be a big
sucker then I really like my I like my
samsung TV and my samsung phone I was
driving down the road today and I saw a
samsung bulldozer and that was kind of
fun here did you want to get word I
wanted to get one just a bit you know
just to say I have it my name is seen a
glasses list 3d screen I saw it at CES
on a like 52 inch display and it was
very difficult to see because you have
to stand exactly in the right spot and
the resolution was definitely far lower
than HD so my understanding was it
wasn't there yet but apparently it is
there and while I mean yet the Nintendo
what do they call it the three here what
is the name of that three BF 3 DS yeah
so apparently it's there for smaller
sizes it's good enough and who knows
maybe maybe this is the next the next
thing maybe the desire HD two will have
3d evan maybe that's one of the little
surprises
lastly I really like how they did 3d
effects on the zune HD remember that hmm
very subtle but as you're moving you can
see that the elements that were higher
up we're moving in a different rate and
if you tilted it they would move
slightly at a different angle as if it
was 3d it was using an accelerometer Oh
little 3d effects in their kind of like
the the photo gallery in stock Android I
don't have you ever seen that if you
tilt the device it kind of looks like
the elements are moving so I know what
you mean yeah that is a that is a cool
effect I mean it it makes for a more
pleasant experience perhaps or maybe as
well find it in a year 3d doesn't belong
on a phone just like maybe dual displays
don't belong on a phone a lot of
experimentation right now it's it's kind
of cool to see all these different ideas
yeah very good so let's move on let's
see so on let's see we were talking
about tuesday the verizon iphone 4
became available in stores and everyone
was expecting massive lines in fact i
was going to go to a verizon iphone
store in in center city philadelphia to
interview people in the line but
apparently the Lions didn't happen why
didn't the lines happen a good question
I mean that the pre orders were
certainly popular or not didn't they did
they sell they turn through like two
million phones and 22 hours or something
right so I don't know maybe maybe the
whole the whole culture of there being
such long lines for iPhones actually you
know kept people away this time you know
everyone thought there was gonna be line
so so no one showed up in there were no
alarm I mean this is obviously a phone
that people want so it's not like
they're not going to tell them you know
maybe verizon made it easier to order it
online or or you know you get it through
best buy and
it's available in more places on launch
I mean that there could be a number of
reasons I think and I'm sure we'll find
out yeah that's that's got to be the
truth I mean if you look at the iphone
for lunch some of the thea the dodos
that stood in line for 11 hours hint me
i stood in line because I thought that I
wouldn't be able to get one I didn't
think supply would be high enough i
thought i'd have to wait wait until you
know a few weeks game around but with
the case the verizon iphone 4 it's a
device that is presumably been in
production for a while you can get at
multiple places as you imply devon and
you know there's no procedure you know
lack of inventory so there people aren't
lining up maybe people did go to the
verizon stores they just didn't line up
in the morning maybe they went when they
got home from work or something plus
those cold out so it's not really that
much fun to go the interview that eats
then in a line in the cold great point
we've got to remember that the verizon
or the AT&amp;amp;T iphone launched in the
summer so that's a different story i
guess people are more tolerant to heat
than they are to home and Steve Jobs
didn't announce it so there's no reality
distortion field there haha yeah no one
told them if you didn't tell people to
come by it they get it to go that's
funny someone at verizon said buy it but
yeah without Steve Jobs I mean people
aren't going to be able to make buying
decisions anyway all right so let's move
on we've got a couple more stories to
talk about we've got ie9 switching to
windows phone 7 ie9 possibly or
definitely coming to Windows Phone 7 in
the mango update although we're still
waiting for the copy and paste update
what significance do you think this has
on windows phone 7 Adam D have you been
using IE 9 on the on the desktop yes
it's i 9 verses i 7 on the desktop is a
huge difference the performance increase
is great the user interface
sign is excellent there's just so many
improvements from i9 arise under 98 on
the phone it's a little different
because when this phone sentence version
of ie really works pretty well now it's
it's fast smooth just assuming that all
works really nicely there's no there's
not a lot of float in the interface it's
very clean design mm-hmm so having ie9
come to that I think it's really more
about the standard support and html5 so
they're going to work to make html5 work
really nicely on the phone so I think
that's the big deal about I am yeah I
think I think it would be nice and I
think what they're trying to do is
maintain the same level of speediness
and windows phone 7 as I I think the
best browser of any platform even better
than an iphone 4 they want to keep that
speediness while adding the html5
compatibility do you think they're going
to do flash yeah we don't know that sure
about that hope I mean they'd like you
right yeah it has to be more on the end
of Adobe um you know if you only have a
limited amount of people to work on this
stuff you're you're obviously going to
concentrate on the Android and and you
know other platforms I think that that
you probably perceive as you know having
more penetration yeah I think the best
way to implement flash on browser will
be one of the options well you can have
it plane right away everything loads at
once and potentially bogs down your
whole system you know I that's a really
interesting question I tend to you know
an Android you can specify either to not
load flash to ask to load flash or to
always load flash and i have it set to
ask to load flesh but I i just wanted to
load and I don't have it just load
because then the page slows down so I'd
love to see a somebody get this right
where flash will always load you it
doesn't have to be a question but the
browser performance is not in
acted we're not there yet and maybe
multi-core processors on phones will
finally allow for that yeah here's okay
you know I the nexus s the inspire 4G by
my count not including you know the
optimus 2x are the fastest or one of the
fast two of the fastest phones out there
and both of them can do this flash thing
but it's it's barely flash because
you've got to decide if you wanted all
the time half the time or none of the
time it's just not the true sort of
internet experience that I would hope
that we would be able to have these days
a lot of flash sites aren't really
optimized for finger input either yeah
that's another big problem I mean you go
to like a restaurant website with a menu
or some sort of flash animations just
not made for your finger it's made for a
mouse clicker so even like a mouse over
effect you have to move your mouse over
the thing for some things to show up or
anything to happen yeah they don't they
don't really translate well to the
mobile experience so ie9 hopefully will
will be cool on a mobile phone ringing
better performance when the heck is this
copy and paste update coming haha we
don't know they said within the next few
months is the official statement yes
that's hard bandit got me a base that's
complicated yeah I don't understand it I
don't understand why they couldn't have
rolled us into the first release of
windows phone seven unless there's some
underpinning impact I mean they have to
I guess code some sort of virtual
clipboard and all this but can't be that
difficult it and maybe I'm wrong I don't
know we need to get Gabe in here to
opine yes Gabe is our resident genius
when it comes to all things technical
related to smartphones so perhaps he
could shed some light on like copy and
paste is so challenging in Windows Phone
7 we saw in the end of a emulator
remember yeah yeah it's in the emulator
it's there it works and i'll get it on a
phone even the first one you could you
could do control see if you have your
keyboard on the and
here I didn't know that there you go so
it was there since it was in there just
that the UI aspect was there at the
first very good and one more thing we
wanted to talk about here so you know
where we're getting close to the next
release cycle of the iphone well if not
getting close but close enough to where
we can sort of talk about it and there's
a rumor there there's a rumor that there
may be a mini iphone sort of to have a
lower price device too I don't know what
would this accomplished I'm surprised
ever done is already very honest with
you I'm surprised that there's not a
whole lot iphone that's a good question
don't you think that that could I don't
know dilute the the iphone brand a
little bit way that it's a
billion-dollar brand you know like any
other company day they should be
leveraging that and trying to trying to
expand it even more and there's still
tons of people that would love an iphone
and can't afford one and you know apples
goal should be to get iphones into those
people's hands and that's part of what
they were doing by continuing to talk or
the 3gs of our prices but you know they
need to go even further and have stuff
that that's absolutely free on contract
hmm animal you say huh oh I was just
agreeing they've got all the old ones
are still available on that all but
those are there for the lower end
purchasers hmm I'm not sure that people
necessarily want like last generation
hard work you know they want stuff
that's that's new that's just not as
expensive i'd like to see somebody Apple
Google figure out a way to make data
plans cheaper because I think hey that's
the biggest sticking point when people
are getting new phones you know the
upfront fee is annoying it gets
expensive but the the recurring data
charge is just it's killer it adds up so
fast that's why the phones are so cheap
though Brandon I mean
you know we wouldn't be getting these
these five hundred dollar to eight
hundred dollar phones for you know
hundred two hundred box if if they
weren't making a ton on the service so
now you can you can get get you know
cheaper Gaeta as you did with recording
your your google voice number but the
chair up is you have to pay a lot for
the hardware yeah that is a very good
point that's a very good point I mean
that equation works perfectly so you go
buy a nexus s on tmobile from best buy
and you pay five hundred and thirty
dollars for it but you don't have to
sign it to your contract but you paid
five hundred and thirty dollars for it
so it's a it's the trade-off you know in
obviously other countries it's sort of
the opposite you buy an unlocked phone
for 600 bucks and then your plans are
cheaper because they're not subsidizing
the cost of your handset so guess it all
depends on sort of how you look at
things if you want a bigger upfront cost
or if you don't mind spreading that cost
over many months hmm oh I wish they had
a I don't know other ideas so yeah
iphone mini could be cool I think
there's an opportunity there but you
can't go I don't think they'd go much
below 3.5 inches I mean I don't think
they'll change the screen size at all
two jobs you know this is the perfect
size yeah nothing else is good nothing
nothing else is good and now you have to
give you the beer now don't you Oh beer
has a keyboard on right knee right
though well now you're gonna have to
have a small i phone with keyboard I
think I mean I beer is clearly going to
take over that check that segment of the
market and this is Apple does something
to stop it the mini mini phone segment
of the market what activities was there
yeah exactly doesn't that segment exist
I mean obviously people have no problem
carrying 4.3 inch screen devices in
their pocket this 55 year old family
friend was over the other day and he had
a droid x and I said don't don't you
mind how you know
you're old and you know Here I didn't
actually say that Tim I said you're
older don't I mean it you know we grew
up with this tech we don't mind carrying
large things in our pocket but what
about you you know he recently came from
a flip phone he said you know it's not
that big of a deal and I think that
we're all hooked on these larger screens
and this this segment of mini phones i
don't know if that even exists i mean
did the palm pixi so well i don't think
it's sold so well that was a 10 real
thing with the beer that that clip on
USB port / you know 3.5 millimeter jack
that's gross if it's going to want to
carry that around and Johnny out of the
phone that I don't I don't know what
they were thinking there so you can't
charge your phone unless you use that
appendage or you use a touchstone of
course oh of course the touchstone
that's a great way to get people to buy
the touchdown obviously all right touch
tones cool it is cool yeah it's gaining
functionality to what kind of
functionality well now they have it so
when it's docked there's a special API
that you can make a do stuff when it
when it's there you know alarm clock or
different types of budgets and I forget
what they call it exactly but but it was
a whole it was a feature they were
counting with about webos 2.0 ah it's
kind of cool idea you know you don't
have to mess with chargers but just
start throwing them in for free putting
them in the box you know make our
unboxings a little bit more interesting
they don't even include headphones
anymore I mean are they going to stop
including Chargers next next next time
write Braille battery byob very very
good and um all right well I think I
think that's all we want to talk about
obviously a lot more news to come on
mobile world congress the next time we
do the pocket cast we're probably going
to be talking a lot about what HTC
unveiled were eagerly waiting to see
what they have in the store and and yeah
a lot of really interesting things
happening in mobile this week so Adam
and Evan
thank you for joining me on the on the
Pocket cast episode 3 here yeah and

time that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
