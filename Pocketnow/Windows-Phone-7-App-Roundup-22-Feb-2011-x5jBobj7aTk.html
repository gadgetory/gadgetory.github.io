calm this is another episode of the
windows phone 7 app roundup in which we
review five applications in 30 seconds
each so let's get started g docs is a
free application available through the
windows marketplace that allows you to
access your google documents directly on
your windows phone so as you can see
here I have a few documents saved on my
google documents so i can either refresh
i can download them all i can go over
here i can delete them i can search i
can go back change some of the settings
login information is the same as it is
as your google a username and password
we can also go to a file here
unfortunately I'm unable to edit it but
I can zoom in and zoom out outdoor
navigation is a paid for application
that cost four dollars and ninety-nine
cents on the windows marketplace so the
cool thing on this application is it has
many different features so we can get
trip tools by going here get a trip
computer and it will show us our speed
speed average all that great stuff
window here and go back to trip tools we
can get a speedometer and we can also
view a chart of our altitude and speed
we can view the compass unfortunately
this accomplice only works off of the
GPS satellites we can also view the math
and this ties in directly to big maps
and we can record our tracks and share
the web Pete sky map is a paper
application that cost one dollar 29
cents on the windows marketplace so what
this application allows you do is to
view the constellations and the stars in
your view during the night time based
upon your GPS proximity and view the
stars and constellations we can go here
that we can change the time that we can
view these and we can also zoom in zoom
out using the pinch to zoom we can
search for constellations and planets
and whatnot so let's search for Mars
we were doing okay and I'll show us
directly where Martha's glow artisan is
a paid-for puzzle game that cost two
dollars and ninety-nine cents on the
windows marketplace so the object of the
game is to create these colored patterns
that are indicated up here what you have
to do is mix and match colors and also
delete other blogs to form the pattern
so it looks like I might need this one
here and i'll delete this and i also
need to add a blue and then a red and
now we've created the pattern and we've
unlocked that achievement so once we
played a bunch of puzzles we can go to
puzzle gallery and beauty puzzles we
played or we can also go back and go to
randomizer and play a random post Tiki
towers is a paid-for game that cost two
dollars and ninety-nine cents on the
windows marketplace so the oxygen the
game is to get our little monkeys inside
of this box and have them collect all
these bananas and move over to this
totem over here so what I want to do is
create a bridge using our Tiki bamboo
and we'll just build one real quickly
and I like to do is hit the play button
and hopefully my monkeys you not come
crashing to the bottom of this ravine
and once they've crossed I beat the
level and i can pick other levels or
different worlds so this has been
another episode windows phone seven apt
roundup and if you like our videos make
sure you give us a thumbs up and also
they see comments down below to get the
download information for all these
applications just visit the link in the
description to be directed Pacquiao's
website where we store the zune links as
well as the microsoft tags and all you
have to do is take a picture with the
microsoft tag application and it will
launch the marketplace on your device
