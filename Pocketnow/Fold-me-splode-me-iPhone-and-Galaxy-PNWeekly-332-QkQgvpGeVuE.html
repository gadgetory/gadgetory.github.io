Ian hello everybody and welcome to
episode 332 of the weekly brought to you
by pocket now and xda-developers
recorded on this Friday the 16th of
November 2018 around here we never get
tired of talking about in this case
exploding phones phones with notches and
complaining about not having an edit
button on Twitter so there's your quick
preview of today's show so pick your
poison and let's get into it of course I
am Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody I'm so happy to be back inside
of my office the travel for the last
month and a half has been in sane I
haven't been home in LA as you can see
for more than a few days at a time which
is nuts
but I'm finally back for a couple of
weeks before I leave again thankfully
I'm not going anywhere too far so maybe
we'll talk about that a little bit later
during our break back with us this week
is our friend my first episode with him
on the pocket my weekly TK Bey how's it
going brother
I'm doing good man hey miss you guys
it's been it's been a minute since we
last hang out yeah exactly on the stove
again when was the last time I saw you
was it the it was a razor event right
yep that was the last row and then right
before then you know it just it's been
busy and I've been enjoying all those
pictures you've been posting online man
I want to go back to Paris I've been
very fortunate over the last few weeks
to be able to go to a bunch of different
places but obviously the number one
thing if anyone if anyone follows me on
social media you know that I was
actually in Paris last week so very
fortunate for that quick shout-out to
the girlfriend Lisa Rodriguez I would
never think that I would end up in corn
called the city of love with my
girlfriend so there's a lot of pictures
of that that TK is referencing
yeah I'm speaking of someone I haven't
seen in a long time another friend has
popped in it's Mark burr Steiner how's
it going dude yeah and I'm just now
getting my my fingers eyes mouth body
back into the video creation swing of
things when I'm not doing video I'm
building and now that we're we've built
enough it's time to start doing video
and build yeah it's great to see you
back the last time you and I were on a
cast together was with my previous show
and I'll never forget that episode it
was me you and Nicole Scott that was one
of the funniest ones I've ever done it
was it was raunchy it was it was a good
one yeah it was a great one all right so
why don't we go ahead and get into this
week's stories mark right before we went
into our right before we hit the record
button or the live button you made a
good point about this week it's not that
crazy of a week for once we need to take
a breather after the last 60 days of
phone after phone after phone yeah for
sure so let's talk about our first story
for this week
so apparently Intel is jumping into the
5g space everyone's talking about this
craziness that is 5g we heard about it
from Qualcomm last year and then
mediatek where who brought everybody out
to Taipei to talk about there 5g stuff
hi Mei I'm super like envious of you for
being in Taipei at the moment they have
announced their own 5g modem that
potentially would be able to make it
into I phones and Apple apparently is
going to adopt the 5g Intel modem for
its iPhones in 2020 another question
here is that too late for 5g like
considering how much we're talking about
it these days no no that's not too late
like hey when we first started talking
about 4G I mean the first few 4G phones
that we got I don't you remember how bad
the battery life was on those babies oh
yeah how long it really did take for it
to take out you know exactly what
constitutes 4G we had a lot of 3G and a
half
all right and that's kind of what's
happening right now there's still a lot
of discussion that the term 5 G's so
very much in contention for what
technology actually defines it and who's
gonna get there first
I think 2020 is a reasonable a
reasonable projection actually things in
technology always move slower than you
think they're gonna even though when
you're in the slipstream it feels like
they're moving really fast so I think
this this timing is spot on okay cool TK
any thoughts on that
I just realized also you're outside
right now yes I decided to I have to go
outside it was more of uh you know why
sit indoors why not enjoy you know the
scenery nature is true and we're friends
over life oh yeah I just realized our
friends over in the East Coast right now
if Jaime were here he'd be complaining
about all the snow that's happening and
we don't have that in Cali to make sure
people knew we got Sun we got good
weather you know we got bamboo yeah but
you know as far as as far as the 5g and
the networks that you know yeah mark
marks right on the spot there we're
still at the early infancy of basically
even see enough a working model I mean
Verizon mentioned it with the Moto mod
you know a few months ago we still have
to see we still haven't even seen a
working model so the reality is 2024
iPhone make sense
I mean apples not gonna do anything that
has not been proven not only that is
good enough for them that it doesn't
actually just kill their phones
obviously as Mark mentioned initial
technology always drains battery cuz
it's not optimized that's true and a
number one thing that happened to us
when when forty first came out it was
just ridiculous battery life oh yeah
agreed and and I feel like okay a little
bit of snort coming from my side right
now but I don't think anybody has ever
said that iPhones had amazing battery
life to begin with so maybe this is not
gonna be that big of a deal and the
thing is like okay so what about this
whole idea and again a little bit of
smart coming from my side I'm not trying
to be on any one side or the other but
there is this this this general thought
in the technology space that a lot of
manufacturers of course Android being
the other side of things they will have
5g before the iPhones and then
everyone's gonna say that the iPhones
perfected something that was started
before them like who could it could that
be the strategy kind of going for it I
mean if history has has taught us
anything yeah yeah that's exactly how it
is it's one of those big wrenching and
yeah exactly
oh boy all right well the speaking of
perfecting something before you release
it
apparently iOS 12.1 was just way too
much for this one person's phone after
their iPhone 10 allegedly exploded after
being upgraded to iOS 12.1 um so I'm
looking at the tweet right now and this
is this is a gruesome photo like not
safe for life is not the term not safe
for phone in this wait wait not safe for
NSF P is what I'll say here that thing
is done like it is done yeah so
apparently according to the quote here
over on Pocket now the iPhone 10 was
still updating when he put it on
charging and dark gray smoke started
coming from the phone the update was
completed and as soon as the phone
turned on it started to smoke and it
caught fire holy hell that is not
standard charger - yeah look it's it's
2018 we made it to the point where we're
carrying like we we went to space with
less than this and people like us carry
more than one in our pockets we had to I
mean think about how much power we're
literally cramming into such a small
physical space you know one one failure
hardware or software wise can be
catastrophic so okay your phone next to
your face but like what what could have
this been you know that he he plugged it
in this person rather plugged it in and
it was updating like these kinds of
stories I would expect them to say
something like I put it under my pillow
or something like that it's new software
it's it's just regulating voltage
regulating regulating the flow of power
if some rogue cycle gets stuck mmm
you're in a position where something's
thinking then it needs to be pulling
more than it actually needs to be all
these
little circuits in open the Chargers and
inside the battery and the software
running the actual device are all
contributing to how much power is
actually getting pulled or pushed is
this a fear is this a fear for you guys
TK is this a fear like have you ever had
a phone explode on you like is this like
we we work with a lot of phones it's one
of those things where you play the odds
like it has to happen to one of us
eventually right and the weird thing is
I actually still have the first one of
the first generations note 7 that never
exploded luckily but yeah for me from
the pictures you could definitely see
the swelling of the battery it's popping
from them both on the front end on the
back end so it's something to do with
the battery it's overflowing the
regulator may have just maybe you've
gone malfunctioning it's it's isolated I
guess at this point we haven't seen many
like the way that the note series kind
of went on but yeah the fact is you're
right it could happen to any phone if
any kind of manufacturer defect goes in
we carry you know I mean this guy has
that forty two hundred million battery
even bigger than than the iPhone mm-hmm
that's true we don't want to be in a
situation where things happen and like I
said I'm hoping it's an isolated
situation I haven't heard many but I saw
the comments on the tweet some people
were making him swear that this was true
because some people were just not
believing the guy nobody what he said so
it was interesting which I say again to
all of our listeners play the odds guys
if you are one of those people that went
into the that the the Twitter the tweet
rather and commented on it play the odds
like we have millions and millions and
millions of these running all over the
place like at any given point and you
know it might be one of those things
where like people don't really report it
they just like the throw away they don't
go on Twitter you know there are there
are many different types of climates in
the world and they test them in so many
different climates I would imagine that
more exploding phones happen in super
hot climates oh yeah exactly where's
because as normally when you're charging
it the phone heats up anyways installing
an update is very similar to when you're
restoring data when you get a phone for
the first time try to feel the back of
that phone it's working double time
downloading data installing data yeah
all the processing power that it's
really given to you is being used to
make the phone or cable so yeah just be
it be safe and you don't do the pillow
thing and don't try to put it in a
situation where it could get you know
doesn't have enough air but
unfortunately
I want to do it I want to do a video at
some point about like watches
smartwatches and mostly fitness trackers
because I'm a big advocate of like
instead of having the phone next to you
to do things like sleep tracking we're
something to do it I literally have one
I have a rate a smart ring that I just
got recently I'll talk about it at some
point but yeah it's things like that
much better for for what you're trying
to do if you're sleeping with your phone
next to you um okay so from Apple we
moved to its competitor and they just
had Samsung just had their Developer
Conference very very recently and it was
there that there were a number of
bombshell let's say kind of weird for me
to say bombshell after our last story
they had a few did a few big
announcements and one of them in
particular is well it's the rumor mill
that's actually moving now on the galaxy
s 10 the anniversary edition if you want
to call it bad maybe what I'll call it
the SX I hope not is gonna be the S 10
but one of the biggest announcements
regarding this future phone is that
apparently Samsung is indeed going to
move away from what is differentiated
them from current phones and actually
adopt the knotch okay hot takes notches
Hatem don't hate them will you hate it
on a Samsung I'm fine with it
this year was I was bored out of my mind
this year phone wise anyway right
notches notches were always the stepping
stone not my favorite thing but even on
the essential phone it really melted
away and stop bothering me doesn't
really bother me very much on the on the
pixel 3xl but it is so nice when you do
get something like the note 9 or you
know the vivo next or anything that's
ultimately truly bezel lists and notch
lists but this compromise that we're
talking about here with Samsung with the
s10 is a is a punch out and I do think
that may be one of the more creative
solutions I really like this idea I just
hope that they can get closer to a
through display camera solution sooner
because as nice as it will be
to have an edge-to-edge display it's
sort of effectively Thing Thing it's
really just an aesthetic move forward a
small step forward
you're still gonna have a chunk of this
display that's relegated to that punch
hole or to whatever pseudo notch it is
in that context not until we get
straight through the screen are we gonna
see a scenario where the camera really
sort of goes away and appears in the
appropriate context but I am really
amped to finally see Samsung doing doing
more in terms of pushing the envelope in
terms of form factor and what we expect
from our devices I keep hoping I keep
saying you're over here maybe this will
be the year the manufacturers start
doing something more exciting than a
glass sandwich you know we just saw the
red hydrogen with metal and carbon fiber
and all this stuff that you do make
sacrifices for but it's time to start
start exploring more in terms of the
materials for the doodles of
applications that we're gonna start
using these devices for now that they
aren't quite so powerful I cannot wait
for us to move away from these
consumption and you know attention
retention attention retention devices
and more toward and a tool that we use
in our everyday lives with our hands
which we don't really use our phones for
very much for today I see a couple of
people in our live chefs saying they
like the punch out because it's not
egregious as far as not just go but also
don't we just love Samsung's terminology
here like I'm looking at the article now
and it says that they have the punch out
which technically uses the teardrop and
then we also have the ultrasonic in
display a fingerprint reader it's an
interest like finger probe you guys come
on their own in the Infinity Oh display
which who knows what kind of jokes can
come out of that
TK's until have some thoughts out of
some thoughts about this particular
device rumor now obviously we're gonna
see it in a few months but yeah no no
definitely it's I think it's it I think
we're we have this is this is a kind of
a stepping stone to what Mark was
referring to it's that hopefully the
behind a display type of technology I
think the the obsession of having that
whole bezel is saying we and we've seen
different manufacturers the the notch is
not always going to be the answer you
have the slider option with the cameras
in the back kind of like the magic two
did well or even the mimics
but the reality is I think once we we
can get behind that we're you know the
fingerprint sensor is now behind the
display getting the camera behind there
that just kind of fixes the issue and it
then out hopefully we can start breaking
away from the sandwich kind of concept
getting maybe different form factors
something a little bit better so I'm all
for it I've heard some rumors also that
some other manufacturers may be going
down the same route with a punch out so
I have anything to make it better in my
only hope and I really hope that Samsung
is listening to this is just do not take
the headphone jack whatever you do don't
try to justify whatever concept or
combination the headphone jack is that's
like literally your bread and butter
right now that's like your really very
unique thing you had so yeah I'm all for
the display thing but keep the
headphones actually okay
there we go so we know where Tiki draws
his line yeah exactly
okay and then during that particular
developer conference they dimmed the
lights down low because things were
about to get flexible so the Infinity
flex display became a thing and sure
enough there was this like device that
that the gentleman was holding in his
hands that then folded and what we're
looking at here is not only a foldable
display that folds inward much like a
DES but there's also an outer four point
six inch Super AMOLED covered display
that unfolds so you still have a screen
that you can use in the more general
like phone configuration like this but
then it folds out to become a 7.3 inch
Super AMOLED main display now the the
apparently this is going to be one of
those things where due to the innovation
of something like a foldable display
we're going to probably have to
reconcile a few of the other factors of
this phone number one the fact that with
all of this display and everything that
I can do apparently is going to cost a
pretty penny and one analyst is
suggesting that the foldable smartphone
might be in the neighborhood of two
million won which roughly translates to
almost $1,800 I just got a laptop for
that price and I can't why I don't know
what yeah that's all
right and oh my goodness I just don't
know how to how to feel about a phone
like that as awesome as a foldable
display might be as awesome as that
might make our smartphone future
are you that jazzed about it that you
would pay that much I I don't know if I
would I would go as much as paying more
like as you just said I personally also
bought a laptop as well I'm talking to
you guys on it right now and yet this is
more than yeah even a well suspected
laptop a gaming laptop even that I'm
using for editing I I think initially
what we're seeing here is it really it's
a proof of concept right hmm they're
gonna try to get at the market they want
to be able to get the first quote quote
unquote kind of statement and I think we
saw it I mean it does actually exist he
had one in his hand he was able to fold
it although very gently we still don't
know all the parameters behind it the
reality I think it's I think it's great
that we're able to push it I'm still not
a hundred percent sold on the concept
that we really want a foldable display
because yeah it's it's it's kind of the
I know it's a different form factor but
is it the right way to go so we'll have
to see I agree I totally I still haven't
seen Westworld I've seen I like both
love Westworld so like I'm in
hypothetically and in theory but in
practice and the more practical sense
I'm not a hundred percent sure what I
what I do think I'd like to see more of
is just a little bit more outside the
box thinking like we were just saying
with that with the hole punch cut out
like more along those lines because in
fact I think in the in the show notes
we've got this article whose other this
other Samsung clamshell flip phones play
and I think maybe there's a lot more
opportunity there to try and get us to
where we need to be prep more
practically in terms of natures and
benefits of what we get out of the
device whether that means taking that
outer display and replacing it with
something that is low-power lo-fi maybe
it's it's the ink black and white
whatever
and replacing the inner key set of the
you know the numpad with another more
practical display so that it sits still
it doesn't necessarily need to fold for
it to have a similar use case for it to
have a similar purpose so I'm not super
sold on it and sure sure as hell not at
that price tag like that's wackadoodle
do yeah for sure and I and personally I
would feel like a foldable display would
make for a phone I mean I know that a
lot of us especially in the tech space
that we do like shows like this we say
that you don't make the make the phone
thicker who cares if we get features
that we want and this is one of them
like once you fold that thing it's
probably gonna be a little remember the
X on em like it was a different kind of
full yeah yeah yeah I think was thick
and sharp well the other thing is if you
guys got a chance to see the no after he
folded it obviously it was in a case you
couldn't see the phone on the actual uh
that presentation package they actually
showed you somewhat of an outline of how
the actual phone folds and it's not a
hundred percent folding no no it's more
of a teardrop kinda so it's kind of a
fold but it doesn't really fold all the
way it's just more then a foldable I
would really yeah it's not I'm really
like can't wait to see ya piece of paper
okay flexible work like creased yeah
it's so it's almost like that more it's
like that more yeah and that to me it's
more of a flexible and foldable but yeah
for sure yeah this it is the Flex the
Flex display so they're not saying like
infinity fold or anything like that so
but we do have a truly foldable Samsung
device that was that was brought to
light this is this is the continuation
of a device line I've always wanted the
W 2019 which I don't know if 2019 means
next year but the so basically this is
this is a flip phone and it's live and
this flip phone so much so what we have
here are two different 4.2 inch AMOLED
displays one on the inside of one on the
outside so you can still use the phone
theoretically like fully I mean
obviously you should have all the
elements still on that outside display
but then you open it up
it's a clamshell phone and it's powered
by the Snapdragon a 45 great powered by
six gigs of RAM great there are options
of 128 gigabytes in 256 a gigabytes of
on-board storage and a dual 12 megapixel
camera why don't we see more of this
also 3000 milliamp hour battery why
don't we see there's your front facing
camera issue resolved right there
you know like you been open and now
you've got a screen looking at you like
I forget dude what was that phone I
think like last week that had that
separate screen on its back or for
something new being Dubya yes thank you
you know there I think we can be just a
little bit more creative if we think I
mean a great look I'm not I'm not a
hardware guy I don't make phones I just
use them I like some you know the phones
but I I feel like there's more
opportunity here to to sub out this
numpad for something a little bit more
modern and contemporary thinking you
know that I feel like oh I'll take a
flip phone any day yeah definitely TK
what was the last flip phone you had oh
man the last I want to say the razor was
the last one the Motorola RAZR was the
actually true last flip phone because I
think after that I started going into
the MDA with Windows Mobile and they
were mostly all smartphone style or even
the eye pack so yeah I've left the the
flip concept a while back but I I do
like the way it looks I like the form
factor I'm still trying to figure out is
this functionality is it something that
we can make it work for us especially
when we were again I mean even today we
do have a thinner device we do have the
bigger batteries the W the line of
devices have always been kind of more
focused toward the Asian market the
business style and I think we've
reviewed one at XDA maybe I think
earlier Issyk last year miles did a
review for one of the vices so it's it
definitely has a market and you know
really excited to check it out look at
it so spec powder but it's so weird
right like we have we flip phones used
to be like so so common and nowadays
with our you know current smartphone
lives now it's being used as Jill said
in the
here it's like it's like a symbol of the
uppity tech person you know it's like
it's like I have a flip phone and it's a
luxury item now because it's not so
common and which is kind of ridiculous
because this phone oh and also to that
end the last flip phone that Samsung
made last year or two years ago they
gifted it's a Jackie Chan so there's
seriously making this a they're making
this like Circe a symbol of like elitism
almost which is crazy right and to that
end this phone is almost $2,700 when you
translate it from Rouen you want RMB
that's a lot of what why that that's my
question this thing better be made of
like like gold
yeah the wiring would be really good
it'll have good conductive properties
with gold lining and everything yeah it
is like you said it's really marketed to
be in that market it's really it's kind
of like when use you know the Porsche
designed some of the other companies
higher-end the Ferrari or the lambda the
Lambo phone the phone is more about
status than it is about the internals
and but at this point they kind of
checked out both boxes it looks really
nice and it's really Spectre definitely
you know as long as they release it with
in the near future before the next
snapdragon comes out and it becomes last
year's chipset I think they probably
have a good good device there wouldn't
mind checking it out just to see you
know how does it actually work the form
factor of the field does it really make
it you know give you that nice luxury
kind of style that they're trying to
sell yeah and to harken back to the
point we made earlier for for the
features that we like in our phones if
the phone is a little bit thicker here's
a great example like we have a phone
that looks pretty awesome has really
cool things it's a little bit thicker to
accommodate all of that we're fine with
that
just so you know manufacturers we're
fine with that so TK just mentioned that
this phone has the Snapdragon a 45 but
we also have a little bit more processor
news and it hasn't pertain to the phone
that mark and I are using right now a
little bit of breaking news
so mark actually lately it wasn't this
he gave us this story right when we were
in the middle of doing our first story
so what did you find mark oh boy
Mark Martin is beauty mark was digging
so so check it out
as it turns out there's there's a
insight that has I clicked it and I
couldn't read it I was like what am I
looking at here well I have a thing
called Google Translate that I use them
eight other languages so I clicked that
one and when I read the article
boy oh boy howdy is some real steamers
in here the pixels three light as it
turns out like real thing did exist
these folks have one in the flesh it's a
baby version of the already baby pixel
three which I've also been using and
have loved despite the battery life
really sort of falling short for me the
specs on it are really interesting so
remember this is a pixel three light so
it's a twenty two twenty by ten eighty
display for a PPI of 444 it's a 5.56 IPS
display so that's a big big shift
alright and it's got a six seventy a
Snapdragon 670 under the hood which has
an Adreno a 615 on it so it's eight of
eight course two two of those course of
the adrene oh I'm I'm so confused and
curious for only 32 gigs of on-board
storage
oh no micro SD card and it's looking
like the price range would be may have
been may still be between 4 and 500
bucks at some point in the first quarter
of 2019 I've seen some other rumblings
that this is still in the cards to
actually occur not something that was a
killed canceled product the camera is
the same it's not an inferior camera so
for everybody who's complaining about
prices hitting and hitting the thousand
dollar mark isn't this exactly what
we're sort of asking for it even has
quick charge for from Qualcomm like
between 4 and 500 bucks for a no-brainer
to get like crisp clean Android software
from Google when you've got a friend
family member who's like yo I need a new
phone my phone's about to take a poop
and I need a new one and I don't want to
think about it too hard and I know I
like Android check this thing out yeah
TK's losing his mind right now because I
think you just sent the xda-developers
article on it thank you for that oh yeah
no no as Mark was saying I was gonna say
I saw it right before we got on I wasn't
sure it was gonna be on the list but
ya know we we we posted we referenced
the same source I'm assuming as marks
referencing for the article itself it it
looks
honestly exciting - hey headphone jack
is back what to say I just have to ask
and it has to be materialized that's
really all it is
yeah but no it it does I really like the
form factor I really so I I'm having I
finally have the opportunity to play
with a pixel 3 on my channel and I'm
working and I really like the form
factor
I love the pixel 3xl have always been an
advocate of bigger phones bigger
displays but that form factor does
something it's weird its small that it's
powerful and getting it to you know
there is a big market for people that
you know don't want the massive phone
this definitely answers it the budget
price is always gonna make it appealing
and having google's AI and well the
having the air core behind it the
processing power to generate nitesite
great pictures pictures I think it's a
no-brainer yeah this is gonna be a this
is gonna be a really I mean if they get
it before the holiday they'll have
better sales because if they try to
shoot for 2019 it's gonna be a little
bit after but I think it still do well
Jules's and i mean in our chat over here
by the way I just realized I didn't
really introduce Jules in the booth
obviously so Jules Jules is a chiming in
and the chat here so there was a rumor
that it was going to come with the
Snapdragon 710 but there is a newer
processor that that Qualcomm did put out
there's the 670 so that's what is being
rumored is in this device and yeah the
yeah I would love to see this and I
almost feel like this would have been
called something like the is weird but
you know you have Android one and the
price point and the specifications of
something like this seem like the kind
of thing you would release in the
markets that Android one and Android go
are all a part of and I think if they
did that that would be amazing I think
that would be awesome
III know people from many different
developing countries and like this would
be a great entry points for people like
them yeah I get so many people who are
asking me who have a phone from three
four years ago that's finally on its way
out and only thing they care
is the camera because you think they
care about is I want a good camera at an
affordable price the rest they can take
or leave and there's no device on the
market right now that I can send to them
for even they're willing to pay 500
bucks bucks tops up to like six in some
situations but if you want the best
camera on the market there's no way to
do that without spending seven eight
hundred plus dollars at this stage this
fills that role yeah hundred percent and
I think I I really hope this mitt this
does materialize and it's not just paper
where yeah I mean obviously we see the
hardware but I'm hoping that it's true
hardware you know mm-hmm yeah and this
would this would give a lot of funds a
run for their money in terms of just
like actual normal normal I'm saying
normal people average person sales you
know cuz let's face it we're not normal
like we would look at this and be like
yeah but I have the Excel buy there are
so many people out there who would be
able to go to their carriers go to their
go to stores that are in their local
areas and see a four hundred dollar
pixel that's unheard of that's something
that we haven't seen since the nexus
days the next is for in the first place
you know that's what the Nexus 5 plus
four
it was the workhorse mmm-hmm for sure
okay so shifting gears one last time
going back to Apple a little bit there's
there's a bit of a there's a bit of
peripheral that's going to be used for
the brand new iPad pros I came out and
also the Mac Mini so the whole idea here
is it's a it's a product called Luna
display now apparently Luna display lets
iPads become wireless displays for the
Mac Mini now I've seen so many tweets
over the last number of days about the
new iPads about how people are trying to
use them as their laptop replacements
and like while there are some really
great aspects to the iPad especially the
newer the newer ones while there's some
wonderful aspects to them that do
replace certain features of a laptop it
is not a one-to-one laptop replacement
there is no way a quick shout-out to uh
I think it was marques Brownlee who
actually said on Twitter and I laughed
when I heard this or when I saw this the
iPad pro is still a great
great tablet it gets really close but it
still has a OS and that's the number one
problem it was something I'm
paraphrasing yeah so if it had if you
had a if it had a better now there's the
thing instead of using it as a full
laptop replacement why not use it as a
display that's exactly what they're
doing here so what it does here is
essentially it's a Wi-Fi dongle that
enables users to bridge the Mac Mini to
the iPads as an extended display which
kind of makes a lot of sense I didn't
even know that the iPads or iOS rather
would allow for that kind of
functionality so it's kind of nice that
they have that so any thoughts on this
did you do either of you use iPads have
you used the new one have not you would
love I mean beautiful device but as you
said it is running iOS and I have work
to do so I can't imagine how I mean if I
if I were an artist if I only relied on
on this device for creative creation
like ideation and and you know almost
like a digital version of a notebook
yeah okay I can definitely get away with
you know shooting off some emails here
and there but I can't open premiere on
that thing I can't I can't do a kind
percent of the things that I need to be
able to do you know like if I'm editing
a deck I'm an InDesign if I need to edit
a vector I'm an illustrator full-on
proper you know and I know that that
Photoshop proper is coming to the
platform but things like this are like
really cool parlor tricks that I hope
Apple realizes they need to stop making
a market for products like this simply
wouldn't exist if Apple would double
down on on its users that that use their
products the most and and the most
effectively and I don't think that's
what's happening here I think we're sort
of still in that weird transitional
period where the C suite of execs at the
company is still sort of figuring out
what to do after Steve's ideas list ran
out there
so I think they're just really they've
got a lot of tunnel vision on iOS and I
mean in what scenario are you real
really gonna use this like it really
feels like it really feels like what the
iPad needs right now is boot camp
personally okay TK some some thoughts on
the iPad pro deluna display any of these
things before we get into our break I
you know the reality so this just as a
point of reference using as an iPad as
an external monitor to a Mac is not
necessarily a new thing we've had
different solutions in the past using
wired connections and downloading apps
on them on the iPad so the way this is
implemented and why it's getting a lot
of traction on social media it's because
it's using both of these two
technologies and introducing touch
interface into the Mac system because of
the actual iPad being a touch display
when you're using it over Wi-Fi with
Luna you're able to actually use touch
display activity you know you can
actually interface with the UI with
touch and that's I think why it's kind
of catching a little bit more and
because it's on the Wi-Fi I think the
article referenced it is you can
literally walk away from your iPad Mini
and still be able to connect to it and
interface and get all the functionality
of I you know of basically a Mac OS
interface is this the right solution it
depends if you have I mean if you really
want to get a you know an iPad that I
think for all intents and purposes is a
great iPad it just as Mark said I don't
think can replace a Productivity laptop
at this especially with the things that
we need for content creation maybe for
content consumption but not creation yet
I think it's overpowered for what it
does in iOS iOS needs to be I you know
basically it needs to move away they
should have it may be an option I mean
it boot up Mac OS maybe that may be an
option it has USB C port which is really
good at least they're moving forward
there the speakers and I mean I don't
know if you guys saw the jerry-rigged
video this morning that just made me
cringe you know Apple beating Samsung oh
oh that's right yes yeah I thought oh I
know is just killing me but uh I think
it's nice I think for people that own
both devices this is a very nice little
addition and Luna definitely made a lot
of buzz it's a great great option but
yeah definitely
I like it it for what it does I don't
think it's really going to be replacing
our laptop anytime in the near future
yeah some some quick thoughts from Jules
before we go to the break the the
impressions of it so far as he seemed
say that it's low latency so it could be
a viable solution personally I think of
it as like I'm always thinking of
portable rigs
I even travel with an e GPU to further
power my my meat book X Pro so I'm not
adverse to extra bits and pieces to make
my laptop experience better
but yeah the Mac Mini you got to plug it
in but I think to myself that Mac Mini
that's cool then you have the power
adapter and then you have the iPad
that's not a bad that's actually not a
terrible travel rig it'll fit in your
backpack you know and you could have it
up and running in any hotel yeah for
sure alright cool
well all those are all of our you know
short stories for today let's go ahead
and jump into a quick break before we
dive into our main topic okay the pocket
now weekly is brought to you by the
National Security Agency almost every
day we hear something on the news about
a cyberattack sometimes it's just a
bunch of pranksters but more often it's
a foreign country with vast cyber
resources trying to hack our power grid
our banking systems our our military
information networks the National
Security Agency plays a big part in
protecting our country from cyberattacks
and you can help the NSA is hiring
technical professionals to serve on the
front lines of information security if
you work in computer science networking
programming or electrical engineering
you can help keep our country safe
design new hardware systems and networks
right faster smarter programs protect
America's critical infrastructure or
help uncover what our adversaries are
planning to do next learn more about
careers at the National Security Agency
today visit intelligence careers gov
slash NSA that's intelligence careers
gov / NSA the pocket our weekly is also
supported by one plus the one plus 60
has a new color and I have it right here
it is called the Thunder purple with a
sleek gradient going from black on the
top to purple on
Matt glass it is the same speedy phone
in a way you've never seen it before
head to pocketnow.com / 1 + 64 more
information alright so we are back what
was funny was when we were coming in -
when I was driving to my office
obviously here normally I'm recording
like right there that's why there's a
light right there and tripod and whatnot
not only on recording there but then I'm
at my desktop on the way here I was
thinking to myself about some thoughts
that I wanted to put into our break and
then Jules actually said he put together
like this little topic for us at the
very end of this show that we're gonna
talk about that actually covers what
exactly what I was thinking so I'm not
gonna I'm gonna keep my mouth shut
until then but I wanted to check in once
again - to our two guests here um so
like TK didn't you just come back from
from China like very recently I did
actually a last couple of weeks it was
the week after you were there we
couldn't work out the timing there yeah
yeah came in back with the the magic -
other the other sliding phone speaking
of form factors right I know we were
talking about like a punch hole you know
screen or even the camera there there's
this may not necessarily be the ideal
situation for everybody but it's
definitely like as addicting as I can I
can play this all day for you guys I can
do the background music for the entire
show yeah I don't know why but it's
addicting and I just want to keep
playing with it that's all we would do
is sit and flip the Droid opus slide it
open and closed all day man man it's
satisfying and and this is it's a
massive it's a powerhouse I love it
Jules calls it the honor fidget - right
before right before we good I don't know
what happened it was it job a bit of a
delay there yeah TK's trying to get back
to that 4G so right before TK actually
went to China I did check out the I
checked out the Xiaomi x3 which is the
same concept
so slider phones are kind of making a
comeback a little bit here
okay so mark I don't like you and I we
talk on Twitter like once in a while I
wanted I wanted I want a little more
detail what have you but I haven't seen
you in years like what else has been
going on on your end I remember you were
streaming for a while yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah so I don't know I'm the
kind of guy who wears a lot of hats
so video like so many folks on the
internet including you have really only
seen me know me they've been exposed to
me via video and video is like a big
part of what I do I went to film school
but video is what I do when I'm not
building when I'm not in the middle of
actively doing something in some space
in 2012 I built a company called FTW we
were trying to build a network a
platform agnostic Network save card for
video games for players to control their
own saves not leave them in the silo of
PlayStation Network or whatever in
write-ins these days I'm back to
building but as we're building in 2018
moving into 2019 and you know in this
era of social media technology every
company must also be their own media
company
the madman era is over so we are taking
on producing video as we're building up
building this product at the same time
so I've been cranking out vlogs and for
the backlog got ourselves an editor and
you'll see me back doing video more
frequently in the very near future but
we're in the process of building a
crypto card game
so we're game a lot like you might be
familiar with like magic the gathering
or netrunner or hearthstone you name it
but we're working on a card game that
has underpinnings to make it so that you
you own the cards and we want to treat
our players a little bit less like
customers a little more like
constituents No so that's kind of like a
loaded phrase but ultimately what it
means is we want to build this game
that's going to outlive us something
that we can maybe take to space with us
as as as the human race and so I think
that players own the rule set for not
something that we are making unilateral
decisions about like you see with
businesses because something that
players through play through the system
are able to define the future the
destiny of the game nice yeah nice
that's not that all sounds awesome and
honestly like I'm really happy that
after all of the travel that I've that
I've been doing that when I come back
it's to you two gentlemen you two are
like some of my favorite people so like
whenever whenever you guys you know want
to be on or whenever we need anybody you
guys are on the short list for sure
hopefully our audience you guys enjoy
these two as well they are awesome so
make sure you follow them all over the
place
um I mentioned I mentioned that we were
talking on Twitter earlier mark and our
main topic or one of our topics for
today has to deal with the fact that
sometimes you might tweet something you
don't want it sweet and you wish that
you had the ability to change that so
apparently a little while back the
Twitter CEO was actually saying that
they are playing with the idea of adding
the edit button on Twitter and Twitter
CEO Jack Dorsey he went to the Indian
Institute of Technology in Delhi to
launch a new campaign called power of 18
and that ended with a question of when
is it gonna get a Neda button when will
tweets have an edit button and he made a
lot of really good points that the edit
button would be used in a number of
different contexts number one it would
be a way of just correcting mistakes but
it also would be a way of actually
changing a narrative and that might
actually be a bit hurtful when you think
about how viral and how popular tweets
themselves can be and how they might
actually shape public opinion so I
wanted to just ask you guys how do you
feel about an edit button on something
like Twitter we obviously have added
buttons everywhere else and Twitter is
the last frontier apparently this is
such a big topic Dave I have a video in
the works actually I can't think I can
share the name of the channel the
channels gonna be called feature mark
that's me and the flagship video series
are the future of so one that one of the
videos we're doing is the future of
Twitter and this is a topic in
particular that is top of mine twitter
has always been a company that's focused
on what's happening now but Twitter has
especially over the last three years
really
shown their true colors in that they're
really more interested in the bottom
line than the integrity of a platform or
in the well-being of their users and the
edit button I think is one of the things
that's we're talking about there's a
bunch of other really big issues like
the prevalence of Nazis on the platform
but the edit button is contentious in
its own right for many many good reasons
I know that I've tweeted things all like
very very frequently where I need to
correct something for the sake of the
typo and I think that the consensus is
the the ideal scenario is is it sort of
like a buffer a waiting period I you
know either
you have five minutes set at this tweet
or maybe when you click the tweet button
there is a like a thirty seven second to
a sixty second buffer before the tweet
is actually published almost like you
know Gmail undo this but I think the the
conversation around more long-term
editing features I think is sort of like
a non-starter because of the ephemeral
nature of how Twitter's sort of supposed
to be used you know being able to go and
edit a tweet after the fact days weeks
after the fact is not is not it's not
representative of what actually
transpired and even if you put some sort
of safety valve in place where other
users need to sort of look request the
tweet or or whatever there's a there's a
simple way to game it is the issue I
think the more exciting question that's
been floating in my mind is what if
Twitter bothered to actually lean into
the ephemeral nature of the platform
what's happening now has always been
their tagline and the ephemeral nature
of content has been on on everyone's
minds over the last two three years ever
since the stories format roaster
prevalence via snapchat and Instagram
stories and maybe maybe it's time for
Twitter to institute a rolling window
revolving door of tweets where it's a
setting that's baked into the account
saying I want my tweets to be live for a
week and then after they're live scrub
them mm-hmm I think the conversation
around an edit button quickly not
devolves but you know moves off into
these tangential arenas because
it's actually a smaller facet of a much
larger problem and it's about how
Twitter wants their platform to be used
very oh I'm I'm really intrigued by the
video that you're talking abut I want to
I want to see it after you've so
eloquently put and all the issues into
place like that which makes perfect
sense right because the the the whole
problem with giving even the ability to
delete as Joseph's just mentioned even
giving the ability to delete a tweet can
also delete accountability and granted
we do live in a world now where the
moment something sensational happens
people hit that power and bottom volume
down button immediately in order to
document it and have it available
forever so what like that's that's the
but that's the weird conundrum here is
that what an edit button actually combat
those kinds of things probably not and
also they were saying in this article
here all rather Dorsey was saying that
we're considering edit but we have to do
it the right way we can't just rush it
out what is the right way if if edit is
in all together type of thing if it's an
all-encompassing thing yeah give
everyone the ability to edit their
tweets but how do you police that should
they police that it's a crazy thing and
TK I want to I want to hear your
thoughts on that I I it's it's always
yeah I mean you're right it's gonna be a
challenge regardless of the fact is do
we do we want to be able to edit I think
if they had to approach it from maybe
more of a program pragmatic way would be
to give us a basically an edited history
right so allow the user to change the
the actual tweet but allowed to be a way
for people they will see the original
tweet so even if you correct it what you
look at the tweet you get the true you
know final version of it and you'll get
that little asterisks at the end saying
it edited and at that point click it and
then you can see the original yeah and
at that point you're you're real you
realize that you know going in there to
edit to change what you said is
pointless but if it is to go in there
which is 90% of what most of us wants to
go in there fix that grammatical error
or that you know where the you know
speech the text didn't really translate
the words correctly for that treatment
you say it sent to like I did which I
need to fix I think it would solve the
problem and I think we need to be
accountable for what we say on Twitter
that is true and I think that's why we
value Twitter and why but why Twitter is
used as a platform for so
people it's because of the fact that you
can't go in there and change it but if
you can at least give us history that
think that would solve the problem and
gives the you know the transparency and
it removes their needs for people to say
well I can just you know edit away and
nothing happened you know this piece
pays it they have it spaced yeah you
think that's probably the way to be I
think if we can if we can cover the Edit
history in the UI I think that sort of
solves most of the major issues but I
think it's also a matter of who's asking
for the feature you know why do we need
it so bad why do we want it so bad is it
- protector he goes is it for us to you
know make these like oh we made a typo
is it to sort of like excuse ourselves
from having to think too hard before we
bother to tweet so I sort of present
them saying we have to do it the right
way I mean they've been trying to do
they've been shipping feature after
feature alienating the developer
community over the last five six years
like very little of what they've done
has been bothered to be done the right
way
so I have a heart I'm believing that you
suddenly care now Twitter's trying to do
Twitter the right way we're trying to do
right by us I totally agree and I love
the idea that you had earlier before we
move into our final like ancillary topic
here that I was talking about earlier um
I love the idea of I would want to see
it explored at least a little bit that
tweets can vanish much like an IG story
can or much like a much like snapchat
would be able to and again it's not like
it would truly combat anything because
if people actually want to document the
terrible or sensational things that you
do they're gonna record it like they're
just gonna it's just how it works yeah
um but I like I don't know that's a
curious idea to me and then obviously
you would have something like an
Instagram where you do highlights or
snapchat does that too but yeah you know
it's it would make people pay more
attention I feel like so if if tweets
ray want to vanish and you knew that
somebody had opinions that you wanted to
like keep an eye on you would keep an
eye on those opinions because things go
away so I don't know it's it's weird and
just just just the world of tech that we
have these days it just it just has so
many implications to it it's such a
fascinating car
but also sometimes a depressing dystopia
it does tend to have that effect but
yeah yeah you're absolutely right the
weird the only thing that I can imagine
from tutors perspective is that in doing
something like that they're effectively
saying they're effectively shunting a
huge portion of their user base off on
to some other service that would be
collating tweets because like you said
that information is gonna be captured
one way or another and whether it's
Twitter or not so if someone wants to
see a canonical version of everything
you've ever said on Twitter it's gonna
happen so that's a third party service
right there indexing someone's Twitter
account and now suddenly the Twitter
profile has been shunted off to a
separate platform no longer capturing
that attention or revenue so it's got
issues too but I mean yeah for sure I
want to actually do we have a number of
people in our live chat right now
they've actually been kind of quiet
while we've been talking about this
particular topic I want to hear what
everyone has to say about this and a
button on Twitter ironically we're going
to have you say it on Twitter with the
hashtag P and weekly so let us know what
you think about this particular topic I
think it's this is the kind of stuff
that we want to dive into like device
world is one thing but the actual
implications behind our tech is
something that I'm always so passionate
about so let's uh let's hear what you
all have to say with the hashtag PN
weakly all right so I know that mark has
a bit of a harder out today you have
basically like five ten minutes left
right so let's uh let's talk about this
little email that Jules has brought to
our attention Justin one of our viewers
and listeners writes okay so I've been
watching you guys for a few years I
currently have the LGV 30-plus pretty
good phone use it as my daily driver but
I listen to a lot of music and it being
my phone also I don't want to kill the
battery so I have three other options
which I can't find audio reviews about
an old iPod Classic fifth gen 30 gig my
HTC my HTC arrive which I think has the
Zune player since 2011 since I used it
and my HTC EVO 4G LTE would Beats Audio
all three with easy to replace batteries
that's true but not sure what would be
the best audio quality was curious if
you guys had any opinions which
leads us to this whole idea like a
modern-day specifically made audio
player this that that's what this person
is tackling with and I'm wondering what
we would say not only in his case but
for our own cases what we would use
something that we miss using as far as
audio players are concerned so iPod
Classic fit Jen
the HTC arrive which had the Zune player
in it
I'd actually don't remember that phone
and then the HTC EVO 4G LTE with Beats
so I think I think the music
conversation again pardon me I'm a macro
kind of guy so it's hard for me to like
touch on the micro without at least
giving it the context of the macro our
our music change our music listening
habits have changed so much over the
last decade as human beings and we're so
used to now relying on the algorithm
tm-2 to teach us what to list to next to
find us things that we already like so
I'd venture a guess that most of the
people watching live right now have
never managed their own music media
library and that's one of the main
things like when you think about a
device that's specifically for music
storage one of the main things I want is
to literally have every song I have with
me at all times
and that simply has it been possible
since the iPod Classic since I have a
tiny hard drive in my pocket with 160
games plus of storage and some in some
scenarios that's really I think what I
want is like something with like a
stupid amount of flash storage because I
think it's maybe time for us to start
managing our music libraries again with
the rise of Spotify in 2010-2011 and and
the streaming services that all followed
suit
it is super sad to feel like and now
everybody else is experiencing the same
thing with movie paths that that I felt
in like 2013 when some songs would just
get ripped off of our do some some
licensing deal would end and I've gotten
used to on Netflix now - movie movie
passes like the perfect example of just
it entirely going away which is totally
possible now so now we're curating other
people's data and that's a huge reason
why a fellow reader
thank you for writing in listener which
is why your battery is gonna why battery
life is even a consideration because you
have to worry about streaming the things
you don't have on your device whether
it's over Wi-Fi or data I just want a
huge amount of storage and I think that
the the real answer is I think we in our
heads need to switch our the paradigm in
our minds away from the streaming model
and back towards the sort of self
sovereign control over custodianship
over our own data model that the
internet was so good at up until social
media went ruined we just need to start
curating our own libraries of our own
mp3 and wav files and aeyden tweets we
share socially in publicly absolutely
cell sovereignty why I agree with that
in a way and the oh they jewel just said
write a journal I try my best to
personally but it's it's just it's the
matter of like time right because I
actually had this issue happened to me
yesterday where I was watching I watch a
lot of food stuff on on Netflix now and
I mean watching a ton of stuff and then
the Wi-Fi why not for whatever reason so
for about 20 minutes I was trying to
figure out what could I put in the
background because I tend to have
something in the background I can't
because everything that I watch is on
some sort of streaming platform right I
was like I'm out I'm out of distractions
I can't you know
so it's interesting how we've moved to
that and we don't have this kind of
thing where like an iPod Classic what do
you have everything that you have taken
the time to actually download it to have
with you all the time because you know
put it put it this way if you go to a
country like all the travel that I've
done has eliminated so many different
pieces of contents while I'm in those
other countries because they just don't
have it in those regions and speaking of
which speaking of regions the fact that
everybody else in the world has Fresh
Prince of bel-air on Netflix but we
don't that's just a that's it that's a
crime that's we have to call the Prince
and let him know that is not being
played at least you know I live in West
Philadelphia and I
marrying the wrong people I all
streaming services mind you yes I love
it go for I didn't want to time in real
quick on the story so I I realize a lot
that maybe maybe you've heard maybe
you've used the service itself there is
there are some I mean yet the word
streaming is still part of the game but
Plex does actually offer certain aspects
that kind of give you the control that
some of the some of us really really
wanted out of the original iPod or the
Apple music library in curating it but
you know then you manage your own
database and the rate the reason why I
mention them is because I personally
love using that as my way of keeping my
not only music as well as content as far
as movies and so on things that I
purchased and I basically put on my
internal server at home and when I'm
home even if the internet drops I'm
still able access if I'm traveling I'm
able to access it over the in and or
even make it offline kind of eliminating
the service part of it but more giving
me control to access my own library and
at the amount of music that you can put
on it especially now with the
integration with Android auto Plex is an
extremely powerful server based and it's
it runs your own private little server
and it runs on either the Nvidia shield
runs on an actual PC or you can even
that set it up like the way I have it on
an ass and you just literally it's the
best it's the best management software
for your own library you can share it
with family you can download content off
of it before you travel so if you want
to have a like a long flight you truly
is the best I would recommend if you
haven't checked it out Josh play a
little bit with plex there's a free
version of it that you could check it
out on your local network but it's
definitely worth the few minutes to
check it out but then also then
obviously predicates on the idea that I
would have my own local content correct
exactly this is a this is if you have
like let's say your existing you brought
up your own library your original add-on
library from iTunes and so on it
integrates with iTunes it transfers your
library over and you're able to interact
with it so but if you're looking to
build let's say from now on like you
know you buy DVDs but you want to watch
them but you don't want to carry the
discs with you that's something you
could do you purchase albums you can
save them to your drive and listen to
them anywhere in
car on your phone offline online
anything so it's a management tool it
works great with mass servers or even
like I said the Nvidia shield the pro
model is you have enough space to put
stuff on it that's really nice yeah
Justin just so you know just so we
actually tackle this question of yours
we went on a few different like
technological tangent but that's that
that's the world that we live in right
now there's so many different options
and I'm glad that you have these three
options that you can choose from that
potentially would have really good audio
quality I don't know from experience if
they would be better than the LGV 30
plus or even as good but I'm personally
in either of the two HTC devices
probably have a good DAC in there so you
probably have good audio quality in
those so with that in mind one thing I
did want to say you Justin mentioned the
Zune player I was thinking earlier on my
drive here I kind of miss that man I
kind of missed the Zune I'm not gonna
lie and for one reason for one reason
locally on your Zune player it used to
track how many times you listen to any
song and you can see what songs you
loved be based upon how many times you
listened to it
and when you go into your thumbs up
playlist for the Zune or your heart
playlist I forgot what it was called it
would prioritize the song as you clearly
prefer listening to more than the rest
of the ones you might have in that list
that's kind of cool and I always I
always loved that because that meant
that I didn't have to do what I do in
Android auto right now while I'm driving
like I did on the way here skipping like
30 songs yeah I'm clearly not happy with
my music library and their songs that I
want to hear and Zune used to know how
to prioritize that which is something
that I was thinking about earlier I
wanted to bring that up today like did
any of the other if you use the Zune on
device machine learning yeah way back
2008 that's true that's really true but
yeah those are those are just the best I
had I never used an iPod to be honest I
actually never used an iPod Touch or
every classic no never yeah mmhmm yeah
it was yeah it was the Zune and it was
the Walkman phones those were my local
audio playing devices and oh man I
missed those to be honest those are
great Assoc the Walkman phones
that's what I want to see like let's see
some let's see some more movement
towards specific parts of tech so that
we have a phone that is we're seeing
there right now with gaming we have the
razor phone the ROG phone but like it'd
be great to see like an like an audio
phone like a phone made from music that
has the the deck built-in Sony makes a
bunch of these Walkmans that are not
phones but you could put that in the
phone that would make the Xperia
relevant again I think it's irrelevant
but it make it more relevant now yeah
that kind of thing and speaking of those
types of players Jules actually said he
sees a lot he sees a lot of stuff on
Amazon that are like a gig players that
are running for about $50 you might need
to spend more to get more storage but if
you're using Justin if you're using the
iPod Classic 5th gen 30 gig as your
reference point it shouldn't be that
hard to get a 16 or a 32 gig audio
player that potentially has a really
good DAC in it for a good audio quality
for something like a hundred maybe a
hundred fifty bucks at the most and I
understand that you know price is
different for everybody but those are
options that you have and I think you
know what I guys I think we did it by
