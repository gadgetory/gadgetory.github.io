something really close to an iPhone 10
from Huawei air pots are apparently
catching fire now and apples already
investigating and we get a buy one get
one free deal believe it or not for the
iPhone 10 I'm hiding that I leave it out
and I'm back in the studio but the funny
part is I'm about to leave it again cuz
that's the name of the game this is
pocket out daily the official news today
begin with deals believe it or not buy
one get one free deals just reach the
iPhone 10 we've been covering for the
past couple of weeks how much Apple is
not really selling much of these and
yeah I phone eight iPhone 8 plus an
iPhone 10 it's really hard to find these
deals for iPhones there are a ton of cat
just from AT&amp;amp;T you can learn more in the
description and they're too much the
Galaxy s8 NSA plus are also included but
I'd go iPhone given the fact that the s8
is on its way out now let's talk about
the Google pixel buds those headphones
that we actually decided not to review
because nobody's recommending them as it
turns out they've just expanded to other
countries in Europe currently for around
150 euros depending on which country two
hundred and fifty something dollars in
Australian dollars as well not the best
deal in the world and we still debate if
it's really worth it to buy these but if
you're interested you can learn more in
the description now let's move the
spotlight over to the most exploding
news today as believe it or not since
we're talking about the Google pixel
buds apples air pods are apparently
catching fire now I say apparently
because there's still just one case that
Apple is investigating and as it turns
out somebody's ear pod just started
melting in his ear now I'm gonna call
this more a user error as I hear that he
was at the gym when this happened and to
my understanding the air pods are not
I'd be rated in any way meeting if you
swept them and you get them wet what
exactly do you think is gonna happen but
yeah we'll see what Apple responds to
that now let's talk about Huawei and
it's a p20 lineup as we've got some 3d
renders leaked it's launched a little
bit of a debate we're not exactly sure
if we're getting three phones that look
like each other or if these are gonna
bring differences because the pizza and
p20 Lite sorry Pete
20 and P 20 plus our what we're getting
and the P 20 plus renders show us the
possible notch design in addition to
triple camera lenses what is going to be
the case if this design is going to be
putted on others we're not exactly sure
but I'm extremely curious as to what
Huawei is planning and finally the very
hot news today have to do with a Huawei
again the company has been taking the
spotlight for the last couple of weeks
with its P 20 but now let's talk about
the mate X as we've got a trade mark and
it's just funny because we already have
the mate 10 and May 10 Pro actually I
have my US variant of the May 10 Pro
just arrived we're actually planning a
review rebuttal on it and we like this
phone in so many ways so try to
understand what the purpose is for this
trade mark of a mate X that could
obviously be dubbed the May 10th against
this device is going to compete against
the iPhone in many ways including design
and you know it leads me to the question
today I mean do you think that's the
smartest thing for OEMs to start copying
Apple again and to start following the
whole iPhone 10 trend as if that phone
was perfect because in my case you know
I like the iPhone 10 but it's not a
perfect phone there are so many other
things but I feel OEM should be copying
like the camera technology on the pixel
- that would be me leave us a comment

opinion friends again if you want to get
