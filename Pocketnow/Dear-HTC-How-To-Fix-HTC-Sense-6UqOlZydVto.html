guides i'm brandon minimun from
pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to talk about HTC Sense and why
it's loved and hated so much and more
importantly how HTC can fix it
HTC really wants you to love sense
because when you go to buy your next
smart phone you're not going to be able
to buy a Motorola with sense or an LG
with sense you're only going to be able
to buy an HTC device with that Sense
experience they want it to be a
household brand that people request at
the cellphone stores they want to make
it that good the problem with HTC Sense
all along from back in the days of the
HTC hd2 and even before that when it was
called touch flow on the Windows Mobile
HTC touch diamond2 Touch pro2 and the
touch broening all of those legacy
phones is that it was way too heavy it
was very focused on being pretty which
in a day when Windows Mobile was ugly
made a lot of sense but today Android
has gotten so much better Ice Cream
Sandwich has a beautiful interface
that's fast fluid and really pleasing on
the eye that really doesn't need much
dress-up and modification but HDC HDC
still wants to do sense they still want
to make it a selling point but again
they kind of missed the mark the HTC One
X 1s and 1 v all have the latest
versions of sense version 4.0 it brings
a lot of improvements but it still
misses the mark in a lot of ways let's
take a look at how so here we have stock
Ice Cream Sandwich on a Samsung Galaxy
Nexus it has the experience that Google
intended it's fast its fluid its
efficient it's beautiful and it really
just works very well to maximize screen
space to feel fast to have a consistent
look and feel it even has its own font
the Roboto font which is part of Android
Ice Cream Sandwich now let's bring in
the HTC One X and by the way check out
our review on that we'll put a link up
at the top which really changes
everything it's got a lot of eye candy
to be honest so we're going to unlock
the screen here we've got a lock screen
that you can drag various items into the
ring
get right to a program and let's take
something like folders for example so
we've got folders on Ice Cream Sandwich
without an inner interface then we've
got Sense 4.0 see the difference I'll
open them at the same time which one is
faster
stocke Ice Cream Sandwich is faster and
it's a lot less fluffy here in Sense 4.0
we've got all this extra padding around
these items and we've got this big Add
button over here in stock Ice Cream
Sandwich it's just so efficient we have
nothing but the icons inside of the
folder we don't have a big plus button
because it doesn't really make sense to
have to go through and check off
different apps that you want enough
older people don't use folders like that
they just drag items into a folder and
that's that so that's one area where I
think HTC is really messed up Ice Cream
Sandwich the folder experience a second
place HTC really needs to focus on here
is settings so if we go into settings on
both of these devices look at the
difference between these two the one on
the right has a lot more eye candy and
to be honest it kind of looks like it
was designed for a kindergartner it has
lots of colors lots of textures fun
animations but on Android 4.0 stock it's
fast fluid and efficient when you get to
the end of a list you get this gentle
blue animation whereas here in sense 4.0
you've got this effect that just seems
to unnecessarily toll the processor why
do you need this accordion effect when
Ice Cream Sandwich just does a very
subtle job here at fading this beautiful
little blue line up there so that's
another example where HTC Sense 4.0 just
has too much fluff another great example
is the multitask UI so we're going to
bring them up at the same time and
they're about the same speed but check
out the difference in since 4.0 you get
this very kind of pretty fluffy
interface where you flip through these
cards but by default here you can only
see one two apps open an Ice Cream
Sandwich which has a great interface for
multitasking we get to see one two three
four open apps at one time it's much
more efficient it works
why did HTC have to take away something
that already worked very well
you know it used to be that in earlier
versions of Android we could say Android
2.3 and below the interface wasn't good
enough so HTC had to do something to
spruce it up but Ice Cream Sandwich is
fast it's beautiful
let's look at the program tray and let's
actually see which one opens faster so
about the same speed they both have
animations here in HTC Sense we get
these tabs along the bottom some people
might find them useful but to be honest
I think this works much better because
you get to see more apps on the screen
at one time and it's just all in one
place so we can go to edit tabs actually
and remove some of these can't remove
that one can remove that one and what
that will actually do is take away the
tabs but that's not immediately obvious
and some people are going to be stuck
with those tabs along the bottom and you
can actually see there's still a
placeholder for the tabs it hasn't
disappeared completely
which HTC has had stuck with the default
application tray in Ice Cream Sandwich
another place where HTC has come in and
done things to make it heavier and
fluffier with more eye candy is adding
widgets to the homescreen so in Ice
Cream Sandwich stock we go over here to
widgets we take something we like and we
drag when we drop it to a home screen
boom no more room on this home screen
that's unfortunate okay so we can go
over to here let's go over here and drop
it there
and since 4.0 Wow
look what they've done some people might
like this but some people might find it
way too much in terms of the visual
intensity so we can scroll through all
these widgets we can press the tons of
buttons and navigate around and you know
slide things and turn things and twist
things and all day long and then you can
add items to your homescreen but it's a
lot less efficient than what Google does
has done in Android 4.0 Ice Cream
Sandwich by default so the problem with
Sense 4.0 is that it's still too heavy
it's still too fluffy and Android Ice
Cream Sandwich 4.0 the stock interface
is gorgeous and it's beautiful that said
HTC has actually done some good things
in Sense and allow me to show you some
of those one of the places that HTC has
done
killer job evolving much beyond what
stock Android does is the email client
so email application is one place where
sense really shines where HTC is really
added value by making a part of the
operating system that you use a lot
really pretty really functional so here
we are an email and as you can see there
are these beautiful check boxes you can
easily action on items text menus
without archaic icons if we bring in Ice
Cream Sandwich and we try to do the same
thing we get these icons that aren't
exactly clear on what they do another
great feature of Sense 4.0 email is that
you can actually look at threaded
messages in kind of a 3d way so we have
a down arrow here we can expose all of
the content there and just have a really
visual idea of what kind of threaded
messages that you have now let's make a
new message here so we're going to press
compose and compose and we'll compare
the two different screens and we run
into a place here where sense 4.0 is
again too much so here in an Ice Cream
Sandwich we've got this keyboard it's
small it lets you see a lot of content
on the screen at one time in Sense 4.0
HTC has added these directional arrows
along the bottom again too much so that
we have less content up here kind of
frustrating something that is some
people might find valuable if you're
moving around a list but you can't turn
it off it's just too fluffy but overall
the email experience between stock Ice
Cream Sandwich Sense 4.0 is definitely
improved and it looks much better so for
most people HTC Sense 4.0 is a good
thing it's pretty it's functional it
adds a lot to the operating system for
power users they just want things to be
fast efficient and streamlined and HTC
Sense is none of that even in its latest
iteration that seems to add fluff in
places that don't need fluff so HTC if
you want to fix the HTC Sense make it
less fluffy like make it less intrusive
allow what Google has done to shine
through some more don't mess with
folders so that they become these
animated padded things that are
just inefficient uses of space use what
Ice Cream Sandwich has done well and fix
what Ice Cream Sandwich doesn't do that
well to really enhance upon the features
of the phone let us know what you think
about HTC Sense and how HTC can make
sense better please leave a comment and
please thumbs up the video if you liked
it thanks for watching that's it for now
