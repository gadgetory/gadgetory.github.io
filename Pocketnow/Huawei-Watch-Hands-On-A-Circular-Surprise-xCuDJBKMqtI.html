see it on a poster and then you see it
on your wrist and if you didn't know
that saying well now you do i michael
fisher with pocket now and the Android
wear ecosystem just got another circular
screen with the Huawei watch if
Motorola's Moto 360 is Android wears
formal addition and LG's G watch R is
the beefier sportsman of the two then
the Huawei watch slots somewhere in
between without falling into the trap of
aping either the casing is 316l
stainless steel and thicker than the 360
but not so tall as to be off-putting
it's kind of like a medium-sized slammer
if you played pogs back when
wristwatches were just wristwatches
there's the requisite heart rate monitor
on the back and you've got a choice of
bands as well gold link or black leather
on the units we tested with the metal
band snapping open and shut with an
elegant butterfly clasp the front side
is of course dominated by the display a
400 by 400 round panel with 286 pixels
every inch
Huawei also claims a 1,000 to 1 contrast
ratio and while that might not be
apparent here since the demo units were
locked at their absolute maximum
brightness I can confirm that the screen
is quite a looker in person it reminds
me of the G watch R and that goes for
the size 2 at 1.4 inches it's a little
smaller than I'd like it looks much
smaller than the 1.5 6 inch screen on
the Moto 360 though the quality is much
higher and the raised ridge around the
side of the Huawei watch sometimes makes
interactions a little dicey of course
Android wear is just Android wear and
this is very early hardware and software
with a demo mode running on top we'll
see how it does in the real world when
we can review it properly when we do
word is this should be a tough sucker to
scratch between the sapphire crystal
cover glass and the cold forged steel
Huawei seems to understand how tough we
can be on our wrist wear combine the
durability claims with a full range of
available wrist bands and some kind of
magnetic charging station and hawawa
watch has most of the makings of a
luxury
Android wear device we'll have to wait
and see whether the pricing reflects
that when the watch sees release in gold
silver and black this summer and yes
unlike Huawei's smartphones this device
will be sold in the United States
stick with us both here on YouTube and
