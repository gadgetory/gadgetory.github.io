up to since the reason Google
developments the answer is a lot meet
the HTC you 12 plus what the company is
calling its way to live on the edge
though this isn't necessarily a call-out
to the design philosophy reporting from
New York City I'm home in Nevada with
pocket now and let's go hands-on to
learn why
to place all speculation behind there is
no standard HTC u12 that we know of at
least not yet
the HTC u12 plus follows on the same
liquid design that began with the HTC u
ultra with curved Gorilla Glass in the
front and the back there are three color
options to choose from ceramic black
flame red and translucent blue with the
latter being the coolest one as it
follows on its name of giving you a
sneak peak on the internals and speaking
of those we have the latest flagship
specification starting with a new
qualcomm snapdragon 840 5 6 gigabytes of
ram options for 64 or 128 gigs of
expandable storage it supports a 3500
milliamp hour battery though no wireless
charging --into ip68 water in this
resistance and this phone will actually
bring a single SKU that's even
compatible with Verizon the design has a
few new tricks like the buttons being
fully digital you will feel the phone
vibrate every time you press them and
this actually means that if the phone
fully discharges you'll have to wait
about five minutes of charging in order
for them to work there's also edge sense
too now with the double press for
one-handed usability though you can
fully map this to do something else and
also at sensitivity yes the one squeeze
for one action then the squeeze and hold
for another are still here and this
phone actually knows how you're holding
it meaning it won't flip the screen if
you don't want to boom sound speakers
have been enhanced to also be 30% louder
than the U 11 with extra tuning on the
tweeter and woofer and apparently there
will be you sonic earbuds in the box to
help with active noise cancellation as
before
reimagined we have a brand new six inch
Super LCD 6at quad HD plus resolution
and eighty by nine aspect ratio on this
display while supporting the p3 color
gamut yes there are less bezels than
before but definitely not following the
current trends that have proven to be
more popular powering the show is HTC
Sense on top of android 8.0 sadly not
8.1 and notice there is no number after
sense though the company confirms that
they're continuing to work on not
interfering with stock Android as much
as they can
features like blinkfeed are still here
in addition to the iconography and
widgets that we've praised in the past
and yes there is also support for Alexa
as your digital assistant but then
that's the only way to differentiate
this phone from others in software and I
actually find that to be great now the
most interesting thing to note about
this phone is there are four cameras yes
four on the back we have a 12 ultra
pixel 4 camera which means F 1.7
aperture and 1.4 microns the other is of
16 megapixels that F 2.6 with telephoto
capabilities both cameras bring oh is
there's Ultra speed autofocus and HDR
boost too with improvements even in
strong --let scenarios then yes there is
a bouquet mode which allows you to edit
the blur and the focus after the photo
is taken video wise the phone is capable
of 240 frames per second at Full HD 4k
at 60 frames per second it brings four
microphones for audio and sonic zoom
which focuses audio wherever you're
zooming into as for the two other
cameras they are both of 8 megapixels at
f/2 aperture and 1.1 2 microns the whole
idea here is to support bouquet effects
as well so yes this is the HTC u12 plus
I'd call it an interesting evolution to
what we've seen before but obviously our
full review will shed some light on our
final thoughts let us know what you
