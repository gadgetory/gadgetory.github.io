what this phone can do for audio during
the press event labeling this as the
front speaker well it is a speaker but
one just for phone calls our review unit
doesn't pull off the stereo speaker
trick found on competing handsets and
with that little bit of clarity out of
the way
audio expectations for the oneplus 5
were pretty high the 3t outperformed
most of the flagship sri reviewed last
year but this year premium phone
manufacturers are taking audio a lot
more seriously competition is always
great for the consumer but can oneplus
continue to undercut the price and
deliver the ear candy let's take a
listen starting off with that speaker
performance we're about par for the
course on a mono bottom firing speaker
anymore this test is becoming an
ever-diminishing listen at the minutiae
of differences between phones which
highlight lower high-frequency sound or
deliver a decibel more or less gain that
said the oneplus 5 competes very well
against similar solution
apologies were repurposing that tract
from our main review but the difference
is between the Wawa wads and the
saxophones is what caught my ear in
testing and it's reproduced here well
for mono audio now moving on to
headphone performance a nice little nod
from the company during the phone's
reveal including a headphone jack is
great but not all headphone jacks are
created equal
we're happy to report that oneplus did
not rest on their laurels from the 3t we
do see improvements to this hardware
first this DAC is now capable of
true-blue 32-bit playback and can
reproduce frequencies of sound that even
dogs cannot hear and over the 3t we see
slight improvements to noise and dynamic
range in terms of quality these numbers
are almost identical to the Galaxy S 8
in addition to quality there's also a
small but noticeable improvement to amp
output this is likely the feature people
will recognize most readily the output
power dictates how well a funnel port
will drive nicer headphones and the 1+5
will outperform all but the top-tier
options like the axon 7 or LG v 20 and a
quick word on software oneplus includes
an audio tuner to help spruce up tracks
might be nice on some genres of music
especially uncompressed audio files
it really does monkey with EQ so it's
not exactly my cup of tea but it might
be up your alley depending on your taste
so let's wrap this up where does that
leave us with the audio on the 1 + 5
well done 1 + well done indeed we'd
really like to see more manufacturers
start pointing at least one loudspeaker
at our collective faces though that will
become increasingly difficult with
current designs eliminating four heads
and chins the 1 + 5 performs well enough
it's just been a while since we were
really impressed by a phone speaker now
the real victory here comes from one of
the more polarizing legacy ports on a
phone there are some great Bluetooth
solutions available we're hoping to see
more data port dax and adapters and
android sorely needs better support for
USB audio that leaves the three point
five millimeter headset jack as the last
universal solution for folks who want
high quality audio consistently and the
freedom to use whatever headphones or
earbuds they wish with the convenience
of
from one gadget to another no
alternative solution is anywhere near is
mature which makes a story here all the
sweeter it's not enough to just include
the port you have to back it up with
some solid guts yet again punching above
its price tag the one plus five delivers
