come to the iphone 5s emerged
galaxynote3 camera leaves hint to
significant improvements and yeah we
know LG announced their white Nexus 4
i'm high meadow nevada and an extra
gallon of coffee would come in real
handy right now this is parking out
daily letters day off with the ok news
you know that there's actually this
operating system made my beau Zilla you
know firefox there's this firefox OS out
there for smartphones that's actually
out there for emerging markets and
that's the reason why none of you have
ever heard of it or actually care about
it well apparently the company is gonna
release a tablet version of this
operating system for more people to not
care about it because sadly they haven't
really focused on launching this
operating system on any hot products or
any hot OEM so stay tuned for you know
just an event that was woven to apple
reports have it that the next generation
iphone 5s or iphone 6 will have a larger
pixel count in the display than the
current generation iphone 5 you have
around 700,000 pixels on the current
generation iphone and apparently this
new one will have a million four hundred
thousand pixels which is doubling the
pixels but not really doubling because
you'd have to quadruple pixels for that
to actually be a double the pixel count
but still it takes to wonder if we're
getting a larger display on the next
generation iphone to fit the reddit
display standards or if we're just
getting a larger pixel count on that
same display stay tuned now let's move
over to samson we've got new rumors that
the company is bringing a versatile
camera module for their galaxy note 3
and that's pretty much optical image
stabilization like we get on the Nokia
Lumia products and that makes them
famous for their low light photography
obviously we still can't confirm if we
will be getting that but it makes sense
i mean like i actually know three or two
as it actually is is actually thick
enough to fit the module so let's just
hope that it actually happens it would
be awesome to get that technology on
other smartphones aren't Lumias and
speaking of launches the news that
nobody was waiting for it just happened
the CEO of LG has just announced their
new white nexus 4 you know that variant
that we were expecting to be launched on
jun 10th along with the next version of
android well it's now official
for Asia and apparently be rolling out
to these countries in the next coming
weeks could still probably be June tenth
floor this shores and could probably be
that we're still getting the next
version of android but you're still
getting the same phone on a different
color chassis and to be honest with you
I don't really like it I don't know
about you and finally for the
interesting news of the day LG's
European Vice President was recently
interviewed and when he was at being
asked about the next generation Nexus
smartphone according to him LG is not
really working on any next generation
Nexus smartphone which begs to wonder
could it be I mean it takes the company
a good amount of months to be able to
actually design build and actually start
producing a specific smartphone so I
don't think there are enough months from
here to there for that to happen could
it be that the Google editions of
flagship smartphones are going to be the
death of the Nexus lineup or could it be
that there is another OEM that's
actually building the future Nexus some
people say more role other people say
HTC that leads you to the question of
the day which one you prefer to be the
company that builds the future Nexus
smartphone or would you prefer for the
Google additions to be the future of the
Nexus lineup in my particular case I do
want a nexus phone and I do want it made
by HTC but leave us a comment down below
honestly think about it the return of
the nexus one you know get at the HTC
one nexus one that's what i would want
but leave us a comment down below what
would you want and of course for an
earlier school of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
