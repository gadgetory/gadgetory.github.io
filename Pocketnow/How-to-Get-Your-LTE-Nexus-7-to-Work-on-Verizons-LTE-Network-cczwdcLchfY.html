you've got verizon for your carrier if
so you're going to run into a problem
trying to get verizon LTE working on
your unlocked Nexus 7 but there's a
workaround I'm Joe Levi for pocket now
and I'm on location outside of horizon
store where I'm going to go in
undercover show you just what you need
to do to get LTE working from verizon on
your Nexus 7 so the problem that we have
here is verizon is old-school they they
really want you to have a device that
they've qualified and certified to work
on their network to work on their
network but really all you need is a
data sim that you can pop into your
Nexus 7 and it should work just fine but
it doesn't then the reason being it
needs to activate and that activation
process is tied only two numbers IMEI
numbers to be specific that verizon's
qualified and they have blocks of these
numbers that they've qualified and the
nexus 7 isn't one of them but there's a
way around that the way around that is
to find an imei that you can hijack now
it's not as bad as it sounds all you
need to do is essentially activate your
card your SIM card using that imei
number for a tablet preferably once
you've done that you're good it's all
just administrative but you do have to
have that number and you do have to go
ahead and activate it easiest way to do
that head to your verizon store get some
screen shots so Miami I numbers of
display units then of course have the
guy behind the counter activate your
brand new LTE sim with one of those IMEI
numbers take a home and you're set now
it's not a bad thing like I said
hijacking makes it sound nefarious and
it's really not you're just getting
through an administrative loophole here
but what you're doing is as soon as you
pop that sim in your new device it's
going to register the identification
number on that
jewel with the imei of your device and
everything will work fine mostly some of
the backend stuff like accounting and
billing isn't going to work through
their portals you're going to have to
call it in if you need to make any
changes or or have any questions about
that but you can still do it this is the
way to get around it until such time as
Verizon allows the Nexus 7 on to their
network officially and really all that
means is they've got to put the imei
numbers of the devices into their
database why they haven't I don't know
hopefully they'll do it soon this has
been recommended by numerous managers
inside verizon stores so it's not
something that we're telling you to do
to get around the system this is
something that they're saying needs to
be done and they're just as frustrated
as you are because really they're
turning customers away by not being able
to do this just really really simply the
first thing you may want to try is going
in and asking the manager to activate
your sim using an imei number from one
of the display models they might do that
they might not if you explain why the
chances are they will but some of them
may give you a hard time if that's the
case come back later one another
managers on duty and take the advice
that we gave you here in this film if
you like what you saw why don't you give
the video a thumbs up and of course
subscribe to our video channel so you
don't miss out on all the new cool stuff
that we're releasing literally every
single day of course you don't want to
keep all this great information to
yourself so why not share it with your
friends on your favorite social network
mine of course is Twitter where I am at
Joe Levi and the channel is at pocket
now for pocket now showing you how you
can get LTE from verizon on your nexus 7
i'm joe levi thanks for watching we will
catch you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
