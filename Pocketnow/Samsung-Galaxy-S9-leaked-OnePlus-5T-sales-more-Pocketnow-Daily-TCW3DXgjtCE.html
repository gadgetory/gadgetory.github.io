final design of the samsung galaxy s 9 1
+ 5 t exceeds sales expectations but
brings up some bad news when it comes to
software we hear that the BlackBerry ki
1 sequel might surprise everyone with
the spec sheet I'm high metal Iveta
packing like crazy this video is
definitely gonna be late I have to
travel and I will see you tomorrow from
Studio number 2 this parking out daily
the official news today have to do with
deals for Black Friday at the Google
Play Store if you're the market for
movies rentals movies there are some
titles that are $0.99 rentals that are
as much as 50% off and then we have a
ton of deals for applications list this
long you can learn more in the
description now let's move the spotlight
over to bad news about Google as we just
learned that the company has been
tracking our Android phones forever
until now that got caught it's been
tracking so ID information even without
your consent meaning even when you said
no Google I don't want to provide my
location the phone was still tracking
your cell ID information so it does know
where you are even when you told it not
to that is really creepy we're not
exactly sure what Google plans to do
about this we'll keep you posted now
let's talk about the BlackBerry key one
and its sequel as a the main complaint
about the key one was not necessarily
the specs but the fact that it only had
three gigabytes of RAM not that I had
anything to complain about but obviously
we Android fans or speck heads we want
the latest and greatest Hardware it
turns out that there are some League
benchmarks to show us six gigabytes of
RAM for the next-generation key one I
can't wait to see what the processor is
going to be and I do hope that they
stick to the Snapdragon 600 life that we
get and yes I do have a blackberry
motion right there that review is coming
up soon now let's talk about the 1 + 5 T
as the company has just tweeted that the
phone pretty much broke records sales
records in the first 6 hours of its
history meaning it sold a lot more
phones that it was expecting that's
great the bad news is that one thing it
didn't tweet is that it's not going to
join project trouble for those of you
that don't remember what it is
treble is what allows OEMs to be able to
update your phone quicker it will
require less hurdles and less
for that to be done but it seems that
oxygen OS is a little more complicated
now bear in mind the project trouble is
for every phone launching with Oreo and
this phone didn't launch with Oreo so
it's not like if I can say 1 plus he
didn't do this right but yeah and
finally the hot news today very early
have to do with leaks of the Samsung
Galaxy S 9
we saw some leaks earlier of a vertical
camera with a fingerprint scanner at the
bottom and we heard that that was going
to be the note 8 but it turns out that
apparently this was the design for the
galaxy s 9 and you know that case leaks
are rarely ever wrong so we could set
these in stone we noticed that the
fingerprint scanner is now placed where
humans can reach it thank you and I love
the vertical dual camera design
hopefully this is the galaxy as nine in
the end but it leads me to the question
today what do you think do you like the
fact that it changes completely in the
back but then the front looks pretty
much similar to what we have because in
my case I like it just like that I
really don't want the galaxies to change
their front I love the way it is even
with the whole iPhone 8 design I don't
care sorry iPhone 10 but leave us a
comment down below in love to know your
opinion friends again if you want to get
