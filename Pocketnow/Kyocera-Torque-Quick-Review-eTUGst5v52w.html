that can dive to the bottom of a lake
and fall off a mountain or deal with
solar radiation in this video probably
isn't for you I'm Michael Fisher this is
PocketNow and this is our quick review
of the Kyocera torque it only takes one
look at the torque to see exactly who
Kyocera built this phone for hot tip
it's not speck worshipers the dual-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 plus at 1.2
gigahertz backed up by a gig of ram and
a paltry 4 gigs of on-board storage
expandable via microSD isn't
top-of-the-line neither is the 4-inch
480 by 800 IPS display or the 5
megapixel primary camera it's a
different kind of spec that sets the
tork apart durability sprint has
enlisted the aid of outdoor survivalist
Bear Grylls to pitch this 14 millimeter
thick 156 grams smartphone to rugged
types consumers who need the toughest of
the tough in their mobile devices the
torque is certified to mil spec 810g and
ip67 ratings meaning it can stand up to
among others dust shock vibration
blowing rain solar radiation salt fog
and immersion for up to 30 minutes in up
to one meter of water in fact on a
recent episode of pocket now live our
review unit spent almost the entirety of
the Hangout in a pitcher of water even
receiving a phone call with no ill
effect the torque is chunky and awkward
as a result and it's hardware is not
without its downsides the direct connect
button on the side is far too easy to
push waking up the screen constantly and
despite its durability rating we were
able to jar loose our memory card with
fairly slight impacts the recessed
screen is a smart move in terms of
scratch protection but it causes some
usability problems and while it's bright
it's not terribly viewable from the
sides on the plus side the bottom placed
front mounted speakers are outstanding
they're incredibly loud in both
speakerphone and media modes and they
dry out quickly after being immersed
unfortunately the software is something
of a speed bump the torch ships with
Android 4.0 we were expecting that back
at MWC Kyocera told us that's a
limitation forced on the phone by
Sprint's Direct Connect walkie-talkie
service which doesn't yet support
jellybean
what disappointed us though was its
responsiveness or lack thereof the UI is
laggy and nowhere is this more apparent
than in the keyboard whether you use the
default swipe or the stock Android
keyboard input lags constantly it's
impossible to get up to a reasonable
typing speed even after installing a
third-party keyboard like Swift key
whether this is a problem imposed by the
ruggedized display or by the Torx
special software build it's very
frustrating there's also the matter of
the pitiful 4 gigs of on-board storage
less than a gig of which is
user-accessible out of the box which
makes the use of an expansion card
almost mandatory if you're planning on
downloading a lot of apps taking a lot
of photos or videos or participating in
really any of the other activities that
justify owning a smartphone we tested
the Kyocera torque over the course of 11
days on Sprint's CDMA and LTE networks
in the Greater Boston area we found
reception to be good on both networks
but there's an annoying hitch here
Sprint's Direct Connect walkie talkie
feature only works on 3G so if your
phone is using the faster 4G LTE network
you won't get any radio calls and you
won't be able to make any so you have to
force the phone to stay on 3G if you
want to receive those we realize this is
probably a technical limitation but it
seems ridiculous to make customers
choose between fast data speeds or to a
radio functionality it's yet another
compromise in the torques design one
which Direct Connect users in particular
aren't likely to appreciate on the plus
side when you're able to use it Direct
Connect works very well
walkie-talkie calls made to both modern
CDMA and older I den or Nextel phones
went through without a hitch it's a much
less buggy experience than it once was
and the loud speakerphone makes hearing
the other party very easy in terms of
phone calls the torque packs an
interesting addition the smart sonic
earpiece uses tissue conduction via a
ceramic transducer rather than a
traditional speaker during our testing
that resulted in a little more fuzz on
our side of the call but it also let us
hear callers quite
well even in situations with a lot of
ambient background noise and even
through industrial-grade ear protection
caller said we didn't sound all that
great on their end calling our sound
distant but they could ultimately
understand us with minimal effort there
are plenty of customizations and feature
settings available in the camera
application though touch to focus is not
supported which disappointed us
we liked the dedicated camera key on the
torx hardware as it let us take an
underwater photo or two which is fun
results overall are just okay with fair
colour reproduction but exposure
problems and fuzzy edges and a serious
discoloration at the center of some
photos prevent us from giving this
camera a rave review overall the stills
will work for casual photos and social
media sharing just don't expect any
miracles video is fine at 1080p though
we wish there was better focus control
and a less jumpy playback during fast
pans sprint quotes 18.9 hours of
talktime on the 2500 milliamp hour
battery which is a big figure but it's
easy to believe the torque did quite
well in our usage testing easily lasting
over a full day with moderate use and
even holding up admirably after 18 hours
of medium to heavy use including a
series of benchmarks battery endurance
was better over 3G of course but when we
did switch over to LTE we managed to
average speeds of 10 megabits down and
just over 4 up not amazing compared to
some competitors but certainly
respectable considering that Sprint's 4G
rollout is still in its infancy if you
need to squeeze even more lifetime out
of the device the torx eco mode and
Maximizer are there to manage your
milliamp hours most rugged smartphones
are an exercise in compromise and the
torque is no exception the hardware is
wonderfully built perfect for an
outdoorsman or a construction worker but
it's writing checks the software can't
always cache the people this phone is
targeted at don't have time to fiddle
with Android and tweak their settings to
optimize their smartphone experience
they need their phone to just work and
thanks mostly to the awful typing
experience the torque often doesn't
unless you move at a very slow and
deliberate pace and wait for the
software to catch up to you that gets
old very quickly and if your try
to get things done on any kind of a
schedule it becomes infuriating as a
voice centric device the torque does a
nice job especially in terms of its
speaker its battery life and its
ruggedness but what point is paying for
the bells and whistles of a smartphone
without being able to fully harness it's
smarter features there are already a
bevy of cheaper feature phones out there
that are just as rugged Kyocera has said
that it has plans to upgrade the tour to
jellybean when Sprint's Direct Connect
services ready though so if you're
willing to trust that that update
improves the devices responsiveness the
torte can be had for 99 bucks and a
two-year sprint contract we don't
advocate buying any phone based on such
an assumption but those searching for a
rugged smart phone have always been
faced with limited options full of once
again compromise and that holds true
here we give the keys here a torque for
sprint a six point five out of ten
it's going to do it for our quick review
of the Kyocera torque if you enjoyed the
