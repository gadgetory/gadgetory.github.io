won't be as ugly as many of the dummy
units make it seem while wait mate X
just got certified and apparently it's
ready to launch coming very soon and it
seems that scammers have found a way to
extort iPhone users through an
interesting trick that you should all be
aware about i'm hiya metal Iveta and
yesterday is a very sad day our
condolences go out to all the families
of those affected by the Kyoto Animation
fires this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with deals if
you're in the market for the Nintendo
switch you do know that it's going to
get updated soon but still if you want
to grab it right now the original switch
is currently 265 bucks on a new eggs
eBay store yeah I know it's just 30
something dollars in discount you could
also get something similar at Amazon
where you're getting it for the same
price but then you get a $30 gift card
whatever the case may be both options
are in the link of the description now
let's talk about a very interesting
problem that's happening right now for
iPhone users that are being scammed
through their iCloud beware right now
there are scammers from Singapore and
other parts of Asia that are using
Facebook to invite users to become of
this free beta testing gaming thing and
the thing about it is when you log on
they ask for your name and your iCloud
and using that what they do is they
pretty much take over your iCloud they
lock your iPhone and then if you want to
unlock it they scam you and they extort
you for money in order to be able to do
so the biggest problem is that well your
iCloud is enough for your phone to be
rendered useless so buyers beware guys
do not participate in this it seems that
Apple support can help you if you're
going through that problem right now let
us know in the comments this is really
sad I mean Facebook is shady on its own
so I would recommend I mean come on man
free game beta testing and then they
asked for your iCloud that's just not
right now let's talk about Nokia and a
very recent development and we're trying
to ensure that it's actually Nokia think
about it is we've got some leaked images
of a feature phone that's running
Android or we assume that it's Android
or these are Google apps running on a
feature OS I mean we've been covered
rumors of the possibility of Google
launching a competitor to Kos which is
the feature phone operating system
that's most popular right now but
apparently this leak shows as I mean
Chrome it seems that other Google
services are working which could be
either two things either it's Google
apps are working on this or it's
actually Android a fork version or some
sort of version of Android that works on
these feature phones that have Google
services whatever the case may be
obviously you know it's it's interesting
to find feature folks today but my god
that market is huge in certain country
still Nokia is being benefited by this
so it would make sense for Nokia which
is currently the biggest Android one
supplier I believe to you know take on
another challenge we'll see now for
those of you that are still wondering
about the Galaxy fold you know it's so
sad to see how much this product hasn't
lost buzz the last time that we covered
it was I don't know how long ago we
still don't have dates for you but the
thing about it is apparently Samsung
sent this to the Korean University for
testing apparently had passed that test
and this was the last system they were
waiting for in order to be able to
consider this product ready for
primetime so this happened just a few
days ago so we're not exactly sure of
you're getting this product soon because
we heard that the unpacked event that
we're going to is not going to feature
the fold so I don't know we'll keep you
posted we'll come prepared with camera
gear and everything in case we actually
do get a product and since we're talking
about foldables let's talk about the
huawei mate X that's another product
that we don't know exactly when we're
getting but the thing about it is it
just got certified
we've got final specifications and it
seems to pack a karin 980 processor an
8-inch foldable OLED display that's six
point six inches when folded a 40
megapixel main sensor along with the
naming a pixel telephoto and a 16
megapixel ultra wide in addition to the
time-of-flight sensor it will have 12
gigs of ram and 512 gigs of expandable
storage all for the cool price of the
2300 dollars or euros which apparently
is not changing so yes stay tuned we
heard argost as a possible launch we'll
see and finally the hottest news today
or developments should we say have to do
with the iPhone 11 and all the dummies
that are out there right now we've seen
a couple of videos
Marquez's is probably the most popular
right now where we see what the iPhone
11 looks like according to the recent
dummy leaks the interesting part is when
we get leakers like Ben Gaskin who is
like you know what this looks close but
it's not exactly quite the final design
that we're expecting apparently there is
some insider information that the inside
of the camera is not going to be black
but apparently it will be to a certain
degree the same color of the chassis and
so he uses marquesses video as an
overlay and shows how it should look in
the final design meaning what we're
seeing currently in the dummies is not
exactly what we're getting so you know
in today's question we've got an
interesting one I mean think about it if
the design would be the camera colored
as the chassis or not which one would
you prefer look at both images think
about which one is your favorite so far
and come on iPhone haters don't say none
pick one the black cover or the colored
cover cuz in my case
honestly the color that matches the
chassis is growing on me particularly on
the black variant but that's just me and
I'm hoping that the hammer hump is also
as small as we've seen from history
leaks I mean been Deskin I'm hoping
that's the case what we would love to
know what you think in the comments down
below
