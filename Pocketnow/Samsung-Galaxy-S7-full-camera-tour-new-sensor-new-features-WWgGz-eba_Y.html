on replying to user criticisms of the s6
and note 5 so this is a year to refine
but camera tech is something Samsung
always champions let's take an in-depth
look at this year's camera app I'm one
Carlos back now for pocket now and
here's our full camera tour of the
Samsung Galaxy s7 brought to you by D
brand here it is the galaxy s7 camera
app we can always expect a game of
leapfrog between Galaxy S and Note
phones a few features missing from the
galaxy s6 are finally included and a few
fun features are added over the note 5
everything about this phone is snappy
ascend and launching the camera is no
exception while I loves me a dedicated
shutter button Samsung's double pressure
cut is maybe the fastest way to get into
any phone camera on the market today if
you've been keeping up the specs are
confirmed from Samsung's unpacked event
and we are looking at a company backing
off the megapixel count to focus on
low-light sensitivity and focus speed
and accuracy
Samsung reps are quick to point out that
everything here is pre-release and there
could still be a few changes but
honestly we haven't discovered any
omissions or places where we might see
major surprises maybe the most
interesting change from last year's 16
megapixel shooter is the return to a
four by three aspect ratio image sensor
you'll end up with a fairly square frame
if you want all 12 megapixels the
widescreen mode is again the crop and
drops resolution down to 9 megapixels a
little disappointing after the number of
great cameras we've used incorporating
native 16 by 9 aspect ratios if you've
played with a note or edge camera
recently the layout here will be very
familiar we have one main viewfinder to
hold both photo and video shutter
buttons users don't need to switch modes
for either option you compose your shot
and decide in that moment if you want to
capture a video or still below the
shutter is where we'll toggle between
the front and rear facing cameras no
surprises with the 5 megapixel front
camera it's still one of the better
options for taking pictures of yourself
and it's still one of the few to offer
quad HD video since the note 4 Samsung
has been offering one of the most solid
solutions for video bloggers below that
we have our mode menu getting us into
pro mode the new panorama mode and
familiar tools for selective focus video
collage slow-motion hyperlapse virtual
shot and live broadcast
Jen's in auto mode the left side of the
frame is home to flash timer and HDR
controls and from here we can easily
change the resolution and aspect ratio
for folks who like to apply filters the
effects option will handle most jobs
there and you can download additional
filters from Samsung dating the gear
icon allows us to adjust video
resolution again very similar options to
what the s6 offered UHD and quad HD at
30 frames per second 1080p video at 30
and 60 frames per second then a square
frame option for Instagram purists at
1440 by 1440 then 720p and standard
definition resolution modes which no one
will probably ever use in this day in
age of monster flagship phones samsung
has included a motion photo option which
we'll talk about more in a bit and from
this gear menu we can also toggle
composition options like tracking
autofocus gridlines for those of us who
live by the rule of thirds location
tagging picture review options quick
launch settings raw file saving volume
key control and the ability to hard
reset the whole camera app my main
criticism of this layout from the s6 in
the note 5 remains here that adjusting
these settings removes you from the act
of composing your photos and videos
making this a semi translucent menu
wouldn't completely block your
viewfinder of course the trend for
flagship phone cameras is to include a
level of manual controls for us to leave
the point-and-shoot camera at home here
we see improvements over the s6 camera
and an expanded range of settings from
the note 5 the layout hasn't changed a
new strip appears left of your shutter
button from bottom to top you can make
quick adjustments to exposure or advance
to manual shutter speed ISO white
balance and manual focus on a Galaxy S
we finally get manual shutter speed
control with the same 10 second long
exposure found on the note 5 at the top
there are excellent expanded controls
for post-processing you can dial in
extremely granular settings for how your
photos will be produced when a JPEG is
created color temperature tint contrast
saturation highlights and shadow
information separate from the main
exposure and white balance settings used
to capture the photo our options for
video have improved over last year's
phones but remain a little on the lean
side the menu strip stays in place but
options we can't use are grayed out this
exposure compensation is much easier to
use from this strip then the solution
offered in auto
with the floating light bulb or what
Apple uses post focusing we now have
access to white balance and manual focus
but we still lack the ability to adjust
shutter speed and ISO users can toggle
between multi autofocus points or centre
point the dual pixel sensor here is
fantastic for fast focusing but it's
entirely possible for someone to lock
that down to a single autofocus point if
need be switching up the metering mode
will change how the phone adjusts to
light conditions a spot metering mode
for example will take exposure cues from
where you tap on the screen to focus
even though this is pre-release software
performance is fantastically quick as
mentioned launching the camera app is
fast the phone is capable of acquiring
focus in about the same amount of time
it takes the average human to blink and
the burst mode is insane the more
powerful phone guts paired with the
lower resolution means in good light we
can pull off a 100 photo burst in a hair
less than 6 seconds that's almost 17
photos per second in the tech world we
like to stir up geek debates when
companies include features that rival
manufacturers implemented first Samsung
has added a motion photo setting but
instead of getting up on two who did
this first COFF COFF nokia did it
samsung has taken steps to improve the
output it's an actual small snippet of
video a la apples live photo mode but
it's a smoother and higher-quality
snippet to capture the moment slightly
before and after the photo was taken
where Samsung has expanded the idea of
motion living live photos is by
including the feature in panorama
creation panoramas are created in the
same fashion as the s6 and no.5
wonderfully splicing the photo together
through a slow lateral pan but the phone
records the past as a video file too we
get a finished ultra wide JPEG you can
share but clicking this button on the
phone will play through a video sweep of
how the panorama was created it's
genuinely a fun feature to expand on the
role of video snippets to enhance our
still photography unfortunately Samsung
reps did not have any of the new camera
cases on hand for me to demo maybe one
of the more exciting developments for
mobile phone photons is a first-party
case solution for attaching fisheye and
wide-angle lenses directly to the phone
so folks for a first look at the galaxy
s7 camera on pre-release
software the state of Samsung photo and
video capture looks strong all the parts
here look like they're in place and we
didn't run into any serious issues
taking the app for a spin nothing about
the s7 is revolutionary and the camera
is no exception
however this collection of subtle
refinements looks to improve over
previous Samsung camera offerings
there's a lot more to cover though once
we get a galaxy s7 to review how larger
pixels in the wider aperture influence
low-light performance and the quality of
the background blur so stay tuned for
more coverage once we start reviewing
the phone proper a pocket now is MWC
