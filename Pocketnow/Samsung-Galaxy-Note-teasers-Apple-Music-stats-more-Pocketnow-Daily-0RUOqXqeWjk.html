just two phablets in its unpacked event
we get the first possible leaks of the
huawei nexus phablet and that will also
provide solid numbers for how many users
are testing Apple music I'm high netting
that I and I always wondered exactly why
is it the thursdays aren't the best days
of the week this is pocket out daily the
official news today start with Apple as
the company is senior vice president for
Internet services Eddy Cue was recently
interviewed by USA Today and he provided
details on Apple music particularly how
many subscribers are testing it he
teases 11 million users out of which two
million are for family plants meaning
there are six more users after that
which is interesting considering the
fact that it's only been in the market
for a month and that Spotify has 20
million users and is available in
everything else in addition to just iOS
which is the gaze of Apple music so it's
a good way to start fifty-five percent
the question is what will happen after
that three month trial is over and
that's what we really want to see the
numbers speaking of interviews the
company CEO was recently claiming that
even if they wanted to they couldn't
read our I messages or share our
facetime calls or anything because
everything is encrypted on to buy spaces
even if the FBI would come up to ask for
stuff they wouldn't be able to provide
it but it turns out there is this full
study in the legs of the description
that I highly recommend that you read
that says otherwise that even though the
FBI will not be able to grab all our
data they could grab some important data
indeed so interesting again read it it
probably pertains to what you care about
other very important official news have
a sous launching a new battery with a
phone in india we're talking about the
issues zenfone max which is pretty much
a Zen phone to laser and specifications
but with the added bonus of a 5,000
milliamp hour battery the company hasn't
really provided details on how long that
battery will last since this is a
battery with a phone indeed but we
should expect this product launched in
october and we will keep you posted we
definitely want to review it moving over
to the hot rumors of the day there is
this very interesting video roaming
around on the internet that shows is the
huawei Poseidon which apparently
is the nexus phablet that the company is
working on now probably because we heard
that it had a metallic back and it
doesn't seem so in the video but the
fingerprint scanner is there even though
this wouldn't be the only Huawei device
with one so there's a lot to expect from
Huawei when it comes to the feature of
the Nexus products that are rumored to
come from Huawei we just want to confirm
if this video is legit and we will keep
you posted to confirm and finally for
the very both interesting and
disappointing news of the day first of
all Samsung is teasing that there is
apparently a tablet in the works to be
announced and it's unpacked event which
is great since this will be a lineup but
on the other hand we've got some trusted
sources claiming that there will not be
a gear a product being announced and
unpacked which could leave things for a
foe which is not necessarily bad but it
does lead me to the question of the day
you have to choose do you want a samsung
tablet or the gear a which one would you
pick because in my case honestly I would
pick the SmartWatch particularly because
I'm not too happy about Samsung tablets
