pocket now daily we'd like to thank our
sponsor boost mobile for making this
video possible I'm sure you knew it but
Boost Mobile offers unlimited talk text
and data with no contracts and if you
hit the friction description or this
annotation up top you can say fifty
dollars off your next smartphone
purchase before march 31st boost mobile
is a great option the iphone 6 phablet
may be delayed according to certain
reports the all new HTC One is ready for
a launch tomorrow and bring some rumors
we have more details on Samsung's return
to Windows Phone I'm hi mera neta and I
don't usually celebrate but when I do I
make sure it's not on a Monday unless
there's some good excuse for that this
is pocket now daily let's start stay off
with some official news is I'm sure a
lot of you ask yourself what you could
do with 35 bucks aside from barring
somebody around of lattes and as it
turns out google continues to push their
chromecast they just launched this
application called photo wall which is
exactly that it turns your chromecast
and TV into a photo frame and this
application is available for iOS and
Android and allows you to doodle draw a
note 8 and even build the full YouTube
video out of whatever you do and this is
free you gotta love that chromecast
don't you now start about Samsung and
Windows Phone even though both companies
haven't really worked together that well
but we got the leaks of the Samsung a
teeth SE for verizon and this is a
windows phone 8.1 handset that should be
launched somewhere around April
nineteenth and even more interesting is
the fact that we get hardware buttons
and it follows all the aesthetics of the
galaxy s4 so if you're interested in a
samsung Windows Phone it's coming now
let's talk about the oneplus one and i
did not get an extra one there we know
that's the feature cyanogenmod that a
lot of people are waiting for and we get
some specifications fully official
specifications and we are getting two
Snapdragon 801 on this phone as opposed
to the recent rumors that we were
getting to Snapdragon 800 we are
expecting for this phone to launch with
cyanogenmod very soon and supposedly
it's gonna be a big thing even though
the specification Tsar pretty much the
ones you get in every other smartphone
that you can root and get cyanogenmod on
anyway so that's gonna be interesting
I'll talk about apple and its iphone 6 a
lot of people have been waiting for this
phablet plus the other phone that's
apparently going to be launched as well
we get a 4
coin 7-inch the 5.5 inch phone and we
get the first leaked dummies of what to
expect for the phone now these dummies
aren't made by apple but we do know that
case makers are famous for getting the
designs just right months before the
phones get launched and this is from a
case maker so definitely the phone is
bigger it looks exactly the same like an
iphone 5s if you Lotus in the photos but
again it is bigger so stay tuned for
that is we get some more rumors that the
phone will probably be delayed at least
a phablet barians apparently Apple is
going to wait until the fall and that's
going to be interesting and finally for
the hot news of the day that's gonna
actually happen tomorrow let's talk
about the all new HTC One which will be
announced tomorrow expect our full live
coverage make sure you join us for our
editorial roundtable that's happening at
twelve thirty eastern where we'll talk
about everything that we saw at the
event what we liked what we've been like
and obviously our impressions and we'd
love to have you on the QA we've got
leaked videos we get more leak teasers
of what to expect from this phone and
this could probably be one of the
hottest phones of the year we are
expecting for that to be the case but
that leads you to the question of the
day what are your predictions for the
all new HTC One exactly what would that
phone need to make you love it in my
particular case if they keep the same
design and give me a better camera I'm
sold but leave us a comment down below
