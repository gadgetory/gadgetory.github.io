according to analyst LG has already
begun teasing its feature smartphone
announcement we get Henson to which OEM
will start launching Android marshmallow
a my anatomy that I am the problem was
working from a desert is this crazy
farmers tan but this is parking out
daily the official new said I start with
Microsoft those of you waiting for lumia
smartphones to be announced well the
company has just shared out
presentations for an event to happen on
october six which is rather sad because
that means that if they will be
announced until october six which is
pretty much a month from now then when
are we gonna get these devices launched
stay tuned as a we hopefully will get
more information other official news
have to do with LG the company has also
sent out presentations for an event to
happen on october first and the company
is teasing that we are getting
smartphones or at least the device and
for those of you that don't remember the
company's CEO tease that they're working
on a super premium phone to help with
their stark slumps so not necessarily
sure that's gonna be the case for this
event in new york city but hey can only
dream and for those of you that are
waiting for two things another HTC
flagship and also android sixth auto
marshmallow well seems that both things
are going to be combined because trusted
sources claim that HTC is working on the
HTC One a nine codename arrow apparently
this device will be ready in time to
launch with Android sixth auto although
it will have since seven as a skin so
you're not getting stock Android but
apparently October will be the time and
even though we are still waiting for the
next smartphones to come we've had tons
of teasers for the LG Nexus and Huawei
Nexus we've got some website sources
from google that claim that the company
is working on a nexus protect which
could be that the company is working on
their own version of applecare meaning
you know extended warranty services that
will allow you to swap a display or swap
your device in case that something goes
wrong now obviously remember these are
just leaks from Google's internal
websites it could just be nothing but it
could mean a lot hopefully it'll be
affordable and finally for the very hot
rumors of the day we've already got
analysts predicting that Apple broke its
own records with the iphones
6s and 6s plus according to them the
company broke its 10 million unit record
over the weekend even though they didn't
specify what numbers were sold or how
much they estimate that was sold during
that period of time but apparently sales
for the iphone 6s and 6s plus have been
positive but it does lead me to the
question of the day the you pre-order
the iphone success or success plus
because in my case well I didn't
particularly because I still don't find
the big difference here but leave us a
comment down below what is your case
