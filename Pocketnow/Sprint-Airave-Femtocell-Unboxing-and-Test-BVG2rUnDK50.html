pocketnow.com if you're anything like me
you've had a little bit of trouble
getting signal with your sprint phone
indoors particularly for me it's
happening at my home where I have zero
coverage whatsoever I step out of my
house I have four bars however once I go
into my house I have no signal at so
ever and that is not a good thing for me
so sprint offers their own i guess you
could say microcell are a femtocell
alternative called the sprint airave in
this video I'm actually going to unbox
the airave set the airave up and test it
out and show you if it's really working
for me or not so let's go ahead and get
to it alright it we're back and we're
gonna go ahead and do a true unboxing
here we're going to cut this guy open
taping everything so the box has not
even been touched yet this is a true
unboxing for you give you the real
experience we're unboxing this guy
together more or less kinds of padding
on top here you go here we go box is
very basic see Samsung air rave as you
can see right here and what I'm going to
do is I'll just open it up real quick
and kind of show you what's in the box
and then I'm going to go ahead and get
it set up I'll show you the setup if
need be and show you with my my results
hopefully I get some better signal with
this so this is the actual air wave
itself I believe this was called the
uber cell before they changes the name
10 itself so it's about the size of a
wireless router as you can see antennas
on the back there's also going to be the
input port the wind port and a AC
adapter port looks like it will stand
right up as you can see right here from
the stand opening this up here we have
few manuals the basics it will give you
the ethernet cable just simple power
adapter one of the things i want to
touch on though is this guy right here
this is a 30-foot gps extender cable
which goes to the gps unit itself they
include this because in order for you
use the e-911 service you have to
actually have GPS connect now we're
going to go ahead and get this guy set
up and i will show you possibly a
glimpse to the setup process and i'll
show you my results something i actually
do want to just let you see real quick
is where this comes in i have zero
signal right now zero bars this is my
sprint EVO so before and hopefully and
after okay so I've actually gone ahead
instead of the airave on the second
floor of a house in a guest room that's
why you're hearing some of the echo
because this room isn't really fully
loaded however as you can see right this
is actually a system light sys that's
blinking which means that it's setting
itself up right now more or less so it
says to wait at least 10 minutes up to
an hour though so we're going to give
this guy some time and then I will
report on the signal of the evil itself
okay now I've actually gone ahead and
taken the camera off of the tripod so i
apologize if it's a little shaky i want
to give you a better tour of this device
itself so my area of is now fully up and
running so you can see we have a power
and a system light that's basically the
data and the fact that it's connected we
also have the gps as well as the base of
the input the land connection now if we
look over here I actually had to run
this GPS unit because i'm actually gonna
be using this in the middle of the room
now I haven't actually hidden these
cords yet so these cords will be snaked
behind but that's the GPS external unit
as you can see right here and that will
be fixed in time now to kind of show you
the back of the you know the side of the
unit first we have the sprint logo as
well as the samsung logo and then once
again on the back this guy does get a
little warm we have the intent of my
intent is pointing down because this is
on the first floor I actually want
signal in the basement which I do have
five bars and i will show you next and
there's also basically a power outlet
here and the ethernet cord right there
and as you can see right there this is
the gps capable going out alright guys
and i'm back after setting up the evo
foley and i would say i have success as
you can see right here i have a pretty
strong signal almost entirely full it
does fluctuate i am in the basement of
my house actually right now so if i move
to the very corner you know it may drop
down to two or three bars but i do have
coverage now where I before had no
signal whatsoever and I'm actually to
show you a quick way to see as to
whether or not you are within your
sprint airave coverage zone now I'm only
showing you half of my screen that's
because the
top half is actually showing my contacts
telephone numbers and I don't want you
to see those so without star 99 here if
you heard that beep they're made them in
the area of zone and that repeating
message is telling me that I am within
the airave coverage zone so what that
means is basically where I'm standing I
am within the airave zone and I have as
you can see here pretty much full signal
can't complain it all so once again that
was the sprint airave that is available
through sprint you can actually go
through either a sprint store get it
through their customer service the unit
itself is ninety-nine dollars now the
airave covers 5,000 square feet for a
house so if you're lacking coverage with
sprint indoors because of the higher
spectrum I really do recommend the area
for it's working great for me so far so
worst comes to worst you can try it out
and if it's not working for you can
always return at risk free sprint does
have that guarantee so you liked this
video please give us a thumbs up and as
always subscribe thanks for watching
