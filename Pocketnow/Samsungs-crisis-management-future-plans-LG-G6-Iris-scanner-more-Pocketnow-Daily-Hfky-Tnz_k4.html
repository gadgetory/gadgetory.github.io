management is needed going forward the
LG G 6 may pony up on some innovations
we saw in 2016 and the mobile internet
usage is finally taken over the market
I'm high Meadow iveta thank you all so
much for your feedback yesterday we're
gonna continue trying premiere
approaches to try something new we would
love more your feedback this is pocket
out daily the official news today have
to do with deals those of you in the
market for a really great smartphone
from last year that's still good today
the Moto Xperia shin is currently for
two hundred and fifty dollars on best
buy I know it sounds too good to be true
this is a really good phone it's got a
lot of really great things going for it
even though it's a year old again
starting at that price range it's really
been hard to even consider Moto G for
that yeah you can learn more than
discretion we've got some very
interesting statistics that claim that
mobile browsing has finally taken over
desktop browsing it's a labor of love
that's happened over years as we notice
that phablets are taken over and also
tablets in a way that people don't
really need computers anymore because
what they do is really the basics that
you can do on a phone so according to
the numbers right now 51.9 percent of
users prefer to use their smartphones or
tablets to consume content and to browse
the web and it most likely will continue
growing now let's talk about Apple as
we've got iOS 10 dot to public beta live
and even though we rarely cover public
beta releases this one's actually a
major one because we've got some
interesting new I changes starting by
the fact that we actually get two more
wallpapers one of my biggest complaints
about the iphone 7 was that there was
only one and one alone but yeah we got
new wallpapers in addition to some
changes in the iconography for Bluetooth
connectivity and others a couple of
changes in addition to also some bug
fixes that you can learn more in the
description now let's talk about the LG
G 6 as a LG is desperate to figure out
how to make a spotlight next year and we
hear that the g6 will innovate in a new
iris scanner now currently for example
in the galaxy note 7 or at least before
on the galaxy note 7 there were two
separate cameras one for the selfie
camera the other one for the iris
scanner and just as we saw
LG innovate with the lgb 20 with that
selfie camera that can do both wide
angle and crop it seems that the plan is
to do the same with the LG G six
hopefully they had a good back to that
thing as well and finally the very hot
lucid they have to do with Samsung's
plans for the future in a recent
anniversary meeting Samsung's co-ceo
came on record just had a very
interesting phrase claiming in a
nutshell that Samsung had discovered
over this recent crisis with the galaxy
note 7 that the company was complacent
and that this was a new beginning for
the company a new strategy a new wake-up
call / thanks to the company needed to
do and that crisis management this
pretty much what's going to push samsung
going forward now bear in mind Samsung
is very famous for trying a ton of
things and some some of these products
even make it out to the market even if
they were just an RD crazy project but
the Galaxy Note lineup was one of them
phablets on their own or one of them so
it leads me to the question of the day
what do you think that Samsung should
innovate on what new would you like to
see in smartphones because in my case I
would simply just prefer for samsung to
you know use its assets to bring us
better smartphone design include a
replaceable battery in that better
smartphone design and in addition to
that fix all of its software problems
but leave us a comment down below we
