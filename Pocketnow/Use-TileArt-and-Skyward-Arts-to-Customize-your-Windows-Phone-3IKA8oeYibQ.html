striking platform but for a long time it
was also one of the least customizable
thankfully that's not true anymore
i'm michael fisher with pocket now with
a quick look at two very different ways
to customize your Windows Phone tile art
and skyward arts we'll start with tile
art hashtag hashtag because that's
what's blowing up on social media this
week hashtag this is an app from Rick
Webb a Microsoft employee who built it
after getting frustrated with the other
customization options out there the
Lumia conversations blog is a good
interview with Rick linked in the
description below the thing to
understand about tile art is that it's
exactly what the name implies and
nothing more this is a way to add
cosmetic touches to your Start screen to
break up the wall of tiles and make the
phone feel more your own but it won't
add any new functionality in fact it
takes some away since the tiles used for
the graphics can't be assigned to any
apps or functions sadface that said it's
really fun to drop your own custom
graphics into your Start screen while
maintaining the tile aesthetic that
makes Windows Phone so distinctive I
went with a Star Trek theme please try
to contain your surprise and frankly it
was kind of a rush job nothing compared
to the bonafide masterpieces that some
other people have come up with even so
my own effort took me the better part of
an hour because as cool as the tile art
app can be it's also kind of cumbersome
Microsoft already has a how-to video on
this which we're linking to down below
as well so I won't take you through all
the steps just bear in mind that you
might need a little while to really get
the hang of how this thing works
unless you're smarter than I am in which
case good for you whatever because you
can use tile art to put any image you
want on your Start screen you can also
use it for spacing tiles if you just
fill the canvas with solid black that's
what I did to separate my tile art
homescreen from my skyward arts one and
that's the other half of this quick look
skyward arts isn't new the developer has
a bunch of Windows Phone apps from the
useful to the not so much but the shadow
tile pack is new and as a press time
it's still on sale for free in the
windows
or so hit up the link in the description
if you want to snap it out other icon
packs run about a buck apiece so for now
I'm sticking to the shadows in contrast
to the tile art approach the skyward
implementation is all utility it breaks
available tiles down into supported
third-party apps and supported native
apps separated into distinct columns
notice I said supported for each
presumably because of limitations
imposed by Windows Phones architecture
there are big gaps in functionality here
so while you can install a shortcut to
compose an email
you can't put one in for your email
inbox same deal with SMS you can drop
shortcuts to toggle things like Wi-Fi
and Bluetooth but there's no provision
for adding a tile for the settings menu
and probably the biggest knock against
this packages well just look this isn't
a freeze-frame these tiles just aren't
moving because they can't considering
how crucial the live part of live tiles
is to the Windows Phone experience
that's a big ding but really this is
about the look and like Roxette says
it's got the look the shadow effect is
really cool-looking and the ability to
adjust the color to basically any shade
the software can produce is really nice
also to skywards credit it's third party
app selection is pretty extensive from
mainstream stuff like here Facebook and
Twitter to really niche titles like
found bite and rap dialer there's a lot
of stuff to choose from then of course
you can always just drop a standard tile
where skyward doesn't provide one yeah
that does detract from the unity here
but clever use of background graphics
might help overcome that
at least until Windows 10 drops and
changes the wallpaper rules all over
again the shadow tile pack and others
are available for download in the
Windows Store we want to see your
creations visit us in the shell post for

fisher with pocket now captain to phones

Start screen like you build your life

wanted thanks for watching everyone
