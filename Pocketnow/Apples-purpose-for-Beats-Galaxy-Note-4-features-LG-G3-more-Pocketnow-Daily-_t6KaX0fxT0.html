music for its talent and not its
technology we hear more software
features of the galaxy note 4 we get
additional details from companies that
want to build sapphire displays I'm hi
meri behna and the only unbreakable
glass that I wish I'd have would have to
hold liquid on it this is parking out
daily today is Friday and there are no
official news that are worth talking
about but tons of rumors first of all we
got support documents talking about the
gear solo from Samsung and rumors have
it that this product will include a
fingerprint scanner will include a
camera it will definitely be a
smartphone in a SmartWatch and we should
be expecting a lot more from this little
instrument full details on just about
everything that's been leaked now sorry
about LG is one of the most anticipated
products of the year is the LG g3 and
the company has just published some
teasers three teasers to be exact and
they show a very cool smartphone it
looks really really hot we're expecting
a lot of features to come and hopefully
the biggest rumor is that apparently the
event happens on May 27th the phone will
be ready for lunch the next day that'll
be cool let's see how it goes that's
being of LG you guessed it there are
more companies that are interested in
bringing set fire displays into their
smartphones and LG is one of them and
Samsung is the other now there are no
specific details as to how these
companies plan to make this happen in
Asia apparently this will be far from
the United States plan that we see from
Apple but still the products are coming
and hopefully they can bring that price
down compared to apple I'll talk about
the samsung galaxy note 4 i've been
getting a ton of questions over the
phone on twitter and trust me I've been
waiting for it more than you guys are
but we get four new software features
that are coming to that seemed to be an
HTC ripoff but then two of them all
right for example aqua shot which would
require you to be able to submerge the
phone so apparently that will be a
waterproof phone and apparently you will
be getting a fingerprint scanner on this
phone as well stay tuned as Aoife as the
Pavo launch and finally for the very
interesting news of the day there are
some interesting reports that apple is
really planning to buy beats by dre not
really for its technology as we know
Apple's been doing music products for
the longest time but really early Apple
wants to bring the hip management from
beets into the apple ecosystem culture
and DNA apparently the managers it beats
her cool dudes and they could bring some
of that culture into apples music
business which has been getting more
elegant than cool lately and its really
interesting as obviously it's not like
if you can't find culture eyes managers
but you know beats is famous for its
design it's famous for it looks and is
famous for its marketing so I do
understand what Apple wants to do but
that makes you see the question of the
day what do you think about this whole
idea of Apple wanting to be more hip
bringing the guys from beats because in
my particular case 8 i've been a fan of
dr. dre ever since nothing but a G thang
and if you don't know which song this is
then you don't know Dre but leave us a
comment down below I'm actually happy
about this and friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
earlier before this video is so mushy
follow us on out our comments a
script writing channel as well you'll
also follow me on twitter hind
underscore very meta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am Hein that I bet up thank you
very much for watching we will see you
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
