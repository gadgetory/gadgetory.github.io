continued in rumor bill the google nexus
5 get slates on video running android
4.4 kitkat and nokia has already begun
teasing their october twenty second
event i'm high never iveta and believe
it or not I've been coffee 3 for the
last two days which kind of reminds me
of when I quit smoking this is pocket
out daily let's start stay off with the
official news as no guest begun sending
out press invitations for an event to
happen on october twenty seconds and
this follows all the rumors that we
talked about yesterday about nokia
launching their Lumia 1520 phablet in
October now obviously it's hard to
predict that this will be the device
launcher the only device launched within
this event so stay tuned even though
some people are already talking about
this phone being called the Lumia 1020
too now let's talk about Sony those of
you impressed by the Sony Xperia z1 at
Aoife and Berlin can now pick it up in
the UK links in the description as to
where the company's new stab at
smartphones brings a better camera
quality better build quality a
waterproof device and etc etc etc you
can bet our review unit to reach the
pocket now labs very soon so stay tuned
as to what our impressions are of
everything that's on paper in the real
world now let's talk about the google
nexus 5 as the device just got leaked on
video and what would a video leak be if
it's not at a bar that's exactly the
protocol it's always followed we're not
sure the device got lost at a bar or
what but as it turns out we get to see
the device you know it's the LG Nexus 5
everything that we saw at the FCC but
interesting it's running Android 4.4
KitKat and if any of you notice any
differences between that and jelly bean
please leave us a comment down below
because I can't figure it out the videos
are quite small wins the description for
that now let's talk about iOS 7 those of
you waiting for it can get it tomorrow
on your compatible iphone though yeah
you can expect those service to be
jammed so be very patient about it if
you want to learn more about what's all
the buzz behind iowa 7 make sure you
watch our full playlist of everything to
expect here now and even more
interesting twist is that apple has now
made it official that if you hold an
older and I mean very older version of
the iphone like for example the iphone
3g you'll know that apps like facebook
don't work on it because they require
iOS
spondence not compatible for the iphone
3g for example so what Apple is doing is
that it's finally allowing you to
download the old version of whatever
application is not compatible with your
phone so that you can still run it on
your legacy device so it's kind of
interesting twist apparently it's
already available make sure you look
into the App Store see if you can get
that old version you won't be getting an
alert for that and finally for the
interesting news of the day we are just
a couple of days away from the launch of
the iphone 5s and 5c and you can expect
that there are a ton of bleep unboxings
already of what to expect within the box
but interesting we are already expecting
shortages for the iPhone 5s is the
second time we hear rumors and
apparently if you're interested in one
you'll have better chances on getting it
in Space Gray apparently the one that's
harder to get will be the golden iPhone
because it seems that Apple assumes that
you'll want the space great model more
but anyways that leads you to the
question of the day are you ordering the
iphone 5s and if so and what color in my
particular case honestly I am going for
the Space Gray model just because the
white one looks exactly like the
previous iphone 5 and then the gold one
looks like a girl's best friend in my
opinion but anyways leave us a comment
down below what is your opinion or which
device are you getting friends is always
for an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone and
tempura machine follow us on out
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well you also follow me on Twitter
Jaime underscore iveta let's get this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am high Madalena thank you very
much for watching see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
