would break SmartWatch records in the
first weekend google has just decided
that any TV can turn into your computer
and motorola gets sweet with a new Moto
X steal I'm hi Mary vera and if there
were a possibility to eradicate april
fools count me in this is parking out
daily brought to you by Linda calm it's
hard to tell which are official news
today and you guys know why so
disclaimer guys but motorola started off
confirming that what they were doing was
a prank in part they're giving away one
hundred forty dollars uh off if you want
to buy a Moto X and they're also giving
away some discounts until april
fifteenth and yep the whole moto selfie
stick is a joke but the discount isn't
and it's a good price drop for the moto
x now a company that has not been doing
a prank with its vr headset for the g3
is LG and they're bringing this deal to
the united states like the description
there are select stores where you can go
buy an LG g3 and yet we're close to the
g4 i know they're trying to get rid of
the existing stock but you'll get a free
vr headset we're not sure if you're
getting a g3 vr headset particularly but
we do know that whatever you're getting
is google cardboard compatible which
could be good or bad because this is
free up anyways but again mix to the
triple d' tails now a company that is
trying to sell you Chromebooks as fast
as possible as google price drops and
everything but the company has just
launched the new chrome bit in
conjunction with a sous and what this is
is pretty much sort of like a chromecast
but instead it is a computer meaning you
get a full fledged quad-core processor
with two gigs of ram 16 gigs of storage
not expandable obviously but this is a
full Chromebook for a hundred dollars
that you could purchase very soon in
addition to other chrome books that were
also launched now let's talk about HTC
those of you that were disappointed in
the company launching the one een ein
plus instead of the One m9 plus we
continue to get more leaks and this time
we get the first renders of the phone
possible renders
it looks much better than the previous
leaks that we've seen those were clearly
early prototypes we couldn't expect this
phone coming very soon we just don't
know when or in which markets and
finally for the hot rumors of the day
analysts are already predicting how much
Apple can sell when it comes to Apple
watches in the next few weeks a
pre-orders begin on April 10th the
launches on April 26 and the company is
assuming that there will be as many as
300,000 pre-orders on the first day and
the more than a million Apple watch is
sold during the first weekend now you
have to remember this is a market that's
barely sold a couple of million units
over the last three years and that
includes Android wear that includes the
pebble of so yeah this is a very
stagnant market and it's really hard to
believe that apple will be able to sell
so many apple watches it's such a steep
price but it does lead me to the
question of the day do you believe that
Apple is capable of selling so many
Apple watches on launch date because in
my case I do believe it I just don't
think that the feature Apple watches
would sell that much but leave us a
comment down below that's not what you
think and folks if you've ever wanted to
