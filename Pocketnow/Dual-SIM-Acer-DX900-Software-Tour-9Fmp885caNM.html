pocket now calm and this is the software
tour of the acer d x 900 if you remember
from previous videos this is one of the
very few devices ever to exist that can
manage two phone lines from one device
by having you insert two sim cards into
the back of the device so in this video
we're going to take a look at the
software on the device if you want to
see what it looks like to manage these
two phone lines I'll put a link up on
the video to the the video that shows
using the two phone lines in action so
let's take a look at the software my
turn on the device with the button on
the side and the screen has been rotated
I'll go through that soon and what we're
taken to immediately is spb mobile shell
2 point 0 as you know three point 0 is
out which brings a lot of improvements
but this is actually the old version but
we still like the old version right so
we can flick our finger we can access
favorite people add new ones click our
finger again get access to our internet
favorites and settings and multimedia
and this is a very customizable platform
to allow you to really make it your own
so we'd like mobile shell we think it's
a good addition we just wish that mobile
shell three point 0 would have been
included on the device so we can exit
mobile shell by going to the exit button
here and we're taken to the standard
Windows Mobile today's screen which is
kind of bland and boring but that's why
they put mobile shell on top of it okay
so let's go into the start menu and I'm
having to use the stylus because i find
the screen on this device isn't the most
sensitive screen then we've worked with
before so let's go through this in games
we have the typical games bubble breaker
and solitaire nothing interesting there
in gps we have some gps utilities such
as gps viewer which will let you give it
see a better idea of which satellites
you're connecting with in that sort of
thing location SMS will send your
coordinates to someone via SMS if we go
to multimedia we have the camera
application and the camera is a 3
megapixel camera and there is got to get
it in focus here and there is a flash on
the camera which is good and it has
rotated again
we've streaming player so that you can
watch videos from m youtube com mobile
YouTube going down the list we have some
entries here in phone such as sim
manager scenarios which will allow you
to kind of set profiles if you want it
to ring or vibrate or or depending on
what you're doing outside it'll keep the
ringer at a very high volume spb mobile
shell that just has some utilities in
there we also have some utilities backup
utility memory optimization which is
actually kind of funny it will on a
regular basis reset your device because
windows mobile doesn't always close
programs when you exit them so the idea
here is that you reset your device and
all the memory gets flushed out in your
back to zero again default settings will
bring it back to factory condition
application recovery is if you
accidentally delete some of the
preloaded programs on the device and you
want to bring them back voice commander
is a program that lets you control your
device with your voice and you don't
have to train it just like microsoft
voice command so that's good you can say
please call Bob or what time is it or
what's my next calendar appointment
going down the list we have
communications manager let me show you
what that looks like it's a very finger
friendly communication manager you can
individually turn off turn on and off
phone one in phone too and of course
phone two is the auxiliary phone line
that you use associated with the second
SIM card going down the list we have
some usual stuff task manager and that
sort of thing if we go to the Start menu
we see that we do have the office mobile
sweet included which is good so we can
view powerpoint excel and word documents
now as you've seen a few times already
this device has an accelerometer built
in so that you can do screen rotation in
any screen and the screen rotation is
actually pretty fast and you can't go
down this this way it actually flips
back the other way and you can turn this
off if it gets annoying I would probably
turn it off personally because I think
having an accident
rotate all the time which it has been
doing is kind of annoying although you
can't change the sensitivity of it so if
we go into settings and we go over to
system gravity sensor we can change the
sensitivity right here so if you want to
make it low then you probably won't have
as many accidental rotations so let's go
back into the settings here if we go
into buttons we have several hardware
buttons that we can customize to launch
certain programs which is good so that
you can quickly launch email or a gps
program like Windows Live search at just
a press of a button we've settings here
for phone one and phone too because
obviously there are two phone lines on
this device an overran system we can
take a look at how much memory we have
left we've been opening a lot of
programs we don't have that much memory
left sadly and I think this device slows
down significantly if you if you're
using a lot of programs so you're going
to want to make sure that you're closing
programs are exiting them if you have
that option so that you keep free memory
available and final if we go into
backlight we can determine if the device
uses the light sensor to regulate the
screen brightness which is always
recommended so that you can maximize
battery life and finally over in
connections we've nothing interesting
here although we have connection wizard
which will pre configure the connection
settings on your device to the carrier
that you're using so this is an
international phone and they have Dave
settings for many many different
carriers across many different countries
so I'm in the USA and I went to the list
went away
and I went to AT&amp;amp;T Wireless and by the
way this does have the bands necessary
for AT&amp;amp;T 3g as you can see up here i'm
getting a little h4 hsdpa so in terms of
performance a view as you've seen
through this demonstration it's a little
bit laggy going from screen to screen is
pretty fast I have a concern about the
amount of program ram that is available
when you start to multitask a lot in
terms of battery life it's okay battery
life nothing great you're definitely
going to have to charge this every day
if you're using you know any level of
email or GPS or Wi-Fi or things that
take their toll on the battery life and
a quick note on the on-screen keyboards
this is the finger friendly on-screen
keyboards called easy keyboard
unfortunately it's not arranged in a
qwerty fashion and that thus it's very
difficult to use however he rotate to
landscape you actually get a much better
layout of the keyboard that is quite
large and I have to say it's actually
easy to use when it's this big so let me
try two types a little something here
take some getting used to but it's
actually not that bad I just wish that
there was a qwerty keyboard that is that
was finger-friendly that you could use
in landscape so it takes some getting
used to but it's not it's not that bad
though the keys are pretty big so
overall I think the acer d x 900 is is a
good solution if you want a windows
mobile device that does two lines it's
really one of the only options that you
have I have never been a fan of acer
previously eaten Eaton's quality build
quality isn't that terrific on this
device it just doesn't feel high quality
in hand like an HTC device and I feel
like the software is kind of haphazardly
optimized you know they threw spb mobile
shell on the top of this to make a
finger friendly but nothing else has
been changed to be finger friendly the
menus are small I have had to use the
stylus a lot through this demonstration
because really the screen isn't
sensitive enough and items aren't big
enough on the screen to make a finger
friendly so really in the end this is a
mediocre device but really an okay
choice if you're looking for a device
that can handle two phone lines which is
a pretty unique capability so that's it
for the acer DX
900 if you want a device like this of
your own they're shipping right now at
clove co uk that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
