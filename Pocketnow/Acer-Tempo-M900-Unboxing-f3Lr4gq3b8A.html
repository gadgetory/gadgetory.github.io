pocketnow.com and this is the unboxing
video for the acer tempo m900 this
device is well positioned as a
competitor to the HTC touch pro2 it
actually has a larger screen and some
other features that are slightly better
than the touch pro 2 and some features
that are not as good as the touch pro 2
we're going to do a lot of comparisons
and talk a lot about how the device is
compared after the unboxing so let's get
to the unboxing and see how acer did
with their new flagship device if you
remember acer bought eaten and Eaton's
devices were always not that great so
this is really a sers chance to prove
that it can be a worthy OEM of windows
mobile devices m900 it's got a nice
slide out keyboard it doesn't have a
tilting screen but this keyboard looks
really really good it has an oversized
spacebar key this key board may be
better than the HTC touch pro2 in fact
the keys are offset just like it they
are on the touch pro 2 so let's take off
this extra piece of plastic
alright so let's take a look around the
box HSPA wvga screen that's the highest
that Windows Mobile can support Wi-Fi
Bluetooth GPS five megapixel camera the
touch pro 2 only has a 3.2 megapixel
camera it also is a fingerprint sensor
on the front we'll have to see how they
implemented that and let's take a look
at the specifications people in the US
will be happy to know that this device
will do us 3g it's got the UMTS 850 and
1900 megahertz bands that is what is
needed to do 3g in the US the touch pro
2 can't do 3g in the u.s. so if you're
watching from the united states you
definitely want to pay attention to this
unboxing so far I like what I see
alright so this is device will put this
to the side for a minute see what we
have in terms of accessories if we have
some good stuff in here so we have a
case and let's do the smell test to see
if it's leather good to see a case and
this is actually a belt clip you
remember the touch pro 2 came with this
which is really just a case it's not add
up quick so here's another way that the
n900 maybe a little bit better than the
touch pro still smell test um it smells
like vinyl so it's not real leather but
people will appreciate having the belt
clip right there we get an extra stylus
which is collapsible that's okay we get
some headphones that use mini USB so
this doesn't have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack but neither did the touch
pro 2 we have wall charger USB cable
mini USB wall charger again and other
stuff in here here we have the battery
which is of size 15-30 milliamp hours
that's a little bit larger than the
touch pro 2 which was 1,500 milliamp
hours don't wave some software and
documentation user manual and so on and
so forth user guide which probably won't
color oh well so let's get to the device
really curious to see how this thing
looks so it looks like you slide it
through the top it's got a lot of weight
to it and with the battery it'll have
even more very very slick design let me
take off this plastic wrap so we can get
a sense for how large the screen is a
massive area of just a touch screen this
is beautiful hopefully the screen
sensitivity is good the screen is as big
as it is on the HTC touch HD let's see
how the keyboard will looks nice spring
assist it's a little bit weak and it
feels a little bit cheap I feel a little
bit of wiggling but we have to talk
about that the keys are kind of raised
here anyway let's do some comparisons
with good we got a flash on the back
some miles this metal maybe metal let's
do some comparisons with other devices
so of course we have the HTC touch HD
look which has the same size screen a
3.8 inch screen the iphone has a 3.5
inch screen and if we look at the its
competitor the touch pro two touch pro2
only has a three point six inch screen
so let's take a look at how they compare
and thickness the m900 is definitely
thicker and it's taller and it's wider
so bigger in all dimensions let's take a
look at how the keyboards compare so
even more surface area on the acer tempo
m900 then on the touch pro 2 we don't
have a dedicated number row
unfortunately we have soft keys which a
lot of people will probably appreciate
because the touch pro 2 doesn't have
soft keys and of course the touch pro 2
as the tilting screen that is where it
really Trump's the m900 this doesn't
have a tilting screen but take a look at
this biometric sensor here interesting
so let's see how it compares to the HTC
touch pro obviously has a much larger
keyboard and a comparison to the diamond
to which has a smaller 3.2 inch screen
certainly much smaller so in terms of
hardware the hardware is pretty
impressive on the easter tempo m900 of
course it all comes down to software and
use your experience we're going to talk
a lot about that in the upcoming video
the M
900 actually has a 3d home screen that
is set up like a desktop in an office
and so we're really intrigued about that
there's a lot to talk about with this
device follow us on Twitter for more on
on the acer tempo m900 twitter.com slash
pocket now tweets and if you want an M
900 of your own check it out at clove co
uk it's actually running about 80 to a
hundred dollars cheaper than the touch
pro two so again another reason to
consider this device will be back with
the hardware tour coming up soon that's
it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
