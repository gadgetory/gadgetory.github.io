today we've gotten the Dolphin Browser
HD we've shown you this before but they
just released version 5.0 beta 1 let's
go take a look alright this is a beta
first and foremost it is not available
in the market as of the time of this
recording you have to download from
their website so make sure you head over
to pocketnow.com so you can get a
download link so you can try it on your
own Android powered phone but once you
go ahead and download it and I just scan
a QR code and downloaded it straight
down here to my downloads folder it's a
just a little bit over 2 megabytes but
I've installed that I've played with it
and then I uninstalled it so I could
show you the installation process
because it's a little bit different than
than what you'd expect it's a little bit
different from what I remember in
previous versions of Dolphin so I
thought it would be good just to go back
to basis and show you what it looks like
through the process so as we do that
this is a t-mobile g2 running
CyanogenMod seven nightly which is a
Android 2.3.4 ROM you can see all the
permissions that this is going to be
given go ahead and install it I am
connected over Wi-Fi so speeds should
not be significantly degraded by the
network connection go ahead and open it
installs very fast at this point you're
given a big long line or a big long and
use your license agreement which isn't
all that cool but ok it's basically
saying that you agree to share analytic
data you agree that the terms can be
changed anytime without having notified
you yeah go ahead and read this stuff
but it's just kind of annoying that they
have it in there most apps don't will go
ahead and accept that
welcome to Dolphin HD and runs us
through a short setup wizard now this is
something that Brandon showed you in a
recent video it's about plug-in support
if you want to make your device faster
turn off plug-in support or set it to on
demand so when you're loading a webpage
up that has you know 10 or 12 flash
objects on it instead of loading all
those and taking all the time for that
it's just gonna put placeholders in
there and if you want to load one of
those you tap on it and it will then go
out and grab that resource and load it
into the screen so really speeds up your
browsing experience if you're not using
those flash components and most of the
time we don't when you think about what
is flash it's games its ads primarily
and that's about it so if you don't want
to see those flash ads no problem just
keep an on-demand or never and if you
want to see the videos then just go
ahead and keep it on demand so that when
you want to see that you can tap and it
will load so very easy I'm gonna set it
to the default here just your settings
this is one of the cool things about
about dolphin and that's you can use
on-screen gestures to write what you
want just with a simple finger stroke if
you will we can either hide it set it to
the bottom left or the bottom right it
defaults to the bottom left so it'll be
right down here we'll accept that and go
next data storage this is something that
I disagree with the the default setting
it defaults to caching to phone I like
to cache to sd card that's probably
because I have a fast SD card if your SD
card is slow it doesn't have a class on
it or class - you may want to cache it
to phone but my internal storage is very
precious to me so I move it over to the
SD card next the volume button this is
something that is really cool with this
browser and it takes me back to my
Windows Mobile days the volume button
right over here is a rocker so I got up
and down well once I am inside the
Dolphin Browser the Dolphin Browser can
remap that volume button so it can
either use the default action you know
which would either be volume up or down
or media volume up or down scroll up and
down the page or even switch tabs well
this stroll up and down the page I
happen to like quite a bit because that
was the old behavior of that that volume
rocker over on Windows Mobile not
Windows Phone Windows
mobile we're talking away long ago so
I'll go ahead and set it to that we'll
go next user-agent this is what you want
in this browser to tell other the
websites basically that you visit do you
want this to be the Android browser
which is the default a desktop browser
iPhone iPad or custom now you can set a
custom one so if you want this look like
Internet Explorer 6 you can and then
those websites will respond back
accordingly not every website has user
agent sniffing or user agent handling
but some of them do and for those that
do it might look better in one or the
other for example they may have just
said well I want to make my website look
good on the iPhone and forgot that oh
you know what there's androids out there
too so this is a way you can go over and
change that on a browser wide basis
rather than a site by site basis so
we'll leave it at Android go to next
some other settings that we have but we
can either show the pinch-to-zoom button
or add shortcuts the home screen will go
ahead and do both and if you're gonna
add shortcuts to the home screen you're
gonna need to have some room on your
home screen it will try and find room on
any one of your home screens but it will
throw an error if you can't find any so
let's go ahead and choose next alright
keep updated with us they want your
email address and yes you do have to
fill it out it is a beta that's one of
the requirements so we'll go ahead and
do that so I am Joe at see if I can type
good on screen and I'm at it kind of an
odd angle so looking at what I'm typing
and actually typing is a little bit
different and it did an autocorrect for
me there so Joe at Joe Levi comm we will
finish and then we're presented with the
Dolphin Browser down here in the corner
you can see kind of a shadowed version
of a finger that is your gesture button
when you tap on that it comes up and it
shows you how to do a gesture and go
back or you can go into the gesture
settings so here are the settings that
are pre-built in adding a bookmark back
forward
go to bottom go to top Facebook and yes
those who just heard that that's new
mail I have the Star Trek communicator
because I've got so many people in my
office that have androids now I know I
was like the second person there and now
everybody has them so I had to find a
new notification sound and that's what
that is just in case you're wondering
because I know you're gonna ask about it
in the comment so we can go ahead and do
this all kinds of nice stuff we can go
in and change things if we want to but
you know I'm pretty happy with those so
let's go ahead and go back there's a
recommended add-on here it's gonna do
this the first time you use it you can
go out to the market and download this
bookmarks to SD which is essentially
going to backup or allow you to back the
preneur store your bookmarks from
various different dolphin based browsers
to your SD card and it's also going to
keep your google bookmarks synced up
with it if you want to try it you say ok
it will take you to the market so you
can download that I'm gonna say cancel I
assume by saying cancel it won't remind
me again because there is a never button
right there so we'll go ahead and cancel
that over here you'll notice we've got a
tab to interface so here's our first tab
it's got the Dolphin Browser there's a
plus button over here we'll go ahead and
open that up and very very chrome like
I've got all of these speed tabs or
speed dial buttons or I could go to I
assume this is going to be the top part
is something you can set it's got this
little plus button down on the bottom it
has the most visited website so it
separates the two out for you you can
have your own bookmarks essentially
frequently these bookmarks up here and
then it will remember what websites you
visit most frequently of course
everybody wants to see what it looks
like going over to and again it's hard
for me to type at this strange angle
doing it on camera
so Brandon you're gonna love this we
have a new website it's pocket baucom so
pocketnow.com but before i hit enter on
that what i want to do is pull out this
nexus 1 which is also running a
CyanogenMod nightly
and we're just gonna open up the stock
browser again we're on the same Wi-Fi
network over here so we're going to go
to pocket now which is spelled with the
W now.com and again I'm sorry guys I'm
looking at this at a weird angle so
we've got the two pocket now pocket now
all right
let's go ahead and hit the Go button on
both of these and almost exactly as fast
on both of them the mobile version of
the pocket now website came up all kinds
of good let's switch over to the desktop
version and I started a little bit
earlier on the g2 than the Nexus One but
you can see the speed over here on the
Dolphin Browser is a little bit quicker
than over on the the Nexus One at least
in initial loan and initial
functionality both of them look good
they've rendered everything
appropriately
I have flash turned on apparently over
here on the Nexus One so our flash ads
are coming up and displaying we're over
here you can see this ad right here has
the missing plug-in link so I can tap on
that and then it will go through and
reload the page with the the flash
component in there so kind of
interesting one thing to note is it did
that not only for that flash piece about
that flash piece as well so it looks
like it's a page wide flash turn on not
just an individual component so kind of
neat let's see if we can go to a another
website and I'm gonna be a little bit
self-serving here and we're gonna head
out to Joe
Levi dot-com now this site is not mobile
optimized at this point in time it's
desktop browser optimized mobile is
coming eventually whenever I get time
for it but just to see what it looks
like on both of these let's go ahead and
go
I do have a randomization script running
on there so it's gonna look a little bit
different a little bit faster initial
load over here but overall about the
same speeds between the the two browsers
scrolling around is a little bit a
little bit nicer on the nexus one
because I've got this interesting that
little characteristic and that's what
I'm gonna get into next so this page
then this is why I deliberately picked
my page is wider and then then what I
can see in what what's called a viewport
the viewable area of the screen is
should be important web development
terminology I have to scroll back and
forth to be able to see it but the
Dolphin Browser has a feature where you
can scroll over to the side and get your
bookmarks bar which is cool and scroll
over to the other side and get your
plugins and other stuff over there so
you've got this other functionality
built in that kind of can get in the way
if you go too far over in being able to
navigate around a to wide screen so it's
a feature that's there and it's neat and
I like it but it's also a feature that
can get in the way so it's gonna take a
little bit of getting used to for you to
realize what's going on and whatnot
another thing I like about this in
addition to the visual tabs that it's
got across the top and being able to add
a new tab quickly and easily is this RSS
button I can easily tap on that and it
takes me to my RSS handler which in this
case is Google Reader so it wants me to
sign in there and let's see if we can do
a gesture and go back that one didn't
work too well for us did it oh that's
because it opened in a new tab okay so
let's go ahead and close the tab that's
something I didn't notice is it open in
another tab I only have the two it
didn't give me a good indication that I
had more stuff over on the side so be
aware of that but it does give you RSS
which the default browser coming back
over here does not have some of the HTC
Sense browsers do have that RSS handling
which I really really like I'm a big RSS
advocate
but overall speed is really good
compatibility with sites is really good
being able to play plugins especially
flash also good you do have to have the
Flash app or the Flash plugin installed
to be able to do that but for a beta
there are some kinks there are some
hang-ups it is still very nice it is a
great evolution of the Dolphin Browser
and if you've been looking around you
know kind of on the sidelines waiting to
go over to an alternate browser go ahead
and give this a try there's only one
more thing that I want to mention here
and that's if you go back home and so
here's our Dolphin Browser
okay two things that I want to mention
come over to an empty area of the screen
we can add a shortcut and that shortcut
can be a bookmark
okay the bookmark is gonna open up in
your default web browser you can also
add a dolphin bookmark which is going to
open that bookmark in the Dolphin
Browser so that's really kind of nice
and that gets me to what I was gonna say
is if we come down here and launch the
browser action in this case it's opening
up the browser but if I had that
bookmark over here it would pop up with
a dialog and ask me hey what app do you
want to use to complete this action and
it comes up a lot you have to specify a
default winner it's gonna harass you
sometimes two and three and four times
per webpage especially if that web pages
has frame sets on it so if you want to
try it set it as your default browser
it's easy to unset that as your default
or to uninstall it if you want to as
well but definitely worth the download
and the try again the link for the beta
version download is going to be over at
pocketnow.com so make sure you go ahead
and take a look at that if you like
seeing these kind of beta videos so you
can either try them or no not to try
them yourself make sure you give this
video a big thumbs up if you haven't yet
told your friends about pocket now now
is the time to do it and of course if
you are watching this over on YouTube
make sure you subscribe to our videos
that's really the best way to keep up to
date on technology the website has an
awful lot of stuff coming to it we've
got an RSS feed to help keep you up to
date there you can also do basically the
same thing with YouTube so that you can
keep up to date with the videos there as
well
subscribing is free as always and
comments on both the video and the
articles are greatly appreciated and
encouraged if you've got questions
comments or saw something that I didn't
mention or glossed over too fast make
sure you let us know that in the
comments so that we can share that with
everyone else who is reading the article
and watching the videos so for pocket
now and pocket now videos I'm Joe Levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
