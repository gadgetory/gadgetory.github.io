a really quick exclusive video to show
you the new google voice widgets in
action let's go take a look okay so with
the new g2 rom that was recently leaked
we found a new google apps package and
inside that was a couple widgets that
showed up for google voice and we had a
lot of hope for these that you know
Google might be getting a little bit
closer to enabling voice from the
handset without going over your cellular
voice provider not quite there yet but
I'm still hopeful with that came these
two widgets the first is google voice
settings the second one is the google
voice inbox and to get to this of course
you find an empty spot you're going to
need a 3 x 1 square on your screen for
each one of these widgets tap and hold
on that empty spot choose widgets scroll
down here to find the widgets and then
tap to insert it now you can see I've
already got the other one loaded up the
google voice inbox widget shows you just
that this is a call that i have i've
already listened to it so it's not
unread and i can just tap on it to take
meet right in there the settings widget
down on the bottom lets me open up
google voice to the inbox quickly
compose a message go into settings so i
can toggle between if you notice down on
the bottom it's set to ask for every
call right now use for all calls do not
use for calls use international only so
you can just toggle through all of your
settings right there i like all calls
and then over there is do not disturb so
if you've only given out your google
voice number and you don't want anyone
to call you you want everything to go to
to voicemail you can just tap that and
turn on or turn off do not disturb mode
so really nice you can do that all
really quick couple things to note you
are going to need froyo this will not
work on android 2.1 or below you have to
have 2.2 or up
and that you have to download it through
a little bit more shady of sources if
you will I'll include a link to that so
if you do have froyo and want to give
this a try you can go ahead and do that
this will replace the stock google voice
app that you can get from the market at
least for now because it's currently
unreleased officially so kind of neat to
show you hands-on so here's our hands on
exclusive of the google voice widgets
that came with the leaked g2 rom i'm joe
for pocketnow.com if you like seeing all
kinds of exclusives and before you can
get them apps go ahead and give this
video a thumbs up if you've got any
questions or comments leave those down
below and if you haven't already
subscribed to our video channel so you
can stay up to date on all things
pertaining to smartphones and especially
my favorite the Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
