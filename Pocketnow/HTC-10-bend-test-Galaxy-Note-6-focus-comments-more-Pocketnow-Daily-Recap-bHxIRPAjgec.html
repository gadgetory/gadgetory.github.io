into the hotel in Shanghai the flight
was a little delayed so I'm running out
of sunlight and I don't even know if I'm
gonna be able to upload this video
because well here in Shanghai YouTube
and Google services don't work so I want
to record an edit but you'll probably
not watch this video until I don't know
when I lost my watch at a party an hour
later I saw some guy stepping on it
while he was sexually harassing some
woman at the party infuriated I
immediately went over punched him and
broke his nose no one does that to a
woman not on my watch you know I've read
some comments and I'm like my god like
what'd I miss stop shaving your face
embrace your manhood oh yeah all right
Twitter was on fire because skai jackson
a 14 year old disney star dragged olysio
shanks hi man why you lying yeah fine
fine I don't get all the Twitter facts
that's right it's that time of the week
I am I'm every bit of this is pocket now
and this is the part out daily recap for
last week on Monday the topic was
smartphone durability there were been
test for the HTC 10 and I asked you how
important is that when you buy a
smartphone we had 719 comments if I'm
paying 800 + dollars for a phone it has
to be durable from drops and scratches
you know what i agree i feel that mainly
when it comes to premium smartphones
there should not be an excuse imagine
that you start dating megan fox you get
pretty excited and happy about that
right but every time you see touch or go
out with her she's wearing an astronaut
suit i assume yeah that's the same with
smartphones if I got your comment right
you mean you don't like to use cases and
yeah i agree but oh my god the megan fox
comment for me i really don't care about
the durability of the device is feeling
good in the hand and looking good i do
not agree with you and I left this
comment last mainly because there are a
ton of premium mid Rangers out there
that look and feel great in the hand but
are terribly built on Tuesday the topic
was the smart connector possibly
reaching the iphone we saw some leaks of
a dummy iphone and i asked you what do
you think the purpose will be we had 611
comments i think apple is getting in the
v
our game and they might use the Smart
connector maybe you know that's not a
bad idea actually some form of wireless
charging that will cost you hundred
dollars yeah yeah I know perhaps that
connector would be inspired by continuum
on Windows Phone oh if Apple hasn't
really ported the ipad to become a
computer i doubt it'll do it with a
phone on Wednesday the topic was a
possible samsung focus feature that
might reach the galaxy note 6 with the
whole concept of merging all your
notifications into one sort of like the
blackberry hub I asked you what do you
think we had 426 comments I would be
open to it being on the node 6 as long
as I can turn it off if I don't like it
yes Samson please I definitely want to
see focus feature on the note 6 the
don't line is about having beastly
performance as well as productivity I
agree and the blackberry hub was
probably one of my favorite features of
blackberries forever so I would love to
see it on the Galaxy Note Iran Android
this feature should replace the
Flipboard page yes please please then on
Thursday the topic was the iphone a
possible leak mentioning that it's gonna
be all display no buttons no bezels know
everything I asked you if you would like
to see a smartphone like that and we had
609 comments no way Apple will go from
10 inch bezels to none at all yes sick
burn matru vessels on iphones are
terrible yes I would love it its
innovative that's why I think that apple
will do it you are probably being
sarcastic there but yeah let's wait and
see and I phone with no bezels is like a
nexus with microSD won't happen I love
your comment I could not agree more and
then finally Friday as we continue to
run out of sunlight in this dim hotel
room I asked you what innovations would
you like to see Samsung bring to 2017 as
we saw the leaked roadmap we had 759
comments I want Sam sent to figure out
updates oh my god please I love this yes
software update samsung that's really
what we need right now number one
updates to battery life three way better
camera like a big jump from where they
are now my god a better camera than what
they do now obviously hey I would love
to see it but the Samsung Galaxy s7
camera is really good then it would be
battery life for me indeed such was is
simply not that bad and has some great
features the ex and Oh's battery life on
the s7 edge is insane but a week of long
bed
real life would be amazing you know I
wish that companies and their rd's would
focus on that let's bring better battery
life and they've done it we've got more
efficient processors more efficient
displays but obviously there are more
steps to be taken I could not agree more
with that as well that's it for the
