pocketnow.com just how tough is Gorilla
Glass we've got a kitchen knife a
Samsung Captivate and an orange here
this cannot end up well let's take a
look
so Corning makers of Gorilla Glass had a
big display at CES 2011 touting the
benefits of Gorilla Glass which is found
on a lot of devices out there including
the Samsung Captivate here Gorilla Glass
withstands scratches it's flexible does
a lot of cool stuff but how does it hold
up to a kitchen knife so here we've got
a really sharp kitchen knife to prove
that it's really sharp we're just going
to go up to this orange here and make a
little slit in it without too much
pressure and hopefully you can see I
made a little cut obviously if you would
do that to your finger you'd be bleeding
pretty bad right now
I'm going to clean off the knife put
away the way the orange and let's try to
scratch the screen of the captivate
we've got a pretty good camera angle
here so you'd be able to see any
scratches if they were to show up so I'm
going to do a light pressure nothing
completely clean
medium pressure you have to take my word
for that I'm giving it medium pressure
now going to do something hard no
scratches at all amazing what you see
over here looks to be from looks like a
piece of lint there pretty impressive
that this device can withstand a razor
sharp kitchen knife Gorilla Glass is
pretty darn impressive so we welcome
them to use their their glass on any
smartphone that comes out it's really
good stuff please do not try this
experiment at home because you may
damage your phone if you put too much
pressure probably eventually if I were
to stab this thing it would eventually
crack and break but to medium to hard
scratches it resists them quite well
please thumbs up this video if you liked
it and thanks for watching that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
