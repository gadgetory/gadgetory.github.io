welcome to the first PocketNow challenge
where we test real-world smartphone
usage by pitting two PocketNow editors
against each other we're starting this
series off with a bang literally for the
month of July we were feeling a bit
patriotic at pocketnow.com so Adam Lane
and I faced off in a photography
challenge to see who could capture the
best photo of celebratory fireworks now
Adam is an accomplished photographer and
he's been a primary resource in how
we've been crafting our smartphone
camera reviews he's also one of the most
senior producers on the site writing for
pocketnow.com since its inception for
all of the content creation experience
between the two of us the subtitle for
this challenge might as well have been
the best laid plans of mice and men
my intention with this farce challenge
was to travel all the way to the
Brooklyn Bridge Park really early on the
fourth of July get a good spot and set
up my tripod and you know take some
really epic photographs of the Macy's
fourth of July fireworks over there in
Manhattan found a pretty nice spot here
that looked pretty good but then I moved
south a bit more and found another spot
here and that's where I decided to wait
for four hours then with one hour to go
before the show was about to start the
rain came so Adams got a pretty crazy
advantage in doing this out in New York
we've got that New York City skyline
that he can fall back on and you know
I've taken some fireworks photos out
here in Los Angeles before and they
almost always come out looking kind of
plain you know unless you're right on
top of some iconic landmark it's just
fireworks up in the sky and I want
something a little bit more recognizable
than that on something a little bit more
identifiable and so to directa fie that
situation we're actually driving down
now we're gonna go hit the fireworks
show at Dodger Stadium which is gonna be
bonus points because it's gonna be my my
little baby daughter's first baseball
game so that's that's gonna be pretty
cool too but we wanted something that
that's iconic that's Americana
that's definitely its quintessential Los
Angeles so hopefully we can give Adam a
good run for his money but
exciting locale okay it's pouring here
so what do we know about Adam we know
that he's a Windows Phone fan so in a
photography contest that means I'm
probably gonna be facing off against a
Lumia 1020 he might surprise me maybe
throw in a 950 or a 930 or a 1520 but
now this is photos so he's probably
gonna go with the bigger image sensor
the the mighty 1020 PureView camera
system that 2/3 inch sensor so I've
really been struggling as to what I'm
going to bring to fight that I know
fireworks are high contrast lighting
situations would be like dark skies dark
baseball stadium bright lights I want to
try and capture so ultimately I mean I
really I was really struggling with this
I was looking at the LG g5 or the galaxy
s7 but the galaxy s7 is low light
capabilities image stabilization that's
not really what I need I need better
contrast in color so I altum Utley cited
on the Huawei p9 and should it really be
a really interesting fight because now
we've got Android versus Windows Phone
and we also have Zeiss versus Leica as
the companies responsible for sort of
influencing the cameras unto their
various platforms however I also went to
a fireworks show on July 3rd this one
almost that Conseco damn a much more
intimate setting my bicycle Darris
supposed to avoid traffic and of course
brought a couple Lumia 1020 s and tripod
I set everything to manual manual focus
is so 101 second charge beat rock Eng
capture works so Dodger Stadium doesn't
allow tripods I actually did read that
before we drove ourselves down there I
thought I was gonna be all clever and
hide this in our diaper bag this is a
gorilla pod which turned out to be
absolutely useless as I didn't have
really anything to attach it to we were
just a little too far away from a
railing for this to actually come in
handy even though the p9 doesn't have
optical image stabilization I
was actually able to pull off a couple
decent handheld shots where shutter
speeds up to around a second and I don't
have the steadiest hands but ultimately
the lighting at Dodger Stadium proved to
be too much they couldn't shut down all
of the lights in the field was still
pretty well lit so even shots up to a
half second shudder proved to be too
bright for me to recover information in
the raw file long exposures were out of
the question so instead of trying to
fight movement holding as steady as
possible why not embrace movement and
here it is great photo needs to catch
your attention and then bring your eyes
into the details and hopefully generate
an emotional response with this one the
explosion at the top is it very crisp
thin glowing lines that are almost
straight it looks like a floating star
at the bottom you can see details of the
people watching this show we can see the
texture and this girl's braided hair we
can even tell what kind of phone she's
using to photograph the show then
there's this woman who isn't facing the
fireworks is she taking a selfie does
she take a picture of the audience we'll
never know but it's interesting to
wonder what she's doing the p9 is
capable of stitching together some
pretty decent panorama shots so about
halfway through the fireworks display I
just started scanning the whole stadium
hoping to line up really well with a
good burst of fireworks I really wanted
to show off the location really tie into
the field of the place that we were at
and and really what's more Americana
than baseball if I could have pulled off
a selfie of me shoving out the pie in my
face with the fireworks burst going off
in the background I totally would have
so even though I didn't intend to
shooting wide helped deliver a sense of
scale where I was at how many people
were down on the field and how these
fireworks were lighting up the night sky
it maybe minimizes the actual fireworks
bursts more than I'd wanted to but
considering the limitations of the
location I'm pretty happy with how this
shot came out in terms of
post-production I didn't do much at all
this photo I did crop it a bit so that
the main firework was more centered and
I used some AC adjustment brushes to
change the exposure of the really bright
areas I also tweaked the white balance
bit in the raw file to get the color
where I wanted it to be and this moto
did require some editing a post I had to
mess around a lot with the exposure that
trust a little couple tweaks to
highlights and shadow detail but I did
try to keep the cameras graininess so
when I started the panorama shot it
pulled its exposure information from one
of the darkest sections of the shot so
the ISO is just off the charts is the
cameras cranking that as high as it can
to try and expose for the scene not
knowing that about halfway through the
shot it's gonna be a perfectly well lit
field I ultimately end up with a dirtier
image but I kind of like a little
texture in my shots it reminds me of old
cheap film stock as far as an emotional
reaction at least for me this image
reminds me of love growing up in a small
town where everyone would gather at the
local park for a local fireworks display
I remember seeing the faces of my
friends only when the glow from the
explosions shined the light on them
there's much more intimate scene and
concern how awful it was trying to see
the massive Manhattan fireworks
I liked the intimate display a lot
better it was an amazing night the
Dodgers won against the Orioles so
there's that kudos but more importantly
my wife and I we got to see our little
baby daughter's eyes just go wide as we
were sitting there in Dodger Stadium
watching a pretty great fireworks
display so there you have it folks you
get to vote on a battle of opposites one
of the more senior editors a PocketNow
against one of the more junior producers
we've got East Coast versus West Coast
Windows Phone versus Android Zeiss vs.
Leica and a very intimate portrayal of a
fireworks display against something a
bit wider bolder and a little more grand
and while we both faced our own unique
unforeseen challenges I think we both
rose to the occasion and we're able to
deliver some cool shots for you guys to
check out who takes the win in our first
PocketNow challenge you decide hit the
more info icon so you can vote in the
poll on this video we're gonna let this
run for about a week and then we're
gonna produce a wrap-up video detailing
the results so that you guys know who
you picked to be the winner of this
first showdown and did you take any
fireworks photos from your phone during
fourth of July celebrations maybe you
were out there celebrating Canada today
