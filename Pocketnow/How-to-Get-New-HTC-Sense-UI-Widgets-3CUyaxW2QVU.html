today I'm on location with a friend of
mine who has a sprint hero with the HTC
Sense UI and I'd like to show you
something with the widgets let's go look
okay so phones that are running the HTC
Sense UI like the hero here have HTC
widgets and they just released some new
ones so let's long hold on the home
screen and tap widgets and from here you
can see we can get more HTC widgets by
clicking on this little down arrow so
we'll tap that now I've already gone
ahead and done this but if you just see
the stock list of icons come down here
to menu and tap on update it will go out
to the HTC servers check and see if
there are any new updates and populate
this screen says hey there are new
updates now I've already done this on
mine said that it's already up to date
but you'll notice in here these little
news that's what I got last time so all
kinds of cool little things new tasks
new dice new coin flip so some cool
stuff the one that I want to show you
however isn't here and that is an
hourglass timer widget I believe that
only comes with froyo versions of the
sense UI but here's a neat tip if you
wanted to get some other stuff let me
show you the coin flip just so we can
say that we actually looked at something
and there it is we'll go ahead and
download that one and it says my widget
will be downloaded and sure enough it is
downloading right there we'll let that
do it okay and our download is complete
it took about a minute minute and half
to do over sprint 3g so we are now going
to go back and put that on the home
screen so we're going to go back all the
way tap and hold widget and that should
now be down here under coin flip
we can find it right there it's called
coin by HTC and there it is it's a very
basic widget it just has a point on the
screen shake your phone to flip it there
you go so this one is HTC I guess that's
tails once again and it's heads because
it's got the android so cool little
widgets I don't know if you've been
really need to have this but it's kind
of fun to have any way and it's cool to
see that HTC is continuing to update the
widgets for sense UI and you can go out
and download them relatively easily so
if you think it's cool that HTC is
updating their sense UI widgets go ahead
and give this video a thumbs up if you
haven't already subscribed to our video
channel it's not too late for a limited
time only only 1995 you can do that
click the subscribe button just kidding
guys it doesn't cost anything as free
just click the button right now and I
won't tell anyone that you almost got
duped into paying us 1999 plus shipping
and handling and four pocket now calm
i'm joe levi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
