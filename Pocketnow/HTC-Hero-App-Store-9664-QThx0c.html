pocketnow.com and this is a tour of the
application store or as they call it the
market for the HTC Hero and really for
all Android devices so let's take a look
at how it looks and how it functions so
we're gonna unlock the screen let's zoom
in a little bit so we're going right in
to market I have an icon here on the
home screen and we're taken into this
screen that will show us at the top
featured applications we can also go
into landscape although it doesn't
really make sense to have it in
landscape because you get fewer results
on the screen at one time and so right
off the bat we can choose from a variety
of featured application if we don't want
a featured application we can just drill
into the games category we can go to
applications to filter and by specific
category we can go to my downloads to
see what we've previously downloaded
from the Android Marketplace and it all
it's also showing if there are updates
available for a particular app that you
have you can also search for
applications so we're gonna go right
into just the application screen take a
look at the categories we have here
again a very endru desk menu system
which makes sense because it's on
android just you know white text on a
black background we can drill into any
of the categories let's go to
entertainment now what you're gonna find
is a lot of the apps on Android I'd say
there are more free apps and there are
pay apps in the Android Market what
you're also going to find is that the
Android App Store is less regulated that
it than it is on the iPhone you'll find
some reviews that may be considered spam
that shouldn't be there you'll find some
pieces of software in here that are just
very junky and crappy and almost sort of
advertisements for for other products
and services so not as well regulated
which is a good thing and a bad thing
Apple's iPhone store is very closed and
and mysterious in terms of what
applications they approve it seems that
on the Android Market they approved just
about everything anyway so you can sort
by popularity or date on the right we
get a view of whether it's free whether
it's installed how many stars it has and
if we want to get one of these let's say
Chris Tucker sounds I'm not sure
and you would want to get that but let's
say you do now what we have here is a
short description we have some reviews
that we can read in depth we can view
more applications we can email the
developer we can flag something as
inappropriate now to download it it's
quite simple you just tap install and it
tells you what resources of the phone it
will use which is pretty neat so it'll
tell you if it's gonna use the GPS or
the cellular data or infecting look at
call history so you really know what
you're dealing with I think this is one
way that Android helps to combat getting
crappy applications on your device you
know before you install it what the
program is going to be using on your
phone so I'm gonna hit ok and I'm gonna
get a new notification on the top of the
screen that will show me that
something's downloading you see that up
there right up there so we can slide
down the window shade and see that says
download complete and it will proceed to
install so we can come back to that
later let's take a look at some other
applications and it's not sliding up
there goes sometimes
this device is a little laggy let's go
back to let's say finance let's find an
application you actually have to pay for
so we can talk about what that's like
and it's not that easy to find
applications that you have to pay for
again so much is free on Android here so
scrolling down some more some more
okay here's something my currency
presumably a currency converter that
cost Oh point 70 pounds and I think I
have to change the regionality on this
phone to get it to display in dollars so
if I tap on it I am brought to a screen
where instead of install it says buy
it's gonna take me to another step and I
click OK it's gonna take me to another
step where it ties into my Google
Checkout account and it'll show me all
the credit cards that I have associated
with this account from here I can choose
from a list of credit cards I have I can
add a new card if I want to do that
and you can buy things right from your
device which is great now something to
note when you set up the market the
application store you have to associate
it with a free Google account now if you
do this after you go through the first
time set up
it won't work or didn't work for me and
I've heard reports that it didn't work
for other people so when you first turn
on your hero be sure you associate the
Google account immediately you'll have
that option it'll say do you want to
link this up to a Google account hit yes
and do it right from the start and you
won't run into any problems so we can go
back and take a look at some other
applications or we can even search for
applications let's search for a Twitter
application there are many for four for
Android so Twitter and there we go I've
already searched for Twitter you can see
and we see just the variety of Twitter
applications that you can get for the
Android operating system and the way
that it manages all the downloads
through the window shade is just pretty
smart it makes it very easy to manage
multiple downloads go into applications
this is a Chris Tucker sounds and
ringtones
hilarious okay anyway so one more note
after you get the application you can go
into the little UP button to find the
application and let's find it
it would be up here here it is Chris
Tucker so we can tap and hold it and
drag it to our home screen that way we
can access it quickly when we need it
and of course there are seven home
screens so you can place it on any of
those different home screens so that's
it for the Android Market for more on
Windows Mobile and mobile devices follow
us on twitter at
slash pocket now tweets that's it for
now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
