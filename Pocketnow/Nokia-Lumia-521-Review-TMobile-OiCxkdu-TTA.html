Shopping Network for only $99 you might
think it's probably gonna fall apart
after month or it's really slow and
crashy
unless it's a Nokia Windows Phone this
is Adam lien for Pocket now and this is
our review of the Nokia Lumia 521 for
t-mobile let's check it out the Lumia
521 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
dual-core processor running at one
gigahertz with 512 megs of ram and 8
gigs of internal storage that's not very
much so they have to pay attention to
what apps you installed fortunately
there is a micro SD card slot that will
allow you to add up to 64 gigs of extra
storage for music videos and photos the
512 megs of ram is also a bit limiting
as there are certain apps that you won't
be able to install these include many
high-end games as well as videos
magazine reader for some reason both
size is 4.9 by 2.85 0.4 inches and
weighs only 4.4 ounces the 4-inch WVGA
screen seems small by today's standards
but that's a good thing for one-handed
usage in fact the Lumia 521 is very well
designed when it comes to one-handed
ergonomics the thickness and shape make
the phone much more comfortable to hold
than the extra large extra thin devices
that are so popular you can actually
hold it and use the Lumia 521
comfortably and that's very refreshing
to see by the way if you get the home
shopping networks bundle for this phone
you get a ton of extra stuff with it you
get a cheap rubbery case crappy matching
headphones and even an extra car charger
it's actually quite an impressive deal
now let's look at the hardware at the
top you've got the handset speaker along
with some sensors there is no
front-facing camera but Skype will still
work you just have to point the rear
camera into a bathroom mirror then
you've got a four inch at WVGA screen
which isn't very impressive outdoor
visibility suffers a bit too but it is
still usable with gloves on at the
bottom of the usual Windows Phone
capacitive buttons for search Start
screen and back on the right side
there's a series of plastic buttons for
treating from the edge
for activating the camera power and
volume up or down buttons are easy to
find with your fingers and they've got a
great tactile feedback on the bottom
there's the microUSB port on the top is
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack I'm back
this is a five megapixel camera and
speaker all there is no flash so you
only want to use the camera outdoors
with a good amount of light now let's
talk about the software
most of our Windows Phone 8 coverage can
already be found in our full Windows
Phone 8 review that's where you'll get
the most meet about the software on the
Nokia Lumia 5.1 however we'll look at a
few highlights from both nokia and
t-mobile here I already mentioned how
the RAM limitation may cost CERN Windows
Phone 8 apps to be incompatible with the
Lumia 521 but there are also some
interesting limitations to some of the
nokia abs for example the augmented
reality view in Nokia's here maps app is
not available north city lens and the
augmented reality feature in the
included Weather Channel app does not
work the phone does include no keys here
drive free GPS navigation program though
the bad news is that the license only
includes maps for the USA Puerto Rico
and the US Virgin Islands you also pay
extra for other countries but still the
United States is pretty big you need to
have a t-mobile u.s. SIM card in the
phone in order for a here drive to work
but it does not require an active rate
plan to function another feature that's
probably worth the cost of the phone
itself is the Nokia Music app you can
download up to four custom radio mixes
for listening to offline then we get
tired of those you can delete them and
download for more it's unlimited offline
music the catch is you can't rewind any
songs you have to listen to the whole
playlist though you can't skip about 6
per hour still that's free music with no
data plan
the only t-mobile customization that's
really worth mentioning is the Wi-Fi
calling feature it's a little unreliable
though so I would only turn this on when
absolutely necessary next let's look at
the camera we've already mentioned the 5
megapixel camera with no flash and you
would probably expect it to be pretty
horrible actually I've always found
those little LED flashes often
included on phones to be pretty horrible
themselves not having a flash on this
film forces you to only take pictures in
decent lighting conditions and if you
pay more attention to existing light you
can actually get some great pictures
with this camera
most of Nokia's special camera apps are
included as well we've got smart cam
panorama cinema graph and the creative
studio for post-processing this isn't
anything like the high-end Lumia 1020
that's seven times the price and ten
times the resolution though in terms of
battery life the Lumia 521 does quite
well with average juice it's certainly
enough for a day and the device doesn't
have any terribly power-hungry features
like a high resolution screen or image
stabilization the key thing here is that
the Lumia 521 has a removable BL 5j
battery which is pretty common in older
Nokia phones you can get another one for
about $4 and swap it whenever you want
our final rating is going to be a 7 out
of 10 while there are a lot of
limitations and areas that are lacking
with the Lumia 521 the big draw for it
is its pricing given the crazy low price
there's a huge amount of value included
with the phone and it's still fast
stable and easy to use in some ways it's
actually better than some high-end
phones be sure to give this video a
thumbs up and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
