androidwear party with a pair of
deceptively dissimilar smartwatches at
first glance they look much the same but
a deeper look reveals a wide gulf
between them in fashion fastening and
fit and finish
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our Android wear comparison LG G
watch vs. Samsung gear live strap both
of these on the same wrist and you'll
get more than funny looks on the street
you'll get an up-close glimpse at how
different the hardware here really is
each one is rated to ip67 for dust and
water resistance but they're the
physical similarity ends the G watch is
little more than a squared off flat
plastic slab a little heavier than it
looks but otherwise almost totally
unremarkable right down to its
conventional rubber wristband the gear
live is just slightly lighter but it
feels more substantial thanks to its
cosmetic concessions from the swooping
curve of that metal bezel to the
understated logo on the pin type
fastening clasp by the way if you don't
like either of these bands you can
change them both watches use a standard
22 millimeter mounting the live also has
a heart rate sensor like its fitness
oriented gear cousins and a side mounted
button to manually toggle the screen and
when you do power those screens on the
gear live blows its competitor out of
the water
they're both one point six inch square
panels but the IPS display and the G
watch is lower in both resolution and
color saturation than the Super AMOLED
screen on the Samsung device daylight
performance slightly favors the G watch
though neither is exactly easy to read
and direct sunlight and the G watch can
also go slightly dimmer on command
but these advantages are narrow at best
in every way that matters the gear alive
has the superior display now if these
were smartphones we'd kick off the
software section talking about skins but
because these are Android wear products
the software is thankfully almost
identical it's the same vertical and
horizontal strip of cards on each device
with Google now intelligently displaying
notifications only when appropriate and
relevant
at least in theory third party apps run
well on the 4 gigs of storage and 512
Meg's of RAM on each watch and the
gestures baked into Android wear work
about as well on each - there are quirks
and inconsistencies of course but the
only performance difference that we
noticed was a tendency for the Samsung
watch to hiccup between cards slightly
more often and for longer periods of
time otherwise each seems to understand
speech equally well the touch response
is uniformly excellent and the gyro
triggered screen on gesture is just as
inconsistent on each there doesn't seem
to be a big difference in Bluetooth
reception with both watches pretty
sluggish to reconnect after a signal
loss the biggest spec difference outside
of the display is in power packs the
gear lives battery is just 75% the size
of the G watches so we're expecting
endurance to suffer on the Samsung
product relative to LG's we'll have more
on that in our full reviews coming later
on a bigger issue comes in the accessory
Department the G watch comes with a
sturdy magnetic cradle for charging
while the gear live sticks with a
snap-on attachment that might be more
fragile we're seeing reports that the
gear lives charger breaks pretty easily
which might help to explain part of how
Samsung was able to get its watch's
price down to 30 dollars cheaper than
LG's winners and losers aren't really
the point of PocketNow comparisons but
well it's tough to see how the gear live
isn't the runaway winner of this one
with the Samsung watch you get a more
stylish and high-end design a heart rate
monitor and a manual button that
triggers a much more beautiful display
yes the gear live has a significantly
smaller battery but all indications so
far are that you'll want to charge your
Android wear wristwatch every night
anyway regardless of which one you
choose so for us it's the Samsung
product we're more likely to recommend
for now but before you pull the trigger
stick around for pocket now's full
review of each device and the Android
wear platform as a whole coming shortly

media where we talk text and tweet until
next time this has been michael fisher
with PocketNow
thanks for watching and we'll be on your
wrist again very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
