best budget-minded smartphones currently
available the Moto G was the original
Minh Ranger to beat and there's a new
version in town to reclaim its throne
I'm high out to Houston with pocket now
and this is Motorola's 2015 moto G
versus the assist zenfone 2 powerful
specs great performance and a low price
tag or the name of the game here and
both phones offer tremendous value in
these regards each phone starts at less
than $200 but we've been testing the
upgraded models with better specs and
more internal storage our Moto G goes
for to 1999 here in the States and ships
with two gigabytes of RAM 16 gigabytes
of internal storage expandable via
microSD and a 1.4 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 410 SOC the zenfone 2 on the
other hand will set you back a little
more at 299 u.s. dollars but with those
three Benjamins you're getting at
whopping 4 gigabytes of RAM and
expandable 64 gigabytes of storage and a
2.3 gigahertz quad-core z3580 chipset
from Intel you get a 5 inch and a 5.5
inch display respectively and the
hardware difference continues here the
Moto G's 720p display looks fine but the
zenfone is bumped at 1080p is pretty
noticeable if you set the phone
side-by-side then again neither display
looks all that great viewing angles are
poor on both and colors almost always
look a little washed out a sacrifice
made in the name of keeping things cheap
another sacrifice is in build quality
where both phones suffer from ever so
creaky plastic builds that may annoy
aluminum champions but here's the thing
both thoughts feature removable backings
that doesn't mean you can replace your
battery in either phone but you can
customize the looks of each phone
through new covers the zenfone 2 comes
in a few different color options but
this is where the Moto G really shines
in past generations moto G users could
switch out the back cover to bring new
color to their phones but with the
inclusion of moto maker this year it's
now more customizable than ever you can
choose from 10 different colors for the
backplate change the front of the device
to black or white and even customize the
metal stripe going down the back of the
phone
no matter what color configuration you
order though both files still have quite
a few differences in physical design and
feel in hand the zenfone 2 feels much
bigger than the Moto G thanks to its
larger footprint and additional mass 170
grams which is 155 both phones have
round it backs and the Moto G is
actually a bit thicker than the zenfone
2 which is already a thicker phone
meaning that they're both gonna feel
pretty hefty but the Moto G is a much
more comfortable size to hold and the
sight mounted Hardware control is making
a more convenient one-handed device the
Zen phones rear mounted volume keys are
nice but putting the power button on top
of an already unwieldy phone makes it a
frustrating one-handed experience also
frustrating is the Zen phones rear
firing speaker which puts out horribly
soft and tinny audio compared to the
Moto G's single front speaker that
doesn't mean Motorola's blowing us away
in the speaker department either its
output is nothing remarkable but it does
get fairly loud and the audio doesn't
sound half bad the software on each
phone reminds us the hardware specs
aren't everything the zenfone 2 runs
circles around the Moto G on paper the
Motorola sneer stock build of Android
5.1.1 feels a lot more polished in daily
use as Souza's offering is stuck on a
skinned version of Android 5.0 and
though it has its charms like extensive
software theming and double tap to wake
neither of which are available in the
Moto G there's a massive list of
bloatware that comes pre-installed on
the zenfone and we're not really sure
about its oozes update schedule motorola
is usually one of the first to push new
versions of android to its phones as
they come
giving it almost Nexus like experience
you're also getting excellent features
like moto display on the Moto G which
shows notifications at a glance whenever
the phone is lifted from a table or
pulled out of a pocket some gestures
offer quick shortcuts as well a double
flick of the wrist will launch the Moto
G's camera and a double chop will deploy
the flashlight these sounds silly at
first and they look hollow more
ridiculous but man are they handy when
you need either feature in a pinch
speaking of cameras both phones are
capable of putting out some pretty great
shots given the right circumstances the
Moto G carries over the same camera
sensor for Motorola's and
six and in daylight you can get some
excellent shots especially if you enable
HDR mode which makes a surprisingly big
difference in dynamic range compared to
most other phones the camera takes a
turn for the worse in low-light which is
to be expected for a phone around this
price but it's really bad the Moto G
struggles to focus on anything in dark
areas and even if you manage to take a
halfway decent photo it'll be drown in
digital noise on the other hand the
zenfone 2 actually does very well in low
light with a long exposure mode that
pulls in as much light as possible and
really works just so long as you hold
your hand in the subject still in
brighter conditions is also an excellent
camera with nice vivid colors and sharp
detail you can even use the super
resolution mode to gather more
information into a 50 megapixel photo
though thanks to the long processing
time between shots you're probably not
gonna want to use this mode very often
in everyday use both felt it's far
exceed what you might expect given their
price tags but the zenfone 2 definitely
has an edge in performance thanks to its
4 gigabytes of RAM doubling what
Motorola offers in the Moto G you can
run more apps in the background at once
and switching between even demanding
games gives the zenfone no trouble those
games have a tendency to run down
battery life pretty quickly though and
while both phones have more than enough
battery endurance to last most users
through a full day the Moto G has
outstanding standby time and can even
make it through 2 days of moderate usage
on a single charge
then again the zenfone is the only one
of the two with quick charging
capabilities which is a pretty big deal
at any price range it's also the only
one with NFC meaning no mobile payments
or quick bluetooth pairing on the Moto G
one great advantage of the Moto G though
is as ipx7 water resistance rated for up
to 30 minutes in a meter of water which
features are more important to you could
be the deciding factor in getting one
phone over the other so consider this
before committing your wallet
subjective as these comparisons can be I
think the Moto G is the best option for
most people considering either one of
these two smartphones the lack of quick
charging and NFC and 2015 is a huge
letdown
but the combination of Motorola's
tendency for quick software updates
extensive customization options and a
clean version of android 5.1 with added
features that actually improve the user
interface make for an attractive
smartphone that won't break the bank the
power user who values Ross specs above
all else may still want to stick with
the zenfone 2 but it's clear why the
Moto G has been Motorola's best selling
smartphone ever for more on each phone
