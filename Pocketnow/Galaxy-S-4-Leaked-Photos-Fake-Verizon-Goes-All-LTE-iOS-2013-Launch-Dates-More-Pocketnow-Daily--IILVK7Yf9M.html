apparently fake verizon is considering
dropping their cdma network over full
LTE and the next batch of iOS device
launches get rumoured I'm hi meri beta
and this like about the seventh time i
filmed is over barking chihuahuas this
is parking out daily ah the
controversies yesterday after pocket now
daily went live we discovered some
leaked renders of the galaxy s4 from a
very trusted source even though they
looked like a galaxy phone well well
sadly apparently these photos are fake
expansys um you know that cell phone
store out there they claim that these
photos are actually something that they
built for their stores you know some
renders for their markups and apparently
these photos are not real not the real
thing same thing is doing a fabulous job
at keeping this device a secret and
there are a ton of teasers out there
they're pointing to the next galaxy
phone so march 14th everyone there's a
lot to talk about and let's talk a
little more about design I'll admit that
I'm a big fan of these flip covers from
Samson for their galaxy s and galaxy
note devices because they do a good job
that subtly covering the display and
protecting it but the interesting news
is that LG has just brought the same
design for their optimus g pro aside
from the fact that the device is a
complete mock-up of the galaxy note 2
but the point being is that they figured
out a way to fit magnets on this thing
in order for the display to turn on and
off something that's Samsung for some
reason didn't figure out it didn't copy
from Apple from their iPad design but
anyways these uh covers are now
available for when the optimus g pro is
out there so stay tuned now let's talk
about verizon we do know that the
company has done everything they can to
push their cdma network as far as they
can because the united states is pretty
much one of the only countries left with
the cdma network available mostly used
by verizon but their CFO just came on
record to state that the plans of the
company in a short probably not short
term a bit term is to actually get rid
of their cdma network and go LTE only
meaning voice over LTE and also LTE for
data as we currently have it's awesome
news because if you didn't know well the
spectrum for verizon for LT is actually
by law required to be only used by
devices so every single verizon phone
that's been locked for the past six
months with LT enable capabilities is
also an unlocked GSM phone which is
awesome so stay tuned now let's talk
about Apple there's a ton of speculation
on the web as to when their next I works
products are going to be launched and
we've got new speculation that the iPads
meaning the iPad 5 and iPad Mini 2 will
be launched in April or springtime and
not in the fall as they've been doing
recently or they did with their iPads
recently for some reason because in the
past they did everything in spring and
now apparently they're switching to a 6
month cycle just like they do with the
max and not a yearly cycle like they do
with the iphone and speaking of the
iphone apparently we will be getting it
in june and not necessarily in the fall
asleep i phone 4s and iphone 5 but these
leaks also mention the device could
probably be launched in August which
doesn't make any sense so again stay
tuned we know that Apple is doing
everything they can to remain relevant
at times but their stock is really down
and finally for the interesting news of
the day nokia has just launched a new
application called hashtag to instil
with love with the purpose of making
your voice be heard maybe a couple of
polaroid filters and the ideas that you
take photos and then you post them on
your social network with the hashtag to
insta would love with the idea of luring
instagram into bringing their
application and service to Windows Phone
which is kind of interesting because we
know that Instagram is owned by Facebook
and there is no such thing as a Windows
Phone facebook application made by
Facebook it's actually made by microsoft
so we see it kind of hard for Instagram
to do that differently but anyways now
you do the question of the day do you
believe or do you need Instagram on
Windows Phone some of us believe that
probably Nokia is trying to tease us
that they're probably bringing a port or
a filter or a service or a lens for
windows phone that will bring you the
Instagram capabilities but it's really
hard I mean it's not really just about
the lenses but about the social network
that's behind Instagram so in my
particular case and I know that in
Michael Fisher's case he wants Instagram
so yes we do want it but leave us a
comment down below is it really
important to you as always if you wanted
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone it's a
parole make sure you follow us on
pocketnow.com and subscribe to our
youtube channel as well please give this
video a thumbs up if you like what you
saw I'm kind
thanks for watching see you tomorrow ah
the HTC droid DNA probably one of the
most beautiful smartphone designs of the
year this 1080p display device made a
lot of headlines when it was launched in
japan as the j butterfly now that it's
made it to the united states on the
verizon network is it still worth you're
buying dollar sadly not everything is
perfect or was perfect in our review so
join us on thursday march seven for the
HTC droid DNA after the buzz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
