ultra high-end market but that doesn't
mean they aren't building premium
products I'm Juan Carlos bag nail for
pocket now and here's our full review of
the Xperia X now Sony's mission with the
X is to trim the fat stepping back from
marketing bullet point specs and
focusing on the stuff that matters right
off the bat we need to send a shout-out
to the folks at cloak code UK for
helping us out with a loaner after our
first review unit arrived DOA
much appreciated as North American
experience will ship until the end of
this month so what we get is a phone
which represents an interesting set of
compromises the flagship phones for
example have largely moved to quad HD
displays but daily phone use is pretty
well accomplished at 1080p which is
where we find the accent it's 5 inch IPS
LCD it's a bright and colourful screen
which just loses out to AMOLED when
looking at outdoor readability our
review unit came with three gigabytes of
RAM in 32 gigabytes of storage stereo
speakers flanked the display there's a
13 megapixel camera up front and 23
megapixels on the back this is all
powered by a Qualcomm 650 chipset any
2620 milliamp hour battery moving to the
aesthetics design language is tricky
territory many will feel that Sony
should be making more aggressive style
changes but we can't fault the
engineering here clean simple lines
high-quality materials it's terrific
execution of the Xperia look the X
doesn't break any new ground but a satin
finished metal back and minimal badging
add up to an attractive handset in
reviewing last year's Xperia z5 we ran
into issues using the power button
mounted fingerprint sensor but we're
happy to report that this hardware is
better refined on the X the thin
vertical surface can still occasionally
miss but we're much happier with how
this phone unlocks and we're also happy
to see how conservative Sony is with
software alterations common elements
like the notification tray and the
settings menu are pretty much stock the
app drawer is tweaked but so long as we
can revert to an alphabetized layout
we're cool
we get a branded PlayStation app though
I don't have a ps4 to pair with it and
alongside that we do have some
value-added software pre-installed
apps can be disabled but I prefer being
able to just completely uninstall apps
like AVG moving to performance there
were some concerns about Sony using a
mid-range or chipset but the Qualcomm
650 performs slightly better than last
year's Qualcomm 808 it's plenty powerful
to get you through most situations
overall it's a snappy phone and handles
most games well Marvel future fight
still has issues with Qualcomm chip sets
but implosion runs like buttah now
taking a look at the photography
experience we would expect the Sony
camera to include a killer sensor and
top-tier optics this definitely holds
true for the X the sensor lens
combination is very good we see some odd
choices though in software and image
processing first of all talking about
this camera requires a little nuance by
default the shooter produces eight
megapixel stills Sony is intentionally
squishing image size down to reduce
noise and produce a higher quality final
image so is this a 23 megapixel camera
or an 8 megapixel camera well you can
shoot at the full res of the sensor but
output generally does look better at the
reduced resolution but then we get into
a whole host of other issues the object
tracking system is extremely twitchy the
color processing is very aggressive in
terms of exposure and saturation and
we're stuck with a ton of individual
modes to help you but really we could
just use a better manual mode that
includes more settings than white
balance and exposure compensation the
outlook doesn't get much better
switching to video we don't have the
benefit of Hardware image stabilization
and Sony software smoothing produces a
buzzy output especially a faster frame
rates we've seen phones with less
powerful Hardware shoot UHD video but
here we're capped at 1080p and we can
confirm thermal throttling you'll only
be able to shoot about nine minutes of
video in one stretch before the phone
will shut you down ultimately this is
still a good camera though we feel like
it's fighting us most of the time we're
using it and the overall experience
stacks up poorly when compared to
similarly priced phones audio
reproduction is also an exercise in more
frustrating compromises will always be
fans of front firing stereo speakers
these aren't the loudest but they are
detailed and certainly benefit from
pointing in the right direction namely
at your face
you
headphone audio however just doesn't
live up to Sony's legacy looking at the
analysis the numbers are nearly
identical to another mid-pack performer
like the galaxy s7 this leads us to
believe that Sony is using whatever
stock DAC comes with the qualcomm
chipset paired with a pretty average amp
the X is fine but it's far from
class-leading and we really shouldn't be
surprised when a smaller battery
performs worse than phones with larger
batteries to be sure this phone easily
made it to dinner time during average
use days but I didn't have much room
left to spare now looking at a movie
test streaming 30 minutes of HD video
over Wi-Fi at 50 percent brightness the
Xperia acts drained 10 percent of its
battery making this one of the poorer
performers we've run through this test
for our usage this was a phone that
handled short Sprint's really well
though this might not be the device for
folks looking to maximize their screen
on time during the day we also couldn't
quite get a handle on quick charging our
review unit came with a European charger
but connecting two different fast
chargers the best we could manage was a
27% recharge over 30 minutes we imagine
a Sony charger will likely juice this
phone up a bit quicker so let's wrap
this up where's that leave us with the
xperia x I really did like using this
phone more than I thought I would it's a
well-built snappy handset in a vacuum
this would be a killer offering we do
run into one small issue though this
thing is priced just outside the top
tier of smartphones a little savvy
shopping lands an unlocked galaxy s7
within spitting distance of the xperia x
price we hear pride ourselves on trying
to figure out who a phone might be for
instead of just playing the worth it for
the money game but at five hundred and
fifty dollars this phone is a tough fit
there's definitely a demographic of
people who will like this device but
we're not exactly sure who those people
are and we can't believe it's a very
large audience we really want to
celebrate Sony's experiment here walking
away from impressive specs which don't
actually add much to the daily
smartphone experience but price plays a
critical role in this market and it
seems unlikely that the Xperia X will
turn Sony smartphone sales slump or
around as always thanks so much for

hit that thumbs up button for a little
extra positive reinforcement for pocket
now I'm Juan Carlos bag now some gadget
guy on Twitter and Instagram and I will
catch you all on the next review
