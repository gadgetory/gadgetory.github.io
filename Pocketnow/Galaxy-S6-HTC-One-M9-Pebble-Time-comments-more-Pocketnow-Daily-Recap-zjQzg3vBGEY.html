next you want me to keep my mouth shut
as well he loves saying Barcelona and
yes of course I do Barcelona I'm
supposed to do my homework right now and
dude I feel honored thanks a lot that's
right it's that time of the week I am hi
Natalie that this is pocket now and this
is the bucket no daily recap from last
month brought to you by Squarespace at
its new seven-point oh you I so on
monday I asked you if the galaxy s6 edge
was the only variant would that be the
phone you would buy next as back then
remember this was pre mwc and the rumors
were that we were only getting one phone
we have 152 comments out of which the
gizmo 302 says depends on the TouchWiz
upgrade it better be damn good to
compensate for the worst launches of the
previous two variants and TouchWiz looks
the same apparently it is better but
wait for our full review then Jesus says
so if Samsung stays the same people
complain about it being boring then if
they fix it up with the edge don't get
me wrong I don't like it then people
call it s and unnecessary and useless
gosh the Internet is a horrible place
and dude we agree welcome to the world
and I'm gadgets stop 321 says I'm going
to be disappointed if the s6 is only
available in the edge model my husband
has a note edge and loves it but I'm
just the kind of man so why would i pay
hundreds of dollars more you've got a
good point you shouldn't be forced to
get the edge and you won't you will be
getting the option but funny i have a
galaxy note edge i love the phone right
now and i'm thinking of getting the
galaxy s6 edge as well on Tuesday we had
two videos a top 5 predictions from WC
as well as the park now daily let's
begin with the questions of the top five
what were your expectations for the
event and we have 540 comments out of
which one of them says something tells
me that the galaxy s6 is going to be a
huge failure in the typical Samson style
well the typical Samsung style is not to
fail dude of the galaxy s5 was not
necessarily a flop wasn't great but it
wasn't really a flop so we'll see
another commoner says enough about Sam's
an HTC for one
and the spotlight over to LG the LG
g4 launches at mwc 2015 that will be my
primary focus LG is awesome too and dude
you've got amazing point here sadly no
the g-force not out yet but I do want
the G flex 2 and I didn't think was
gonna happen at mwc primarily because of
the G flex 2 at CES but yeah I am
looking out for the g4 even though that
depends if i get the G flex 2 that ultra
SD GV says 1am 9 and since seven don't
care about Sam sing at all and yes the
one of nine has been a great phone we're
still waiting for it to launch as of the
time of this video but we did like it at
mwc for the most part there are things
that wait for our full review by the way
and now let's continue with Tuesday and
the pocket nail daily I asked you what
did you think about the new pebble time
as a pebble I just announced that we
have 132 comments out of which Eric lang
says I've heard a lot of people say it
looks ugly I agree but to be honest with
you I just don't see it it's a
good-looking watch but i would
definitely wait for the steel version
and yes thankfully there is a steel
bearing that was announced eventually
before the time of this video i still
consider it ugly but these is one of
those things that I'd rather try before
I judge the little marquee says I think
it looks so one cheap hopefully it is
affordable it's not too simple colorful
great I can take it to school and work
without getting stolen three boring you
I my toddler relatives won't think it's
a toy toddler relatives that's an
interesting comment there but I don't
know if it looks cheap again this is one
of those things that I would rather try
first before I judge I am a big fan of
the original pebble and so am i a fan of
the pebble steel I do like the new you
whine the implementation I just feel
that the watch does not look at all
appealing to me but again i'll let you
know more once i get the hang of it then
the fat voice layer and man i love that
user name says i feel like i am one of
the very few people who likes the pebble
time i am ready to replace my
Kickstarter edition pebble original with
this kickstarter edition pebble time and
no you are not the only one that likes
it this is probably one of the hugest
backings and Kickstarter his
3 the pebble time it is crazy they were
raising hundred thousand bucks I think
and they made ten million dollars that
many people like it uh but I'm not on
the list and finally for wednesday since
that we had to leave her bus hello to
the next day let's talk about our pocket
out daily show that day i asked you what
do you think about the leaked photos of
the galaxy s6 since we had the first
leaks we have 1096 comments thanks a lot
guys and which hush hype says the leaks
look like a sample AKA Samsung Apple yes
it did and it does but Mickey says cough
cough looks like Sam's and copied Apple
again by making their s6 look a lot like
the iphone again cough yes and no I
don't agree that it looks like an iphone
6 and it doesn't look like an iPhone for
us either it looks like a galaxy alpha
in a good way I like the glass back even
though I'll hate the fingerprints but I
don't really agree that it looks like an
iphone 6 but then again that's because I
consider the iphone 6 to the ugly by the
way and then T Anthony 78 says I came
just to see people seriously get mad and
hockey over cell phone design mission
accomplished and dude I have to agree
with you some people love the galaxy s5
I didn't some people love the galaxy s6
I do you know it's just an ambiguous
topic it depends on your appeal the
things you like and yes the comments get
crazy over which design is better or
worse when really there is no such thing
as better or worse design or better wish
materials people consider aluminium to
be better than that it's not as
resilient as plastic and so many other
things so again love to hear from you in
the comments and i love this debate it
makes things interesting it's great to
know your opinions so really that's the
cool thing about the comments and are
you getting the galaxy s6 leave us a
