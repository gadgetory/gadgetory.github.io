our last video we unbox the motorola
droid razr the thinnest smartphone to
date well let's go ahead and take a look
at the hardware that you can expect to
see on that phone let's go take a look
alright in our last video we unbox the
motorola droid razr in this video let's
take a look at the hardware now first of
all this phone is very very light in a
longer phone so it fits pretty well in
my hands but they're a little bit larger
on the back you can see here we've got
this really kind of cool Kevlar backing
it's not the metal backing that we're
used to which should add strength and
durability as far as weight though the
Kevlar is very lightweight it gives the
phone of a very light appearance but
we're really shines is in its thickness
see you here next to the motorola droid
bionic which is a about the same phone
you can just see the difference in in
thickness it's a little bit longer the
razor a little bit wider but the
thickness it's about half the thickness
of the bionic so very impressive up here
at the top we've got the motorola logo
which is black on silver most of the
time that's silver lettering on a black
background this they decided to call it
out a little bit more we've got the logo
on the back of the phone as well along
with a little bit of some horizon
information in 4G LTE stuff moving back
around to the front of the phone you can
see we've got a protective film here now
this isn't just a protective film it's
also an instructional film tells you
what you've got highlights in this case
the front-facing camera right here up
front you've also got a rear facing
camera on the back that's eight
megapixels it defaults to 6 megapixel
widescreen but you can change that has
an LED flash as well so very very nice
and then of course your rear facing
speaker right here you can get your
speakerphone and your audio out coming
out there from the large speakers up
here at the top of the phone you'll
notice
your standard input for a microphone and
headset you've also got micro USB and
HDMI so you can output to your TV over
on the side we've got a silver power
button this looks reminiscent of the
iphones on-off switch but it is just a
push button you also have volume up and
down which does double duty as zoom in
zoom out kind of hard to see that button
so if we can get a different angle for
you feels very good right under your
index finger it's easy to actuate and
has a nice tactile feedback over here on
the back of the phone again you can see
that the ridge the bump if you will
that's what your rest your finger on to
be able to hold it the bottom of the
phone is completely empty there is a
microphone jack near the bottom and then
of course on the side you've got your
your micro SD and micro sim port on the
bottom of the phone you've got your for
capacitive buttons that are very
responsive i might add you will also
have your little indicator that shows
you where all of your hardware it goes
and we'll take a little bit of a closer
look at that so opening this door it
pulls out and fold down and gives you
access to the micro SD card and the
micro sim know it is a sim phone because
its 4G LTE on the phone itself for voice
and 3G data is a cdma phone on the
verizon network getting the micro sim
out is not that easy we'll do a little
bit of manipulation off-camera here to
try and get it out it is spring loaded
but it doesn't pop out as easily as
you'd like so just go ahead and pull it
out with your fingernails once removed
it's a sandisk class for 16 gigabyte
micro sdhc card the class for speed is a
little bit faster than some of the
others that we've seen which are class 2
or unrated you need that extra speed or
recording HD video to the card and it's
plenty big enough to record most of what
you need as far as the sim goes this is
a micro sim it's not the traditional
large sim it comes on a
hard you may have this pre-installed for
you at the verizon store get separately
like we did with our review unit there
is a nice little diagram here on the
front of this protective film that shows
you how to insert the card it wasn't
quite descriptive enough as you can see
and putting that card in with a little
bit difficult because it's hard to tell
which side which direction it goes in
now of course if you look at the
instructions and pay attention you'll
see that the gold dots go up and once
you have made that realization and
correction putting the card in and very
easy this is spring loaded as well you
need to push it in and the last little
bit if you push with your thumbnails or
a paper clip I can help you get the rest
of the late in relatively easy once it's
in and done close up the door it's
resealed and that you are ready to go
and boot up your phone for the first
time which of course is what we're going
to show you in our next video we're not
going to need this protective film so
let's get that off and get ready for our
first boot alright so that was a quick
look at the hardware that is the droid
razr specifically what's on the outside
now as we get further into the video
series will start looking into the
hardware on the inside and we'll take a
closer look at that HD video camera 8
megapixels is very nice and 1080p video
that's insane so make sure you subscribe
to the video channel if you haven't done
so already so you don't miss out on any
of those videos that are up and coming
if you like seeing new hardware make
sure you give the video a big thumbs up
so that we know you like these and we'll
make more of them for you up next we're
going to have the software first boot
you don't want to miss that 4-pocket
