companies to be in the mobile market one
big development in 2018 finally brought
a beloved smartphone to a major US
carrier but how does one plus his latest
offering stand up to Samsung's this is
PocketNow and I'm Joshua Vergara what's
going on everybody let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy S 10 plus up against the
oneplus 60 you might have noticed in
this video that I finally got my D brand
skin on here and if you want to check
them out for yourself they have skins
for the samsung galaxy s 10 line all
together in the links down below but
there is a new pattern which is the one
I have on my phone and it is called
swarm again you can head to the brand's
website via the links down below to see
them for yourself big screens are the
name of the game between these two
making the footprints pretty similar
right off the bat I'll say that
one-handed usage will take a bit of a
hit if you want to keep the hand
gymnastics at a minimum but that said
both phones are good lookers indicative
of their company's design languages now
you might notice that I'm using the
McLaren version of the oneplus 60 so
this is kind of a limited edition firm
but there are a few other variants
available including two black ones the
mirror black is the version that you
would get if you're on t-mobile and then
of course is that really cool looking in
different thunder purple oneplus opted
for a teardrop notch on their display
which is thankfully pretty minimal and
as far as our hardware is concerned the
60 brings the alert slider for easy
changing of the ring mode but there is
no longer a headphone jack which is a
feature that has become a bit of a
commodity for some users and it will be
a big plus in the Samsung column you've
probably heard it a bunch by now but
it's definitely true that Samsung wanted
to put as many features as possible in
the Galaxy S 10 plus the only thing
really missing here is an S Pen this one
has a headphone jack dual speakers that
triple camera system on the rear a dual
camera on the front and it even has
reverse wireless charging it's also the
company's first foray into the notch
alternative called the hole in display
or in this case the Infinity o display
and it actually turned out to be a
pretty fun new way of personalizing the
device between the two phones though the
little cutouts don't really get in the
way of what is otherwise a couple of
very good viewing experiences and the
other side of the experience coin is due
to the internal hardware the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 plus rocks the latest
Snapdragon 855 and thus will have an
edge over p1 plus 60 which has the 845
but you know what daily usage and
everything including gaming has been
high-end both companies have put their
best gaming feed forward by including
some tools
but it is only the galaxy s 10 plus that
includes a cooling system a vapor
cooling chamber you won't really want
for any extra RAM or storage between
these two because the base model of the
oneplus 60 gives six gigabytes of RAM
and 128 gigabytes of on-board storage
while the galaxy has 10 plus gives 8
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
storage
Samsung even allows for further
expansion via microSD cards but as far
as biometrics go both phones actually
have in display fingerprint readers
which is a great feature to have in the
oneplus 60 was one of the first phones
to bring it to us Shores now both of
them do perform well Samsung did go for
the ultrasonic fingerprint reader but I
haven't really noticed one really pull
ahead of the other in terms of getting
you into the interface quickly past the
lock screen on the topic of battery life
the Samsung Galaxy S 10 has definitely
been a joy to use I've been able to get
between 7 &amp;amp; 9 hours of screen on time
pretty consistently but there are a ton
of options for actually getting more
battery life out of the phone by
limiting things like the CPU or bringing
down the screen resolution you can kind
of expect this level of battery life
from a 40 100 million power battery but
the one plus 60 is no slouch with 3700
milliamp hours and has been able to get
through full days of work with no issues
but the ace-in-the-hole has of course
been warped charging for oneplus and in
the McLaren Edition you get that 30 watt
charger which against half of the
battery in about 20 minutes that's
really no time at all it's easy to top
this thing up if you have a little bit
of time to just plug it into its
proprietary charger okay so we're gonna
get into the cameras a little bit
earlier than usual in this comparison it
probably comes as no surprise to any of
you that the Samsung competitor packs
more into its camera package including a
third wide-angle lens on the rear
shooter and a depth sensor for the front
now that wide angle lens is a great
addition for getting more in the frame
in both pictures and footage between the
galaxy s 10 plus and the oneplus 60
pictures the results aren't actually
skewed too far in any one direction
obviously the 60 is a bit lacking in the
different types of photos that you can
get despite having a secondary 20
megapixel sensor that backs up the 16
megapixel main 4 bouquet effects and
digital zoom the one thing that Samsung
still hasn't put into their flagship
devices that oneplus and honestly other
manufacturers have been doubling down on
is a night mode as far as selfie
shooting is concerned there are portrait
modes and either device
and the beauty modes for potentially
taking the airbrushing a bit too far but
I have to give Samsung a bit of the rub
here because its front facing shooter
has 4k video recording which is a great
sell to people who do vlogging in a lot
of Instagram storms I wanted to go ahead
and end this one on user interfaces
because I'm sure a lot of you are going
to have many opinions about these two
operating systems here these are two
different versions of Android but one of
them is decidedly more minimalistic than
the other let's start off with Samsung's
though Samsung one you I really tries to
put in so many of the features you might
already expect in Samsung phones into a
more palatable skin you could still get
overwhelmed by many of the features but
as is the case with Samsung devices you
might get more than you need but at
least you have everything you need and
some of the features have actually
become new daily habits for example the
edge UI is easy to access for shortcuts
and the smart select panel where things
like gift creation are available the
Samsung version of full screen gestures
are also easier to get used to than the
ones on the oneplus 60 because it's
basically mimicking the original
three-button navbar anyway and all of
that is on top of the many customization
options found in this version of Android
you can really make this phone your own
now that isn't to say that oneplus is
very far behind in that department but
clearly oxygen OS is made with
simplicity and minimalism in mind oxygen
OS users have really fallen in love with
this stylish but simpler take on Android
and oneplus deserves credit for their
attention to detail you won't get the
crazy amount of additions that Samsung
is prone to have in their flagships
instead you get key features like
monochromatic reading modes a
system-wide dark mode that lets you
customize the accent color quick
shortcuts via the fingerprint reader and
the shell forgetting widgets out of your
other home screens all of this comes in
a clean style that even comes with one
plusses own proprietary font some people
go as far to say that this is the best
version of Android out there
it keeps the stock Android enthusiasts
satisfied while deviating just enough to
ensure that oxygen OS remains fresh it's
super exciting to see what oneplus might
have in store especially after Samsung
set the bar what the Galaxy S 10 plus
but of course there are going to be
diehards in either camp so I want to
know which camp you are in and let us
know why in the comments sections down
below as well let's go ahead and have
that discussion but for now I'm gonna go
ahead and call it on this one thank you
so much for watching don't forget to
subscribe to pocket now if you haven't
already
and hit that Bell over on the side if
you want to see even more content about
the Galaxy S ten plus you can also head
over to my channel where I already have
a few videos up so you can get some
extra perspectives on Samsung's latest
flagship that's at youtube.com slash
Joshua Vergara once again thank you so
much for watching and we will see you in
