reviewing the yotaphone
to a dual screen smartphone we called
one of the most innovative we'd seen and
one which wouldn't be possible without
something called e ink i'm michael
fisher with pocket now and this is a
guided tour of ink what it does and how
it works
e ink powers much more than just the
yotaphone special feature phones of
yesteryear like Samsung's alias 2 and
Motorola's Moto phone ran on the
technology and a host of electronics
from wristwatches to smart cards make
use of it today most famously of course
if you've ever used an e-reader like
Amazon's Kindle you've used e ink in the
form of something called an ePaper
display or epd but how does it work the
e ink corporation invited us to their
headquarters and Innovation Centre in
Billerica Massachusetts to find out the
en corporation got its start at MIT back
in 1997 the time since has been filled
with hard work dotted by a series of
firsts it took seven years for the first
EP de book to come out in 2004 followed
a year later by the first EPD watch
followed a year later by the first
ePaper phone
it wasn't until 10 years after the MIT
spin-off that the first Amazon Kindle
launched and it along with various other
readers began escalating public
consciousness of this strange new
display medium so what is it but simply
e ink is well ink chemically very
similar to pigments used in the printing
industry but rather than being deposited
on paper this ink takes the form of tiny
capsules about the diameter of a human
hair sandwiched between two electrodes
in the implementation we're most
familiar with these capsules contain
white and black pigments separated by a
transparent fluid the pigments carry
opposite charges in this example
negative for black and positive for
white so a negative charge applied to
the bottom of the capsule repels the
black pigment forcing it to the top and
making it visible on screen as a
darkened area reversing that action by
applying a positive charge switches
positions of the particles creating a
white area
stet making text or graphics out of
these dark or light bits as a matter of
applying the correct charge across
millions of capsules and the technology
can even bifurcate the charge for still
sharper results with only monochrome or
very limited color options supported in
current ePaper implementations you might
ask why ePaper exists at all especially
given today's super sharp AMOLED and LCD
screens which kick out 16 million colors
or more at densities sometimes higher
than 500 pixels per inch the folks at
ian corporation have plenty of answers
to that some of which take the form of
surprising applications it would be
costly and power intensive to make
changeable retail price tags with LCD
for example a Inc makes a lot more sense
here same with oversized wall clocks or
cabinet lock readouts for supermarket
divider advertisements are really
anywhere there's a premium on space and
power it's the latter area that really
comes into play in our mobile focused
world we're almost always bemoaning the
poor battery life of this smartphone or
that tablet and a inc is a technology
that's only using power if it's changing
state so when it's just showing a static
page it's not consuming any energy at
all witness the incredible power savings
we got when we switched to the yotaphone
2 Z paper display documented in our full
review the tendency of the display to
remain static in its inert state also
makes e-ink panels ideal for decorations
whether they're integrated into the
device or added on via a third-party
accessory finally the reflective nature
of a ink eliminates the need for a
backlight in brightly lit environments
and the durability of the panel's makes
for a very rugged display those factors
combined make for an outstanding reading
experience on a portable durable device
which plays a big part in the enduring
popularity of the kindle and other eerie
ders I saw a lot more from he Inc during
my product tour oversized presentation
tablets for the enterprise under sized
wearables for the fitness focused
Testaments to the technology's
resiliency and peaks at its possible
future applications
and while the more traditional displays
of the world are certainly in no danger
from yank at least in the mobile space
but they're not supposed to be
electronic paper is at its best when
supplementing more conventional screens
in specific applications and given the
sense of momentum I got from Ian's
corporation during my visit I think the
most interesting developments are
probably yet to come again folks to seee
paper in action be sure to check out our
Yoda phone to review here on YouTube and
at pocketnow.com and to see more boots
on the ground coverage check out our
videos on how sapphire screens are made
and how AT&amp;amp;T protects its network from
natural disasters till next time this
has been michael fisher with pocket now
captain to phones on twitter reminding
you to keep your capsules properly
polarized we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
