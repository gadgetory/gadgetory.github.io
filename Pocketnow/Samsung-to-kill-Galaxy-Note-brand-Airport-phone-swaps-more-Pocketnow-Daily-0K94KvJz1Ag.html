completely kill the Galaxy Notes have
been brand going forward while we
announces a new SmartWatch and some sort
of a tablet and if you lost cellular
connectivity on your iPhone recently
there's actually a fix for that I'm hi
Mary vera and you know for a minute
there I thought that it was tmobile that
was misbehaving yesterday when everybody
tried to call me and couldn't but now I
fixed it this is parking out daily the
official news today begin with software
updates since some of you complain about
getting deals every day fine ok Apple
has just launched iOS 1003 and according
to the update it fixes a couple of
things number one bugs number two some
issues that cost people to completely
lose connectivity and it's funny I
actually experienced that yesterday
where the phone just completely went no
service and it didn't really start
working again until I rebooted the phone
apparently that update fix your
phone even though currently servers are
crashing with it stay tuned for that
other official news come from misfit the
company garnered a lot of Fame in the
fitness wearable department because of
two things one you don't need to
recharge them number two these were the
first wearables that were fit for
swimming now there is the misfit phase
this is actually the company's first
SmartWatch but it actually blends on
fossils a hybrid technology after
remember that also pretty much owns
misfit so yeah you now have a hybrid
SmartWatch and the price tag is actually
rather compelling you can learn more in
the description and remember all the
rumours of Huawei building another
Huawei watch two or the honor s1 up well
I'm actually reporting on it just
because I'm kind of underwhelmed the
company has just announced two new
products to honor s1 SmartWatch which is
pretty much a fitness watch it doesn't
run Android wear anything that we
actually know of we're going to confirm
that definitely but it's primarily
focused on fitness and then we have
another honor tab that's 8 inches 1080p
not really something special these are
products that are mostly offered for
lower tier markets so I don't even think
they're gonna make it to the United
States but we'll keep you posted now
let's move the spotlight over to the
galaxy note 7 i'm really getting bored
about talking about this but the
developments just continue to be
important first of all because it's now
available for replacement at SFO san
francisco international airport yes
there are kiosks from samsung right
there where you can just walk in with
your note 7 they'll give you a new phone
bill move all your data that's how
samsung is taking this i commend this
company for what they're doing but it's
just interesting that the approach has
been so serious and it is really imagine
that thing you know causing trouble in
the air or in the middle of the ocean or
whatever and finally the hot news today
actually have more to do with the
question of the day but I obviously
leave that for last focusing again on
the galaxy note 7 there are strong
rumors from analysts that Samsung is
going to completely bitch the brand now
we don't think that the company is going
to ditch the product obviously there has
to be some sort of a smartphone in the
future from Samsung that provides you
with wacom digitizer technology as
Samsung acquire the company and it does
a really great job at it the question
for today is for all of you if the
Galaxy Note brand dies what should it be
called should it be called the galaxy
scribble the galaxy tab we actually had
a full conversation on the podcast
wanded recently where we were talking
about different possible names that it
should have and we would love to know
