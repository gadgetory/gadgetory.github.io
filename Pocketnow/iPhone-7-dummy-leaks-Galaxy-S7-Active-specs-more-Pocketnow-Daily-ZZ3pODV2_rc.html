what to expect about the regular iphone
7 rumors already hint to some of the
specifications of the Samsung Galaxy s7
active and the FCC file decided to
question software updates or the lack
thereof I'm high Meadow iveta and in a
perfect world I would just come in
record this video and go out and it
would just magically edit itself this is
parking out daily as we try every single
day today we begin with deals if you are
in the market for the LG g5 that buy one
get one free deal that we saw on AT&amp;amp;T
just reach verizon you can pretty much
take the second one and only go zero
down and then 26 bucks for 24 months the
LG g5 continues to be one of the best
cameras of the year and it's also one of
the most versatile phones even though it
is rather controversial probably the
coolest news today have to do with the
FCC and FTC now questioning OEMs and US
carriers over software updates not
necessarily because they are treating
consumers bad even though they are but
mainly because hey there are a lot of
security patches that haven't reached
phones and a lot of it has to do with
the fact that these carriers just take
forever even though Google has been
doing an amazing job ever since the
whole stage fright debacle happened
let's see where this leads now famous
tipster Evan blast just got us
information on the next generation Moto
X lineup because we're getting two
phones according to him just like we got
last year with the ex play and the ex
Pierre this time code names or vertex
and vertex then being the vertex thin
the Moto X and the vertex regular is
apparently the equivalent of the play
why well because uh the vertex has a
Snapdragon 650 too and then the thin has
two Snapdragon 820 both devices support
a 5.5 inch ick wattage the AMOLED panel
a mollet thank you but then again we've
got less ram on the vertex we've got
four gigs of ram on the vertex then and
even more interesting we don't
understand this but it seems that the
regular vertex which is the entry level
is getting optical image stabilization
in the camera 13 megapixels and then the
thin is not
getting optical image stabilization but
we've got 16 megapixels on this camera
smaller battery on the thin one as well
this is going to be a rather interesting
launch we can't wait to tell you more
and for those of you that are still
waiting for the Samsung Galaxy s7 active
I am actually one of them it seems that
the phone is still happening apparently
we are getting a 5.5 inch quad HD
display for those of you that were
worried that it was going to get smaller
apparently it's going to be the same
size as the Galaxy s7 edge and then the
same specification Snapdragon 820
processor 4 gigs of ram etc etc you can
learn more in the links in the
description and finally the hot news
today have to do with the iphone 7 there
is this leak dummy out there that shows
us what to expect you know that case
makers are really good at finding these
things it seems that the antenna curves
are actually happening on the borders of
the phone it seems that the camera hump
is going away but most interesting is
the fact that the smart connector makes
the cut we're talking about the regular
iphone 7 by the way not the pro not the
7th plus it seems that the smart
connector actually is going to happen I
remember this is a dummy but in the
question of the day I'm really curious
what do you guys think apple is planning
to do with the smart connector in my
case I doubt that the company would ever
pull a keyboard for this phone this
would just totally defeat the purpose of
whatever Steve Jobs top this company to
do but hey leave us a comment down below
I think it could be a keyboard man are
probably just compatibility with
existing keyboards and just snap the
iphone there which is ridiculous but
we'll see French you know the way it
goes if you want to get these news
earlier before the video was filmed
follow was not talking out I've calm and
