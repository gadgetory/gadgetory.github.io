or podcast said to you you forgot
someone on your gift list but lucky you
we are here to help hello everybody and
welcome to episode 336 of the weekly
brought to you by Pacquiao and
xda-developers recorded on this Friday
the 14th of December 2018 did you know
that on average the busiest shopping day
of the year is actually the fourth day
before Christmas kind of makes sense I
am one of those people and also parking
at the mall
it's a nightmare on that day well good
thing we caught you here before then
we've got some last-minute gift
suggestions for the people that you
connect the most with and we've got this
week's biggest topics in mobile tech as
well
hey it's Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody and joining me is and let me
reiterate as it will be reiterated at
the end of this segment
Jules wrote all of this the best Jewish
mall Santa in Bucks County Pennsylvania
Brandon minimun how's it going brother
Jules you got it wrong I don't live in
Bucks County I live in thank you for
recognizing my Judaism and Hanukkah was
great thanks guys for asking and again
Jules wrote this The Grinch whose ram
grew three sizes too big I made of Etta
how's it going Bram grew three sizes too
big that sounds very lucky not hey
everybody how are you and like I said we
were gonna reiterate I can guarantee you
that this is all Christmas
in the script that our producer Jules
Lang is willing to write this season so
thank goodness for that no more of this
even next week even though it's right
before Christmas so next episode all
right a note before we get started to
our live audience watching on YouTube
right now we'd love to take your
questions about the special phone of the
week that Jaime and myself actually have
I just have it unboxed mine the oneplus
60 McLaren edition now the best way to
do that is through Twitter there you go
use it
see I stroked the orange the orange tint
alright so the best way to give it your
questions is through Twitter so use the
hashtag P and weekly for that we'll also
try to look through the live chat but
you know how it goes there is a bit of a
delay with the live chat so we may or
mean I get your actual questions so
again your best bet is Twitter with the
hashtag PM weekly all right everybody
that we do we actually do have quite a
bit to talk about a lot happened let's
say in China and I mean I were just
talking right before this cast that like
we were kind of thinking of trying to
get out to a couple of these events
obviously wasn't the case but we're
gonna start off with one of the little
pieces of news that came out from Xiaomi
now Xiaomi president Lin bin seems to
have gotten into the buzz of the 48
megapixel camera that is starting to
appear in a lot of mainly Chinese phones
at this particular week now speculation
at least among us right now is that the
48 megapixel camera that everyone's
talking about is indeed the Sony sensor
that was just announced and yet released
and it's going to start appearing in a
lot of phones and if Xiaomi is president
is any indication at least to start
through well it looks like this
particular 48 megapixel camera is gonna
do some awesome stuff so before you make
a pixel cameras we are obviously going
to talk about Xiaomi in this case who's
saying that their phone is going to have
this particular sensor it may or may not
be you at CES but we're not too sure
about that yet so Xiaomi is their Huawei
did the same thing with the honor view
20 and it has not only the 48 megapixel
camera on the rear it also has the new
camera hole punch it's one of the first
ones we're seeing combating the notch
for sure
and then finally we also had vivo doing
the same so there a couple of devices
out of huawei we'll go through them a
little bit and then of course vivos at
the end and that one has a really fun
feature that I want to talk about a
little bit later but first 48 megapixel
camera coming from Sony coming in these
Chinese phones and potentially in the
future how excited are we about a new
sensor you mean this Sony the one that
makes phones that doesn't include that
sensor in their phones yeah pretty much
yeah
I'm pretty excited I I i think that
Huawei has proven throughout 2018 that
photography superiority and mobile it
does have to do with hardware obviously
they made a significant push between
hardware and software but I am really
excited I honestly can't wait to see
what you know if these cameras can pull
off your software because the sad part
is that not all of these companies have
done a really good job when it comes to
the software implementation of existing
sensors so the question is how is more
megapixels over the same software you're
gonna do any better that's my question
yeah and and not to go too far into the
future but we do have one commenter here
saying with 48 megapixels on the phone
in 2019
think about that for a second 40 it
megapixels on something like that's
small like it's crazy and that's one
sensor they may not even be the multiple
cameras I was seeing on the back anyway
with 48 megapixels on a phone in 2019
god knows what kind of phone we're going
to have in the next decade I am inclined
to agree we're packing a lot into
smartphones now so 48 megapixels I
remember seeing a story about the sexual
sensor about how especially for
low-light photography it is going to do
the usual thing that we see now which is
pixel binning so I think it's supposed
to be four four megapixel diodes so that
would make it like a 12 megapixel
low-light photo or a 12 megapixel photo
at the end of it all because of the
binning but yeah I mean 48 megapixels on
the rear Brandon what kind of camera do
you typically use and how many
megapixels is that thing I use just my
phone I think it's gonna be amazing when
you get really high resolution cameras
along with really good software I mean
the stuff you'll be able to do like
you know if you look at the super zoom
on the pixel 3 which is able to get
incredible detail when you zoom in
significantly with a relatively low
resolution camera if you add to that a
high resolution camera do you guys
remember some TV shows where like
there's a video camera taking a video of
like a robber and they zoom in all the
way it's super pixelated and then some
some guy in the backgrounds like D
pixelate and suddenly it looks perfectly
enhance the I hands that's that's going
to be reality you know 50 megapixel
sensors with like the ability to use
machine learning to guess what the
pixels are around it it's gonna be
awesome for zooming into things and
getting really great detail I think as a
reviewer I'm actually kind of excited
about that because for how many years
have we been doing 100 crops into the
photos from these phones and then it
becomes pixelated and we're like well
you know the detail may not be there if
the details there that's something to be
excited about personally it's gonna be
hanging yeah it's just right now it's
all about pixel thinning so that would
be an interesting like we we thought
what Qualcomm is doing with imaging with
haif where they you know they've they've
told everybody like there are companies
that are doing ATI F but they're not
really taking the full advantage of what
the file of what of everything that can
be compiled in this file so like you can
pretty much take a photo and edit it
after the fact just because of hei F
just because of these capabilities all
this information that's already being
stored in the file so I mean what if yes
you were using pixel bidding to create a
10 megapixel shot but what if we can
eventually say you know what no I don't
want it 10 megapixel I want a 48
megapixel shot from that photo that's
already taken and then I could zoom into
it losslessly I mean that would be great
yeah and I think I think that there
should be I'm you know bringing up the
buzzword I know everyone's sick of
certain buzz words like 5g and AI which
is what I'm going to bring up depending
on the actual because a lot of these
Chinese companies are we're looking at
honor Huawei and Xiaomi and also vivo
but the the first three that I mentioned
they've done a lot of work in AI
photography to make it so that the
camera app is able to figure out what
it's looking at
that way it can change the settings
accordingly so if you have like a
landscape in broad daylight maybe a 48
megapixel photo is going to be the thing
and then when you're in low light the
bidding occurs so I could see that kind
of being the case you say here's a super
fun fact what resolution do you think a
camera needs to be to equal the ability
of the human eye to see detail just a
guess oh my god no
no oh it's it's massive it was massive
so two things about the human eye is not
just the photo quality obviously
stabilization there have you have you
know it's for me it's one of the most
fascinating things when you walk do you
notice your vision doing this you don't
sure you don't I mean for me it's just
wow the human eye is such a fantastic
you know
creation seriously I mean to try to
mimic that is insane yeah Jules called
me out he knew where my brain while it
was like no not PPI joshi's megapixels
release talent what a counter one of our
one of our commenters and we can get all
of these phones that have the 48
megapixel we will do a comparison among
all of them and try to get a account of
bear fine let's do it I'm down all right
so the other piece of news from a couple
of these from one of these phones in
particular so we're looking at honor by
the way if my camera goes out you'll
still hear my audio so I'm gonna do a
little bit of sleuthing over here the
the honor is introducing that hole-punch
front-facing camera so you got a tiny
little hole at what was the millimeter
do I think it was like oh there I go
four point five millimeters so you have
a four point five millimeter hole on the
front in a very corner no more knotch
but you've got this tiny little hole
that might it would that be annoying to
you in the way that the notch has been
cutting into your content how do you
feel about the hole punch now that's a
period the question is what companies
are planning to do with the user
interface like I feel that like the
essential phone design where that punch
hole in the mid
was you know not it didn't affect
notifications in any way we'll always
student it good job with the May 20 Pro
this Google is not doing the best job
with a pixel 3 Excel so it's just how
our apps going to interact with that
punch hole and can we please just all
define where like one spot because like
you know for the average person that's
gonna have two phones or a phone a year
that's fine you know or a phone every
two years that's fine but can you
imagine trying to get used to like
you're reviewing a phone you're used to
the camera in the center but now it's on
the left but now it's in the damn right
oh shoot it's at the bottom like it or
no there's no camera now it's in the
back layout like it is like so I I love
the experimentation don't get me wrong I
feel that we needed this experimentation
and we have to thank vivo for that for
that you know motorized camera which
pretty much like launched a trend and
they're just following up with more more
and more ideas you wouldn't you weren't
totally wrong by saying vivo but it was
Oppo right wasn't open the motorized oh
no no right vivo the next you're not
even thinking of the elbow fine tech
find exothermic okay yeah you're right
Brandon any thoughts on the hole punch
you wouldn't I think it actually looks
really really good and I don't think you
would have to do much to the UI to
reflow the content around it unless
unless it was hiding something like a
notification then you'd have to do
something if there was like a little
blank where an icon would be you'd have
to move that icon to the right but
otherwise I don't see why it can't just
be on the screen somewhere without
having to change the UI right yeah I
agree with that like it will just be
there and maybe some applications would
take advantage of the fact that that
tiny bit is cut out but every other app
it's just gonna be there and holstein
are just yeah it's gonna be there and
then hopefully they'll just have
elements to move around it if needed
because for example where it is in this
phone right now in the in the honor I
kind of wonder it's not going to cut
into the back button on the top left you
know what I mean like yeah yeah but you
have a back button in Android to begin
with but yeah up there too it's just the
gannets for me it's it's all about the
implementation and just like it's funny
whenever I read comments that are like
hey dude whatever when are you gonna
make 18 by 9 video and I'm like
not now not now at all because watching
18 by 9 video on a pixel 3 Excel is an
effing nightmare like you you get cut
outs on on a certain corner and then
you've got the knotch taking over like
50% of the video and you've got the chin
on the other end and it just and you
can't there's no way to zoom in or out
of that like whereas 16 by 9 can still
cover the knotch and you don't have to
put up with that part of that thing
affecting your user interface and so
imagine right now that we've got punch
holes coming over and then the punch
hole is gonna be in different parts of
the video and we as creators can't
predict where that's gonna be so the
best thing is to just go 16 by 9 for now
until you know something is gonna be
like this is gonna be the standard or
whatever and then sure you won't have to
worry about
oh shoot like the portion of the video
that I wanted to see is being covered by
this or that like you know whenever we
frame things we try to frame things in a
useful in a useful way so it's not like
that everything that's in the corners
doesn't really matter yeah fair enough
it's it's going to be like it doesn't it
doesn't matter I may because it's going
to be such a small percentage of the
entire video it's gonna be like 2% of
the pixels on your screen there will be
a whole so but what do i matter what if
you have a phone that has more than one
camera on the front
so imagine imagine going to the movies
and having to put up with this tall guy
sitting in front of you with head
covering one corner of the movie how
does that feel ok fair for the knotch
but this hole punch is more like there's
a aberration on the actual like screen
which I which is something that you just
sort of understand is there sometimes
but when someone stands up that's a much
that's what you hate I hope you agree
with that like I love the approach of
televisions like the ultra-thin
televisions have this like protrusion
where the cameras at the top which for
me the mechanized system if it wasn't
for the fact that you can water water
resists these phones but for me that's
like the perfect thing because you don't
want anything getting in between you and
your content that's just the way it is
why I don't I don't feel that it's the
best solution and there goes Josh's
camera it's just my camera you can still
hear me yeah I don't know man like for
me it's it's not the best idea to have
something punch a hole in your content
like I get it that you don't always
watch video Brandon but that you again
that's one of the main reasons why for
me 16 by 9 is the way to stay for now
until that is like standardized in a way
yeah I think I think that I think that
is pretty so what would you want the
whole punch then front and center would
Lenovo bring back the ThinkPad and put
it right in the middle and make it read
I think I feel that if technology is not
there I'm not saying that this I mean
this is the Samsung Galaxy approach bad
I mean think about it
it's the Samsung Galaxy approach bad
where you have minor bezels and these
minor bezels have you know they have the
camera they have the speakers we get
dual speakers because of that I don't
feel that there's anything wrong with
that approach hmm okay fair enough I do
want I want to make sure we cover one
last thing before we move on to our next
group of topics let's say VEVO with this
ring light on the back along on top of a
completely secondary display I like that
approach I kind of do too I have to
admit cameron's are crap really what's
crab selfie cameras are crap oh yeah
like it doesn't matter if you've got the
24 megapixel shooter or the dual cameras
from the pixel or 24 on Huawei's or it
doesn't matter selfie camera really bad
yeah and so like if I could have the
primary camera and have a way to see if
it's useful I don't think it's I know
that it's a nightmare to have two
screens which the battery in this and
that I get it but I think I think that
if they're like oh code did it once with
that sliding mechanism for you to be
able on the Oppo n1 and n3 for you to be
able to use the primary cameras the only
problem is the primary camera on that
phone was terrible but the terrible yes
yeah but the idea was great so that for
me is the best thing where you get off
imagine the 48 megapixel the 40
megapixel camera on the May 20 Pro to
serve as the primary imagine that like
the level of bokeh that you get from
that camera because of the size of the
sensor is crazy it's great so I like it
I like that idea
I love the
like I mean can't just I think the ring
light is a wonderful idea and I love how
its implemented because it's exactly how
you would implement it in a real camera
where the lights literally around
whatever lens you're using or whatever
cents are using I don't know the larious
just imagine what it would be like
vlogging with this that's always where
my mind goes very focused yes exactly
and then people has a beauty mode on top
of this ring light so like you're you're
you're you're kind of creating the
perfect phone for that market because in
Asia and China like beauty modes are
actually really important so now you
have good lighting for if you want to
solve the problem of selfie cameras
being poor and you want to take
advantage of the rear camera what you
need to do is you can go on Amazon I
think dbrand slick wraps might have this
you get a sticker that's a mirror finish
you put it on the back of your device
and then you can you can just use the
rear camera all the time because you
have the camera the kid the mirror
finish yeah the problem is there's no
guarantees so the biggest problem when
you set a camera a primary shooter you
have to remember that's a 27 millimeter
camera equivalent and so if you're too
close to it it has trouble focusing and
so there's no guarantee that you're in
focus with a mirror that's the problem
this is true also the other thing you
can do is just have a wide angle on the
back that you trigger that turn it
around you're pretty certain you're in
the shot yeah because it's it's it's
it's standard like there's no autofocus
on that all right so while we move onto
a topic that came up actually right
before we started our show one other
thing one other phone that Jaime is
playing with that I have yet to unbox
also is the ROG phone when you have so
many phones that you can't even and pull
them out of the box I can I'm working on
that I'm working on the meat when you
Pro right now and the yeah I just need
to get through them one by one I realize
I'm terrible at multitasking but in any
case speaking of the ROG phone that is
in Jaime's hands right now so Jaime is
actually kind of into this phone first
of all but apparently a soos is very
into this phone as well because
presidency
Oh Jerri Shem is gonna step down at the
end of the month to be replaced by two
CEOs who are being promoted from within
and their plan is to essentially make
the ROG phone more or less the focus of
their mobile strategy and kind of bring
the zenfone a little bit to this to the
wayside so Zen phones you were
mentioning before we started Jaime
they don't sell particularly well could
the ROG phone make up for all of that
well the thing about it is like from
this if you remember we were right now a
tech summit I had no idea that there
were such high demand for gaming phones
like you know when Razer came up with
the market I was like okay fine you know
it's a gaming company they're making a
gaming phone and now I had no idea like
I get it
I'm I get it that a lot of this like
money involved this candy crush and you
know certain of these games that aren't
just but I love it it's it's a dead
giveaway that a person is not a total
mobile gamer when their first thought is
candy crush right the thing about it is
a lot of this gaming market has to do
with games that aren't necessarily
high-powered first-person shooter games
because these are not necessarily great
on phones the thing about it is for
these to get really good on PCs pcs had
to get good for these to get really good
on gaming consoles gaming consoles had
to get good yeah so I feel though this
is like what was first the chicken or
the egg we need the hardware and so I
feel that if a sous is not succeeding in
making phones in general why not figure
out a niche they're already good at when
it comes to when it comes to the PC and
just bring that knowledge into a gaming
phone and I feel that their
implementation of his ROG phone is
frickin great Mike I really Michael in
Oh Chad says Jaime just has to get good
at the game dude you and I man Mario won
let's see who wins
great hey you know what super smash
brothers just came out we should told
you that oh man it's already downloading
back there I'm just at a third-world
country right now it's gonna take about
two days for that thing to download but
I really want to play that thing now you
guys do you guys know anyone in your
life
that is a hardcore gamer because I look
at the ROG phone with it that attachment
that lets it like oh really like he
plays for like hours the two people that
I know Quan Bagnall and Sam Blake one
bag nail could be on his phone playing
all day and I'm like he is passionate
about that like Quan is really good
about that and Sam is the other guy he's
been doing a lot of gaming videos for
Spanish channel for those of you if you
guys want gaming videos in English like
he's totally down to do them in English
and that's the reason I'm like alright
dude you're gonna make this ROG phone
review in English in Spanish first and
then I'm gonna do the spat the English
review but hey if you guys want to see
content from him in English I mean this
could even be his first review as well
he is really stoked about giving it a
try oh sure yeah it's an exciting phone
there's a lot offered and in the box it
actually comes with the cooler yeah yeah
or the fan I should say and yeah there's
I'm sure I'm not the biggest gamer the
cooler but Zen phones over ROG
or rather ROG over Zen from I don't know
I know mine they used to make a ton of
Zen phones right they weren't really
great phones like the zenfone 5 Z they
had a great camera it looked good but it
looked like a me-too phone it look like
an iPhone you know mixed with an Android
phone and for me that's that's the thing
man whereas this is full originality
this is something where wear shoes can
say we did this our way I mean think
about it like a fully overclocked
snapdragon 85 here you've got the cooler
to provide you know all you need now is
more accessories like a better
controller this and that but because for
me it's that like and by the way I just
received an email to try out that razor
phone the controller so that that is for
me what's missing me that's what's
missing but in the case of this as soos
phone like what things don't I like
about the razor phone come on man no
headphone jack you've even got two USB C
ports here two USB ports on this phone
it's amazing efficient to a head to a
great display I haven't tried the camera
yet the fingerprint scanners not really
good
but like come on man and this phone
doesn't really look like something that
came out of I don't know from Jurassic
Park or something it's almost like a
cyberpunk exact Shawn Velez says just
invest more in the zenfone line you know
because and I kind of see where he's
coming from with this because the auto G
phone is a premium high-end device and a
lot of the zenfone line was supposed to
be affordable good point so I do kind of
think that that's that's kind of the
case as far as price goes on all of
these phones our G phones gonna be kind
of up there but as a sort of rough segue
into our next topic the price of an
upcoming phone that you might be excited
for is gonna be a little bit exorbitant
I feel like oneplus okay I'm gonna do
this
Jaime why don't you recount real quick
as my camera goes out I've got to move
to a webcam because the batteries from
my GH 5 were just not charged I'm sorry
guys while I'm changing to a webcam can
you recount hi mate the the the
announcement that Pete loud did on stage
back at Tech Summit okay because that is
what our next topic is on is this
potential 1 + 5 g phone that is actually
not going to be the next flagship phone
it's gonna be separate to it apparently
yeah alright so there was a little bit
of a fun thing that happened with that
announcement so how about you go and
recount that while I switch my cameras
do it do it no for me I guess I was like
I didn't expect people out to be there I
didn't expect like that was a pleasant
surprise I do know that Qualcomm and
oneplus have been collaborating since
day one from oneplus I mean this was the
first company to big bring flagship
specs into you know a segment that was
unheard of before when it came to the
price point and so you know he just came
on stage and told everybody about you
know just a commitment through to 5g
that oneplus is going to be like they
were the they announced a few things
that I was a little confused about I
don't know if you can confirm this
jewels because you you did you know part
of the part of the backend with the
whole press releases but he was like
this is gonna be the first phone with
the kharkom Snapdragon 855 he said that
and I was like really the first cuz in
the timeline
the 855 I was assuming was going to be
you know early February or something
like that where Samsung usually launched
it launches and then we've got in it one
plus is usually in April that was the
first thing and then the second thing
was that they were gonna be that they
are bringing a 5g phone that they were
gonna be the first 5g phone I believe in
Europe for EE was that was it the
carrier I believe and so like it for me
those are bold things like usually you
would expect
you know you get flagship specs on a
oneplus but obviously because of the
difficulty in the price point it's very
hard for oneplus to be the first at
things and so you know usually it's when
when chipsets are on their way you know
and their mid point where it makes sense
for them to get a better deal for these
chips and being able to acquire them and
so that plus the fact that they're
making a 5g phone he was clear in a
separate interview I believe it was
Musashi Siegen he did mention that he
couldn't there was no guarantee that
this was going to be an inexpensive
phone that it couldn't because of 5g
connectivity obviously so we're assuming
that you know that the 855 doesn't
necessarily doesn't have 5 G's so the
Snapdragon 85 brings the X 24 modem so
this is two gigabit LTE
but if you connect the X 50 modem you
will have the capability so it could be
that we will be getting early next year
a one plus seven I would say with a
Snapdragon 855 not necessarily 5g
capable and then later have a phone
that's 5g probably the T variants that
would include it I'm thinking what do
you remember Josh I see your back yeah
well I'm still changing a couple of
things here sorry
yeah the from what I remember like there
was lot there's a little bit of hubbub
around the whole fact that up on stage
it literally said that that phone was
gonna be the first 855 and it's clearly
not gonna be the case and Jules is uh in
the booth right now telling us that it
was chalked up to an interpretation
error which that's true he was he was up
there speaking in Chinese and everybody
but the thin but then aside from that it
was
she sprawled on the slide behind that it
was gonna be an 855 first which everyone
kind of scrambled them was like holy
crap the the one plus is one plus is
really like pushing really well for this
but as far as the 5g phone goes
apparently and one thing that was cool
about tech summit is that there are so
many people coming out the woodwork to
say they support 5g all these carriers
especially EE out of the UK like it was
great to see that now whether or not the
5g modem is going to be a part of the
flagship one plus that remains to be
seen but apparently they're gonna make a
whole different whole different phone
that because of the cost that it takes
to actually create what is inside of
that and everything that goes around it
to make it 5g capable it could be up to
three hundred dollars more yeah I mean
think about it you need for RF on
antennas on each on each side to be able
to provide the millimeter wave
connectivity in addition to the X 50
modem which is a separate chip that
would need to provide the connectivity
for sub six so you know it's it's a lot
of extra hardware on its own yes as Sam
says might be doing the same thing yeah
having a separate phone for 5g yeah and
and so that's I you know for me probably
one of the interest most interesting
takeaways from tech summit was the fact
that we have heard companies say
building millimeter wave into a phone is
impossible and so Qualcomm just proved
that it is possible but obviously there
are some there are some tricks that have
to be done in the hardware for this to
be possible like pretty much having
cutouts on every corner and I'm just
waiting for jerry-rigged everything's a
durability test of these phones for this
RF for these RF antennas to be able to
capture the millimeter wave and not just
sub 6 which I do know that other
companies are gonna do 5g but only sub 6
not the millimeter wave yeah it there's
so much there's and then again I bet you
a lot of people in our chat or like oh
this 5g talk again I mean it is it's it
is gonna be the next wave and what is so
crazy is that companies have to work
around all of the things that are needed
for 5g to happen which means different
devices so you kind of have to let us
know in the in
Twitter or what or in the chatter in the
Twitter hashtag P and weekly would you
pick a 5g phone over the flagship phone
the more conventional every year phone
just to be at the bleeding edge because
we don't even know what they're going to
put in the 5g phones if they are
separate from the flagship if they're
going to be anything and also right here
I can't pronounce the name nephews Fuad
I hopefully I said that right oneplus
will not get another excuse for a hiking
for hiking their price 5g might be the
only excuse I've had to be honest but
it's so the price that they're saying is
$700 yeah even so $700 is so far less
it's still $200 less than every flagship
yeah that's true
okay well enough times you talk let's
get to a phone that actually happened as
really exciting the one +60 McLaren
Edition okay I'm looking at a beautiful
photo that was taken of it already I bet
this was here right Jaime so man like
mirror black finish with the McLaren
logo at the bottom a little bit of
carbon fiber underneath as far as the
pattern goes and then that orange dance
but that's not all that has changed now
go for it so alright so the main thing
that's changed is it's got 10 gigabytes
of RAM now what you feel like that is
absolutely necessary for a smartphone
that's up to your preferences but the
other thing that has been getting the
headlines is its warp charging I have to
mention this while charging is one crazy
new addition to this have you used the
warp charging on yeah but I just I don't
I don't have the time to notice how
quickly it charges because by the time
I'm back it's already charged like like
no it's it's like if Luke from Oppo was
great which was pretty much the first
company that came up with this
investment and then that's charging like
this is being able to do the same thing
so there are a couple of benefits to
warp the first one is obviously being
able to charge your phone for a full day
like a full day of use which one Plus is
calling 50 percent of battery which I
have proven 50 percent on a1 plus it's
just fine
ever since the five T battery life on
one plus devices is that great so yeah
fifty percent of battery in 20 minutes
is I think that's even can
servitude I think that that's very
conservative the phone charges faster
but the cool part is that you you know
usually when you're when you're charging
a phone the phone heats up and so that
overheating doesn't allow that like the
charger will sense that the phone is
overheating because you're using it and
therefore will slow down the charge
whereas the one-plus approaches there
are more connectors and therefore it
will it has more contact points to
provide power to the battery and so
therefore the thumb doesn't heat up
while they're charging it which for me
is a major benefit when compared to the
last a technology that they had and not
only does the charge speed stay up but
the phone which is cooler doesn't
throttle like yes so it doesn't throttle
either the charging or the phone while
you're using it so during those 20
minutes you can literally be topping
your phone off out of need and use your
phone and that's no problem whatsoever
you know so for me this is one of those
reasons where a lot of people are like
complaining oh yeah but the phone
doesn't have wireless charging I get it
I like wireless charging now
particularly with the pixel stand that's
really cool but to be honest with you if
I don't have to worry about charging my
damn phone that's even better
and when I do have to charge my damn
phone to know that all I'll have to do
is twenty to thirty minutes and then
just forget about it and for me that's
even better
and you know that makes a lot of sense I
was there when one of our friends David
Kogen was unboxing his and he got a
little bit I wasn't David Coker was a
David Amell it might have a David Amell
he was a he was like I want to get this
phone set up I'm so excited to use it
but it's low on battery and the rest of
us in the room were like just plug it in
for a few it was like all right there
you go so he plugged it in and in like
10 minutes he was like I have enough for
the rest of the day it's awesome fast
charging is like in it is it is a
requirement now over smartphone lives I
feel like and it's great that it's
becoming more and more prevalent
Warp charging is a new way it's too bad
we can't call it - charging anymore I
kind of like that name but warp charging
fine let's do it by the way we're
charging is faster than - charge but
what does I mean but Jaime was talking
about but the heat dissipation was
present - in - charge where it would put
the heat in the brick and not in the
itself exactly yeah according to Jules
it's 20 Watts versus 30 roxtor
yeah which a lot of people are like yeah
but Huawei has supercharged for 40 watts
I think about is this technology has
more contact points between more
contacts point feeding the batteries so
that's the reason why it's it's not just
fast more wattage but it's more
distribution and that's why it's faster
yeah definitely
okay oh by the way one quick thing as
Jules has also said xda-developers has a
comprehensive story on warp charge 30
live right now so make sure you check
that out head over the XDA they're
always doing some great stuff over there
okay and just before we move away for
those of you considering 10 gigabytes of
ram to be overkill project boost on
oneplus devices the fact that it's not
just fast it's not just you have more
multitasking because you have more RAM
but you also have the advantage of of
the you project boost will use Ram the
leftover RAM to store portions of apps
that you use constantly and so it's not
just that the app will remain there but
also it'll remain faster as well you're
asking is it a good upgrade from the
oneplus X alright so for me honestly
with the oneplus 16 the standard one I
was like no I really liked my red one
plus 6 with a headphone jack I really
loved it but man this McLaurin looks
really nice it looks really nice it
performs really nice I love the
packaging like for was it well what is
it $6.99 oh I got it here so for $6.99
you get all this like you get the case
you get the McLaren that signature
carbon fiber or black you get that
booklet it's like you remember the old
days when you used to unbox CDs and
there was this like experience inside
there were even CDs where they were like
pop up and bring like different things
vertically like that's how this feels so
for less than the price of a standard
flagship you get pretty much one of the
fastest phones man like that's the way I
see it sir eyes true I'm totally down
for this version of the 60 in
pass like you know as I said in my
review it's a great phone but if you
have it not a one plus six I wouldn't
upgrade I I wouldn't so do you feel that
the difference between the eight gigs
and the ten gigs of ram from the sixty
to the sixteen mclaren actually make a
difference on day to day usage well the
thing about it is you have to you have
to consider the fact that it's not just
in day to day usage think about 2019
most people can't buy a phone each year
man so the more powerful your phone is
today the more future proof it is for as
long as you want to carry it for right
so if you you know instead of buying
like right now how much is a pixel 3xl
out of 789 if I remember correctly
no it's 899 Oh 899 899 for the 60/40 XL
yeah yeah pixel 3 Excel is okay and all
right so that's a lot of money or four
gigs of RAM and wait for gigs of RAM and
64 gigs of storage whereas you get 10
gigs of ram and 256 gigs of storage
dual-sim capabilities I mean come on
also in the Box in the pixel 3 isn't
port of RAM management so you got that
to what you know what you're absolutely
right there's poor RAM management
apparently ok so one of the but one of
the best examples on that on the excel I
will say play music like I always do I
always have something playing in the
background and then open up the camera
the music will stop yeah that has
happened not every time that has
happened yeah all right so we have one
more story also I apologize to you
Brandon if we're not able to get you in
our final segment because I know you
might have to get out of here in a few
but I do think we have to talk a little
bit about this apparently my my fair
state of California is out of its mind
because because tax revenue from service
providers in particular and yes we have
Silicon Valley here and they don't
really pay as many taxes that's probably
a lot of people wish that they did
because of that California is actually
looking to tax the SMS or our CES
capabilities of a phone carrier there
might be a text
haxe oh but you know you know what
California you're just in time welcome
to 2009 man
whatsapp a facebook Messenger like just
don't use SMS and that's it
you know it's funny I just got my
project fly or rather Google fired
now that it's Google Phi I got a fresh
sim because my old one for some reason
crapped out and I threw it into the
Huawei I started I started texting like
like crazy on that thing I was happy to
use SMS again for some reason because
Android messages as an application is
kind of good and then this happens
yeah I I I personally can't really
understand like its what it is one of
those things where if if you if you're
gonna pay more for texting and what's
funny is we have unlimited texting now
we used to pay for like what there would
like limits 500 texts 800 text thousand
texts you're like 10 cents per remember
exactly yeah or like nights and weekends
we can keep it off for free yeah so
there might actually be a little bit
more of the tax on text and it's not
necessarily now this is a thing it may
or may not be and also Jules did say
it's a proposal at this point but
another thing another thing to keep in
mind it's not necessarily a it's not
necessarily a cost that's going to be
harbored on to the user per se directly
it's on the service providers but
because they have to pay more than phone
plants could rise in price for them to
make overhead so that sucks I hope it
doesn't go through do any other states
do this another of you guys areas texts
this kind of stuff do they orally no not
New York no New York Pennsylvania now
FCC says state authorities can do this
now that's okay fair enough Jules thank
you for that well yeah I just we just
wanted to put that out there I obviously
I rep LA to the death and I'm
Californian all of my life this is kind
of weird and I wonder where it's gonna
go
yeah alright so from there we're gonna
go ahead and actually let me just double
check on one last thing all right yeah
so that'll do it for our first segment
we're gonna wanted to take a really
quick break
all right here we go the new pocket my
weekly comes to you with support of cos
theta by neutron and today I want to
talk to you about casita by Lutron smart
lighting control brought to you by
Neutron pioneers and smart home
technology with casita you can schedule
your lights to come on at dusk so your
family always comes back to a well at
home instead of switching out all of
your bulbs for smart ones or slapping on
bulky smart plugs why not save yourself
the trouble interest replace your light
switches it looks better on your wall
anyways all it takes is a screwdriver
fifteen minutes and you're in business
you can press the buttons or link up
your smart speaker and illuminate your
house as bright or as dim as you like
our producer Jules has been trying these
switches out for a while now and uses
casada to force himself to bed all he
does is ask his echo you can use a
Google home or an Apple home pod as well
then set a time for his bedroom lights
to turn off otherwise he'd be too
engrossed in his game of mini metro to
even care about getting up fiddling with
the lamp switch and then going back to
sleep what he's a simple man yeah what
can you say and if you can have your
smart lighting just as simple by getting
it the smart way with caseta by Lutron
search cas ETA or hit up Lutron comm
casita by Lutron welcome home to peace
of mind alright alright so we do a bit
of a check-in for today but knowing that
brandon is going to be getting out of
here in a few I do want to say we have a
main segment a little bit later today
where we talk about the kinds of gifts
that we would recommend to our viewers
and listeners if you haven't already
gotten a gift for maybe the tech lover
in your life the connected individual in
your life Brandon you can do a check-in
you could talk about your gift you could
do all of the above before you get out
of here why don't we go ahead and start
with that yeah I'll talk about the gift
um as jules emailed about this several
hours ago said guys think about a gift
and for me it was for me it was so easy
it's a gift that I gave to my in-laws
and they loved it so much and that's a
good litmus test because my in-laws
aren't that technically inclined they
don't care about tech
like at all and that thing is a either a
Amazon echo or a Google home if if it's
and if you get the dot or the many
they're so inexpensive $30 and if
they're people if people just spend a
little bit of time embracing them into
their life it's amazing and every week I
feel like I come on in podcast and I
talk about how much I'm in love with my
you know echo and Google home because I
use them in so many ways but I think for
the average person for mom and dad and
even grandma you know these $30.00
hockey pucks are incredible that's my my
gift idea and with that I'm going to
jump off and say Happy Hanukkah and see
you guys later all right
so we do so we wanted to make sure we
got Brandon was a gift in in before he
left but during our check-in we do have
a couple of things I wanted to talk
about just sort of on the side just have
some fun with it
first of all Jules if there are any
other questions about the one plus six
to declare and go ahead and throw those
into our chat and we'll answer them but
Jaime you wanted to talk about something
very controversial today the least liked
the most disliked of video oh my god oh
my god I'm like really only people that
have not made a video about YouTube's
rewind there's a lot to unpack about
YouTube rewind and I don't think we're
going to get into any of like the
YouTube politics or any of the actual
things but it's it's so interesting that
this this is loo this is the worst it's
ever been it's literally the most
disliked video of all time but it's the
most disliked video of all time it
reminds me of that Friday music video
from Rebecca Black like it was funny
because that year that you know what a
Friday came back Rebecca Black was the
host of the real was opposed the rewind
I get it I know it was it was like I
guess it was like one of YouTube's best
viral videos at its time and the
problems rewind it's just that like even
Marquez made his own video and then
cased he made his video where they were
talking about like this is sadly
clearly a way for YouTube to please
advertisers and it's just sad because
like I feel that seriously we can't
forget our community like it doesn't
work that way like no way
like even even when we do sponsored
content like we try like we even tell
companies like sure like listen we have
no problem in doing sponsored if you
want us to review your product or this
we're just not gonna sponsor the review
we can't because we can't tell the
audience you know it's just unethical
for me to tell people my opinion of a
product if you're paying me to say it
but you can sponsor the part of the
parking out daily all you want but you
have to understand at the moment that I
review your product I will say
everything about this phone if you're
confident that your product is great
then fine but I'm not obligated to talk
anything beautiful about your phone if
it sucks
yeah so let's just be clear about that
you can sponsor the daily all you want
and you've got you've got a segment for
that or the weekly yeah opinions are
never paid for exactly but then you know
you get the rewind where the whole idea
is to recap on the best videos of the
year obviously a lot of these were
controversial and so none of these are
included a lot of good creators are not
included in something like YouTube
what's wrong with these I mean come on
commute the community made you and it's
the community that makes you appealing
to advertisers the other way around
what analyzers looks for you because of
the size of your community not because
your YouTube yeah and Jules even said
here if you want to pay for the news you
have to pay for the good and the bad
news like it's it's all in one thing I
feel like okay so YouTube or Google in
Google as YouTube I should say they have
this whole thing of like
compartmentalizing the actual content on
the platform why not have a rewind for
each section like a rewind for music a
rewind for tech a rewind for vlogs that
way there might be more representation
in each of the categories and that
allows you to push it towards the
advertisers who want to have ads on
those types of content if they want to
be specific about where they want their
ads to be they can just look at the the
tech rewind or the music rewind or the
late-night show rewind which end up not
even being youtubers it's gonna be all
actual celebrity
was a big problem a lot of people were
getting up said that like the video
started out with Will Smith for example
like he's technically a youtuber now but
he's still a massive celebrity he's not
really of YouTube he's not home who
channel's freaking awesome that way yeah
he's not like he's great
oh my goodness a better idea a youtube
fast-forward I just dope you in video
wasteland that we are one of our
questions on Twitter or rather just a
statement on Twitter I'm gonna wait on a
5g device because I know my city won't
get it when it launches that's true
I also upgraded frequently with my
carrier so I can wait that's very true
as well on stage at the tech summit
people the carriers were actually
showing what cities they were going to
support off the bat and I remember
getting a tweet from somebody that said
oh great I live like 30 miles away from
that one city and Britain but my city is
not gonna get it so like you're close
but that's so not quite there
I'm sure this country is not gonna get
it into like 2029 or something like that
maybe so at least our 4G LTE is better
than in the United States I'll tell you
that much
there you go and that's the more
ubiquitous one so there's some emphasis
to that as well so if I'm going to uh
it's like going to Seoul Korea or to
Hong Kong and the 4G is it's incredible
out there yeah I remember uploading
videos willy-nilly in my hotel room and
in Seoul it was amazing
all right so Christmas Christmas coming
up it looks like you got some I'm not
sure if the decor behind you was
supposed to be Christmas themed or
anything like that but it kind of seems
a little festive I just got a really
good friend that's a girl to do the
decoration and she kind of overdid it
but is going on and you know what I was
mentioning to a couple of our friends
while we were in Hawaii for tech summit
like there's something kind of odd about
being in a really cool and chill place
like Maui where it's always hot and
humid that gets me in the mood for
Christmas
yeah it's it's kind of funny because I'm
really happy by the time I leave Maui
and I'm ready for the holidays to come
through
of course for you and me Jaime getting
back ready for the holidays means
getting the flu in a way yeah break was
a great back for bathroom break for me
like I am like I'm really sick it's bad
like out and everything that's why I'm
in my home right now I'm in my family
home right now I was like you know what
I can't even like drive to my office
right now I'm gonna do it later
when I get the strength to but when I
woke up this morning I was like T I need
everything right now it's the holidays
blah blah um okay so we're gonna go
ahead and Jules is I'm the only one in
30-degree weather who's not sick well I
mean I you have a great career in a
really dry area to that to brighness
helps yeah okay so Christmas coming up
have you got your Christmas shopping
done ah yeah you know the kids usually
like do all good always knows what he
wants you know and it's always either
PlayStation related or stuff like that
or clothing he's really into clothing
and then my kids all they want is a
Nintendo switch stuff nice but what are
you talking about for like for like the
tech gifts or like in general like
essentials I don't think oh my god
simply so uh like I'd like Brandon took
the idea off my mind when it came to
like a really good gift for Christmas
dude Amazon products are killing it like
I've been trying an echo from the Taiwan
trip like I got a I got a Amazon echo
and I didn't think it was gonna work
here and I'll do it as it actually does
work fully I can connect it to all my
accounts just fine I have an Amazon
Prime account in the United States and
it works just fine
dude like I'm really impressed with
Amazon products from the Kindle is
probably one of my favorite gadgets ever
like ever I really love using a Kindle
and then you can find Kindles that are
really inexpensive the Amazon echo is
really inexpensive another thing that
I'm trying but it's in the other room is
the Google home hub oh so it's not the
perfect product it's thought that a
little room to grow in the user
interface because it doesn't behave like
anything like it's got its own
I tell the left user interface it's kind
of weird but just the whole idea like I
like whenever I turn off the lights in
my bedroom and it just dims dead into
this like night clock really well and
the alarm is like really subtle and then
I can ask it for a ton of things and I
like that I could you know I can start
playing a video in youtube and then I
could just put my phone to charge and it
throws the video into the home hub like
these are really good products obviously
on the higher end like I like I would
not recommend devices like a humble home
because the home hub is pretty much
almost the same price and you get a lot
more functionality so I would gather go
for the Google home mini or the Google
home hub or in the case of the Amazon
echo I've never tried like the higher at
like the higher end ho echo but the echo
dot is just it sounds so good like it
literally sounds well enough through
this whole living room in the apartment
you know so for me it's like it's a
really great gift Amazon products are
like killer everything else is too
expensive I would never recommend a
flagship phone right now they're too
crazy expensive probably the nine point
seven inch iPad which is three hundred
and fifty bucks you weren't in love with
that thing yeah you're in love with that
thing and no we're filming right yeah
yeah no my my iPad pro but they had the
iPad pro that's the thing man it's just
I love tablets like for me tablets are
just so convenient and so like if if you
don't need a tablet you don't need a
SmartWatch but these are the things that
are really cool to have um and so like
for 300 something bucks if you want to
like really impress somebody that's a
good gift
but I would again an echo dot is like a
good enough gift for 30 bucks man I
would have it in every room yeah yeah
the only reason why the tablet market
grew this year I know cuz I bought what
last year because I was like what the
iPad pro cost what no I'm not gonna buy
it I was actually a test I would
actually asked like over the last week
what kind of trends people could look
forward to in 2019 that they should like
buy into right now so that they're kind
of on the bleeding edge and like the
first thing that came into my head
because we were just out of Hawaii I was
like 5g like it's a 5g but never buy
with the thing that I was actually
thinking about was yeah voice assistance
it is a great time to get into it
because it could be that that's all most
of your gateway drug is the is the home
hub or the home mini or the echo dot or
anything like that because it is your
first foray into the smart home world
and Lord knows I go on slick deals net
like all the time and there are always
smart plugs and smart switches that are
on sale
yeah and in like Brandon said if you
take a little bit of time to just learn
how that thing kind of works then you
can easily just say okay gee or whatever
turn on my light like even my light up
here this is a lifx bulb right now and I
use it not only to like point it at my
bed to wake me up in the morning which
has been failing lately but I also
control it using the home mini which is
over there my TV is so like there's a
certain level of of the eco system that
you can get into you don't have to dive
too far into it you know you can wade
into it stay in your comfort zone just
do smart switches smart bulbs all that
stuff yeah cuz I'm smart bulbs are
expensive that's the problem
yeah three bucks for one one well no I
highly recommend either life X or the
casa by tp-link those two are actually
fairly affordable and I bet you they're
gonna be on sale a lot during this
holiday season speaking of the holiday
season once again PocketNow actually has
a holiday shopping guide so make sure
you check that out we have it linked in
well we'll have it in the show notes or
links down below in the YouTube video
sérgio in our chat apparently agrees
with you Jaime tablets are very
convenient like for taking pictures in
public come on man follow my review
points do not take photos with your
tablet how dare you it's it's the dead
giveaway when you're traveling it's like
oh that's someone's grandma oh oh my god
like right now that we were in Taipei
yeah buddy
everybody age 50 and higher this is the
tablet and they were all using it to
take photos with it everybody I was like
wow alright now I understand why fab
exist yeah I get it like yeah I would
actually think okay I have a few
different categories for the types of
users or gifts that I would recommend
like there's there's there's media
consumption there's gaming and then this
creation
now the creation one you've seen you
talked about before and you've seen me
use hi me our jewels as well actually
this bad boy right here this clip-on
lens now I know a lot of people out
there or scoffing right now but take it
from not only me but also some of our
friends in the tech industry who are
like I will try that out too this is the
best thing that you can get for photos
on a front facing camera like if you
want to make a wide-angle on a rear
camera I mean that's one thing but when
you're doing like selfies or IG stories
or you just want to say something and
have more of the background and just a
better view this this particular click
on lens
Zenvo it makes it a point four five
field of view than is already in the
front-facing camera yeah I've used this
so many times if you follow me on IG
stories there's a lot of times when I'm
actually using this or the moment or the
moment lenses it's kinda like Yolo clip
multipel I love this approach from
although clip where it's like very
easily snap in and snap out different
lenses yeah I just it's in the other
room but it's I like it cuz it works on
pretty much any smartphone mm-hmm yeah
yeah very and primary and standard it's
really cool yeah I do her I do recommend
those it's just those lenses aren't
cheap dude like it not cheap from the
rights perspective not just that like
when you grab them they are not light
yeah they're not this thing is this this
is big like you could see this but the
glass in here is actually pretty good
quality it may not be on the quality of
like a moment lens but then again very
few are but yeah I mean this is only
like 30 it's only like 20 bucks twenty
thirty dollars and you know for anybody
that looks at the ratings more than
anything else this is the highest rated
one on Amazon so just keep that in mind
because because there's also another
feature where you can unscrew this
larger umbrella part up here and it
becomes a macro lens so it's macro and
wide so you can have some fun with that
both of those so that's for the Creator
I would actually say it's a very cheap
one you can throw it into even a white
elephant or a gift exchange if you want
and someone will scoop that thing up I
use a book chromecast
why elephant exchanges and people would
like fight over them for people who like
their audio now I'm using the oneplus
bullets USBC that's actually where I'm
using for the microphone right now so if
you've been looking for like a little
bit of a review of it like you're
listening to it right now
USBC headphones fine USBC is like the
the standard now there's no headphone
jacks blah blah blah well then why not
just dive into bluetooth I will always
always always recommend these I the
Jabra yeah it lead 65 minor charging
there on the higher right they are oh my
god so when people ask me every time
that I'm running what are the headphones
that I'm using Java elite 65 T active
and whenever I'm not running and
whenever I'm not running it's the Jabra
elite 65 T those are my favorite
headphones hands down oh the earrin em
twos are also fabulous but these Jabra
is it's just like if you're gonna go
over 200 bucks uh you know you're the
audio quality has to be great and the
thing about Jabra is you know they are a
multiple they're a multi company with
resound and resound specif their
specializes in hearing aids and so their
technology in audio quality and noise
cancellation is top-notch man yeah
top-notch like whenever I'm running I'm
like guys don't talk to me I'm not
hearing you like and I always forget how
to activate the ambient display mode
which is available but I always forget
and do it if I don't turn that on you
can't hear anything
and it sounds fantastic mm-hmm
yeah absolutely love those if you want
something cheaper that are not truly
Wireless and if you're okay with that
the one plus bullets Wireless are pretty
fantastic as well and it seems like they
updated it so when the oneplus 16 was
announced they gave us the oneplus oh
well I happen to love my ear buds with
ambient display sorry whatever
ambient ambient noise yeah I didn't even
care
[Laughter]
but yeah the one plus bullets Wireless
the ones that go around your neck
they're a little bit like the the beats
wireless ones those are only like I
think they're only $60 and yes 50 $99.99
they're good yeah those aren't quite
good as well and sprites are good
they're a little wonky to pair oh and I
kind of don't like the design like for
fitness I you know for regular all day
these are the headphones I do recommend
them but for fitness they're not my
favorite mmm
I agree because they would like kind of
get in the way a little bit like when
she wants if you're a gym rat or if you
run like Jaime does truly wireless
earbuds are a revelation they are so
awesome and then finally see more
endurance so one final thing for gamers
I actually don't have it right next to
me I don't remember where I put it but
pretty much any controller for a
smartphone honestly like what is that it
is that little bit for a gamer who games
on their smartphone that they need and
it's it's it just opens things up like
there's so many games and the Play Store
right now that reports that the current
games that are that are current mobile
games even gachi games they benefit from
a controller but how has your experience
been Josh because I bought a couple of
powered magas like Sam is actually
playing with one in the other room and
the problem with these power bogus' is
just they use the Bluetooth hid profile
the keyboard no file and so depending on
the game you have to go into settings
and like really dig deep into being able
to have the controller work well with
the game and then it does it does depend
on the game I will admit but built into
recent versions of Android is automatic
X input which means that when you have a
controller that actually supports let's
say the shield controller for example
obviously ABXY two joysticks and whatnot
when this pairs to a phone with recent
versions of Android it automatically
views it as a controller not has come
not as a keyboard input I guess I
haven't been using these
it's almost on the level of connecting
this very controller to my laptop or to
my computer and it thinks it's an Xbox
controller it's the same general idea
I'm sorry for you that it thinks that
it's an Xbox controller I'm really
looking forward to trying that Razer
phone one I mean they just offered it
right now through you know I'm like yes
definitely send them over I got you the
one that I would highly recommend that I
just love because there's a nostalgia
kicking me is I think I think I know
where it is but it's just too far out of
reach
it's the 8-bit do a bit Doh why don't I
open it is it's a Super Nintendo
controller that has been retrofitted to
have analog sticks and two two shoulder
buttons so it's a modern controller I
have the shape of SNES so you can use on
the switch right you can use on the
switch you can use audacity you can use
it on your on your smartphone it's only
50 bucks I've heard great things about
that controller like they're great
things yes I love it and there are
certain games that I've played on the
touch screen of mainly the pixel 3xl
lately
and once I cared the controller too and
I was using that I was just I was just
kicking ass it was great but that would
be my thing like like accessorize there
are so many different things for the
smartphone that might be missing that
you can just add on after the fact with
headphones this lens I even have this
case this five thousand milliamp hour of
case with the pixel three XL now that
was sent to me by zerolemon so there's
that one
you can add battery so your pixel 3 if
you want there are so many different
accessories you can get and I would say
don't be afraid to do that even if you
take off the accessory like a case when
you don't need it you know you doesn't
who says a case needs to be on the phone
all the time just times when you meet a
person yeah it does oh yeah get
accessorizing start trying all all these
products and and then when you're done
with that head over to the holiday
shopping guide and make sure you check
out what pocket now in general says
about what you should be buying for this
holiday season I think I should pretty
much do it drills I don't know if
