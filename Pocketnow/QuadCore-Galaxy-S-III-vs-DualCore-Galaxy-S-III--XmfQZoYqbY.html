this is a big week for Samsung in the
United States they've announced their
galaxy s3 phone for all four major
nationwide carriers as well as a fifth
US Cellular now that's a big deal the
galaxy s3 is essentially identical
across all of the US carriers but it
differs significantly from the
international version released a few
weeks ago as far as specs under the hood
go now I've got the international
version of the galaxy s3 here and I've
also got a Sprint branded version right
here we're gonna do some app launch
comparisons some benchmarks and other
speed tests and see how these devices
stack up speed wise we got a lot to do
Michael it's pocket now here we go
okay so I mentioned some spec
differences between these models let's
see what they are now the International
version of the galaxy s3 is powered by
an Exynos 4210 a nine processor clocked
at 1.4 gigahertz backed up by one gig of
ram the radio is Penta band GSM the
storage options are available from 16 to
64 gigs and microSD expansion up to an
additional 64 gigs the Sprint version
like all the US variants is powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 dual-core CPU
clocked at 1.5 gigahertz
that's a dual-core processor but it
allows the Sprint version to incorporate
support for LTE and it's made with the
28 nanometer process as opposed to the
Exynos 32 nanometer and it's backed up
by double the RAM two gigs in all the US
versions as opposed to one for storage
there are 16 or 32 gig variants with the
same expandable microSD card slot for
all those changes under the hood though
as you can see these are very similar
almost identical devices physically both
are running Android 4.4 with the
TouchWiz 5 nature UX skin in the out of
box configuration because it's so hard
to tell them apart I'll keep the Sprint
one here on the right for the duration
of the video ok let's start the test
battery let's go for a boot up
time check so both of these devices are
on the same page the international
version was given a hard reset and I
installed only the apps were going to be
testing today the Sprint version was new
out of the box just a few days ago and I
did the same on it
so aside from setting up the bare
minimum of accounts and home screen
shortcuts these are very close to an
out-of-box condition here we go then 1 2
3 so already we can see the differences
here
the GTI 9300 is displayed on the
international version and the
international version is quite a head
start now we have the Sprint
carrier-specific animation here 4G LTE
called out dual Samsung banners sorry
about the screen reflection on this one
here and already we're up on the
international one can unlock the screen
and we are ready to go we have a network
connection and everything there we go
now the Sprint one has finally caught up
so we're talking about a difference
there really we're only talking two or
three seconds I think is what that felt
like
but just in case you are constantly
turning on or off your device that could
matter a lot or a little depending on
you now let's move on to app launching
and see how these devices fare launching
various stock applications so as you can
see just to be sure on the same page
here these devices are running with 0
open apps and they're both connected to
the same Wi-Fi network in the office
here so one of the first things we do
out of the box especially if you're
migrating from a previous Google device
is to redownload all your apps from the
market so let's try a test launch of the
Google Play Store here we go 1 2 3
very quick load on each one almost
identical as far as that goes
so that's nice then let's move on to
email which I have set up with my pocket
now email address 1 2 3 boom and we have
this first use dialog telling us how to
double tap to get the top of a list once
again that was pretty instant on each
device
let's try messaging boom I have no
messages because I use Google Voice but
those apps launched right away let's try
maps 1 2 3 the International Version for
some reason has us over in Ireland but
then we do a little location check there
and then the location thing here and
that's great and the camera one of the
most important things that you want to
be able to launch quickly 1 2 3
but viewfinder is up identical time on
each and they've both got no focus
because their face down but that focus
happened instantaneously no difference
let's go into the browser one of the
things you're gonna be spending a lot of
time in unless you use the third-party
browser 1 2 3 boom ok now I was doing
some testing before so these are loaded
the last page that was up but we're
gonna hop on into bookmarks here and
we're gonna see if we can load the
desktop version of pocketnow.com if we
can find it there it is
1 2 3 as I said before these are
connected to the same network so
theoretically they should be
experiencing the same speed very very
very quick on each and we have that ad
loaded finally they're not too shabby on
each device let's do a little bit of
zooming in action here zooming in
simultaneously pinch-to-zoom
almost a one-to-one ratio there you can
see the both the international version
and the sprint version need time to re
render the page at the larger view but
I can determine no difference
performance scrolling is great we're
gonna try and sorry we're gonna try and
tap a link here at the same time to see
a new page load let's go in and read
this story let's do a chain one two
three boom
pages load once again now the
International Version was about a second
ahead that time but really unless you
are really pressed for time I'm talking
sub-second time levels these are very
very similar as far as performance in
the browser goes let's try to load
another page I tend to like nasa.gov
because it is heavy with media and space
type stuff that I like one two three
boom this is the NASA home page not the
mobile site so it should take a second
to render once again International
Version just slightly ahead there by a
sub second amount once again pinch to
scroll pinch to zoom rather rerender way
in here once again no discernible
performance difference to my eye
of course if stock apps were the whole
story we'd all still be using dumb
phones
what about third-party applications
let's test a few okay so for third-party
apps we're just gonna load a few here
let's go for Flipboard
very very pretty app made its Android
debut on this device and now is
available on most Android devices
responsiveness is nice launch time
unsurprisingly is identical hop into
facebook facebook splash screen
international version just about a
second ahead so that's a trend that's
starting to develop a little bit except
it didn't load that image quite as
quickly so
inconsistent but we're only talking a
second or two Twitter boom Twitter feed
loads there it is some new people have
followed me that's always nice to see
and let's try Google+ if you use it one
two three Google+ loads and that time
the Sprint version beat it so it's
inconsistent the international version
doesn't always lead despite its beefier
processor and let's hop into YouTube now
for a YouTube we want to see how these
manage video we don't really care about
load time we just want to see if there's
any difference in how these devices
buffer and play the same video it will
hop into the pocket now account up on in
here I'm going to tap in at the same
time 1 2 3 boom so see International
Version heart we're gonna turn me down
cuz I just talk a lot this is after the
Buzz episode 3 if you haven't watched it
you should it's awesome
ya know I mean there was a very very
very slight time difference between
these two devices but once again nothing
to write home about and speaking of
video while we're here we might as well
test one of the more processor intensive
special features of the galaxy s3 pop up
play this is a 1280 by 720 WMV file from
nasa.gov called
dynamic earth let's see if we can play
that on each here and will enable pop up
play on each
and we can kind of drag that around in
there we go missus this is good now
there would be sound playing on this
normally performance on each of these
devices is essentially unaltered with
pop up play active in the foreground
here not that you would be doing a lot
of intensive browsing or texting while
you're in pop up play mode but
theoretically you could do almost
anything on the device except maybe
watch another video which might be a fun
check but which we are not going to do
today now as we've mentioned before
these devices have very different
configurations as far as hardware goes
with the processor and the RAM so let's
run some benchmarks and see what we get
ok so let's hop on over to benchmarks
here the first benchmark test we're
gonna run is quadrant standard and we
will run them three to one with a full
benchmark boom okay so on quadrant on
the left here in the international
version we're looking at 53 85 I'll show
you that result right there pretty
similar to results the first time we ran
this down in New York City and on the
Sprint version on the right here we're
sitting at five zero five nine okay so
that's quadrant let's go ahead and run
smart bench okay so the sprint version
finished very quickly compared to the
International Version let's see what
these scores are all about okay you can
see we'll do international version first
sitting at God that's really really
difficult to read thirty-nine sixteen
and sixteen twelve is the stock rom
score yes that is 39 16 I'm a sprint
version here we're sitting at 28 22 just
confirm that and one of the big reasons
to buy a top-of-the-line fancy spec
loaded smartphone these days is for
gaming so let's run a game and see how
they compare so I like flight simulator
games on Android and the graphically
intense flight simulator I chose for
this one was explains let's load it one
two three boom once again International
on the Left sprint version on the right
spin version as the splash screen up
first but I'm thinking that the
international version is going to be
ready to play first
this is a landscape game yes there we go
past the title screen Oh No
Wow all right even though the sequence
was out of order on these guys they
loaded effectively identically let's
play with the international one first
make sure the volumes up so we get some
great jet noise throttle and the flaps
down to half whoa whoa no no reason to
go off the runway already performance is
buttery smooth on the control interfaces
themselves let's get some camera angles
here did not mean to use the map stay in
the cockpit please running out a runway
here so I'm hoping I'll be able to take
off soon
and there's our liftoff the camera angle
here there we go
performance very very very smooth even
if you are an amateur pilot like me I
haven't used I explain a whole lot and
see if I can get back into the cockpit
here before I end up doing something
excellent graphic performance index
plane and Oh No flaming death alright so
that's how we do internationally let's
go ahead and take off on the Sprint
version here max throttle sure our
volume is up there we go bring the flaps
down same basic idea
no difference so far of any kind that I
can tell rudder controls here good do a
view change there let's see if we can
rotate and we can good again here's our
other view once again buttery smooth
absolutely no discernible difference
between the quad core and the dual core
devices to my eye and I have played this
once or twice ah flaming death I have
played this once or twice on both
devices for longer periods and they both
do perform right about on par right in
line with what we've been seeing pretty
much this whole time the devices are
very very close to one another as far as
performance goes finally we want to do a
speed test now we're on the same network
here so we won't run the test at the
same time so it's not too corrupt these
results these should be similar does
this really mean anything
probably not but this is one of our key
keyer videos where we go into extreme
details so if these are valuable to you
I want to include them good speed test
complete there we'll begin it on this
one in the meantime here are my internet
speeds in Boston if any of you are
interested not too shabby
on this Wi-Fi network and here it is on
this other device so 36 down 33 down on
the Sprint device upload is 17 up here
upload as 19 up here so comparable
results no big surprise because it is
the same network so there are
significant differences between these
two models under the hood but as we've
seen today there's really very little
difference in real world use between
these two phones unless you're doing
some very processor intensive stuff this
has been Michael with pocketnow.com give
us a thumbs up if you liked the video if
you've got something to say leave a
comment on the post at pocket
Oh calm if you want to follow us on
Twitter you can do that at pocket now -
eats I'm also on Twitter at captain -
phones that's captain the number to
phones and stay tuned we've got a lot
more coverage on the galaxy s3 and it's
international and US variants coming
down the pipe in the next few days and
weeks till then once again I'm Michael
it's pocketnow.com thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
