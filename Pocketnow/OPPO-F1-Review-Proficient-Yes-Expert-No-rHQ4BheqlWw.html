expert so oppa says but does the f1 cut
certain corners to make it so does it
even live up to its own moniker well
that's what we're here to find out i'm
jules wong and this is PocketNow a metal
backplate
polycarbonate shell in 2016 s
middle-of-the-road price range the
competition has brought their all-metal
jackets to play and Oppo didn't but we
think it got away with something here in
addition to Cost Reduction it also lent
enough probable metal to keep that cool
feel on contact and a small sense of
luxury but it's not much luxury as we
take a closer look at the back we find
speakers and only one led to serve as a
camera flash flip the phone over and you
have capacitive keys that don't have
light-up icons and a 5 inch 720p pad
warm LCD as you can probably tell we had
a hard time shooting the display while
outside and that's thanks to the panel's
limited brightness range more of a syn
to us than below resolution is the f1
has dual sim capabilities but there is a
slot that has a micro SD card space to
expand that native 16 gigabytes of
storage by up to 128 gigabytes even
better news on the insides though the
snapdragon 616 promises very consistent
power and with the 3 gigabytes of RAM
this phone shouldn't really stutter
well it doesn't tiny ways but we'll get
onto that on paper the f1 is a modest
but substantial phone modest is not the
software though color OS is a tangley
matter exhibit a lock screen you can
offer it to show a magazine of sorts
constantly rotated images of pretty
things
every time you unlock your phone like
beautiful woman oh sure is a man's world
huh beyond that the typical Chinese
Android traits are here mimicking the
layout of iOS having a theme store
screen gestures that apparently work
only one time out of three animations
some superfluous things here and there
of course the notification shade is at
least a decent one it even adjusts its
layout for landscape mode the nastier
side of color OS art of the box shows us
how much of a control freak it is
seriously the security center nudges you
to send unwanted memory beat stored or
active up into space Major Tom it
aggressively manages your power usage
with a smart mode that kicks in at
around
said what's up Kirk's I'm about is that
you can't edit any of the behaviors that
set to do even though it seems to invite
you to do so it even tells you every so
often to take a break and eat hey I know
what I'm doing with my time oboe and it
doesn't help that you treat every
calendar event like it's an alarm
OCD much now viewing the larger software
picture we hope that oboe is making
progress with the spectrum UI project in
the meantime color OS presented by
default does it color us and impressed
camera wise we are pretty happy fourth
the f one's worth 13 megapixels is fine
for the rear and F 2.2 aperture is okay
but the rest of the work goes to the
functionality packed software with
features like 50 megapixel snapshots
through compositing raw output manual
focus and just a whole bunch of nifty
features the pro mode is a bit of a joke
though is the fastest shutter speed you
can manually set to is a quarter of a
second focus was a tad tricky to get
sometimes but we're pretty happy with
the results
decent color balance and great detail in
bright conditions as is the standard for
most cameras contrast II situations gave
some trouble to the f1 with far-off
details of washing mud and noise and
blown out sky to lower light still and
well so much for dynamic range on the
selfie side the 8 megapixel camera with
a relatively large sensor does a decent
job the beautiful lens is as
overpowering as ever but beyond that
fluff it's certainly good on the detail
side and even in the dark where yeah
that's pretty bad overall but it'd be a
few shades darker on similar font is it
a selfie expert at 229 euros well we'll
go as far to say that it's right among
the better selfie takers even in the
upper price ranges but expert is a
little too boastful
our performance notes will be short Opel
doesn't have an American version of the
phone app leaving our unit stuck on edge
for most of our test period we opted to
carry around a hot spot to use the phone
while benchmarking scores showed good
potential
we found that moving around the UI and
covered some occasional dinners just
from how burdensome it is casual gaming
is fine more intensive games come pretty
smoothly with the very rare frame drop
battery wise we couldn't really get an
accurate picture the day we had our
t-mobile SIM minutes the f1 lasted us
nine hours all told while sticking
strictly to Wi-Fi we've been able to go
into the next day with 40% battery
there's no VOC rapid charging as there
is on other Apple phones and how pushy
color OS is about saving battery it
doesn't give any duration info the best
estimate we can fathom based on these
percentages is about three and a half
hours of screen on time its 229 year
rows 20 more than what the honor 5x goes
for but in some key specs the f1 does
outsmart its Huawei competition and in
spite of the very blow D sometimes
dysfunctional software the hardware
carries through it admirably and there
are good cameras packed in for the cash
well we don't have reason to wait for an
update to marshmallow
given off of software track record there
is hope that it may come in form of a
project spectrum ROM now if you're
willing to forgive a pretty bad display
by this year standards Oppo definitely
has a great value proposition in the f1
while its main selling point the cameras
are fine they're just fine ahead of the
pack but only by a stone's throw and you
could say the same about the rest of the
innards of this thing if that arcs the
future preferring you the f1 should
probably be out with there running if
it's not well put a little work into it
and this device should treat you well it
certainly has for me
thanks for tuning in if you like this
video enough and are on YouTube well
hopefully you have hit that subscribe
button as well as that thumbs up to and
to our vessel viewer as well thanks for
checking us out of course there's more
to come at pocketnow.com in all the
social sites as well my name is Jules
Wong at point jewels on Twitter for all
of us here there's more coming your way
