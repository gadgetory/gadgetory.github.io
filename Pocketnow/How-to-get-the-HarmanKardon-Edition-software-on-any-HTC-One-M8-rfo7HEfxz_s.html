you may be jealous of the Harman Kardon
version which is exclusive to sprint but
maybe you shouldn't be I'm Taylor Martin
this is PocketNow
and this is how to get the advantage of
the Harman Kardon software on your very
own One m8 last week our own michael
fisher made a quick hands-on video with
the sprint exclusive Harman Kardon
version of the HTC One m8 it comes with
a black paint job with champagne trim a
nice set of Harman Kardon earbuds and of
course some special audio software that
isn't readily available to just anyone a
mate the software comes with two modes
clarify which restores the quality of
compressed audio and live stage which
adds dimension anymore lifelike sound to
headphone listening fortunately it
didn't take long for the development
community to jump all over the Harman
Kardon software and make it available to
almost everyone m8 xda-developers member
bad news posted them on just a few days
ago and I'm going to show you how to get
the benefits of the Harman Kardon
software on your very own m8 proceed at
your own risk
first some prerequisites this mod will
not work on the Google Play edition One
m8
it requires since so if you have the
Google Play m8 you will need to install
since 6 on your phone before applying
this mod you will also need 80 be up and
running on your machine and this mod
should work just as well with Windows
Linux or Mac you will also need root
access on your One m8 and there are
several ways to accomplish this I chose
the more official root i unlock my
bootloader through the HTC dev web
unlock tool simply go to HTC dev calm
and follow the detailed instructions
just note that this method will factory
reset your device and Voyageur warranty
also know there are other reversible
methods of unlocking your bootloader
from there I chose the TWRP custom
recovery for the m8 and flashed it
through fastboot plug your m8 into your
computer and use the terminal command
fastboot flash recovery and the file
name of the recovery image this mod
doesn't necessarily require s off
however the process will be much
smoother with s off unfortunately the
only existing s off method for the One
m8 firewater by XD a member be UPS is
hit or miss with the t-mobile model
after several hours of tinkering and
trying workarounds I threw in the
how my one m8 is still s on but I still
managed to apply this mod with very
little trouble if you're using a u.s.
model you will likely not be running the
latest version of software which is the
biggest hurdle it doesn't come with the
proper code to display the Harman Kardon
submenu in the Settings app this can be
solved one of two ways either tinkering
with a settings apk such as ripping one
from newer version of software or
manually flashing newer software either
official or a custom ROM we opted for
the latter option and found a completely
stock rom to flash the twerp linked in
the description if you go with this
option you will need to reboot into
recovery perform a backup wipe the
system in the cache and flash the ROM
zip of your choice
I then flashed the superuser zip file
through TWRP to obtain root access once
that completes reboot the device and go
through the initial device setup once
that's done reboot back into recovery
and flash the HK enables it from bad
news is Harman Kardon conversion thread
on XDA when you reboot the device the
Harman Kardon setting should appear in
the settings application this will
disable or remove boomsound settings to
get boomsound back and remove the Harman
Kardon software simply reboot back into
recovery flash the HK disabled zip from
the same thread and reboot once more
everything should be restored to normal
and of course if all else fails you can
always restore your backup
