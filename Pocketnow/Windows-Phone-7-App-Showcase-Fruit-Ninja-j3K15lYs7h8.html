calm and we're gonna look at a new game
for Windows Phone 7 that was launched a
little bit before Christmas but it went
straight to the top of the charts and
the Windows Phone 7 lack a place it's
called fruit ninja so let's check it out
probably heard of fruit ninja before
it's available on other mobile platforms
here you see the launching time and here
it is as you can see it is xbox live
enable you got my avatar up there trying
to run down some more
and you got achievements leaderboards
check out leaderboards there we can see
other people's scores and achievements
and see which achievements I got in my
Xbox Live and let's try new games so you
got three different modes Zen mode no
bond from the lives 90 seconds Arcade
Mode and classic most classic mode is
just going to start off with pretty slow
and then gradually increase and
difficulty let's show you our cane mode
this is 50 seconds
I had a bomb I lose points hard to do
this while filming sorry for the
shakiness but basically you slice
through with a sword as a ninja and it's
a lot of fun so here we go let's get out
of there and there's also another
feature here called dojo so I can choose
different types of leaves and you can
unlock more of them and also choose
different types of backgrounds and
obviously can unlock some more of those
too
so that's about it for fruit ninja
really a lot of fun cool game you've
heard of it before and it's available in
the Windows Phone 7 marketplace for
three dollars hope you enjoyed this
video that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
