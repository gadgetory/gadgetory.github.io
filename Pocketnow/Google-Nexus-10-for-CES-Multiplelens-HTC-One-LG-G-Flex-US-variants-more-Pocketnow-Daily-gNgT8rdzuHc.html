according to some Samsung sources LG G
flex renders point to more carriers
getting into n HTC's future flagship
seems to be including some new camera
lenses I'm high netting that I and
probably one of the coolest things about
this week is how short it was this is
 out daily the Stars lay off with
some official news is I know some of you
are still in the market for the
microsoft surface pro 2 as it turns out
the company has just upgraded the
processor and the GPU as well and even
though these are minor upgrades it's
always best to have your hard work so
make sure you look out for that links in
the description for full details on the
specifics of this processor so that you
make an educated by before you do now ZD
is a company that's trying to make a big
splash of the United States and after
we've reviewed their ZT you'll be fine
it was a decent phone but the company is
planning a lot for CES they've already
made their list official we're getting a
SmartWatch with bluetooth and pedometer
capabilities which is interesting for
you know those people are out there for
working out then aside from that we've
also got a ZTE grand s2 with some
interesting specification aside from a
5.7 inch tablet too with a 720p display
which is not really that good but
anyways in the description for full
specifics will definitely be covering
this when we get to CES 2014 and for
those of you interested in the LG G flex
in the United States and not paying a
thousand dollars to get it unlocked well
we've already got the spring renders but
we've also got some new renders now for
t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T we still don't have
specifics on these because these are
probably just renders towards the
carriers for them to negotiate it's
probably not something that's final but
anyway CES 2014 could be the day so stay
tuned for that event now probably one of
the oddest rumors for CES 2014 is that
apparently google and samsung are
planning to launch the new nexus 10 and
the reason why this is odd it because we
never get any of these sort of events
from bubala trade shows they do their
own thing or they don't at all but
apparently this could be the news we
could be getting a new Nexus endin we've
been waiting for it for a long time so
that's who we get we were expecting a
sous tablet so let's see and finally for
the very hot news of the day we get more
details on the HTC m8 which would be the
successor to the m7 aka HTC one and
while we do get a four point nine inch
1080p display aside from the fact that
we are getting a fingerprint scanner
which is not
something we'll celebrate but even more
interesting apparently the company is
bringing interchangeable lenses to this
camera which was one of the biggest
ports we had when the original etc1 the
fact that we only had a 4 megapixel
camera so let's have that aside from
that interchangeable lens thing they
also bring us a bigger sensor but
anyways that leads us to the question of
the day would you be compelled to buy an
HTC One next year or whatever they're
gonna call this phone if they brought
interchangeable lenses in my face this
is one thing that I've wanted for the
longest of times but i would rather
something that is not so cumbersome you
know probably we have this case where
you can adapt these lenses and whenever
you need them you just pull them out and
swap them and it's something really
simple but leave us a comment down below
let's see what we get and friends you
know the drill if you want to get it as
earlier before this video's spill mushy
follow us on pocketnow.com it's a scrub
changing channel as well you'd also
follow me on twitter hiney underscore
iveta please give this video thumbs up
if you liked what you saw i am hey Mary
that I thank you very much for watching
we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
