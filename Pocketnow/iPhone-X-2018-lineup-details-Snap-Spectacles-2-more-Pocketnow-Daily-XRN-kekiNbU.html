simpler name for this year's iPhones
finally what was as officially announced
that we're getting a one plus six Marvel
Avengers edition sort of and we get new
snap spectacles that might end the best
forgotten if it's the first ones I'm
Jaime Rivera and I wish there was a day
where we covered a phone that didn't
include a notch but it sadly won't be
today
this is pocket out daily the official
news today have to do with snapchat and
the launch of a new pair of spectacles
definitely not a deal for the day
particularly because well they look
pretty much like the old spectacles
they're faster in the way they transfer
videos now they're capable of photos
their design a slimmer but the problem
is the design one that looks pretty much
the same there are no variances except
for colors and the second it's a hundred
and fifty dollars snapchat snap Inc what
are you guys thinking over there now
let's talk about the HTC you 12 or you
12 plus not exactly sure there are
certification documents right now of a
Verizon variant and this is huge I don't
know if you've noticed but it's taken
forever for HTC to find US carriers
again such an irony when back in the day
HTC was the company that would built the
US carrier variants of whatever phones
remember the touch pro2 I don't blame
you if you don't
but then again here it is HDC you 12
might come to Verizon similar specs to
the galaxy s 9 Plus let's see what we
get in the end then when as if
certification documents are in and means
we shouldn't wait that long now let's
talk about Samsung and the Galaxy S a
night and as 9 plus the company is
apparently predicting that it will sell
8 million units of its smartphone for
the month alone just to give you an idea
of how significant that is the iPhone 10
apparently has only sold 14 million
units wait for it in the whole quarter
yes in the whole quarter meaning Samsung
clearly is pushing this hard and this is
only the second quarter for the iPhone
usually it's not selling that bad by now
yet
so let's see how that evolves now let's
talk about oneplus as the company has
pretty much teased that we are getting a
one plus six Marvel Edition to be
launched at its event that we were
assuming will be on may 16th or 17th
according to the rumors and teasers
think about it is uh yeah we didn't get
to see the phone we just got a teaser
that we're getting a Marvel edition of
the phone so we still don't know what it
looks like but we're hoping it's just a
thought and finally the hottest news do
they have to do with the iPhones of this
year and the problem names that we're
getting as it we've got some trusted
sources that are claiming something
interesting I've been saying this as the
rumors began that the iPhone 10 this
year was going to be called iPhone 10
once again apparently the rumors are
that it seems that the 6.1 inch LCD
iPhone will just be called the new
iPhone and then in the case of the 5.8
variant with an OLED display it seems
that that one is going to be called the
iPhone 10 the new generation iPhone 10
and then the taller variant that's also
OLED is rumored to be called the iPhone
10 Plus apparently Apple wants to slim
down names and I love that because you
know it's just been kind of crazy lately
but in today's question let us know
would you like these names or do you
think that Apple should come up with
something smarter in my case I like the
idea but let's see what we get let us
leave us a comment down below we'd love
