galaxy s6 edge+
to those with huge hands or huge demands
these are some of the only smartphones
that matter in the high-end space and
each packs a wallop
from innovative interfaces to refined
cameras to everyday conveniences these
phones get you where you're going but
they take completely different paths to
get there which one fits your mitt
better I'm Michael Fisher with pocket
now let's find out for years
the Galaxy Note family was about as far
removed from the iPhone as you could get
Samsung used to tout versatility above
all bundling in removable batteries
expandable storage and all the fake
leather you could handle while Apple
stuck to its popular but predictable
formula of premium simplicity in a
petite package Apple changed up that
strategy last year with an inflated
iPhone aimed right at the heart of
Samsung's big screen loving audience and
Samsung's 2015 response is a galaxy note
with fewer features but a better build
and that goes double for the s6 edge+
what it all comes down to is that these
competitors have never been more similar
than they are this year but there's
still nothing alike the differences
become apparent as soon as you pick them
up with wider radius corners and a
smooth slab-sided aluminum build the
taller and wider iPhone 6s plus is also
a bit more awkward in the hand
the thicker note 5 has a glass back
which curves down to meet an aluminum
magnesium side rail the glass makes it
more prone to fingerprints but it's also
more ergonomic the edge Plus is a
strange inversion of the note 5s design
that's easily the most awkward of the
bunch
the Samsung phones also packed slimmer
bezels and to our I a more refined
industrial design
yes elements of that design were plainly
inspired by the iPhone but then again
you could make the argument that the
iPhone Plus was forced into existence by
large format smartphones which the note
line pioneered so let's put the kibosh
on the who copied who argument it just
doesn't
matter Samsung as usual has a decisive
edge when it comes to raw hardware and
boast worthy specs the note fives larger
display brings a higher pixel density
and it's custom software takes advantage
of that with a higher dpi setting that
lets it squeeze more information onto
the panel it's also a Super AMOLED
display
meaning it's blacks are truly pitch
black and it's screen has a wider range
of brightness settings compared to the
iPhone the note also has a bigger
battery that charges faster and charges
wirelessly and it also uses USB so if
need be you can get a replacement
charging cable more easily it's got a
heart rate sensor that can measure your
pulse and blood oxygen levels it's got
double the RAM of the iPhone and Samsung
pay might be the new kid on the block
but it works in more places than Apple
pay in the United States thanks to its
ability to mimic magnetic swipe card
readers all this is true of the edge as
well with the notable difference of the
curved display Apple's victories are
more humble perhaps but no less
significant to the kind of customers
that have made the iPhone such a success
while both of these phones pack
fingerprint scanners Apple's is
significantly faster and you can use it
across a wider range of functions like
making purchases from the App Store the
iPhone comes in 128 gig option while the
note 5 doesn't you can control the
iPhones notification status with the
flip of a switch while the note makes
you unlock it and fiddle with sliders
the iPhones taptic feedback engine makes
for a subtler vibrating alert than the
traditional buzz saw and passing an
iPhone to someone else to show them a
funny thing is a lot easier than doing
the same with a Samsung phone you know
what I'm talking about
capacitive keys bad times when it comes
to software the hits go back and forth
iOS 9 continues apple's tradition of
consistency at the expense of
customizability you always start at the
grid of icons on the springboard and
you're not allowed to do anything aside
from rearrange them and even that you do
on apple's terms widgets are tucked away
in the notification shade and back
buttons are ridiculously placed in the
top-left corner of most apps again in
the name of consistency and a
the expense of common sense by contrast
Samsung's custom build of Android
lollipop lets you do anything you want
up to an including rescanning the entire
OS to look the way you want it to or
accessing the file system Samsung's
solution to one-handed accessibility
makes just as much sense as Apple's
reach ability and Google now continues
to be a much smarter voice assistant
than Apple's Siri what's changed on each
side this year are the special interface
enhancements on the Samsung side those
include the edge display features of the
s6 edge+ and the new s-pen on the note 5
now while we really like the s6 edge+ on
the whole the extent of its special
features our app shortcuts and flashy
notifications so it will focus mainly on
the notes integrated stylus which is
much more significant because this is
the year the s-pen finally gets out of
its own way and starts getting useful
from the instant memo functionality to
the right on PDF software to the new
scroll capture screen cap mode the s-pen
is now a legitimate enhancement for more
than just artists and old-school stylus
lovers it's something the average person
could find useful and as a bonus the
s-pen is also the surrogate Mouse it's
always been adding hover scroll and
preview ability to the smartphone
experience but for the first time ever
in one of these comparisons Samsung no
longer has a monopoly on that ability
Apple's new 3d touch adds a third level
of interaction to the software
experience by letting you press harder
on the display to preview say a link and
then press a little harder than that to
jump right into it it's also useful as a
fast shortcut for home screen actions
that jump you directly to specific app
functions and if the first time you use
it to preview an email or a text message
you feel like a wizard obviously it
doesn't bring as much functionality as
Samsung's s-pen but it's still a very
significant improvement to the iPhone
experience maybe the most significant
one in years
when it comes to photos these phones are
damn near neck and neck at least when it
comes to the end result yes the note 5
has higher resolution but when you put
the photos side by side more often than
not it's a draw when you get to really
challenging stuff like low-light these
go blow-for-blow
sometimes the iPhone comes out on top
and sometimes the Samsung does on
average the note tends to bring in more
light while the iPhone tends to provide
better color reproduction but that's not
consistent where Samsung manages to pull
ahead surprisingly is in the details
Samsung wins the selfie camera battle
hands-down apples use of the display as
a front firing flash is clever but its
refusal to use a wide-angle lens means
you can't fit as much into the shot as
you can on the note Samsung's HDR mode
is also better than Apple's brightening
the shadows while retaining more color
and Samsung's viewfinder launches crazy
fast with a double click of the HOME key
while Apple's quick launch shortcut is
rendered all but useless thanks to its
superfast fingerprint sensor Apple does
have live photos where Samsung does not
but then again Samsung has a lot more
shooting modes including a full suite of
manual controls if you want to use them
we'll have more samples in our full
iPhone 6s Plus review but taken together
I think Samsung wins this particular
camera battle other corners of the
performance experience again flip back
and forth iOS has for a long time been
good at making the most of a skimpy
battery and that holds true here too we
managed one and a half days out of the
iPhone 6s plus battery before it needed
a charge but while the note absolutely
needed a top-up every night there's no
measurable difference in software
performance iOS feels a little slower
than Samsung's build of Android but
that's because of animations not because
of lag and differences in speaker output
are minor at best its design and intent
not performance where these phones
differ the most
you've heard it before folks either way
you go here you're getting a great
smartphone if lots of your friends and
family have the iPhone and you want to
try life inside that world you're bound
to be impressed as confining as it can
be and as cartoony as it looks from some
angles the iPhone is not a toy it's a
stable and well-designed platform
supported by the most robust app store
there is you'll almost never feel out of
the club with an iPhone on the other
hand the Samsung lineup of 2015 is
unlike anything that's come from the
company before particularly as it
concerns the Galaxy Note it's no longer
a collection of disjointed elements in a
clumsy casing targeted at tech heads
it's a beautifully presented bundle of
features open to customization by those
who feel the need and tailored for
mainstream appreciation by those who
don't and as the wireless charging pads
at your local Starbucks can attest the
mainstream is definitely taking notice
it's always been the case that you can
do more with a Samsung flagship than an
iPhone but 2015 just might be the year
that a majority of people will actually
want to for me Samsung takes the day
I'll be excited to hear what you think
