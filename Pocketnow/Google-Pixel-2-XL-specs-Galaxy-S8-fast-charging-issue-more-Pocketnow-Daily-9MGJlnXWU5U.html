show not much innovation in specs new
Samsung Galaxy s8 information shows us
that fast charging doesn't always work
we get some new teasers of what to
expect for the HTC u 11 I'm high metal
Ravana and even though the new Thor
movie is not out the trailer was awesome
I just have to get the t-shirt
this is pocket out daily the official
news today begin with deals if you want
the brand new Galaxy s8 or the LG G 6
both smartphones that I highly recommend
we actually had a comparison go live
yesterday
well t-mobile has currently got the best
deal buy one get one free and it's just
for a limited time so you can learn one
of the descriptions now something that's
not going to be a deal at all is the
brand-new Mont Blanc summit those of you
that don't want to spend so much money
on a tag heuer that's 1500 bucks you get
them on black for eight hundred and
twenty nine dollars it is a lot of money
sure you're getting the latest and
greatest specifications the latest
version of Android wear but it's still a
gadget that will not last you as much in
a typical Mont Blanc so oh well let's
spotlight over to HCC the company
continues to tease what to expect to
come very soon at their event I cannot
wait to see what the U 11 is like and we
now see a teaser that involves 360 we're
not sure if it's 360 degree video that
the phone might bring native capability
or that it's 360 degree audio which we
pretty much already had on the new ultra
to a certain degree if I remember with
you sonic but anyways leave us a comment
let us know what you think it is now
let's talk about the Samsung Galaxy s8
for a bits particularly when it comes to
its capability to recharge quickly the
company doesn't really say if it's quick
charge 3.0 or not because some variants
are Exynos and we know that that's a
Qualcomm feature but then again some
publications took the time to actually
check how fast the phone charges and it
turns out that it doesn't charge at all
fast when you're using the phone meaning
yeah it seems that Samsung is trying to
play it safe after the whole note 7
thing it makes sense but still just for
you to know Samsung didn't say it and
apparently that's a new
non-feature and finally for the very hot
news today let's talk about the feature
Google pixel XL being dubbed the Timon I
think that is right I think I butchered
the name but anyways those of you that
we're wondering if Google was going to
push the boundaries of certifications
with a new processor like it did with a
Snapdragon 820 one it turns out that
that's not going to be the case on
benchmarks of emerge and apparently it's
got the Snapdragon 835 four gigs of RAM
you would have thought you know at least
six gigs of ram at least don't make it
so easy for the 1+5 when it comes to
specs but anyways it leads me to the
question of the day is this a
deal-breaker for you the fact that the
Google pixel will launch later this year
probably in the fall and still keep
specifications that are for flagships in
the spring in my case it's not a
deal-breaker Google does a really good
job with its software and everything in
its optimization the problem is that
whole concept that this is the vanguard
google pixel phone and you're not really
getting the Vanguard specifications or
it could just be that Qualcomm is not
really planning anything in the pipeline
