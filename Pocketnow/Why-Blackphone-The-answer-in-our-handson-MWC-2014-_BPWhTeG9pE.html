pocketnow.com Tony behind the camera
we're here at MWC 2014 and one of the
biggest questions that a lot of you
asked as a couple of weeks ago was what
is blackphone exactly what is the
purpose behind the black phone and I'm
going to try to answer that right now so
the black phone on its own is an Android
4.4 smartphone with a specific private
OS that will bring you different
encryption services but this is actually
a joint venture this phone is made by
geek phone which is a Spanish company
but it's partnered with a company from
the United States called silent circle
that those of you in enterprise must
know and this is actually a Swiss joint
Verte venture now I sadly can't turn on
the phone because it's currently on
pre-production software but the phone is
on sale today for $629 and here's a deal
why would you buy a black phone well
silent circle services will cost you
$1500 on their own if you wanted to bar
them on a separate phone than if you
bought them on a black phone for 629
dollars so you get encrypted messaging
encrypted operating system and you have
additional layers that you cannot
confirm to get from any other phones so
just to clarify these $1500 from silent
circle is actually the whole suite of
different services like two-way
conferencing and other services that are
included again links are going to be in
the description for details but if you
want to ask your question why black
phone and not blackberry well honestly
the BlackBerry operating system is
something that a lot of people are
already questioning because of all the
issues and the outages that have
happened and obviously the fact that
blackberry is an operating system is not
really as popular and we have Android
4.4 here with an additional layer so
there is a benefit for you to have a
black phone you're not stuck to an
operating system that is not really
giving you the services that you're
looking for in this day and age so yeah
salad circus services are multi platform
meaning even people from iOS can
download these from the App Store but
again if you want to get exactly what
the black phone provides and we will
provide you links in the description for
full details on what you're getting you
really have to pay almost three times
the amount that you would have to pay to
buy this phone so there is a purpose if
you are security mind that if you want
guarantees that your text messages are
secure that your operating system and
secure that your phone is pretty much
non hackable silent circle services are
actually state-of-the-art and it's been
verified for quite a long time so it
depends on you it really depends on your
service is one of the coolest things
about buying this phone is after you pay
the six hundred twenty nine dollars you
actually get three accounts from silent
circle so you can encrypt this phone
which will cost you that and then you
can have your family members to people
within your family that will have the
benefits of silent circle and they don't
necessarily have to have a black phone
to communicate with you securely so I
got a does depend on you we will have
more information for you when we get
this phone for review the next couple of
weeks I am I'm going to be bed up with
Barca now calm Tony behind the camera is
it worth to buy a black phone and after
all the NSA things I'll tell you
something it really is and for the price
tag for the amount that'll cost you buy
any other phone you don't have any
guarantees there and they're
guaranteeing this here so let's see what
we get when we get the review unit to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
