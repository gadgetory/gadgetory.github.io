photographs the first Jolla selfish
smartphone sees an announcement today an
AT&amp;amp;T commits to being nicer about video
chat capabilities over cellular I'm hi
meri beta and if you do have a problem
with Monday's and trust me I can tell
you stories this is pocket now daily
we've finally gotten some photographs of
the samsung galaxy s4 active and no it's
not a rubbery brick like many people
were expecting in it's not also
identical to the galaxy s4 the back is
different the front buttons are actually
a little different it seems that to
comply with the waterproof standards but
aside from that you are getting a minor
downgrade it seems that you will be
getting the same processor the same
everything except for the camera instead
of 13.1 megapixels you're getting an 8
megapixel sensor on this phone and the
galaxy s3 camera wasn't that bad so stay
tuned as more leaks and rumors come up
and I'm going to say this just like
stephen chang wrote it on the post AT&amp;amp;T
commits to stop being a massive jerk
about video chats over cellular nice one
Steven the point being is the company
has just come on record the state that
they know that customers aren't happy
about the fact that when facetime over
4g came over well nobody could use it
except for those that had shared data
plans and apparently now the same
problem is happening with hangouts on
google so point being is the company is
committing to changing things by the end
of this year what do you think that it
was going to happen right now what
they're expecting is for you to actually
forget it in by the time end of the year
comes over they're not going to do
anything that's the way it works now
let's talk about windows 8 we know the
company is working on shrinking the form
factor of their desktop operating system
into smaller tablets but we were waiting
for that to happen by the end of this
year or whenever Windows 8.1 was
launched but we now have some leaked
photographs of an apparently already
official acer iconia w3 tablet
specifications down below this actually
runs a full-fledged version of windows 8
on an eight point one inch display so
it's kind of interesting we sure they
don't know what it's going to air on
this side of the planet but we'll keep
you posted kind of interesting would you
actually want a smaller version of
Windows now let's move over to Android
we didn't get a new version of Android
at Google i/o but we have seen a ton of
teasers in just about every
presentation that they showed out there
mentioning either the word key lime pie
is showing an Android you know the robot
being drawn eating a key lime pie all
over it does seem that we will be
getting a newer version of Android be a
key lime pie not necessarily 4.3 jelly
bean or it could be that 4.3 is key lime
pie actually but stay tuned for the
rumors as we most likely will be seeing
something after apple's WWDC and finally
for the interesting news of the day
remember Jolla from mwc know that
company from mex nokia employees after
the middle project and simeon projects
have died at nokia they launched this
company and their operating system
called selfish well they not only
launched sailfish they actually launched
their first Jolla smartphone and while
they announced it it's going to be
available by the fall but this phone
aside from the interesting
specifications has a very interesting
concept or smartphones unnecessarily and
software software is beautiful it's kind
of unique very interesting in the user
interface but aside from that the
interface actually depends on the back
cover of the phone meaning you can swap
that back cover and add another back
cover that includes a bigger flash or a
different lens for the camera or you can
even include probably even a keyboard in
the future it's kind of interesting the
concept imagine the idea of being able
to expand your device like you could win
the past with pocket pcs you remember
the compact I packs the way they used to
work with the sleeves that concept was
genius and I really don't know why I
died but anyways that leads you to the
question of the day let me think about
it you've got android you've got I OS
and then you've also got windows phone
and blackberry do you really believe or
do you really consider Jolla to have an
offering that's interesting to you in my
particular case I'll be honest with you
know the seal from Jolla made an
interesting point he said that the
current operating systems that are
ruling or five years old and yes they
are five years old and the other
operating systems haven't really taken
off so I am really interested in
sailfish I am really interested in this
expandable concept for smartphone where
om's and you know other collaborators
can bring different sleeves or sorry
back covers for this phone it's really
interesting and I would love a
smartphone that I could expand so leave
us a comment down below what do you
think of course it's always for an
earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone the topology
fall was unpacking outcome
scrap trying to channel you can also
follow me on twitter time underscore
Rivera visit this video thumbs up if you
liked what you saw I am hanging there a
better thank you very much for watching
we will see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
