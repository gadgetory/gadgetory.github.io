should expect the media powerhouse with
the Galaxy Note 8 China is the first
country to see HTC efforts in stand
alone vive headset and Samsung continues
to hit a homerun with its quarter
results in the galaxy s 8 I'm hi meadow
Iveta
and yes believe it or not we are trying
to get this video up every day at 9 p.m.
Eastern this is out daily the
official news today begin with deals I
think I am going to start calling
Verizon to five dollar-a-month company
for those of you in the market for a
Moto Z to play which is one of the
phones that I highly recommend this is
actually currently available for $5 a
month and Verizon two-year contract
obviously there is a catch you can learn
boiling the link in the description and
if you are not a fan of YouTube Bret or
Google Play Music it seems that Google
executives are not fans either up to the
point where we have a Google executive
today claiming that both services are
going to merge there is going to be a
new service coming soon there would no
dates provided but yet these two are
going to merge let's see what we get
from that hopefully at the same price
tag
ever since Google i/o we have seen
companies tease their efforts in
standalone VR but the things you hadn't
really seen anything concrete as part of
the daydream project as it turns out HTC
has just announced its new standalone
vive VR headset it's powered by a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor the
only question is exactly when are we
going to get it outside of China because
apparently this is only going to be a
China product or at least now stay tuned
we'll keep it close as we learn more I
was going to spotlight over the Samsung
we have quarter results information and
the company continues to break records
55 billion dollars in sales a 42 percent
growth and profits when you compare the
company's results last year and the most
important part is that yes definitely
some of this growth is attributed for
the Galaxy s8 but even the company
claims that most of this growth comes
from the sales of chips and OLED
displays so yeah it still has a lot to
go when it comes to sales of smartphones
and still the company is
breaking records again and finally the
very hot moves that they have to do with
the future galaxy note we're going to
dub it Galaxy Note 8 the company
executives after the quarter results
then claim that we should expect a media
powerhouse with the Galaxy Note 8
apparently it is going to be focused
mostly on media consumption and this is
rather interesting mainly because well
we're actually getting a smaller battery
than the galaxy s 8 plus obviously to
fit the s-pen and usually the note has
always been a phone for productivity
even though most of us have always
claimed that the last thing you really
do with a smart phone this big is be
productive with it so anyways it leads
me to the questions that they do you
think that this possible shift of
Samsung into more of a media powerhouse
what the Galaxy Note 8 is a good move
because in my case I think that the
company should have done that years ago
instead of focusing on making this a
business phone but leave us a comment
