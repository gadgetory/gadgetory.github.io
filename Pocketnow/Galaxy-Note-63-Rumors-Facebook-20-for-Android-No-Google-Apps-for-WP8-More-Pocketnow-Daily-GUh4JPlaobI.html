inch display gets rumored Facebook to
point o improves the experience on
Android and Google isn't building any
Windows Phone apps I'm high metal iveta
unclear why Google is so harsh to summon
nice to others and this is poking out
daily just when we thought that
Samsung's January eighth event that SI
es las vegas was going to be all about
the galaxy s4 well rumors have it the
samsung is not really ready to build the
indestructible display of the galaxy s4
or a galaxy note 7 inch display that we
thought about also and apparently
they're building a new 6.3 inch display
device and it just affects you to wonder
if this is going to be a phone or a
tablet or if this is just going to be
another phablet you're going to look
funny with so stay tuned for the rumors
because this is really going to get
interesting Facebook has just launched a
long overdue upgrade to their Android
application that they brought to iOS
months ago and the cool thing is that it
now runs on native code as opposed to
how it ran before apparently it's
supposed to be faster but I've been
testing it for the last couple of
minutes and honestly it doesn't seem to
be any better but just cut them some
slack they're trying to do something
make sure you upgrade the application
it's obviously free and if you remember
the yotaphone device that we talked
about months ago that sports two screens
being an e-ink display at the back well
apparently the phone is now a reality
it's late at the ship by mid-2013 and
even though it's got looks that only a
mother could love the form factor
actually brings some compelling specs
for today's standards not sure what will
happen next year so stay tuned for
probably CES 2013 we could probably see
the phone and yes the rumors were true
just a couple of hours after we
published pocket out daily yesterday
google gave a nice pad in the back to
Apple in their thermal nuclear war and
gave them google maps for iOS now the
coolest thing is that well it's actually
much better than what we get an android
at least when it comes to the UI looks
much better it looks much cleaner so
make sure you watch Brandon's video on
all the tips and tricks that you can do
with google maps on iOS it doesn't work
on the iPad just yet but so far the
application is really cool so make sure
you download it before somebody changes
their mind and finally for the harsh
news of the day
after Google showed the world how nice
they can be to Apple with maps on iOS
they also showed how harsh they can beat
a Microsoft their product management
director just came on record to state
that they're not building any windows
phone applications because well when
those phone doesn't sell that well
according to him so that leads you to
the question of the day what do you
think about Google than their services
after they pretty much ditch microsoft
and windows phone and please show google
that you're not just a handful of
Windows Phone users leave your rents in
the comments down below and if you want
an earlier scoop of everything that's
happening in the smartphone and tablet
world make sure you follow was on
pocketnow.com please give this video a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw I'm
hi Matt iveta thanks for watching and
stay tuned tomorrow as we go through
some nice Android 4.1 jellybean upgrades</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
