samsung galaxy note 2 copycat I'm Taylor
Martin this is PocketNow and this is the
lg optimus G pro versus a samsung galaxy
note 2 when Samsung unveiled the 5.3
inch galaxy note in 2011
if you imagined it would ever blossom to
a thriving popular brand there was a
time when 4.3 inch smartphones were
considered too large so it was hard to
see how a 5.3 inch phone would be
necessary or wanted yet the Galaxy Note
was a surprising success for Samsung and
one year later it introduced the galaxy
note 2 but not before other companies
jumped on the smartphone tablet hybrid
bandwagon LG was among the first to
recognize Samsung's success in the
blossoming market and introduced some
so-called phablets of its own the
optimists view the optimist view - and
now the Optimus G pro
from day one many have considered the
Optimus G pro to be a galaxy note2
look-alike almost a carbon copy although
the two devices have their differences
in hardware design and even feel it's
impossible to deny where LG got its
inspiration for the Optimus G pro it's
like they thought oh let's use that
design but slightly tweak it and stuff
better specifications inside both the
galaxy note 2 and the Optimus G pro
feature chassis is made almost entirely
of plastic the Galaxy Note 2
incorporates a more smooth rounded
design while the Optimus G pros edges
are sharper both are equipped with 5.5
inch displays on the front paired with a
single physical home button beneath
flanking the home buttons are capacitive
buttons for menu and back but note that
the order is different on each the
galaxy note 2 sports hits back button on
the right and the Menu button on the
left the Optimus G pro has a back button
on the left and menu to the right also
the Optimus G pros home button doubles
as a notification light which is nice
but the tactility of the button feels
very cheap almost like a holo toy versus
a silent smooth click of the brush
button on a note 2 there are
similarities all around the edges such
as button import placement power button
on the upper portion of the right edge
volume rocker on the left headphone jack
on the top left corner and microUSB
bottom center the optimus G pro does
have an additional button though the Q
button for a user to find shortcut at
172 grams the Optimus G pro is
noticeably lighter than the 183 grams
galaxy note 2 and as surprising as it
may be the Optimus G pro feels less
substantial and more flimsy cheaper than
the note 2 both are nine point four
millimeters thick yet the note 2 feels
thinner thanks to the tapered edges that
said the optimus G pro is physically
narrower than the note 2 by a noticeable
four point four millimeters LG cut all
the unnecessary bezel from around the
sides of the display on the G protein
features roughly double the bezel on
each side
although the Galaxy Note 2 feels more
sturdy and substantial if you can
overlook how lightweight and cheap it
feels the optimus G pro certain has the
upper hand in hardware and design once
you take a look inside the differences
between the two extra-large smartphones
become quite clear the 5.5 inch display
on the Galaxy Note 2 is a
720p HD Super AMOLED panel at roughly
267 pixels per inch the optimus G pro
features a 5.5 inch 1080p true Full HD
IPS plus display at 401 pixels per inch
and the difference is quite apparent the
saturation and contrast of the AMOLED
panel are definitely far greater than
the LCD on the optimus G pro both offer
great viewing angles and brightness but
the Optimus G pro wins by landslide and
color reproduction and clarity other
specifications for the galaxy note 2
include 16 32 or 64 gigabytes of
built-in storage a micro SD card slot a
1.6 gigahertz quad core Exynos chip set
and a megapixel camera 2 gigabytes of
RAM and a 3100 million of our battery
the Optimus G pro has 32 gigabytes of
built-in storage a micro SD card slot
for expansion 1.7 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 600 chip 2 gigabytes of RAM
13 megapixel camera and 8:31 40 million
of our battery
both come with your typical host of
connections Bluetooth 4.0 NFC Wi-Fi
b/g/n etc and both come with HSPA+
connectivity though the note 2 supports
far more bands and both offer LTE
connectivity but our galaxy note 2 is
the global variant which lacks LTE
support
at first glance the software on the
optimus G pro in the Galaxy Note 2 look
very similar
LG's custom interface mimics the more
popular TouchWiz nature UX by taking
some design cues from nature and
including various nature wallpapers and
a water droplet lockscreen animation
LG also included miniature q slide apps
for videos TV internet memo and q voice
not unlike pop-up browser popup video or
s note on the galaxy note 2 in the wall
type tasking field the galaxy note 2 has
a major advantage multi window and s-pen
not only can you open s know atop any
application using the S pin you could
technically have three or four
applications open at once using multi
window pop-up browser and s note sure
it's a little ridiculous but it's there
for the taking but the more you use LG's
interface the more it becomes clear how
much more in depth and heavily-laden
LG's customizations truly are the
Settings app for example is tabbed and
hardly looks anything like the stock
Settings app also the Optimus G pro
comes with a ton of various applications
pre-installed 78 to be exact
those vary from the usual apps like
Google+ YouTube or the camera to LG's
own apps like smart wallet cue
translator cue shopping smart touch and
many many more the notification shade is
another area where the Galaxy Note 2 and
Optimus G pro have a lot in common
along the top are numerous settings
toggles for Wi-Fi GPS or airplane mode
it also has a slider for display
brightness but the Optimus G pro also
has room for the qslide apps performance
is an area neither of these devices
struggle in the Optimus G pro Snapdragon
600 give it a little more muscle for
synthetic benchmarks using the antutu
for example the Optimus G pro scored an
impressive 1995 - the Galaxy Note 2 16 -
41 and using the quadrant standard test
the Optimus G pro scored a staggering
1207 6 while the Galaxy Note 2 scored a
more average 6814 lastly in the
SunSpider JavaScript test the Optimus G
pro took the cake once again with a
score of 950 six point nine milliseconds
- the Galaxy Note 2's 1060 milliseconds
but in day-to-day performance both of
these devices operate on a very high
level showing little to no signs of lag
or stuttering when switching between
applique
or running multiple applications allow
pop-up browser qslide apps or multi
window we haven't had the optimus G pro
long enough to comment fairly on battery
life but the Galaxy Note 2 on most days
lasts for an entire day of moderate to
heavy usage seldom requiring an
additional charge to get through the day
if the 30 140 million power battery
performs as well as the 3100 milliamp
hour battery in the galaxy note 2 there
should be nothing to worry about and for
those getting this Korean model it comes
with a spare battery and dock that
doubles as a battery charger in the box
lastly cameras both devices are on par
with one another in the software side of
things the interfaces are equally easy
to understand and use and both feature
almost the exact same modes such as
burst shot panorama best shot etc as far
as output goes the Galaxy Note 2 is
regarded as having one of the best eight
megapixel cameras on a smartphone ever
the Optimus G pro comes equipped with a
13 megapixel sensor side-by-side the
output of these two cameras is quite
different the Galaxy Note 2 tends to
produce warmer much more saturated
pictures while the Optimus G pro tends
to produce more washed out pictures
however its pictures offer more detail
in a higher output resolution actual
true-to-life colors lie somewhere in
between the super saturation of the
galaxy note 2 and the washed out
pictures on the Optimus G pro that said
both cameras are about on par in terms
of detail and quality and if you're
pleased with the performance of the
Galaxy Note 2's camera you should be
mostly pleased with the Optimus G pro's
camera it's not the best but it's
nowhere near the worst after all is said
and done if you're in the market for a
5.5 inch device both the Optimus G pro
and the Galaxy Note 2 are both
high-caliber devices the Optimus G pro
of course is newer and offers a slight
boost in performance and a much higher
resolution and higher density display
the Galaxy Note 2 nearing 7 months old
is beginning to show some age and it
could be months before we see another
successor on a device with a 5.5 inch
display 1080p matters which gives the
Optimus G pro some clout and LG has come
a long way with phablet oriented
software the Optimus G pro is finally a
nice entry from LG in the extra large
smartphone category and it gives the
Galaxy Note 2 a run for its money
that said the Galaxy Note
feels and operates like a more refined
product if you need the latest and
greatest the Optimus G pro will suit
your needs but if you want a device with
a little more polish despite its age go
with the Galaxy Note 2 that's all for
now
