pocket now calm and this is a comparison
between the iPhone 4 and the new HTC
Thunderbolt on Verizon let's get to it
how you want ok so a lot to talk about
here and we're gonna start off with
press the iPhone 4 with a new two-year
contract is $200 for the 16 gigabyte
version if you want the 32 gigabyte
version it's 300 the thunderbolts
actually a better value for 249 dollars
you get 32 gigabytes of storage which is
obviously fifty dollars cheaper than the
32 gig model on the iPhone 4 so better
value for the Thunderbolt in terms of
the data plan on the Thunderbolt you get
30 you have to pay $30 for unlimited
data and on the iPhone 4 you pay $25 for
2 gigabytes of data personally I rather
have the unlimited data for 5 dollars
more per month so we're also going to
give the points to the Thunderbolt here
in terms of the data plan now they both
have a similar scenario when you want to
tether they have the $20 add-on that
gives you about 2 gigabytes of data
transfer when you tether so sort of
equal in that respect although if you're
in a 4G area it's gonna be a lot better
to tether with the 4G Thunderbolt you're
going to get much faster speeds if
you're tethering your laptop or your
iPad or what-have-you
ok so let's talk about specs what is
inside of these phones now we'll talk
about screen to start off 4.3 inch
diagonal screen with 800 down by 480
across resolution the iPhone obviously
has a smaller 3.5 inch screen but with
much higher resolution 960 down by 640
across if you look at this in terms of
pixel density the iPhone 4 is at about
326 PPI whereas the Thunderbolt is at
about 217 PPI if you look at these
screen side-by-side which we're going to
do in a few minutes you'll notice that
the iPhone 4 has a crisper screen HTC is
probably on the verge of bumping their
screen resolution to qHD which will
bring it closer in line through the
pixel density found on the iPhone 4 but
right now you're going to get a better
picture it's going to be easier to read
ebooks on your iPhone
for compared to the Thunder book but
that isn't to say that the Thunder point
has a bad screen because the screen is
quite good on the Thunder book inside
the Thunderbolt we've got a 1 gigahertz
Qualcomm Snapdragon processor inside the
iPhone 4 we've got an a4 chip clocking
at around 800 megahertz to 1 gigahertz
we're gonna do some speed comparisons so
you can really see which one is faster
and day-to-day usage the iPhone 4 has
about 512 megabytes of RAM the
Thunderbolt 1 UPS the iPhone with 768
megabytes of RAM again whether this
matters in day-to-day operation we're
going to find out when we actually get
into the devices and move through some
webpages load up some YouTube videos and
do things like that now both of these
devices have front-facing video cameras
and they also have obviously rear
cameras the camera on the back of the
Thunderbolt is 8 megapixels with a dual
LD foot do dual LED flash say that 10
times fast and on the back of the iPhone
4 there's a 5 megapixel camera which
takes great pictures I've already seen
the samples of the Thunderbolt gotta say
that the iPhone 4 has better imaging
we're gonna turn on the front facing
cameras in a minute so you can tell if
the front facing camera is better on the
iPhone 4 or the Thunderbolt in terms of
hardware no comparison here the iPhone 4
is a smaller device it's lighter weight
and it feels higher quality thanks to
the use of metal and glass in terms of
thickness you'll notice that the
Thunderer book is it looks almost 2
times thicker than the iPhone so if
you're concerned with size in your
pocket and sort of how big the phone is
in the hand the iPhone 4 is definitely
the winner in that department
ok so let's turn on these devices we're
gonna flip on on the front-facing video
camera just so you can get a sense for
how that looks and we're gonna go over
to the the camera application here on
both we're going to flip this over to
the front camera yep you can see I
haven't brushed my hair today so let's
go to where are we over here this camera
alright we're going to turn on the front
facing camera and
you can uh you can kind of compare kind
of a yellow yellow it should glow on the
Thunderbolt and hey Here I am
and again I didn't brush my hair today
but it looks like the actually the
Thunderbolt has slightly better
brightness here you can actually see my
face a little better there a little bit
dark on the iPhone 4 so we're gonna say
that the Thunderbolts front-facing
camera is a little bit higher quality
than the iPhone 4 but of course whether
that matters to you is determined by
whether you're going to use video chat
when you when you use your your
smartphone okay so let's now compare the
web browsers obviously very important
we're gonna try to launch the web
browsers at the same time and see which
opens fastest they're probably both
going to be instant to be honest so
they're both pretty much instant the
iPhone 4 looked a little bit slower
because it has that animation but really
at the end of the day they are pretty
much the same speed and launching the
web browser now we have no other open
windows so if we go here you can see
there's only one open window there if we
do a little pinch you can see there's
only one open window here on the
thunderbolt and by the way I like this
gesture better to get to the tab to view
compared to the iPhone 4 where you have
to go into this view and then you'll
swipe side-to-side just not as intuitive
I think on the iPhone so let's go to a
page that has lots of text lots to
scroll around with we're gonna go to end
gadget here and we're over the same
Wi-Fi network and by the way we're going
to talk about the cellular data speeds
which are extremely important when
considering a phone let's try to launch
this at the same time I'm gonna zoom in
just a little bit so we can see what
we're doing here and let's try to do
this boom there we go okay a little bit
unfair there because the thunderbolt
launched the mobile version and
obviously finished first so we're going
to launch the desktop version and then
compare it from there
all right and we're done so let's kind
of flick down the page and see what
scrolling is like we don't want to see
any checker boards let's go real quick
on the iPhone see if we get any checker
boards no checker boards okay well we
got a little bit at the end there and
with the Thunderbolt not as smooth a
little bit choppy there to begin with
but actually after it caches it becomes
buttery smooth as you can see here we
also get a nicer fuller screen view on
the thunderbolt as you can see here on
the iPhone we still have this bottom bar
showing we have a little notification
strip at the top the the HTC Sense web
browser the web browser that HTC is kind
of tweaked to make it a little bit
better is full screen and it really
looks awesome let's do a screen rotation
speed test here okay Thunderbolt must
faster that was pretty much even let's
try it one more time
Thunderbolt was faster there and then
it's interesting Thunderbolts faster
going into landscape but they're tied
going into portrait so let's go to the
same story and try to click on a link at
the same time so we'll go to the top
here check pinch to zoom pretty smooth
on the thunderbolt ultra smooth on the
iPhone 4 let's see which one gets there
first
go and
okay Thunderbolt finished first there
looks like the iPhone is up there goes
finished up we'll move around the page
and we'll click on something else okay
so we've got another link to try here
we're stalling Engadget let's do this
boom and they're off the same time let's
see which ends first
okay this or the Thunderbolt one again
so we're going to give the point to the
Thunderbolt in terms of web browsing
speed share speed although if you kind
of want to look at sort of the
smoothness of of browsing the web you
really can't beat the iPhone 4 it is
just buttery smooth that isn't to say
that the Thunderbolt isn't very smooth
too but there's just something about the
iPhones browsing experience that is
unrivaled and people that use the iPhone
and after coming from another device
really believe that so in terms of sheer
speed the Thunderbolt wins here but in
terms of sort of the refinement of the
browser and a smoothness the iPhone 4
wins there now let's talk about
bandwidth speeds because obviously the
Thunder book has 4G and the the iPhone 4
has 3G so let's take a look at some
tests that we've run on both of these so
if we go back here and we're looking at
the little icons indicating data speeds
you can see that average speeds over 18
T's 3G network pretty good 1.7 3.9 that
was a good run 2.9 2.2 so about 2.5
megabits per second down on average if
you look at the upload speeds were at
about 1.2 megabits per second down so
very strong they're obviously not 4G
speeds if we look at the 4G speeds
clocked on the thunderbolt they are two
to three times greater
on average getting 6 megabits per second
down
you gotta ignore these upload speeds
because right now there's a flaw in the
speedtest.net application it's not
benchmarking the LTE network just right
but we can look at the download speeds
getting seven at times there was even a
run down here where where we clocked 13
right there 13 megabits per second down
that is a multiple of about five times
faster than ATT's 3G
network so if you're looking for the
fastest phone when you're out and about
and you want to get a fast internet
connection obviously the thunderbolt is
the phone that you want to get so let's
go back to the home screens and talk a
little bit about the software now iOS
and Android has been compared at length
and just to recap that I Oh s gives you
screen after screen after screen of just
icons
whereas on Android you get the option of
at least having some widgets so instead
of having just icons but you can have
icons you can go to a screen and you can
add say a stream from your social
network bookmarks I mean what you can do
with your home screens in Android is
just so far greater than what you can do
in iOS so if you're looking for the
utmost and versatility and being able to
really make the home screen work for you
Android is definitely the way to go and
the funderbolt has the newest version of
HTC Sense or at least one of the newer
versions there's a lot of versions out
there and so you get a lot of new
widgets beautiful widgets that allow you
to click through your email check your
your messages through this carousel
really fancy stuff here but of course on
Android if you don't want HTC Sense
interface you can download launcher pro
you can download ADW launcher you can
really customize it and make it your own
on the iPhone
unless you're jailbreaking what you see
is what you get icon after icon after
icon
ok so let's open up the YouTube
application and just test how the
playback is of some video so we're going
to find the YouTube applications okay so
here we are on the home screen of the
YouTube app I like how the Thunderbolt
gives you more sort of choices here
whereas you only get four pictures or
four thumbnails on the iPhone because
you've got this bottom bar in this
massively thick top bar another problem
with iOS is that the screen real estate
isn't necessarily utilized in the best
fashion they could have struck this
featured bar to about half the height
and giving you a lot more video choices
here but alas let's move through and see
what we have let's try to play the same
video so we're going to go to search
here
so so let's search for for pocket now
here and see what we get
now that brings up another point how
about these on-screen keyboards you can
see side to side if we match them up
sort of from the bottom of the screen up
the HTC Thunderbolt keyboard is
significantly taller then then the
keyboard on the iPhone which means if
you have larger fingers you're going to
enjoy typing on the Thunderbolt more
both have really good screen sensitivity
so that's not an issue it's just a
matter of the height of the keys that
said there are a lot of people out there
with big hands that use the iPhone and
say that the keyboard is great for them
so that's just something to keep in mind
so we're going to press search here see
which finds results faster okay so the
Thunderbolt was faster and we're getting
the same results which is perfect so
we're gonna tap and see which plays the
video first we're gonna jump this into
landscape okay so we got the thunderbolt
again loading the video first actually
significantly faster okay this is too
loud here is actually about three or
four seconds faster and getting the
video on the screen compared to the
iPhone which is quite impressive now in
terms of playback quality you really
couldn't tell from there from this
particular angle but they looked about
the same they both can do high-quality
YouTube videos to take advantage of the
higher resolution if people are
uploading sort of near HD quality so in
terms of YouTube performance it looks
like the Thunderbolt does it a little
bit better it provides a better kind of
display of the videos on the screen
because it takes advantage of the of the
full screen real estate here it doesn't
have a bottom bar but it does have a
thick top top bar just like on the
iPhone so let's go back home now in
terms of call quality I've actually
found that call quality on the
thunderbolt to be slightly better it
does this interesting effect where when
you talk into the microphone you hear
yourself a little bit which makes it
easy to sort of hear what you're saying
especially if you're in a loud
environment now both of these devices
have noise cancellation so the iPhone 4
has a microphone down here and also up
at the top and the Thunderbolt also has
a secondary mic up at the top so if
you're looking for a phone that will
allow you to talk to people and loud
they'll both do a great job at that and
also that isn't to say that the iPhone 4
has poor call quality because it has
really good call quality in terms of
speakerphone the speakerphone on the
iPhone 4 I found to be a little bit
louder than the Thunderbolt if you
maximize the volume on the speaker phone
on the Thunderbolt it will distort which
is kind of gross huh so the iPhone 4
wins in in terms of speakerphone quality
but I'd say the Thunderbolt wins in
terms of call quality so you got to
think about what is most important to
you so at the end of the day there
really is no clear winner here it all
depends on what you want if you want a
device with the big screen the
thunderbolts the one to go with if you
want a device that has a more refined
web browsing experience the iPhone is
the one to go with if you want to be
able to get 4G LTE speeds obviously
you're only going to get that on the
Thunderbolt right now in fact there are
no other LTE phones that you can choose
although on Verizon there will soon be
be the samsung stealth and the LG
revolution but right now the Thunderbolt
is all that you get if you want a
slightly faster all-around device the
Thunderbolts the one to get as you saw
it loaded webpages faster at loaded
YouTube videos faster another advantage
of the Thunderbolt that we didn't talk
about is that it's really optimized for
video viewing because it's got this cool
kickstand on the back so if you want to
do that with the iPhone you've got to
kind of tilt it like this on its flat
edge which is okay and depending on
where you're sitting that may be perfect
but the Thunderbolt kind of provides a
better viewing angle when you're
watching videos or reading a book or
what-have-you on your phone so at the
end of the day it really matters what
your personal preference is what you're
looking for hopefully this video was
able to give you some insight into which
one may be better for your needs if you
have any specific questions or you want
to see something on video that we didn't
show please leave a comment below and
we'll do our best to get back to you on
that if you like this video please give
it a thumbs up and thanks for watching
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
