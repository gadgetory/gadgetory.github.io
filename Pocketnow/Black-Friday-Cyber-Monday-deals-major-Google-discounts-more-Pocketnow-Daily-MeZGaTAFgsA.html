like google providing some awesome deals
1 plus seems to think that the holiday
deals you want or the lack of
restrictions and if you wanted a Lumia
950 or 950 excel in the US it seems
you'll have to wait I'm Hyneman ravenna
and the only doorbuster deal that I had
to deal with is going into the studio
this morning but anyways this is parking
out daily yesterday is black friday i
know some of you are actually either
watching this video from a store in the
line or you're watching this online
because you're trying to shop or
something if you want to see the best
deals out there follow the first link of
the description as we've compiled not
only again the best deals but also the
best value for your money and some of
these deals are actually gift cards for
product but these gift cards are
actually compelling I'm just shocked
because like for example I'm not used to
seeing Apple providing any deals on
their products and then best buy is
providing the best discounts out there
for products like the Apple watch and
iPads for example so the list is
extremely useful i recommend you follow
it if you're not looking for just any
deal and you want to find deals for a
particular product that you want then i
recommend you follow the second link in
the description which is our holiday
shopping guide the advantage here is
that we segregate products like for
example the LG v10 which is brand new
you'll find deals for that or in
addition if you want to find new
products from samsung like the new
galaxy note 5 or galaxy s6 edge+ you'll
also find them separately and the deals
that are out there you won't find many
discounts for these products again
because they're new but hey it's also
useful for those of you that want to
save a few bucks as well I guess one of
the biggest shockers for the holiday was
Google as the company has shaved off a
lot of money on its Nexus products you
can get eighty dollars off any nexus 5x
meaning if we get the 16gb or 32
variants you can consider that you're
getting eighty dollars off but hey if
you want the nexus tablets for example
the Nexus 9 is now available for just
200 bucks in its entry level which is
pretty much half price for the product
and again you can also find some Android
wear offerings though the deals are not
that great link into the description as
well for more details on that and those
of you that were in the market for
Lumias per tick
early either the Lumia 950 or Lumia 950
XL and you're in the United States it
seems you're out of luck is apparently
Microsoft has run out of stock or
whatever is happening because the
company has already confirmed that they
are unavailable for sale which is really
odd since they are available in Europe
right now you can actually get them in
Germany for example not really sure
again if the company ran out of stocking
if they did we're happy because hey it
means that Lumia is either sold or
whatever we're hoping that that's the
case but yeah it seems you'll have to
wait the problem is the company is not
really telling us how long you'll have
to wait and finally for the most
ridiculous deal of the day and by
ridiculous I'm actually being negative 1
plus feels that the deals that you want
from their products is to be able to buy
them without an invite from the 27th of
November to the 30th that is their deal
they're not dropping the price in any
way but then to be fair let's just be
honest their products are not expensive
at all for what you're getting so Hey Ya
let's cut them some slack at least
you'll have the option to be able to buy
the product without restriction which is
great but hey I'm really curious for
days question of the day what did you
buy for black friday or are planning to
buy for cyber monday if anything in my
case i actually didn't buy anything
because while the products that I wanted
I pretty much got a month ago but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know what you guys got friends as always
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video was
filmed make sure you follow us on Fargo
