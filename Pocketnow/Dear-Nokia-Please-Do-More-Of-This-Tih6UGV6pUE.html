the Nokia 7 and proof that there is such
a thing as great design and a great
software approach in the mid-range fun
fact Michael Fisher recently showed off
my first ever cell phone in a video of
his so that explains why I have a soft
spot for Nokia making such a tremendous
comeback I'm high metal II that I will
pocket now when let's talk about why you
should care to
we've seen a trend of premium mid
rangers that all look great at a glance
but watered down a few important
elements to keep the price down and okay
up 7.1 is actually the exception to some
of these so let me start by telling you
what I love about this phone back at our
briefing Nokia told us that their
primary focus was design performance and
pure Google and first off they did get
the design part right it's not such a
large phone being just slightly taller
than the iPhone 10s the CNC machine
champers on the aluminum make this
midnight blue variant quite the looker
and the 2.5 the glass on the top and the
bottom make it pleasant to hold the
second thing I like is this display
usually mid Ranger's do not get this
part right but the Nokia 7.1 provides a
very beautiful and vibrant experience at
five point eight inches diagonal Nokia's
pure display brings full HD plus
resolution HDR support and is actually
capable of converting content to HDR
with great color and saturation this is
definitely one of the highlights of this
phone probably one of the things that I
enjoy the most
third the whole concept of pure Google
is just flat-out great for those of you
looking for the full Android Pi Google
pixel experience on a budget this is the
way to go look no further this is
actually my first experience using
Android 1 and it is seriously
fascinating this phone mimics the pixel
experience in absolutely every animation
but with the added bonus that if you
don't like the pixel pill you can
actually switch it off from its
integration to Google services to the
cool selection of wallpapers I think
what are the highlights of buying a
Nokia phone is that they're not trying
to reinvent software here but of course
there's no such thing as a perfect phone
so let me begin telling you what I'm
mixed about when it comes to this device
and it starts with the internals sure I
know this is a mid-range er but at the
time of the poco phone that's actually
kind of a hard argument to defend we
have a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor
options for 3 or 4 gigs of ram depending
on your choice of 32 or 64 gigs of
storage respectively and with support
for micro is the expansion up to 400
gigs
there's a 3060 milliamp hour battery
with quick charge capabilities through
USB see
company uses special tuning on its
display to adapt and push endurance
according to them so sure this phone
doesn't include the best specifications
for a mid ranger but the reason why I
mixed is because once you start using it
I don't think you'll actually care about
that
like for example animations are fluid
gliding through menus works fine
performance being another key pillar for
Nokia this film does not feel like a mid
Ranger I don't even have complaints
about battery life that also works just
fine and the cherry topper is that you
even have a headphone jack here so even
that's great and then other things I'm
mixed about are things like the speaker
which is loud but sounds a lot better if
you assisted with your hand and then in
the case of the display the whole notch
and large chin just really hinder all
the great quality brought by the panel
now believe it or not I don't really
have anything that I would say that I
don't like about this phone but there
are cases when it comes to its camera or
I do feel that it needs improvements
sure bit Rangers never really get this
right but in the case of a phone that
offers carl zeiss optics and its dual
camera system i was actually expecting a
little more we have one sensor of 12
megapixels f 1.8 aperture and 1.2 8
microns and with a secondary 5 megapixel
camera that provides def sensing for
portraits the selfie cameras of 8
megapixels with f/2 aperture photos are
well they're good during the day as
expected with all smartphones colors
seem great with good saturation and
detail is good with neat tricks like
phase detection autofocus and HDR which
is hard to find for mid-range errs the
problem really is low-light photos where
this camera doesn't do the best job in
handling grain even it's such a bright
aperture I was really expecting more
given the spec sheet and Nokia's legacy
but low light is definitely something
that needs work
portrait photos are the opposite though
they're surprisingly good with great
color detail and without any sort of
overbearing or faked looking bouquet
though the experience is not the same
with portrait selfies even if regular
selfies are fine and then when it comes
to video I will praise
they'll give for including some nice
stabilization and some very good dynamic
range though you will notice it gets
quite warp II whenever you're in dim
situations this stabilization and
dynamic range also makes it to selfie
video along with a very nice crop which
I'm honestly surprised because that's
even hard to find on flagships today to
conclude I have to say that I walked
into this review not expecting much
which is usually the case with mid
rangers but I'm actually leaving with a
smile where has Nokia been all these
years I would say planning one of the
smartest comebacks in history the Nokia
7.1 has great hardware good performance
and the purest of Google which is
seriously the way that I feel most if
not all smartphone OEM should go sure
it's not perfect and the mid-range is
rather crowded with some awesome devices
like the honor a texture the poco phone
thing is in my opinion Nokia's choice to
go Android one gives it a significant
benefit over its competition it
seriously offers a less traumatic
experience for you the end user I'm
actually really glad that I spent some
time with the Nokia 7.1 it's always
great to see one of your favorite
companies reinvent itself I definitely
do recommend this phone for those of you
on a budget I do feel that you're
getting more than your money's worth
