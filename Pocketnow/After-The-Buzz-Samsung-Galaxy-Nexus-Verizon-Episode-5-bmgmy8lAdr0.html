when a new phone is announced the media
gets the device ahead of time maybe a
couple days a couple weeks if we're
lucky and we get to use it while we're
preparing our review then the date and
time of the press embargo arrives the
embargo lifts everybody posts their
review at once and it is a giant big
frenzy of activity there's commenters
going nuts and defenders and attackers
and it's just a huge explosion for about
a day and then everything disappears
ensure there's follow-up coverage and
stuff as people find bugs people have
other stuff to say other devices they
they wear a man over the course of a day
or so but really nobody ever goes back
and revisits these devices after that
initial blast of review to see how they
feel after a couple weeks so let's do
something about it let's take a look at
another device whose day as the media
darling has come and gone I'm Michael
Fisher with pocketnow.com this is the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus LTE and this is
episode five of after the buzz
the Verizon version of the Galaxy Nexus
the Galaxy Nexus LTE was supposed to be
my cure for phone hopping it was
supposed to be the phone that personally
for me kept me interested for more than
a few months it was a series of firsts
it was my first phone on Verizon
Wireless it was my first LTE device and
it was also my first experience with a
nexus Class device from Google it wasn't
just new ground for me this was the
first time a nexus device had been sold
by Verizon in a retail setting and it
was one of their early LTE devices not
one of the first LTE phones but it was
the early wave and it was a big deal
when it launched a little over seven
months ago it had a lot of potential so
after over a half-year of use how has it
lived up to that potential well there's
good and there's bad in the hardware and
in the software let's take a look at
each in order
I've often picked on the Galaxy Nexus
when comparing it to other phones
because it's never really seemed to me
to aspire to anything it's what I call a
handsome device it's not ugly by any
means but it's not mind-blowing that
said it has got a lot going for it I
like the teardrop style design I like
the textured battery door and I like the
ever so slight curve of the display
glass
I adore its notification LED all I need
to do is glance at the phone even if
it's across the room to see if I've
missed something and I don't know
whether it's just me but every time I
return to the Galaxy Nexus from my time
with the review device I just feel a
sense of relief the device feels
wonderful in the hand with perfect width
and especially with the extended battery
door which thickens it up just a tad it
sits perfectly in the palm it's very
comfortable device to hold and it
doesn't make me struggle as much when
trying to get to the notification drawer
as other larger devices like the Galaxy
s3 which is a much feels like a much
larger device in the hand even though
it's not that much bigger
in actuality and even though it's not
winter anymore and I've switched to
shorts it
it's just fine in a pocket the hardened
display glass here isn't foolproof it
does in fact scratch I don't use a
screen protector so I've scratched it up
in a number of places the panel itself
continues to be a real disappointment as
well I like the deep blacks that the
Super AMOLED panel provides and I like
that it's big and at 720p but the white
reproduction is just awful it's washed
out and gray and ugly
the colors often seem dead and the panel
is quite dim and lacking in color it's
sad as for the rest of the phone the
plastic casing picks up oil from your
hand quite readily which is annoying as
a bonus though the texturing on the
battery door covers up scratches and
scuffs very very nicely from a hardware
perspective this phone is a real trouper
I mean I haven't beaten it up too bad
but I haven't always been kind to it
either and it's held up really well so
unless you're a real abusive phone over
you phone owner you shouldn't have too
much trouble with the Galaxy Nexus LTE
hardware so how about the software and
the rest of the experience I'm running
stock 4.4 ICS on my Galaxy Nexus and
once again returning to this phone from
review units always gives me a strong
sense of relief responsiveness even
after over six months is superb and this
is ICS not jellybean we're not seeing
any project butter action here it really
just runs like a finely tuned watch I
seldom experience crashes and I've never
had to do a full device wipe or reset I
have plenty of storage 32 gigs and I do
use it as my primary media player with
very very few problems but it's not all
sunshine and rainbows it didn't take me
long to realise that this phone has some
serious shortcomings remember how we
talked about this being an early LTE
device well it takes a Galaxy Nexus
forever to connect to the network if
you've lost signal now normally that
wouldn't be a problem but I take the
subway somewhere almost every day and we
don't have coverage underground here in
Boston so at least once a day I'm
waiting sometimes over a minute for the
device to find the network connection
again
that would have been fine in 2001 it's
not fine now maybe because of all this
network stuff battery life suffers
accordingly there's no way I could make
it a full day with the Galaxy Nexus LTE
without my trusty spare battery and my
power pack I'll put it this way I'd
pretty much always leave the apartment
the same way I walk out the door I walk
to a bus stop I ride the bus to a train
station and then I wait for the train
that takes about 10 to 15 minutes during
the entirety of which I'm on my phone
the whole time before the train even
arrives every day that's less than 20
minutes I'm down below 90% that's
ridiculous
the camera has really fared no better
but everyone knows this already you
don't buy a Galaxy Nexus for its camera
you're gonna get ok shots in the daytime
or indoors if there's enough light for
it but for dim environments you're not
going to be blown away the shots look
slightly better on a computer screen
than they will on the phone because of
that washed out display but bottom line
it's still just not a very good camera
by far the most frustrating part of the
device though has been in the Nexus
sense Nexus phones are supposed to get
timely first crack updates from Google
the latest version of Android and
Verizon has really truly botched the
entirety of that experience I've talked
about this already and a piece on the
site called this ain't no Nexus phone
which you should read and yes I know
that's the nature of the beast with the
CDMA device but it shouldn't be marketed
as a Nexus phone if my update to 4.4 is
gonna arrive months after it does for
the non Verizon Galaxy Nexus that's a
huge messaging failure and a real
disservice to anyone buying this phone
for the pure Google experience still
more than a year and a half after
release the Galaxy Nexus LTE is still a
great Android phone with awesome data
speeds so if that's all you're looking
for if that's all you're getting at 4 as
an Android smartphone with all the Nexus
stuff aside I absolutely think you will
be happy as long as you a carry a spare
battery
and be don't expect too much from the
camera if you're okay with these things
this is a great great Android smartphone
it really is and I don't hesitate to
recommend it even now that we're more
than a half a year there's there's less
than a half of your left before we see
it's likely successor on the other hand
if you're looking for a genuine Nexus
device with direct from Google support
and timely updates to the latest version
of Android I also don't hesitate who say
run run as far away from this device as
you can run to the Google Play Store and
get yourself the real Galaxy Nexus the
HSPA unlocked version it's priced very
reasonably and most importantly you'll
be getting what you paid for a real
Nexus device which sorry to say the
Verizon version here is not guys this
has been episode 5 of after the buzz we
