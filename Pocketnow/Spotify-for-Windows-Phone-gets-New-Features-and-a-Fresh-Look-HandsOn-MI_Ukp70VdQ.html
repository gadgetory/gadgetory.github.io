or iOS for the past few months almost
nothing about the company's new update
for Microsoft's platform will surprise
you but for Windows Phone owners there's
lots to celebrate I'm Michael Fisher
with PocketNow and this is a quick look
at the new Spotify for Windows Phone 8
Windows Phone apps are so often behind
their iOS and Android counterparts that
whenever a major one gets a refresh it's
pretty exciting
and this Spotify overhaul is indeed a
major refresh check out the old version
seen here running on my lumia 1020 the
front page is very simple with nothing
but a search bar up top and the
collection of so-called popular
playlists beneath with the currently
playing track at the bottom personally I
don't think I've ever clicked any of the
popular playlist options so this layout
which I believe was introduced in August
of last year was never my favorite
everything worthwhile was contained in
the side panel to the left which was
quite nice and clean but still tucked
away out of sight in the new version the
default open page is the browse option
which is laid out exactly as it is on
Android with new and timely suggested
playlists on top followed by top lists
new releases and discover options below
in the general genres and moods titles
filling up the space beneath the new UI
is darker which Spotify says helps the
content pop more and that's certainly
true on the AMOLED panel of our Lumia
930 here hitting the overflow to open
the side panel also reveals another big
addition to the new version my music is
here this allows you to save albums
artists or tracks directly to your own
personal archive for quick access now
this is something I've been doing for
years by making individual playlists but
if you find that practice cumbersome or
outdated which I guess is the case then
you'll be happy to see my music included
here
other changes are mainly cosmetic
alterations to the typeface and icon
design and reformatting of the various
sub pages to bring the experience more
in line with Android and iOS and this
being Windows Phone and pretty powerful
hardware on this 930 responsiveness is
excellent
only time will tell how well this
revision holds up but on a platform
where months and even years sometimes go
by between major updates any substantial
revision is worth celebrating and that
goes double for an app as big as Spotify
the new Spotify is available today in
the Windows Store for more on Windows
Phone check out our recent after the
buzz review on the Nokia Lumia 930 and
our Nokia denim camera update tour both
here on YouTube toss us a thumbs up and
subscribe if you enjoyed this quick look
till next time this has been michael
fisher with PocketNow captain to phones

on Windows Phone we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
