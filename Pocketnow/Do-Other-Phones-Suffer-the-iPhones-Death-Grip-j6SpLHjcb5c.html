most of you know I'm the android guy I
use a nexus one my wife has ag1 we
really love them and one of the things
that we like best about our androids is
being able to pick on iphone users no
offense to iphone users out there it's
just something fun that we do and you do
it right back so it's all okay well
recently we've had news that the iphone
4 has an antenna problem in air quotes
and I've been right there on that
bandwagon making fun of the iphone 4 4
we're not thoroughly testing the the
antenna but it turns out that it may not
be an iphone 4 problem let me show you
what happens when to use Steve Jobs
words you hold it wrong with a nexus one
I think you'd be surprised okay so
holding the phone this way with one
thumb and one finger you can see I've
got a full five bars now if I squeeze in
here and cover it up with a couple more
fingers did you see that I just dropped
down to two bars now I'm back up to
three because I moved it up towards the
camera a little bit but I dropped
basically half my signal strength just
by holding it like this now if I let go
again and hold it just with the two
fingers there you go I just recovered
that other bar so is the iphone 4 at
fault for having those exposed antennas
possibly possibly not it looks like
other phones have the same type of
problem though it took me a long time
before I was able to finally reproduce
this reliably and show you on camera and
you can see even here it took a while
for those bars to drop if I hold it just
a little bit differently like this or if
I hold it with my right hand I don't
have the same types of problems as I do
if I hold it with that left hand so it's
kind of interesting that it takes so
much effort to try and reproduce the
same type of problem that the iphone 4
antenna has on the nexus one that kind
of speaks either really well to the
nexus ones antenna design or speaks
against the iphone 4 antenna design and
i'm really
not going to conjecture on which one of
those two it is but it goes to show that
every phone is going to have a reaction
to blocking the signal I mean that goes
without saying if you cover up the
antennas and make them go through human
flesh and bone make the signals go
through human flesh and bone you're
going to drop your signal strength so
maybe this is an argument for using
bluetooth headphones that way you're not
even touching the phone with your hand
at all during your calls and maybe
you're going to get some better signal
strength out of it that way time will
tell I'm interested to see what kind of
phone you have and if you are able to
reproduce the grip of death on your
phone if you are if you're not let me
know post it in the comments down below
