and in this video going to give you a
comparison of how well HTC Sense runs on
the HTC wildfires bigger brother the HTC
evo 4g so we'll make this video any
longer let's just go ahead and jump
right into it okay it's time to jump
right into doing these software
comparisons on these two devices here
now as we've mentioned these are both
running HTC Sense which is the same
experience however the processor in the
rim available under each device should
make a difference and we're basically
going to test that right now and see how
much of a difference there actually is
so the first test we're going to do is a
browse your test go ahead and pull up
each of these browsers and we're
actually going to go to pocket now calm
alright we're now going to press the
enter button on both these devices at
the same exact time as you can see the
wildfire is showing a stronger wireless
network so we'll see what happens they
both are on the same Wi-Fi it looks like
the evo is pulling ahead the evo is
definitely loading it rendering the
pictures faster all right now based on
the status bar the Wildfire does look
closer all right it looks like the evo
did win the race the wildfire is still
going here and what it's basically
trying to render are going to be all the
flash banners here and on the top of the
page itself that's where it's going to
really depend on the CPU to get that
going so the main portion of the page
loads no problem it's just the flash
content that can be a little of an issue
as you can see here there's a little
hourglass still pending all right and
they are now fully loaded it took the
Wildfire about another three or four
seconds so it wasn't too too bad overall
I'd say the evil one by about ten
seconds this is a pretty intense page to
look at though in terms of the flash
content the pictures that are on the
page itself the logos etc etc now we're
going to do is actually going to zoom in
using the multi-touch support on both of
these we're gonna see which ones are a
little smoother and it seems that the
Wildfire actually has a smoother I'm out
arts to jerk up a little bit as
smoother motion however as you can tell
hopefully you can tell the screens while
you're zooming in with the Wildfire is
actually it's blurry the Texas blurry
it's tough to see it has to actually
render that text before you can read it
and that's partially have to do with the
processor as well as the screen
resolution itself as you can see here
it's still blurry and now it has to
render it in terms of the general
navigation you can press the home button
to get the helicopter view we're gonna
actually press these both at the same
time right now and that was pretty
comparable the evo does seem to pull it
up a little faster however it's not
going to be night and day another test
we're going to do are some of these
social networking application this is
something that we like to typically test
out because many of us use the Twitter
applications the facebook applications
etc and the whole point for doing this
this sort of testing is to see if the
faster processor the one gigahertz
processor on the EVO is really having an
upper hand over the 528 megahertz
processor on the Wildfire common sense
would say yes however some things are
still going to load pretty close to one
another as you've already seen let's go
ahead and pull up Twitter and we're
actually going to go to my profile and
we'll see which one will load faster
going to press these bowls at the same
time now it looks like the Wildfire I
did it sooner however we're now going to
search for Brandon minuman and now we're
also going to try the search
functionality by searching for Brandon
minuman on the Twitter application
itself and we'll see Russia going to tap
is at the same time we'll see we'll see
which one actually pulls up the results
under him faster and as you can see the
evo actually moved the screen over
faster but it looks like the Wildfire
was able to actually bring the results
up sooner and that may have to do with
the fact of the Wi-Fi signal now once
again the Wildfire is displaying full
bars Wi-Fi whereas the evo is only
displaying the three now mind you the
wireless router is about 10 feet away
from us so we are pretty much right on
top of it and we are not getting full
signal with the evo that may just be
software or could be a hardware effect
right there that's that's more or less
inhibiting the performance on that point
next up we're going to take a look at
the facebook application and that's
simply just going to be by loading my
profile here and this time it looks like
the evo did pull ahead it actually
pulled over a little bit later but it
was able to load the entire feed faster
we've now gone ahead and moved into the
YouTube application testing out the
YouTube speed is one of the tests that
we really like to do here and because
this will show off the video rendering
speeds as well as the data speeds itself
of the device so let's go ahead and
press PocketNow video did actually press
the Wildfire a split second faster
however the evo was still able to pull
ahead and we're going to just pick any
random video here we'll pick the very
top one and we'll see which one actually
is able to load faster looks like the
wildfire believe it or not hold it up
sooner now of course we were stuck with
the loud volumes on both devices but it
looks like surprisingly the Wildfire was
able to pull up the video render the
video sooner they are both doing it in
HQ mind you some of that may have to do
with the fact that the evil as a
four-point inch screen the processor may
have to fill up that screen fill up that
canvas more than it does on the Wildfire
and now it's time to test a video game
application and to do that we're going
to use one of our favorites which is the
asphalt 5 game
as you can see here the game lawful logo
was very cut off ooh and unfortunately
this device cannot support asphalt five
now that's most likely going to be
because of the screen resolution as you
saw the logo itself was cut off so
unfortunately you're going to miss out
on some of the games in that sense and
that's likely because of the resolution
of this device so because we weren't
able to test out asphalt 5 which was
kind of a letdown we're going to go
ahead and test out Teeter what should
one of the applications that are
included on both these devices itself I
believe it comes with HTC sense by
default so we're go ahead and touch
she's at the same exact time looks like
the wildfire is a little head here and
basically it asked if I wanted to
restart a game however we do not and it
looks like the Wildfire was able to
actually load it faster but if you look
here it's very hard to play this through
the camera but it seems almost a little
jerky kind of like the ball is almost
teleporting whereas when you play it on
the EVO it is much smoother and the ball
seems much more real it seems like the
frame rate in this game is almost a
little bit better on the EVO and that's
going to wrap it up for the software
comparison on the HTC evo vs the HTC
Wildfire now the results weren't
necessarily conclusive of course the evo
did pull head and many of the tests if
not all of the tests which was to be
expected but unless you're a power user
you're really not going to the
difference itself so if you are a power
user a device with a faster processor
will really go a long way especially if
you plan on browsing a lot looking at
pictures watching videos playing video
games the whole nine yards however this
is going to be your first smartphone or
your first Android device the Wildfire
will definitely suffice for you but as
you saw not every game unfortunate is
going to be compatible and that's going
to be because of the screen size and
resolution the HTC Wildfire does have
one very good thing going for it which
is why some of the specs or a little
lower and that's the price as an unlock
device priced at only three hundred
dollars you really can't complain there
with what you're going to be getting the
fact that you're not going to be in a
contract and still only pay 300 hours
for a real
lative Lee top notch device is not bad
at all stay tuned for our next video
which will be the final video in this
series and that will be our review our
final word on the HTC hero as always
please give us a thumbs up on this video
and leave a comment with any suggestions
or questions you may have thanks for
watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
