it okay I guess I'll explain why am i
okay my favorite part of end abuse oh my
name right feel better and I'm gonna
pick okay sometime the way that people
only have that's right sorry no I I
realize they have a new favorite thing
now okay I'm hi I'm Eddie better with
pocket now MWC is pretty much over but
one of the things that I like the most
about this show is the collaborations
the fact that all of our good friends
are here and then we get to talk about
technology and we thought we'd do the
same again we just came out of the
mobile tech podcast which is also going
to be part of our pocket our weekly and
definitely let's talk about our favorite
parts of MWC 2018
brought to you by invisible shield
I'm Michael Josh from gadget mass comm
MWC this year was the Samson show
because they chose to unveil the Galaxy
S 9 but my favorite part of MWC was
seeing what the other brands tried to do
to kind of get our attention Nokia in
particular had the reboot of another
popular favorite the 8080 110 4G which
was awesome it's the banana phone that
was really awesome and of course LG
talked about AI and in a little corner
in a little booth I saw a prototype of a
phone that has a selfie camera that pops
up so that you don't have to have any
bezel any bezels or any not jumpy hey
guys Nicole Scott here for mobile geeks
and my favorite part of MWC was Nokia
coming back I absolutely lost my mind
when I figured out that in the UK there
were number three in terms of shipment
and number four in terms of sales and
they only started selling their Nokia
smartphones enjoy why that's six months
and they're back we all wrote them off I
mean when I when I was a journalist in
the very very beginning they had 95%
from the entire industry with Simeon and
then they went down to 3% when they
finally got sold to Microsoft and now
now they're back in the UK and other
markets I'm sure hey my name is Meera
I'm the host of the mobile tech podcast
at tankara on Twitter my favorite part
of MWC was the Nokia 81 10 4G banana
phone matrix whatever you want to call
it and in general I think now kids come
back you know I'm a long time Nokia fan
you know back from the early days and
they've done so well in this past year
and they're bringing so many cool
interesting Android devices and future
phones like come back whatever whimsical
older retro phones whatever you want
that I think they need to do this every
every year every year give us more Nakia
that's my that's my take away
hey there it's Jules Wong with pocket
now with timing bear over there and my
favorite thing actually has to be folly
it's cheesy as it sounds this is mink
book X that they have that they have the
sequel to Pro out right now and it has
that camera that just pops in and
out and about I mean little things like
that well Hardware tweaks that they can
do to get SLS displays or at least
closing in on bezel as displays I think
that's always been the trend from you
know TVs and smartphones and now it's
down to laptops too so the more that we
can do that the better hey it's Josh
Vergara for manager authority what's
going on everybody and I wanted to talk
about my favorite thing at MWC there's
actually a lot of things but I have I
keep coming back to the mechanical iris
of the samsung galaxy s 9 I'm really
happy that a real physical Hardware
feature of typical cameras like the one
I'm holding is now a part of a
smartphone and the reason why I'm
excited about that is because well we
can only go up from here
my name is Daniel Bader I'm the managing
editor of Android Central and my two
favorite things at MWC I'm gonna take
one easy and one kind of hard so I'm a
sucker for Sony phones I have always
been and the experience is XE too great
upgrade and I'm really excited about
using it fingerprint sensor on the back
I mean what else can you ask for right
the second thing 5g it's a little bit
nebulous right now but we're getting so
close and I'm legitimately thrilled for
the potential applications I think it's
gonna change the world I know every
company says that but there's a reason
they do and I'm really looking forward
to 2019 to see what changes and how
close we are to 5g launching hey I'm
David from the unlocker comm and my
favorite thing at Mobile World Congress
it has to be probably the s9 or the s9 +
that low-light camera is pretty amazing
I do like it is only a slight refresh
but the phone itself feels super solid
compared to the s8 I mean the s it
wasn't bad but like it just feels more
solid the cameras a nice upgrade some of
those AR features are pretty neat it's
kind of cool just to see where AR is
going and how fast it's moving and
that's yeah I would have to say the s9
and the s9 plus my favorite thing about
MWC 2018 is a tie I am definitely going
to give props to Huawei that make book X
Pro I've been using it since we were
briefed my god I the battery life is
insane the design is gorgeous and you
know what at first I didn't like the
design of that camera but security-wise
it actually makes a lot of sense and
then the second thing is obviously the
samsung galaxy s 9 it's a the hottest
flagships of the year and I feel that
Samsung remain conservative in a ton of
things that it should have and it played
innovation and others obviously our
review coverage has just begun so there
is more to check more to prove stay
