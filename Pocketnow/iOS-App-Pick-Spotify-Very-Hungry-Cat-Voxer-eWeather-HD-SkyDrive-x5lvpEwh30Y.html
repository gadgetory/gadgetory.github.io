intera comm and it's another episode the
iOS app picks would review five
applications in 30 seconds each so let's
get to it Spotify is a free application
veil on the App Store but also has a
subscription-based service but it does
give you 30 days free so this
application allows you to play
practically any song on your iOS device
so if I was to search for something
let's say I was a searcher of wine I can
just click on here and begin playing
this song okay so we can listen to that
sound flight you can also go back and
hide this and like those of you what's
new so I can view the top tracks near
the released audio and it can also view
my friends over facebook so i can see
the anton also uses spotify very hungry
cat is a free game avail in the app
store so the arch of this game is to
collect these birds while trying to
avoid deal a bombs and other items so a
game is pretty simple all you do is use
one of these touch pads on the sides and
will collect the birds when they get to
these lines so there we can continue to
close the birds so it's pretty much a
progression game and which you're going
to challenge yourself your hand on my
coordination so you want to try to
collect some of these items without oh
it looks as I collect to the bomb so now
i'm probably going to die boxer is a
free application of elapsed or the love
should turn your iOS device into a
walkie-talkie you can also send SMS
messages and emails and also mms so let
me just go here if i want to create a
message i'll just go up here i can
invite my friend there are many friends
on here right now so we can just go
there and put next and i can send a
message to myself for ease as a
walkie-talkie so just hold and talk so
there you were able to hear that i can
also send a text message if I like
swingers click done and we can also
share photos a weather HD is a paid for
application will in the app store the
gives you practically anything you want
to know about the current weather
forecast so here I can view my kind
temperature and I can just scroll over
to view the other days in the upcoming
week or what not forecast here I can
also view when there's earthquakes and
when there's weather alerts so at the
top I can be radar information so you
can just click up here and we'll show me
a radar map and I can also go to play
and play the radar in the past I can
also view this as a clock so it's kind
of cool
you can view the tire weather forecast
as a little tiny clock so the Microsoft
SkyDrive is a free application build an
app store that gives you 25 gigabytes of
online storage so here if I wanted to
store some documents I can I share them
directly from here so let me just go
there but one of you one of my mobile
uploads I can do a photos that i
uploaded so there's that photo I can
also listen to music directly from this
application so that I can listen to this
audio track that i uploaded previously I
