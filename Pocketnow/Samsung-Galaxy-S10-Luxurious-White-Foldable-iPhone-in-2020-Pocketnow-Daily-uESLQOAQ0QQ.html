variant of the galaxy s 10 M it looks
hot
apparently Apple is working on a
foldable smartphone in their own way for
the next year it seems and Google will
reportedly launched their pixel watch
this year to compete with the Apple
watch I'm Jaime Rivera and well we get
celebrated yesterday and we're gonna
celebrate some more today this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals of Walmart currently
has the iPhone se for crazy price tags
like 250 bucks and 140 dollars depending
on the color that you pick but obviously
there is a catch you have to grab
Walmart's new sort of than via no
service I'm trying to gratis a crash my
hand over what the product is they also
have deals for like the g7 in the v40
you can learn more in the description
now let's talk about Huawei as well the
company's CEO and their president of
Europe pretty much just came on record
to state that they were working very
hard to reach the top sales and smart
phones for the world according to them
they are on track to defeat samsung next
year they haven't provided a timeline as
to when but they plan to silla crazy 300
million units by 22 2020 like that's
crazy obviously even with all the issues
that have been going on legally all
around I wonder how that's gonna play
off now for those of you wondering
exactly why Google acquired certain
portion of fossil well there are reports
that the company is working on having a
rebound to the Google home and then a
very complete revamp to their whole
wearable approach to the business we
should see that by the launch of the
next pixels which should happen some
around the fall of 2019 whatever the
case may be Google I hope your watch
actually gets the software right now
let's talk about Apple because aside
from the fact that that watch from
Google will compete with the Apple watch
it seems that the company is working on
another competitor for its own iPhone
there are some pen files that show a
foldable smartphone that folds in the
middle sort of like the rumors of what
we saw with the possible modal razor
update and you have to remember the fact
that when
Apple launched the iPhone and even in
previous attempts to make a smartphone
foldable you know the whole clamshell
designs the smartphones was common so it
would make a lot of sense for the
company to figure that part out we just
wonder what the Apple way will be here
and finally the hottest dish that I have
to do with yet more leaks of what to
expect from Samsung's Galaxy unpacked we
saw recently that there might be a
ceramic variant it seems that now we
find another color option today we also
hear strong rumors that the twelve
gigabytes of RAM and one terabyte of
storage might actually happen but then
apparently there is the galaxy wearable
application that it seems pretty much
just spill the beans on stuff like the
galaxy active though I'm not sure about
that way I know that it did leak stuff
like the galaxy buds if that's also
gonna happen and even a possible galaxy
fit let us know in the comments down
below what do you think about this
portfolio of products I mean do you
think that it's a good idea or not
because in my case I mean Samsung really
needs to stretch as much as they can and
I feel that this is a smart approach but
that's my opinion leave us a comment
