the maid ex because they want to be
cautious and we also know the other
reasons why the Google pixel 4 has
already been spotted in the wild and
that camera module yeah it's big and we
always vice-president just confirmed
that their operating system is being
tested and the trade war will affect
their growth I'm hey meri behna and TGIF
definitely but how are you gonna
celebrate cuz we've got a ton of videos
coming let's park it out daily the
official news today begin with deals
don't you just love it when Apple
products gets discounted every single
day right now iPad Air's are currently
on discount pretty much $40 on Amazon
and you can get your price matched on
B&amp;amp;H obviously if you're in the United
States and primarily in New York it
makes it even easier just show the price
on Amazon you'll get the price match and
you can actually even do that at Best
Buy I've tried it and it actually works
think about it is I've had errors
they're really good not the best tablets
out there but still really good product
and now let's talk about the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 5g I had my recent
experience with it there's a video
coming up very soon to show you how it
was but now it's also going to be
available on Sprint pre-orders begin
today installment plans are pretty much
40 bucks which is not bad but the only
thing is you'll only be able to get it
if you're in a market that supports 5g
you can see more about that in the link
of the description so far my experience
with Verizon was really good I'm curious
to see how it performs on Sprint and for
those of you that are wondering exactly
when you should prepare your wallets for
the next generation of hot phones that
are coming think about it as Evan blasts
just pretty much tweeted a counter from
Verizon I believe that shows us when we
should expect these devices starting
with a Samsung Galaxy Note tennis
errantly it's gonna be a reality in
August which pretty much matches what
happened last year then the next iPhones
are happening in September which is fine
but then for pixel's apparently we're
not gonna have to wait until November it
seems that we're gonna have to wait
until October and I mean Google pretty
much just filled the beans over what to
expect over Twitter but there's actually
more in the next segment think about it
is yeah set your wallets as everything
that we've been covering in the rumor
is hot and hot because of the stoves and
yes the stoves they are because well
we've seen the leaks of iPhones and case
molds and everything but Google pretty
much tweeted yesterday that the stove
design is a reality and for those of you
that we're doubting even Google's own
Twitter well we've got some leaks of the
phone being tested in the wild it's in a
non on a snip stir it seems that the
phone is being covered by the typical
mesh protector that Google seed so it
seems legit to me and now that Google
has pretty much confirmed the design
then I guess then out of those three
design firms this is what we should
expect obviously there's a ton of
curiosity over what these cameras will
do more about that on the parkin al
weekly we just recorded a couple of
hours ago we are really curious as to
what Google plans to do with that
spectral sensor in addition to what that
secondary camera is going to be and how
about if we talk about the huawei maid
2x that was one of the foldable tablets
that I was really looking forward to but
obviously we know what happened with the
galaxy fold and we still don't have a
date for that and 18t just cancelled
pre-orders and so did Best Buy weeks ago
and so the thing about it is that Huawei
just announced in a statement that no it
won't be launched in June they're moving
the launch until September given all the
happenings with the galaxy fold they
want to take their precautions they've
actually been testing the made X more
extensively and apparently they are
delaying the product because of this I
wonder exactly what has the company
discovered we know that there are up to
a hundred moving parts in that hinge and
the more moving parts makes the
possibility of it failing even higher so
yeah we'll see exactly if it happens in
September and I guess the biggest
question is what operating system is it
going to run as I tested it with Android
but it perform really well I mean emu I
worked really well on that product but
obviously there is so much to wonder
right now with everything that's
happening that we will keep you posted
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with the future Huawei operating
system we now have a confirmation and
the past we were only covering leaks
over the possible name now it's
confirmed it's going to be called Hong
Mango s at least in China and it's being
confirmed by a company's vice president
that it's already being tested in check
yesterday we covered rumors that it was
being tested by Oppo and other companies
now it's now official that it is and the
thing about it is he didn't provide any
details as to how this operating system
is better than Android but he was very
clear that the company is proud to use
Android that they really don't want to
launch this operating system that way
they would rather continue being a
company that pretend royde community but
obviously because of all the things that
are happening right now they're being
forced to launch on Mac OS as their
alternative and obviously this Spurs a
ton of questions and I asked you in the
questions down below I mean what do you
think if you have a company like Huawei
that wants to continue using Android do
you think that Google should figure out
a way or do you think that while we
should continue with their plans because
you know I think that because of
everything that's happening it's the
smartest thing for them to continue with
their plans even if Google changes their
mind but well the United States meaning
not Google we know that the problem is
not Google but then obviously the
question is do you think that there is
space that this operating system will
succeed or not because you know well we
has so much scale that I think they will
and I think this could come back and
bite Android but that's just me leave us

opinion friends again if you want to get
