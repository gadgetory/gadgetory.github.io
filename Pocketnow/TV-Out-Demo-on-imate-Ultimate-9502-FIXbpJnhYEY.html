pocket now calm and now we're going to
take a look at the TV out capabilities
of the i-mate ultimate 9502 in the box
you get this cable on one end there's a
mini USB cable and there's actually a
pass-through pass through there so if
you want to charge the device at the
same time you can and on the end other
end of the cable there are composite
cables so you have red yellow and white
so you can also output audio ok so the
setup we have here is a 42-inch LCD
television and I've got my eye my
ultimate 9502 connected to it and in
order to get the video feed going you
have to press a combination of keys
function and then symbol and there are
two display modes one is mirror mode so
that you see the same thing on both
displays and the second is external
display mode where you save a little bit
of bad battery power by having the
display on the 9502 shut down so I'm
going to pick up the device and go to
mirror mode and here's what we get the
quality is ok it's not that great we're
seeing you know vga resolution stretched
on a 1080p panel so it's not going to be
that great because we have the audio
pass through if I press play the audio
comes through through the TV so you can
have this connected to a larger set of
speakers if you're doing a presentation
for example something that bothers me
and I've tested this on multiple
displays is that the left side of the
screen is cut off i'm not sure why that
is if we go into settings for the TV out
there's not much we can change if we go
to system down to TV out there's only an
enable disable and you know resolution
obviously we're going to keep on ntsc so
that really bugs me the the cut off on
the left side of the screen if i flip it
to portrait this is what happens it
reorients itself so that you get the
right aspect but it still looks kind of
funky we can change the setting on the
TV so that it doesn't stretch the
display so it makes it look a little
better this is probably your best bet
actually so is this useful well I don't
know it depends on what your needs are I
mean if you're doing a powerpoint
presentation you don't want to bring in
the the whole laptop you could certainly
use this though I'm not really happy
about
quality because you can't get that high
resolution out of composite anyhow
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
