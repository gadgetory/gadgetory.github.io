and spare batteries how do they work
together and what do you need to keep in
mind when you get a new one
that's what we're gonna talk about in
this week's episode of the Android guy
weekly so NFC or near field
communication is something that most new
phones are starting to come with notice
I said starting to come with there have
been a few phones that have had NFC in
them in the past the Galaxy Nexus is one
a lot of the the galaxy phones from
Samsung and of course the Nexus S which
is also a samsung phone but as
popularity increases you're going to see
NFC in more and more devices and why is
that well NFC stands for near field
communication and it lets you
communicate simple bits of information
at very short distances so it's not
bluetooth it's not Wi-Fi it's not
anything like that instead it's the
ability for your phone to communicate
with another device which might be
something as simple as a sticker to be
able to send information back and forth
now if you remember the old old old
Pocket PC days do you remember how all
of those devices had an infrared port
that you could beam information across
kind of like that but really not that
much it's very slow and it has very very
limited information transfer that's why
I bring up the whole infrared transfer
thing but it doesn't really have to be
fast in this case with NFC because
you're sending such small little bits of
information well what can you do with it
one of the main things that you can do
introduced with Ice Cream Sandwich is
the ability to share information with
another device also with NFC with it
turned on with Ice Cream Sandwich so you
know not a whole ton of people out there
yet but it's really cool when you find
someone that you can if you want to
share this episode of the Android guy
weekly with your friend you just open it
up you're looking at it on your phone
you're watching it on the subway or
whatnot and hey it's awesome you want to
share it with your buddy all you
have to do is hold your phone up to the
back of his phone and beep there you go
it says hey do you want to share this
you tap your screen he then gets that
information right there you can do the
same thing with web pages with business
cards with calendar appointments all
kinds of stuff it's really really a cool
technique in technology something else
that you can do it doesn't have to be a
phone that you're doing that with you
know phone to phone you can do that with
a sticker kind of like barcode scanning
with QR codes so you can get information
to your phone quicker that way you can
also through the use of an app and
specialized hardware use it as a credit
card now how does that work well
especially with the Nexus family the
Nexus S began and then the Galaxy Nexus
next that was a lot of Nexus wasn't it
anyway what you can do is tap the back
of your phone to a payment terminal a
pay pass terminal and beep be able to
pay for whatever it is that you're
buying with the credit card stored on
your phone now there are some pretty big
caveats that go along with that that
will tackle in an upcoming article not
an episode of the of the Android go
weekly so you're going to have to go
over to pocketnow.com
and keep up with my articles over there
to be able to read about some of the
caveats with Google Wallet that just
came up and a threat by the way you'll
want to make sure you get that it's kind
of fun so now that we've covered kind of
what NFC is and what it does how does it
do it well NFC is very very simply a
transceiver there's a chip in
specialized phones that lets you
transmit this very short bit of
information and it also has an antenna
that lets you receive very small bits of
information and the system works
together pretty well well I don't know
if you've been keeping track in smart
phones and tablets and whatnot how many
antenna
do you have in there antennas and 10 I
let us know which one you prefer in the
comments there's lots of these little
buggers in there you've got bluetooth
you've got Wi-Fi you've got CDMA you've
got GSM
in the same phone you've got HSPA you've
got edge you lots and lots of stuff
sometimes they're built into the same
antenna sometimes they're separate
antennas and they're just a lot of them
so where are you gonna cram this extra
antenna which in all honesty has to be
somewhat large comparatively speaking
these NFC antenna are very both are big
but you don't see them anyway they don't
add any bulk to the phone so how do they
do that they do that through your
battery now there's some confusion going
around that says that NFC chips are
inside your battery not true in fact
let's go ahead and read this battery
right there says Samsung near-field
communication in fact it says it on both
sides of the battery so a lot of people
think well if I want to have near field
communication I have to have a paddle
battery can I take a battery and put it
in my non NFC phone and tada now I've
got NFC in my older phone no you can't
or how about this I've got Google Wallet
on here but I've got this error message
that says that my NFC chip is borked
can I just swap out the battery and have
it work no you can't sorry and why is
that the whole reason behind that is
because that's not your NFC chip that's
your antenna the NFC chip is still
stored tightly inside your phone your
antenna there's used to help transmit
the signal and receive the incoming
signal as well very very simple but they
didn't say with near-field communication
antenna they just said near field
communication so what about spare
batteries can you get a spare battery
pop it in your phone and have your phone
still work well if it is an actual
legitimate battery then yes you can
meaning if it's a name-brand battery
specific for your phone from your phone
manufacturer you're you're good to go
you're just fine as long as it's the
model for your phone I haven't seen any
yet that are say a replacement for the
Galaxy Nexus that don't include the NFC
antenna
there might be some out there I just
haven't seen any so keep that in mind
when looking at replacement batteries or
spare batteries extended batteries which
this one is not also come with in
general the NFC stuff built-in so you're
probably okay there where do you get
into some problems well if you get
generic batteries that all it is is a
battery they may or may not have that
NFC antenna in them so you need to be
kind of aware of that how about
knock-offs
you know you find some deal on eBay
where you can get a extended battery for
3 bucks there's probably something wrong
with that battery you either it's a
refurb or it was a reject or it's
counterfeit and if it's counterfeit they
usually just take the label and reprint
it the the manufacturers label slap it
on their fake battery and there you go
so it's not a Samsung battery and you
know what it probably doesn't have B in
it so if your NFC stops working with
your spare battery probably want to see
if you can get a refund for that but if
you stick with authorized distributors
if you stick with name brands you're
probably okay and you'll still be able
to use your NFC now that's implying that
you're using your NFC now if you're not
I encourage you to take a look at some
of the things we talked about in this
video to see what you can do with NFC my
personal favorite is exchanging business
cards I don't have to do it through a QR
code but I can if someone has a phone
with NFC I can very quickly and easily
exchange business cards just by tapping
our phones together as long as they have
NFC and Ice Cream Sandwich so it's
really really a cool thing and then of
course I can fall back to QR code if I
need to so that's my favorite thing to
do with NFC now it's your turn we want
to know two things from you in this
week's episode one is what's your
favorite thing to do with NFC let us
know in the comments down below the
second thing is have you gotten an
extended battery for your phone and if
so were you aware of the need to have
this NFC antenna in it or not let us
know that down in the comments below as
well so I think that's going to wrap it
up for
talking on NFC and spare batteries if
you have any other questions at all of
course leave those also in the comments
below make sure you head on over to
pocketnow.com and leave comments on that
article and see the other news now just
a reminder we do have another article
coming up at pocket now it's not gonna
be on the youtube channel you'll have to
go over to the website and check it out
it's gonna be under my name so just look
for me you'll know it when you see it it
involves Google Wallet and a threat if
you like this video and the Android guy
weekly make sure you give it a big
thumbs up let me know how you're doing
on the homework assignment from last
week where we challenged you to share
our wolves sheep and sheepdogs with
everybody else I want an update on that
also in the comments and anything else
that you want to feedback let us know as
well for PocketNow the android guy
weekly and NFC in batteries I'm Joe the
Android guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
