now
here is part two of my video review of
the verizon smt 5800 windows mobile 6
standard smartphone today we are going
to look at bluetooth connectivity the
smt 5800 is a bluetooth 2.0 + edr device
it uses the microsoft bluetooth stay
here is my toy box of Bluetooth devices
all of these devices I've reviewed on
pocketnow.com we have over here the
trans system I blue 737 gps receiver a
real nice small gps receiver works quite
well with the smt 5800 although it's too
bad that yes we can't use the smt 5800 s
internal GPS chip directly for headsets
I use a v12 LCD from blue ant in it
works very well with the smt 5800 I also
displays caller ID coming in so I put
this in my pocket pull it out I can tell
who's calling before answering the call
without having to look at the phone I
use my old motorola HT 820 headsets
which i reviewed a while ago Motorola's
gone on to produce newer headsets but i
haven't tried them this headset works
very well again with this it s mt 5800
in terms of the top-of-the-line
earphones we've got the etymotic ER 88
and they really sound very good with the
smt 5800 a new product I'm just testing
now is the the altec lansing inmotion
sound blade a bluetooth speaker which
also acts as a headset it has a
microphone built in to give you a little
bit of a sense of what it sounds like
we'll try it on the sound blade so we'll
turn this device
on all that down turn on the SMT 5800
you should connect okay so now we've
connected bring up media player and then
let's play this song from my Nicolette
Larson here we can adjust the volume
from here or from the device itself so
you've got you've got a choice we can go
to the next song on the device this is
writers of the storm
and every produces the sound quite well
so all in all I would say this is a very
capable Bluetooth device so the SMT 5800
did real well with all these devices so
it's Bluetooth capability I would say is
excellent it also connects to laptops in
desktop PCs using Windows XP and Windows
Vista using activesync or windows mobile
device center the one thing that is
missing from the Bluetooth connectivity
is a modem profile you cannot use this
device out of the box as a tethered
modem off of your laptop you actually
have to use a USB cable to enable that
function so this about does it for
today's video review and I'll be back
with my next part 3 video review and
we'll go over some software applications
that can run on the smt 5800 that's all
for now bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
