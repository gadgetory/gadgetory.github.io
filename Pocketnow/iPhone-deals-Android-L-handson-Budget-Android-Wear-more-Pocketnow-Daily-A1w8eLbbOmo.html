price drops available at Walmart Samsung
has decided to join t-mobile and giving
you a trial for a week and if you
haven't seen our preview of Android L
you should be doing so right now I'm hi
Mary vera and my friday weekend meter is
about to explode everyone and I'm sure
yours is too this is pocket now daily
just a couple of hours after we filmed
the parking out daily yesterday Android
L Developer Preview went live and Joe
leave I got his hands on it you can bet
his video is already live links in
description watch for a full coverage of
everything that Android L offers it is
extremely compelling and i wish i had a
nexus 5 right now another official news
walmart is trying to make it more
compelling to get rid of some iphone
stock if you're in the market to buy an
iphone right now Walmart is the place
150 bucks for the iphone 5s fifty
dollars for the iphone 5c and if you
already have a smartphone they've got
some really good deals on sony microsd
cards 16 bucks for 32 gigs $33 for 64
gigs that is crazy you should be there
and after t-mobile's uncarrier five
point 0 event where they're allowing you
to give an iphone 5s a test or a week to
see if you like their network and then
choose if you want to take the phone or
not samson is just joined the wagon but
in an even hotter deal will give you a
galaxy s5 I galaxy note 3 but they also
allow you to take one of their gear
smartwatch just the test yes you can
test the gear aside from the smartphone
just to see how all three the network
the phone and the wearable work together
Lynn cistercian for full details this is
a great deal now on very unexpected news
Google's engineering director David
Burke was recently interviewed and he
was very concerned that all of us are
worried that the nexus lineup is dying
to which he confirmed that it's not
going anywhere the Nexus lineup will
happen and there will be products this
year according to him it is
intrinsically tied to the way google
launches android and obviously since
android l is not ready i guess we're
gonna have to wait for that to happen
which will be in the fall so great news
totally unexpected and finally for the
very hot news
the day though these are kind of rumors
it seems that there are wearables that
are coming that are more affordable from
Android wear which is totally expected
that's really what androids bottle is
and apparently a sous will be the
company that will be driving these more
affordable wearables we're talking about
price tags between 100 and 150 dollars
which is great we don't have a timeline
for when these products will launch but
since Android wear is already available
it should take only a little time but
that means you to the question of the
day what would be the perfect price tag
for you to buy an android wear product
in my case honestly it really depends on
the product i mean i'm willing to pay
three hundred dollars for the Moto 360
just because of its design and i
wouldn't pay what the LG G watch costs
for whatever because i don't like its
design but it all depends again on what
the product looks like leave us a
comment down below what would be the
perfect price tag for you to buy friends
you know the drill if you want to get
the news earlier before this video is
filming sure you follow us on packing
our common structure youtube channel as
well you'll also follow me on twitter
Jaime underscore iveta please give this
video thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am hi Mary better thank you very
much for watching we will see you next
