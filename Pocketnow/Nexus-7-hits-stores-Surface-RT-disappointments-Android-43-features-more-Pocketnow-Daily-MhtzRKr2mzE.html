though we're still a bit early so the
Balmer speaks about their
disappointments with the surface RT and
if you haven't gone Android 4.3 on your
Nexus we'll teach you how I'm Jaime
Rivera and listen if you don't want to
celebrate the fact that today's Friday
fine I'll celebrate alone this is
PocketNow daily let's start off with
some interesting news is Android 4.3 is
making it slowly to the masses some
people have gotten it some people
haven't and as it turns out there are
some hidden features that are being
discovered like selective app
permissions which wasn't mentioned
anywhere but it seems that you have that
option now so stay tuned as this a
hidden feature becomes unhidden by other
people and most probably will be finding
new things and if you're still
struggling to get Android 4.3 on your
Nexus device hit the links in the
description and we'll teach you how
Joe's video is pretty descriptive on how
to get it done now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy Note 3 aside from reports
that it's not getting a fingerprint
scanner
apparently sammy hasn't really decided
what size they're gonna bring to this
device there's reports that the device
is being tested in 5.5 inches 5.7 inches
and 6 inches and index to wonder why so
late I mean they should already be
building this phone but anyways which
size do you prefer leave us a comment
and speaking of hot devices that are
coming soon we've got some leaked
photographs of the sony onami being
compared against the Xperia Z there's a
full gallery of the device being
compared to the links down below and as
it turns out there isn't much of a size
difference this new flagship smartphone
looks pretty much like an Xperia Z only
it's kind of 20 megapixel camera so stay
tuned as the rumors develop now let's
talk about Microsoft the Steve Ballmer
just had an internal meeting with his
team in reportedly well they talked
about a lot of things including the fact
that Ballmer is extremely disappointed
at the excess of inventory that they
have with the surface RT because it
didn't sell well at all as it turns out
this is part of the reason why they have
almost 700 million dollars in losses and
aside from that well he's also
disappointed at the fact that when those
products aren't really selling well so
with all these bad numbers it's
interesting to see what's Microsoft next
move and finally for the hot news of the
day if you couldn't wait to
get your hands on the new Nexus 7 well
retailers couldn't wait to sell it to
you and not even Google they're already
selling the tablet and you can bet we
already got ours for our non-marking
treatment links down below to watch the
taylor Martens video and so far as it
turns out the tablet is as beautiful as
Google is boasting that it is so that
leads you to the question of the day are
you ordering or getting this new Nexus 7
in my particular case it's not that I'm
ordering I already ordered the damn
thing so leave us a comment down below
what are you doing of course as always
for an earlier scoop of everything
that's happening in the smartphone it's
a little mushy follow us our parking out
comment subscribe to our YouTube channel
as well you also follow me on Twitter
and hang out underscore Iveta
let's give this video a thumbs up if you
like what you saw I am creme de banana
