this week but to some the LG G watch is
the more pure manifestation of Google's
new SmartWatch platform so how does it
fare as the more minimal ambassador of
Android wear let's find out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our video review of the LG g
watch the mission of a SmartWatch is to
make life easier
to improve on the experience of using a
smartphone by allowing you to keep it in
a pocket or across the room while at the
same time not missing messages calls and
emails and other notifications the
nondescript
water-resistant G watch does a fairly
good job of delivering those
notifications popping up inbound
messages on cards modeled after those
from Google now these cards are the
anchor point of the whole OS containing
everything from weather reports to
calendar items to how many steps you've
taken and so on all the while the G
watch is also telling you the time with
one of many available watch faces on its
IPS LCD which is not as crisp as some
others we've seen but which delivers
vibrant color fair daylight visibility
and good touch response there's also an
always-on mode available so you don't
need to tap the watch to see the time
it'll show a power saving watch face
until you raise it at which point
usually the display comes to life and
the Snapdragon processor spins up inside
and here's where the G watch becomes
something more with the screen on an
Android wear device will respond to
voice commands you can tell the watch to
send a message
take a note plot a course to the closest
dance club or whatever and translate
words into other languages and more you
can also launch apps with your voice
third-party titles are limited to just a
few for now but they're off to a good
start already in terms of layout and
polish and functionality - it's really
handy to have a food recipe right on
your wrist when you're cooking and being
able to say hail a cab to your watch in
order to summon a lift is just awesome
that's just a sample of what's already
in place and if the rapid growth and
third-party wallpapers is any indication
the future is bright for the Android
Ecosystem unfortunately we're not quite
there yet and everywhere you look with
the G watch you're presented with a
reminder of just how 1.0 this version of
Android wear really is that starts with
the hardware which is so bare-bones it's
almost like a reference design you'll
need to change that 22 millimeter wrist
band if you want to add a little pizzazz
the more irritating shortcomings are in
software with our number one complaint
being voice dictation one of the great
things about Android wear is that it's
not a one-way notifier like other
smartwatches
in theory it allows you to dictate
replies to but honestly it's bugs City
if the person you're texting with sends
another message while you're drafting
one the watch will act as though it's
sent your message but it hasn't also the
voice prompt has a hair-trigger which
forces you to rush unnaturally not even
giving you enough time to think before
it sends and if your message goes too
long well you might as well just pull
out your phone because that's not gonna
work either
sorry period that's what happens when
you try to say too much in an email
period because apparently emails are
only meant to be like 10 words long
period fish period didn't catch that in
contrast to voice dictation on most
Android phones this is an infuriating
feature that diminishes the entire
Android wear experience unless you're
just saying yes or no and if Google's
intention was to limit you to that it
could have just incorporated preset
replies like other smartwatches do we're
hoping for other usability fixes to the
homescreen cards change positions
seemingly at random and if you clear one
accidentally you'll have to go to your
phone or risk a quick voice command to
get it back
same thing with third-party apps which
are very beneath everything else in a
list of input suggestions that might as
well be hidden we get at Google we're
supposed to talk to the watch but even
if it worked flawlessly we don't always
want to talk to it thankfully there's
already a third-party launcher app to
address this which again bodes well for
the future the G watch also occasionally
disconnects for seemingly no reason at
all which is of course
annoying the G watch comes with a sturdy
magnetic charging cradle that you can
stick to your bedside table and it works
very well a good thing since you'll be
charging the G watch at least every
other night we've been able to squeeze
two days out of it with light use but
that's further than you're likely to get
after eight days of testing the G watch
with several Android smartphones we've
got a good handle on its ups and downs
on the bright side it's not bad looking
it does it's a notification job fairly
well and most importantly it packs some
very cool potential we do expect it to
quickly improve over time and we're
looking forward to the after the buzz
treatment in a few months but the LG G
watch is on sale right now then between
the buggy voice interface unintuitive UI
and unimpressive battery life but we
can't say we'd recommend it in its
current form to anyone but the most
die-hard Android tinkerers if you're
curious how the other Android wear
launch device fares check out our
Samsung gear live review available right
now here on YouTube and also see how the
two match up in our head-to-head
comparison until next time this has been
