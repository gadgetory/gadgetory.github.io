better from pocketnow.com and this is
Angela denied and mwc has just finished
we're here at Barcelona everything's
being packed up here at the feeder and
well let's talk about the things that we
liked about the show and obviously what
we didn't like okay so our general
thoughts about mwc was that while the
show was well organized I could probably
say that it was even better organized at
CES at least transportation wise at
least the boots wise i think the
company's brought even more stuff but i
was again just like CES expecting more i
wish i could have seen more devices at
the yesterday's mwc was probably a
little bit bigger and i don't know i
feel that everything was just
incremental Yeah right because you know
devices the device wise i was at least
personally expecting more quad cores
everything was about quad core the
anticipation the buzz but we got a
couple of phones which were quad core
than a couple of tablets but at the end
of the day it was either quad core for
Wi-Fi or 3g only because of the
limitations someone with snapdragon dual
cores it's a little bit iffy plus ice
cream sandwich it was missing we had it
but still we had some phones like so
many phones which were running
Gingerbread exactly exactly yeah we had
HTC running for example how they had ice
cream sandwich but just think about it I
mean they brought their 1 z 1 V was it
yeah one day and it wasn't even ready
for the show and well we were expecting
the HTC Quattro nowhere to be found so
mwc was good but frankly we're expecting
something better okay now so about
Android and this is the fourth show it
was this year's MVC it was last year's
NBC was this year's CES and last year's
CES Android was all over I mean Windows
Phone of course was present but they are
still playing catch-up we saw three pose
to nokia and ones that TV phone and we
saw millions of angry
android it's got what it takes to be
present on the market they are
constantly pushing with updates with new
incremental versions when this phone is
still catching up and of course other
platforms are insignificant yeah
probably one of the things that I like
the most about Android is that
definitely we wanted to see ICS and
everything but I have to agree with Tony
and the fact that we saw more ICS this
year that we saw gingerbread last year
so definitely things are working better
it seems that Android Google are working
better with OEMs and pushing ICS to
their new devices and not having froyo
devices being launched and the quantity
that we have last year in comparison to
Gingerbread so yeah I feel that the
state of Android is positive it's
innovating icss were dead where it has
to be Joe Levi disagrees a little bit in
his passive to Tory oh but I understand
Joe and the fact that well it could be
better it should definitely be better it
should be even more unified but I think
that Google is doing a good job and
we'll probably see even better
innovation and shows to come probably
ctia okay let's talk about the state of
Windows Phone I mean honestly Microsoft
is one of those companies that even rent
the hotel at the other side of the road
just to come all out with everything we
were expecting more about Windows Phones
I mean we pretty much like Tony
introduced right now we only got a
couple of devices there's nothing new
about some of them I mean we're really
not sure what's going on with Microsoft
we were expecting this really big boom
but sadly the whole show floor is taken
by Windows 8 in a mobile world congress
surely Windows 8 is going to be all
about tablets eventually but it
currently is and it's still in customer
preview so I don't I don't know what's
going on I think maybe that's normal
maybe they are somehow preparing for
windows 8 and maybe Windows Phone 8 and
leaving windows phone 7 as it is right
now we were expecting tango and the only
device running to angle what the new ZTE
orbit we were expecting some new phones
like we had seen the LG miracle Windows
Phone being licked or or maybe the new
Sony prototype which has been leaked
last year but instead we got to nokia
phones the 900 which is really not a new
phone was introduced with a TNC over at
CES and the new 610
three phones Microsoft this is not the
Aegean and by far even high-end yeah
lumia 900 was pretty much the only thing
you know home exactly exactly so kind of
disappointed it Windows Phone we love
the platform I mean hey you're an MVC
gonna be seen here in MVP I mean it we
love the platform we couldn't agree more
with where Microsoft is taking things we
just wish we saw more momentum so again
this could probably be a show floor for
ctia for windows phone we're hoping
that's going to be the story we were
expecting some there's one more thing I
mean windows 8 and probably say hey this
is Windows Phone 8 which is Apollo and
here's what's coming up probably being
released in the fall this was the
perfect time frame for that to happen
sadly it's not have any one more thing I
was expecting maybe at least one HTC
windows phone agree they had something
at CES but that was made night in the
Titan to I was expecting the Titan shoot
to be launched in Europe oh yeah true
that's a good point they do your little
camera coming it was in the case and and
that's another thing I mean no 16
megapixel camera come out to the
1-series no but we have the 808 that
we'll talk about that soon yeah okay so
now that we talked about a couple of
things which we did not like let's see
what we really liked and i'm referring
to devices what were those hot devices
which which impressed you and maybe what
were those devices which will be your
next devices as far as I'm concerned my
next phone will be the same as my next
tablet is the bathroom it's something
new it's something interesting it's a
concept which we all know about and this
goes for android of course it's ICS and
as long as Windows Phone is concerned
I'll have to go with the Lumia 900 but
really because you don't have to sure
exactly but maybe just maybe i'll pass
on the Lumia 900 and get the PureView
808 I love that phone how about you
having okay my case particularly I think
HCC was the company that went all out
this year I mean the 1-series was
probably what we were expecting every
other HTC phone looks exactly the same
so it's like why not just make one
series of phones and keep keep the same
name the One X is definitely going to be
my next device I probably debated why
did we get polycarbonate on the one x
and y did we get the aluminum
backing on the 1's but still i mean i
think that the specs of the 1x are
beautiful the whole ecosystem around the
1x with the whole car dock with the
whole media hub that we reviewed i think
that the whole banana looks just
promising for the future hcc i think
they figured it out i think they figured
out that it's not just about the phone
it's not just about a ton of phones it's
not about doing everything it's about
doing one thing and doing it right so i
think the 1-series is probably the best
thing i mean aside from that well
tablets um I'd have to agree with you
I'd like I like the PadFone but then the
day the phone a single tablet okay the
because nothing to work without the
photo I know I know but but still I feel
that if it wasn't the one x for example
we definitely got the the Sony Xperia S
that we're currently reviewing this is
probably the second phone that I liked
and probably the the reason why I liked
it and we're going to show you in a
video soon is about the smart tabs I
mean they figured some of the smart tags
more tabs on the NFC technology that's
built into these phones in the whole
ecosystem around them all the apps that
are included in the phone and the
software Maria will show you soon I
think that it's really good and then
decide from that theah souza the the
other transformer yeah the said that the
infinity 700 was really good we had a
lot of really good devices and then we
have a lot of Chinese devices that were
not even going to rise talk about so
that was the good part let's talk about
the bad now ok so talking about the bad
things let's start with the phones
everybody knew that there will be no
samsung galaxy s3 at the show but
samsung run a couple of low-end mid-end
phones like the Samsung Galaxy Beam the
h2 the minutes you and the galaxy s
advance I mean those are new phones of
course but people want to see high-end
devices they want to see quad-core that
aside ZTE and this is a personal
experience of mine I wanted to film a
hands-on with the Zetas but it's awkward
it's a quad-core Yates it's got Tegra
free and i picked up the unit and it
didn't it not only had no gorilla glass
on it it has plastic and it was full of
scratches like my like my sunglasses so
i decided to ask for another unit and
they didn't have one so i just passed on
that video for cheap devices there of
course slow and cheap budget devices but
i think they should do better my biggest
disappointment here was LG
I mean I think that LG still can't
figure it out first of all well they
brought a couple of good phones but you
saw our review of the 4x I mean it
completely crashed and and here's the
deal a lot of people in the YouTube
comments are telling us hey you're being
too hard on them it's like this is a
show floor and it's open to the press
we're definitely going to bash something
that doesn't work and sadly none of the
LG devices work as we expected the three
final why should I show it exactly i
mean i think that yeah we're complaining
about the HTC One V not even being
available but I think that that was like
the smartest thing to do if it's not
ready if the ROM is not ready just don't
come and show it i mean with it we can't
we can't talk good about something
that's unfinished and for them to not
having to eat enough respect for the
press to do things completely well for
us to either talk good about or talk bad
so you've been told that the experience
will be the same as on the One X think
so they told you say exactly so in my
case in particular for example LG LG
needs to figure it out their new UI for
Android looks good but it was crashing
it wasn't working and then hey the l7 l3
l5 forget about those phones i mean we
started filming the hands out of the l7
and you know i'll probably upload it
just to have it there in YouTube but to
be honest with you it wasn't even worth
it it was a terrible device sadly
nothing that I was expecting and then
obviously Huawei why didn't we even yeah
we had a couple of videos of Huawei uh
we can also upload those just to have
him in YouTube yeah but sadly guys I
mean Huawei they went all out they had
cars they had the show floor everything
said Huawei everything scream wanhua way
except their phones and accept their
tablets except that one essen phone
which we really saw at CES they brought
up to nvc it's a little bit of
improvement but it's not the a game
which they need to get into the market
exactly that's the only way they're
gonna get a game show sadly for us I
mean I feel that LG LG come on you're
capable of more you're right now on the
rocks you really need to do some work so
next time let's let's hope that you get
your act together you really need some
top people your engineering the design
was beautiful but if the software is not
there it's not going to sell yeah I'm
rula they brought popping let's forget
about more oh no they didn't even bring
anything to see yes true so anyways
that's it okay so to end our mwc
coverage let's talk about our biggest
winners in our biggest loser in my
particular case Tony I have to be honest
with you I think that definitely Sony
went all out but gingerbread totally
killed though you got the sticker on the
boxes that says it'll be upgradeable to
Ice Cream Sandwich question when
questioned when nope specific dates
let's say they said and the VAP row Sony
could have been the winner if only they
would have brought ICS on their phones
my biggest winner right now is HTC
they've not only brought ICS but I'm a
big fan of sense since four point Ellen
sense four-point-oh was beautiful again
I it was sluggish in the in the dual
core I hope they were find it in the end
when we tested in the quad core it was
definitely there i feel that HTC is on
the right track for me they're the
biggest winner and obviously for me the
biggest loser sadly LG I was expecting
more as i mentioned and well tablets
well you know I was waiting for more
tablets that's my particular case I mean
what's your biggest winner pretty well
there's not too many to choose from
really but a sous really had three great
tablets on the show they got quad core
and they got the bat phone that's an
awesome product I don't know if it will
sell well but it's a new concept so for
me definitely a sous is the winner in
tablet if they price it right it's gonna
be a killer the price is what I'm afraid
of most yeah and in terms of phones I'd
say that the biggest loser is nakia of
course they got B nine hundred and they
got a PureView 808 but everybody
expected more they're not yet everybody
wants them to rule the market as they
once ruled and this is their market I
mean exactly its home turf okay so right
now what we've got next to ctia and
we've also got something that's coming
in next week the ipad 3 event agree i
mean i think that this was the
opportunity for companies to tell the
market hey forget about the ipad this is
Sue's tablet is better and then you look
at the ax sous coverage of the azuz
exposure I mean they had their booth
everything was nice no fancy keynote
great show mobile yeah I mean a sous was
probably the biggest winner in tablets
there was no sluggishness on ICS on the
asuste tablet they performed perfectly I
think a sous is probably going to be
like the winner and tablets from here on
sadly the ACC Quattro nowhere to be
found if it ever will have nobody knows
that but the sous should have tried to
push the tablets harder everybody knew
the iPad cream was coming as time I said
this would have been their chance this
would have been their chance we already
know that Android totally dominates the
market it doesn't really matter if Apple
brings anymore iPhones Android would
still be the dominating platform but
again huh tablets this was the show for
tablets and sadly it wasn't it could be
ctia we're not really sure but it could
be that companies are waiting for the
ipad 3 to come out for them to come out
with whatever they're going to come out
next yeah sure probably ctia is going to
see more phones and more tablets than
ever will show in they of course IFA so
we're definitely going to be covering
each of these events hopefully we'll see
