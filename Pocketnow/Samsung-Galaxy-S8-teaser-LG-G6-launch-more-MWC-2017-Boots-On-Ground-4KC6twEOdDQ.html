about to kick off here we just made it
to our Airbnb a nice little pad here
getting really excited for what's going
to be arriving at the show floor this
year I'm Juan Carlos Wagner and I'm
Jaime better let's go through everything
we expect to see at the show
just remember Mobile World Congress is
probably one of the biggest shows that
we hit it's probably gonna be the most
amount of work
we're expecting a ton of things from
different companies we're not really
expecting much when it comes to things
like tablets or smart watches we do
expect to see something but not at least
anything that we could call significant
so with a spotlight over to Nokia mainly
because hmd has been teasing that we
should expect at least three smart
phones at this show we've seen the Nokia
six being launched in China it's
beautiful design underwhelming
specifications we're expecting at least
one of these products to be a flagship
bring good specifications etc in
addition to that we're also expecting
companies like ZT to show off new
technologies you know ZT is more than
just smartphones the company is pretty
much the second when it comes to
smartphone spectrum LTE connectivity the
company plans to show us something
related to 5g with its gigabit phone
that we don't expect that to be a final
product for sale it's just hey this is
5g Oppo has been teasing us with 5x we
don't know what it means but we suspect
it might mean the Apple iPhone 7 plus
optical zoom
/ to Motorola maybe it'll be the g5 the
g5 plus you're gonna have to stay tuned
for more details and of course they're
Sony the story with Sony is almost
always the same we're expecting big and
we're being delivered less between Moto
G 5s and 5g LTE LG's feeling fly like a
g6 like a g6 like a g6 already a hotly
discussed phone we've got a couple
videos teasing what we might see on the
show floor we're pretty certain we've
got the specs down pretty tight just a
few unanswered questions from LG as to
what they're gonna do with their next
flagship device you know it's funny the
most interesting product at CES 2017 was
the new blackberry but we only got a
teaser we're expecting to actually see
the final product with final software
and all the functionality here at MWC it
was a gorgeous phone at least for some
of us and we can not wait to see the
final thing but in addition to that we
don't expect that to be
the only product room DCL obviously
there is also all Cattell and we do
expect to see something from the company
hopefully the new idol we will see also
Huawei in the hizzy after a string of
pretty successful product launches from
honors to the p9 to the mate nine p10
already wetting our appetites a series
of really cool specs that keren 960
chipset in the mate nine already turned
up processing power and the next next
generation dual camera system partnered
up with Leica we're definitely
anticipating a successful launch from
Huawei this year on the show forth and
finally to wrap this video of probably
the hottest product that we were
expecting to see is probably a no-show
the Samsung Galaxy s8 why well Samsung
has pretty much come clear that it will
not announce a product that this show
but the company still does have an event
or expecting Galaxy s8 to be part of
some sort of unpacked event later in the
year and therefore we wonder exactly
what we are getting from Samsung we have
heard that we might see a teaser the
Galaxy s8 in addition to other products
and that would be great to see but it
leads me to the question of this video
we would love to know what you are
predicting to see at MWC in addition to
what you're expecting most which is the
product that has you most excited
obviously each of us has different
opinions here so leave us a comment down
below we would love to know which ones
are yours as always thanks so much for
