was a great phone for a great price now
there's a second-generation let's unbox
it see what you can expect the Moto G is
a budget device and the box itself says
budget too let's go ahead and take a
look around we've got the nice device
they're sitting on the front relatively
playing sides barcodes and whatnot on
that side over on the back you've got
your specs I've already cut into this to
make it a little bit easier to open but
no box inside a box just a nice lift out
then we've got the device sitting on the
front now this is the white version go
ahead and pull that out and set it aside
just for the time being open this up
it's unusual to see a power cord at
rather than a USB wall wart with the USB
cable we saw it with a moto 360 but
that's a SmartWatch here I guess it's a
cost-saving measure but we'll go ahead
and set that aside we'll look at the the
books that we have down in the bottom
and really that's it there's nothing
else in there we have a get started
guide we've got another one for
multilingual stuff and then of course
we've got the the full manual so we'll
go ahead and put those in there set it
aside let's take a look at the the
device itself very much like the the
second-generation Moto X you've got
these big grills down here the top and
the bottom and these aren't quite as
pronounced they're not quite as Grilli
as they are on the the Moto X but
they're still very pronounced you've got
a nice bevel on the screen now this is
kind of unusual just going to say that
there was a little line gap around there
but that was just the the case not being
snapped on tight we've got our front
facing camera and of course other
sensors and whatnot on here go ahead and
take a look around like the Moto X the
Moto G has a top-mounted headphone jack
coming around to the side same kind of
button orientation button configuration
is the the X does where there's your
power button and your volume rocker so
right there underneath your
index and middle fingers if you're
right-handed holding it in your left
hand you've got our micro USB port on
the bottom nothing on that side moving
around the back we've got our motorola
dimple I think that's what we're calling
it now got our LED flash in our camera
we'll get into more details and specs
about those in the coming days so one of
the things about the the Moto G is this
back cover is very I was going to say
very easily removable go ahead and just
pop that off now over here we've got our
sim so we've already got a sim in there
looks like we have another sim trait
that could be in here for other regions
this one does not it's just a a molded
plate and then we've got a micro USB or
micro SD card rather up here on the top
so kind of nice got some other
information there now you can put all
kinds of different cases on here
motorola was kind enough to supply us
with a nice kind of a bright lime
reminiscent to what we've seen before
and of course a flip case or flip cover
which includes this little instruction
sheet we'll go ahead and take that out
set it aside and we'll take this one's
kind of a lavender fuchsia now if you
saw our Motorola power pack unboxing I
mentioned that it had a kind of a grippy
almost a rubbery texture to it not quite
rubbery but kind of that gives you that
kind of feeling well this is the same
kind of texture and its really nice it
feels good you're not going to drop this
snaps on to the phone very quickly and
easily I like it unlike some of the the
covers that we've seen before have this
nice thick front on it this does not
have a built-in battery to extend your
battery although that would be really
nice wouldn't it so there we go let's go
ahead and take this screen protector off
just so you can hear it and I'm doing
this so that Michael Fisher
and so you get to put up with me and my
wow this one is hard to do here we go
just like that power it on for the first
time so we can see what that display
looks like very nice subtle it's got
kind of a black border around it that we
haven't seen on some of the other
devices but I suspect that's just
because this is the more entry-level
Motorola and then the others are of
course a little bit higher in overall
nice I love the the way it feels in hand
it's nice it's lightweight but it's not
too light and of course with this nice
case on it is flip case I really dig it
that's how I like carrying my nexus 5
around with me so make sure you stay
tuned we're going to have a lot more
information about this we're going to
have some benchmarks and of course our
full review in the days and weeks to
come make sure you subscribe to our
video channel and of course follow us on
your favorite social media network we've
got a lot more information coming on
this cool little device in the next few
days and weeks as we do our full review
and additional coverage and you won't
want to miss out on any of that for
pocket now showing off the latest and
greatest from Motorola I'm Joe Levi
