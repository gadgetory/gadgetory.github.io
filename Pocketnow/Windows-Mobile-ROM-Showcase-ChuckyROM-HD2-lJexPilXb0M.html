pocketnow.com in a recent video we
showed the cell evo b1 rum for the HTC
hd2 since then we've gotten a lot of
requests and comments to show other roms
on video including the Chucky rum and I
loaded the Chucky ROM up on my HD 2 and
I've gotta say it's one of the most
impressive roms that I've found for the
HD 2 if you like something minimal and
clean this is perfect I'll show it to
you now ok so let's take a look at
Chucky ROM for the HD 2 again I'll push
the link on pocketnow.com on how to get
this so we're gonna slide to unlock and
the thing you'll notice right off the
bat about Chucky ROM is that it's very
minimal very elegant the theme is the
white color which is quite a deviation
from what you get in the standard HTC
black and compared to the previous round
that we showed you in the ROM showcase
the cell Evo v1 it's just a lot more
clean there's not as much I can debug
some people may appreciate that I
certainly do
so down here the Start menu bar has been
redone we have a sort of black strip
that floats on top of a white background
very clean very elegant I even think
it's been shrunken in size if we go to
the Start menu of the Start menu icons
are a little bit smaller so that
everything fits on the screen at one
time we can tap and drag and move things
around although that is standard to
Windows Mobile 6 point 5 point 3 and not
just this ROM so let's go back so here
we have cookies Home tab so we can do a
lot of fun things here we can expand
what we're doing today we can swipe to
the right to get more Quick Links we can
go down lots of gestures that you can do
with cookies Home tab and it's built
right into a Chucky ROM
so we can swipe to the right standard
HTC stuff we can go to the internet tab
and everything continues this really
nice and elegant white theme we even
have different icons here at the top and
of course tapping up there will bring up
HTC's notification area where you can
action on various system commands so
here in photos and video we can go into
landscape it has that really cool
animation and that white theme is
continued even here so we can tap on
this button and go into the standard
photo gallery okay let's go back and we
can go all the way to the right now
that I do want to point out and I have
to get to the right menu to do that I'll
do it in weather here and look how cool
this looks what the maker of this ROM
has done is made all of the menu items
thinner which is really handy because
sometimes an email and other
applications you get these really long
HTC menus that require you to scroll you
can't see the bottom choice without
scrolling but in this rom because all of
the items are are kind of thin here it's
much easier to see the menu options that
you are dealing with so this is Twitter
and footprints built right in it also
has a Facebook tab and some other
goodies as well and just a really cool
rom extremely elegant very easy on the
eyes and again it's called Chuck near on
and I'll post a link on PocketNow to get
to it please if you liked the video give
it a thumbs up and if you would in the
comments tell us what ROM you want to
see in the next ROM showcase from
pocketnow.com
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
