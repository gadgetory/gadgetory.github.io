of Apple's to new flagship smartphones
it's the intended replacement of the
iPhone 5 meaning you won't be able to
find the older phone on the shelves for
too much longer
so if you're in the market for a lower
end iPhone should you rush out and buy
last year's iPhone 5 or get a little
colorful with the brand new 5c i'm
michael fisher with pocket now let's
find out so the party line goes that the
new iPhone 5c is nothing more than an
iPhone 5 in a colorful new plastic
casing to some degree that's correct but
there are plenty of differences here
worth covering we'll talk about them in
terms of hardware software and some test
notes putting these phones side-by-side
it's hard to believe the 5c is the newer
model yes we're all used to the classic
style of the iPhone 5 by now with its
chamfered edges glass end caps and
smooth aluminum backing but despite its
design being a bit old hat
it still looks much more premium than
the toy-like 5c now don't take us the
wrong way there's a lot to like on the
five Cs build the added customizability
that comes with a choice of five colors
is a definite plus and we've seldom come
across a plastic phone that feels as
well made and partially due to the five
Cs
rigid steel frame lying beneath the
polycarbonate other details like button
size travel and feedback are impressive
and well done but there's no question
that the 5c feels like the cheaper of
the two devices it's more comfortable in
the hand thanks to its rounded corners
but the 5c was built as the lower end
alternative and it feels like it despite
its increase in weight and thickness in
terms of published specs the differences
are exceedingly minor the 5c is powered
by the same Asics processor and modem
combination as the iPhone 5 with the
same 1 gig of ram and its display is the
same exact panel as well the 5c does
pack a slightly larger battery and the
front-facing camera has seen a small
upgrade as well from the standpoint of
an end user everything else on the
hardware front is exactly the same
those similarities only multiplied on
the software side the newer iPhone 5c
runs iOS 7 out of the box but as Taylor
Martin demonstrated in his iOS 7 gold
master walkthrough video the iPhone 5
has no trouble running the new version
app launch times between the two devices
are exactly the same from stock to
third-party titles and responsiveness
throughout the interface is similarly
identical from multitasking to browser
performance to boot times the camera
results follow exactly in the pattern
you'd expect given the identical 8
megapixel shooters on the back of these
phones the pictures shot with iOS 7's
new stock viewfinder app are identical
in both HDR and non HDR shooting modes
colors are bright and edges are sharp in
most well-lit situations but low-light
is still a pretty big challenge compared
to newer phone cameras with optical
image stabilization is something not
included on either of these shooters
nevertheless photos are fine and videos
come out smooth and well balanced on
each on the other side the improvements
to the front-facing camera are minor but
they do result in slightly more accurate
coloring on the 5c there's not quite as
much parity in voice performance where
the 5c takes a small hit in quality
people we called said we came across
slightly muddier on the 5c without as
much of the crisp clearness the 5
delivered and we experienced the same on
our end the difference isn't major but
it's there
in terms of speakerphone there's almost
no difference in amplitude or clarity
which is solid on both devices
so taking in some YouTube videos or
Spotify tracks with the loudspeaker
shouldn't be a problem with either
device the differences between these
phones are so minor that the choice
between iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c is almost
entirely a cosmetic and aesthetic 1 if
you want the added customizability of
different casing colors and you don't
mind the feel of plastic in the hand the
5c is a very capable mid-range iPhone
but if you're looking for the same
responsive performance with slightly
better voice quality and a much more
premium build you'll want to snap up an
iPhone 5 while you still can folks
there's an iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s
review from pocket now coming shortly
and in the meantime be sure and check
out our comparisons including the 5s the
5 the 5c and every other device we can
get our hands on follow us on social
media and make sure to throw us a like
