pocketnow.com and if you saw my initial
software overview of the Samsung wave
you kind of saw me delve into some of
the basics of the Samsung bada operating
system however in this next video I'm
going to show you actually the browser a
browser test next to my sprint Evo I'm
also going to show you some of the flash
compatibility that the Samsung Wave
offers and then I'm also going to show
you some of the gaming and some of the
social networking apps that are
compatible with the phone that come on
the phone itself as well kind of talk
about the Samsung App Store so I won't
apologize ahead of time for the length
of the video I wanted to make sure that
I really touched upon everything that
was necessary because once again as I've
said before this is a brand new
operating system so I wanted to make
sure that I gave you guys the full
benefit of seeing the ins and outs and
everything there was to really see with
bada so let's get started all right and
we're back in I'm going to jump right
into testing the browser of the Samsung
Wave I actually have it next to my HTC
EVO at Sprint they are both on the same
home Wi-Fi network so there's really not
going to be any advantage between the
two phones in terms of the connectivity
goes but I do want to show you the speed
of the browser I mean kind of how how it
compares to some of the other operating
systems offerings as well one main thing
that I'm actually going to show first is
this browser has the ability to do flash
I'm gonna go ahead and bring this phone
up here so you can actually see it a
little bit better so right now we're we
are in the Internet what I want to do is
pull up the settings menu here I'll go
to the internet settings under the
Preferences tab you're gonna see the
ability to run flash which again I
showed in the software one video now
when it says run flash its I wouldn't
say it's a full-featured flash to say
the least if I go to a website for
example like our YouTube channel for the
pocket video in the desktop YouTube mode
mind you so now you're seeing the
desktop version of this now with a spot
where the video would be a zoom in here
you're actually seeing the flash logo so
it's not showing however what I find is
we come over here when we select one of
these
videos for example will shoes this video
here what it's now gonna do it's gonna
pull up the video so you kind of have to
initiate it we will assume back out a
little bit so you can see a little
better as you can see it's it's playing
it's not exactly fluid hundred-percent
there is a little bit of a stutter
almost almost a hesitation however I am
fairly impressed with what this can do
we can turn it in landscape mode and it
will set to play as you saw there I had
a hiccup you know that's one of the the
downsides is it does hiccup a little bit
when you're using flash but I compress
the replay button here and it will
actually replay it'll take a little bit
but it will actually play the video
again now what I want to go ahead and do
is test the browser speed between these
two browsers so what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go pocketnow.com right now just
the main website then uh hope the
Internet is well on my evo here so these
both have it's pretty much pre select
them and tip them both the same time on
the count of three one two three I've
selected them both what happens is you
can see the wave takes off it looks like
it's gonna win and it has loaded hasn't
load 107 of the stuff in terms of the
animations though if you look right here
it hasn't loaded some of the drops now
there you go though so the the wave
doesn't beat the Evo now that's pretty
impressive now you know grant it's not
showing the banner ad up here for
example and some of the other stuff on
the sides as well isn't showing up so
the Evo did load more I'm not really
sure why that is I think it's just part
of the browser with the way of however
it did load faster now in terms of the
overall navigation with the web browser
itself as you can see it's it's pretty
fluid it does jitter here and there it
almost has like a momentum snap with the
scrolling you do have your pinch-to-zoom
here it may just take a second for it to
actually fully render and clarify the
text pinch resuming works very well once
again it's very fluid you can actually
select let's say we pick an article here
so you can actually select one of these
articles and once that loads it will
give us
the ability to plate a YouTube video
directly from the page and it's gonna be
loading right here again it's a little
slow with some of this stuff it will
load a text site no problem
however the video down here as you can
see it took a little bit time to show up
there but I'm going to press the play
button and it will actually play right
here and it looks pretty good hope I'm
hoping my camera picks it up as well as
it actually looks but this looks almost
exactly like it what if you're viewing
ionic and a computer in terms of the
frame right it's pretty solid it's
pretty consistent
now if I press the tab button here I
have the ability to actually open up
different tabs now as you can hear the
video that I loaded before is actually
playing in the background
the whole thing gets picked up so I can
actually come back here now in the video
is once again still playing grand right
now it seems like it's locked up so it
does multitask fairly well in terms of
the browser it has a few little loose
ends that need to be tied up right now
it once again this is locked up to
playing the audio but not the video and
one of the next functions to actor that
I want to show you here is going to be
the ability to create a mobile hotspot
so if I go to the settings in the menu
here we go to the connectivity mobile ap
we now have the ability to create this
mobile hotspot so if I come in here you
can see you can share your phone's
mobile internet connection with PCs
three connections from this guy right
here so I'm going tethering and it
actually has the name with the password
now the next thing I want to show you
are some of these social networking
aspects that the bada and the Samsung
Wave offer so I go here into the app
menu itself
I had the social hub which will bring my
text messaging my email my facebook my
Twitter and also my myspace if I had one
in together into one hub location
however I'm going to show you each
individual app in that sense there's a
Facebook app which it
is a little slow once it actually comes
up but it will load the feet it's very
kind of archaic looking though to be
honest there's not really a whole lot
you can do with it you can do status
updates though obviously so now I'm
going to back out of this back into the
app selection we're going to the Twitter
app it's the same type of splash screen
that you see with the Facebook
application if I go to the actual
replies to me as you can see here when I
press the refresh button it actually
takes a little bit takes a little bit
longer than some of the applications
that I personally use for Twitter on my
other phones for example like on my evo
as you can see it's still going and now
it has loaded I can actually select this
here
and I can actually reply to it asphalt 5
comes pre-loaded on the device and it
looks fantastic the frame rate runs very
solid it's a good-looking game
especially with this screen on it I'm
just going to show you a quick little
playthrough of it do a quick race
nothing special here
takes a little bit of time too low but
it's a pretty big trek you use the
accelerometer to actually turn so you
would tilt the foam there's an onscreen
break button which you actually would
press to slow down you can see I'm
actually tilting the screen right now so
bring us a little closer hopefully you
get into it some justice the framerate
is actually fairly decent I can get a
little bit of cloture that people you'll
actually see that it gets a little
choppy at times the closer I get to some
of these races there's actually little
boost power-ups that I have so I'm
running like a turbo boost right now
some reason this car seems a little too
slow but if I could actually catch up to
some of these cars you'd see that it
gets a little choppy because of all the
action on screen kind of hard playing
through my camera but what I'm gonna do
is I'm actually gonna leave this now a
little choppy there I'm gonna back out
of this application and I'm gonna show
you a different one that I've actually
notices has a very cool feature and some
of the more simple games offer this as
well to go to the games is also a lot
more games around here but parachute
panic in particular very very basic game
pretty addicting pretty fun to play
simple concept guys jump out of an
airplane you have to guide them onto
your ship think it's loading right now
and it has like a little song that it
sings in plays I make a brand new game
and I'll put it on the normal so you see
these this airplane is gonna drop a
parachute guy down now he's falling now
if I press the end button here I can
actually minimize this game so now it's
minimized so now what I want to do I can
go onto the feeds and updates to pay an
update for Twitter so to test something
very basic the on-screen keyboard
actually isn't too bad as you just saw
it's a little a little narrow but hey it
works fine and now we can do is we can
go back write a parachute panic and
actually give you an icon that is
running and right from where I just was
the plane was flying away the boat was
moving
they just resume is right from exactly
where you were Samsung is also offering
their own way to get apps onto your
phone onto a bottle phone by pressing
the middle button it brings me once
again to the same menu as you can see
here we have the Samsung Apps icon when
I press this icon it does load however
I'm in the I'm located in the US and
this app store is not actually available
in the US yet I've been searching for a
way around as maybe see if I could trick
the device into thinking I was in a
location where it is offered however at
this time it's not I believe is gonna be
coming in September or October so will
be until fall unfortunately so pretty
much you're stuck with whatever comes on
the phone which is what I just showed
you for the most part make sure you stay
tuned as I will have a final video
coming with a wrap up in a final review
of the Samsung wave itself and some
thoughts on bada and kind of where I
think the platform could go and where I
think it currently is so thanks for
watching everyone if you like this video
give us a thumbs up also feel free to
comment and subscribe for future updates
of this phone and many more phones to
come thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
