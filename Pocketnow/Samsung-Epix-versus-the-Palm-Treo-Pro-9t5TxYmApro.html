pocketnow.com and in this video we're
going to compare the
pro with the samsung epix and come out
with a winner at the end to determine
which device is better I know a lot of
people are looking at both devices as
their next bone so let's start with the
similarities both devices have full
QWERTY keyboards right on the front they
have a flush touch screen that is 2.5
inches diagonal and 320 x 320 in terms
of resolution both devices are running
windows mobile 6.1 professional and
beyond that there are a ton of
differences let's start with design
let's look at the samsung epix the epics
has a more traditional design with kind
of hard hard square corners here I'm
compared to the treo pro which has
rounded corners it has a unconventional
dark grey metallic finish to it which
some people will like because it's a
very unique there's not many phones out
there that have a great finish on it and
some won't like it because they prefer
that the usual black I'm going around
the edges we have this chrome strip
although we don't have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack we don't have a quick way
to turn on vibrate and Samsung gives us
their proprietary jack for syncing
charging and audio which no one really
likes but fortunately the microSD slot
is on the outside of the device so you
don't have to take out the battery so
let's take a look at the palm treo pro
the palm treo pro is a much more
progressive design with very rounded
edges a lot of curbs a really
interesting looking device painted in
black gloss it's also as you can see a
complete fingerprint magnet it has a
very minimal button layout so we don't
have soft keys here for the hardware
Hardware soft keys and the call start
and call end buttons are separated by a
lot of distance and they they glow their
respective colors so green and red over
here so it looks really nice I'm going
around the device we have a you know
volume rocker here like we do on the
epics we have Micro Micro USB and a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack with a lot of
people are happy about and going around
the other side we have a dedicated Wi-Fi
button which is tremendously convenient
and on the top we have a switch to
quickly go in and out of vibrate and
have the ringer turned on unfortunately
the palm treo pro puts the micro SD
slot underneath of the battery cover
which is really inconvenient but even
with those issues I think that a lot a
lot of people will agree that the palm
treo pro is a much better looking device
it's very sexy it looks fantastic
sitting on a table top and it has a
great design so for design the trail Pro
gets it okay so now let's take a look at
the keyboards because if you're getting
or looking at either of these devices
you probably care a lot about the
keyboard so let's look at the keyboard
on the epic's first which is taken right
from the I 780 and also the blackjack to
the keyboard on the epics has a lot of
very ample spaces between each of the
keys they're large they feel good on the
finger although they're a little bit
difficult to press you have to press in
a little harder than you do on the treo
pro the trail Pro is a very small
keyboard which is actually advantageous
for people with medium or small sized
hands because your fingers hardly travel
when you're typing along but for people
with large sized hands the palm treo pro
is going to be very difficult to type on
so for that reason I'm going to give
this one to the epics in terms of the
keyboard so the epics has the better
keyboard okay so let's talk about
software both devices really don't come
with much additional software to enhance
the experience they don't have any kind
of interface replacement like you know
touchflo 3d or spb mobile shell they
don't include anything for flick
scrolling they don't have Opera Mobile
9.5 built-in it relies on pocket
internet explorer and and if we look at
the program's menu we see no unusual
entries nothing really interesting that
differentiates this from each other or
from other windows mobile devices now
the one advantage i see is that the palm
treo pro doesn't come with a lot of java
based trial where there's probably about
15 pieces of java based trial where on
the samsung epix which just clogs the
program memory unnecessarily so I think
for software they both kind of lose but
if I were to pick a winner it would
definitely be the treo pro okay so let's
talk about usability let's start with
the treo pro if i'm using the treo pro
i'm going to take out the stylus from
the bottom right corner very good
placement for that if i'm using the
device i'm going to try to use the the
d-pad here which is a really good tip at
it
nice allege on it so you can feel for it
when you're not looking at the device
also the selector button in the center
is really predominant and easy to use
unfortunately the treo pro does not have
Hardware soft keys so if i open up a
program that requires me to use a soft
key i have to go up and actually press
on it which is not that big of a deal
but when we're talking about usability
and and moving your fingers as little as
possible that's a little bit of a
problem the screen is actually more
sensitive on the treo pro than it is on
the epics which which makes it easier to
use with a stylus and easier to use with
a finger but like I said earlier there
are no really touch enhancements built
into the treo pro it's mainly a device
that is supposed to be used with a
stylus okay and so if I'm going to use
the epics I have another input option I
can use the optical mouse and hopefully
you can see that moving around the
optical mouse is fantastic sensitivity
and really allows me to use it to
control all of the aspects i can even
scroll with it pretty well in addition
to having the optical mouse this device
has hardware soft keys here so really if
i'm using programs and i'm moving around
doing various tasks I'm not moving my
thumb around much past this area in the
center so if I want to operate the right
menu I don't have to reach up I can go
right there and I can close the program
like that or use the ok button it's just
a lot less finger travel which makes it
super easy to use this device with one
hand so for usability the samsung epix
wins and in terms of performance i have
to say that both devices have really
snappy performance there have been a ton
of windows mobile devices in the past
that were just slow you'd click on an
icon it would take forever not the case
with these two devices they are
optimized very well from the OEMs and
they work really well that said they
have different specs the epics has a 624
megahertz processor whereas the treo pro
has a 400 megahertz processor you really
can't tell the difference where you may
notice the difference is in the amount
of program memory and let me pull that
up in the settings so you can see ok
here we are in memory and we can see
that the treo pro is 101 megabytes of
total program memory whereas the epics
has 108
megabytes of total program memory this
difference is very small and what it
what it may mean is that you may be able
to multitask a little bit harder on the
samsung epix before you run out of
program memory but it may be the
difference of one program and it's
really not that big of a deal but
because it has more program memory and
because it has a faster processor i'm
going to give performance to the samsung
epix and finally i want to talk about
the all-important price and availability
the palm treo pro is being sold right
now I saw it on buy.com for five hundred
dollars the MSRP is about five hundred
and fifty dollars and it is sold
unlocked so it will work on any gsm
carrier if we look at the samsung epix
if you buy it outright without a
two-year contract it'll cost four
hundred and fifty dollars but if you buy
it with a new contract it will cost two
hundred dollars on AT&amp;amp;T now of course
you could buy this device and unlock it
and use it on any carrier but that may
be an additional you know thirty to
fifty dollars or so so in terms of price
and availability i'd say that the treo
pro wins on availability because it's
unlocked already and the samsung epix
wins on price because it's being
subsidized on AT&amp;amp;T okay so let's
conclude our findings here I found that
the treo pro is the better looking
better design device it has a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack it has curved
lines it's sexy it's black and gloss it
looks fantastic in terms of keyboard the
epics won that one because it's more
spaced out it's better for the most
amount of people because the buttons are
larger and they're easier to use and
feel and then we talked about software
and I said that the treo pro 1 software
because it has less java-based trial
where then does the epics then we talked
about performance and it was kind of a
tie but I gave it to the epics because
it's got a faster processor and a little
bit more program memory which is great
for multitasking then we talked about
usability and the epics took that
because it has this optical joystick
here and also software hardware keys so
you don't have to move your thumb too
much from the center area and then we
went to price and said that the epix is
cheaper if you buy it on AT&amp;amp;T but for
availability the treo pro wins because
it's already unlocked when you buy it so
if we add up all the totals we get the
epics at four points and
treo pro at three points and so the
winner is the samsung epix and the epics
even has better battery life so that's
another point for the epics definitely
the winner here and so if you like what
