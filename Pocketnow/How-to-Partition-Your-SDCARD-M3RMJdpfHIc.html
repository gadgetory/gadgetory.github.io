one of our viewers was watching a rom
manager premium video and said he'd like
a little bit more information about one
of the options being the partition SD
card that we talked about just briefly
so let's go ahead and do that
all right so first and foremost this is
ROM manager premium it is available in
the market it is not free though there
is a free version that's kind of like a
lite version of it that you can get it's
relatively inexpensive and I highly
recommend it you do need to have a
rooted phone to be able to use the
majority of the features on this so that
having been said let's get to
disclaimers partitioning your SD card is
a destructive process meaning it is
going to erase everything on your card
so you have been warned now that having
been said if you go ahead and copy
everything off of your androids SD card
onto your computer then you can go ahead
and format and partition this SD card
and get some of the other advantages so
let's go ahead and do that first of all
you can do this through the user
interface by tapping on partition SD
card it asks you the size of the ext
that you want this is the basically
where your SD card can function to get
all of your your apps basically
installed so the reader particularly
said hey look I see that it has 128 256
and 512 for this partition can I do more
than that and that's a good question
I'll show you how to do that but let's
go through how to do this using the user
interface first so we'll say 512 say ok
next is the swap size 0 32 64 128 256
now everywhere I've read you want to use
32 or 64 as your swap partition and no
more than that some roms make use of the
swap partition some don't so I usually
go between 32 and 64 Meg but I don't do
anything bigger than that just because
of that choose okay and then it is going
to warn you that it's going to wipe
everything on the card and say hey if
you want to continue now at this point
we'd say ok and it would reboot into
recovery mode and partition that SD card
with all the settings that we've just
set
that doesn't answer our viewers
questions so to do that let's come over
here instead and reboot into recovery
and we'll do this manually are we sure
we want to yes we're sure we want to
rebooting into recovery this way is
quite a bit faster because you don't
have to do the whole finger gymnastics
to be able to get into recovery mode you
don't have to remember that what that is
because the app itself will just
basically say hey reboot into recovery
and it does that and you can see here
now it's done that so let's go ahead and
come down here to advanced and in
advanced we have partition sdcard so
we'll select that says ext size now I've
got sizes from 128 all the way up to 4
gig so that's how you can get around the
limitations of the UI I'm going to go
ahead and set this to a thousand 24
megabytes or one gigabyte now you want
to make sure that this is the right size
for your card if you've got a 1 gig card
you probably don't want to do this in
this case I've got a 16 gig card in
there so I'm going to select that my
swap size I'm going to go ahead and make
64 megabytes and then down here you can
see the status says that it is
clockworkmod recovery version 2.5 point
1.3 and that it is partitioning the SD
card and that I should wait now this is
where you get to be very patient because
this process is going to take several
minutes I'm not going to subject you to
that on camera so through the magic of
TV we're going to go ahead and just skip
all of that all right and about two
minutes have passed you can see down
here it says done and I'm back at my
menu from here I can go through and
partition it again if I want to or I can
reboot so we go ahead and do that we'll
go back to the main menu and I can
reboot the system now that's all it
takes to go ahead and partition an SD
card now if I wanted to I can go through
and just partition a whole bunch of SD
cards so if I've got friends who have SD
cards and have promised me that they've
backed up all their data I can just go
through here in assembly-line format
them partition them and I don't have to
worry about going into a command
and typing in any keys or even running
any of the special script files that
have been out there so this makes it
very very easy you're a little bit
limited on your configuration but once
you drop down into recovery mode rather
than doing it through the UI it becomes
very powerful a lot of those limitations
aren't such a big deal anymore because
you have more options to choose from
so really really nice this is
clockworkmod recovery what I showed you
before was rom manager they the first
one the image itself you're going to
have to get specific for your device
head over to pocketnow.com and do a
search for your device with the words
recovery image to see if we've
documented how to get that and install
it on your device for rom manager you
can go ahead and grab that from the
marketplace and actually then download
and install clockworkmod recovery for
your device as well really cool really
powerful be careful make sure you get a
backup first if you've got a tip you'd
like to see leave a comment down below
if you have some some more information
about what partition sizes you like and
why please leave those in the comments
below our readers would love to hear
your input on that so showing off custom
partitioning of your SD card for pocket
