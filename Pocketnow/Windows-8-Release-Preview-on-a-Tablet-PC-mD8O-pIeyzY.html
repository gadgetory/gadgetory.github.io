calm and there's a new build of windows
8 available called the windows 8 release
preview and we thought it'd be fun to
see how it works on the old HP
touchsmart tm2 so let's check it out ok
here's the new start screen for windows
8 the release preview not much has
changed but we have a few new apps that
are bundled which is pretty cool let's
go into the photos now already I've
launched this and I'm connected to my
media center pc and this is browsing
photos that are on a different computer
using the SkyDrive so I can really
easily look at old pictures look at that
tablet ok so we can do that and if we
back out here's the home screen so we
see this is the pictures library on my
tablet we have SkyDrive pictures
facebook pictures there's another
computer that has SkyDrive installed but
it's not turned on so you can browse
pictures when it's not turned on and of
course it's flicker next up let's go
back to start and look at the people
this is seen a few updates we still have
the people what's new me up there at the
top and it's going to load the what's
new feed so here we see Facebook and
Twitter loading in right there and
that's pretty cool check the meat aisle
there's a little number there saying
when we have notifications so there's
the meat aisle we can see some of my
facebook updates notifications and of
course pictures and you can even see
comments on photo albums here and likes
as well and let's go to music now you
steal a little animation they're pretty
cool little flipping
out there and you can see I'm not an
artist right now and we can tap that and
you can see the music add to my music is
works with our zoom past so it'll just
download the whole album so you have it
for offline use so you can just play it
and stream the whole thing if you have a
zune pass and here's the home you see my
music there we see new releases kind of
a zune like interface / xbox style let's
go back and see what else we have xbox
live games again we got the cool flippy
thing and here it is we have a couple
friends are online I can edit my avatar
view achievements and we can see some
game advertisements ornament and I can
see my game activity there's some games
for windows which are coming soon
there's the Xbox game marketplace so it
is pretty cool interface there i also
have xbox companion which is very cool
this will control your xbox kinda like
the windows phone version we swipe up
from the bottom you get game controls if
it was connected
and here's some new apps it was a news
one very very nice design here and a
horizontal scrolling and click on an
article and it's kind of a newspaper
layout so this is a very easy to read
multi-column and we scroll to go to the
next page there's the sports app again
very cool design full full screen
pictures typography little boxes for
articles very cool and this one I like
travel travel up being travel very cool
large picture and destinations and
here's something that I really like the
panoramas
it's Times Square
Micah zoom in not so much okay that's a
very cool feature
and you got articles so fun stuff there
and the finance that again very
beautiful design here and you can add
sir stocks that you want to watch here I
have some featured now let's show that
let's get the share button working how
about WordPress let's choose an article
so there's pretty nice design their the
pictures and let's try the share button
from here there we go now we have posts
on facebook mail wordpress com people so
post on facebook is going to go to the
People Hub it brings up a bar on the
right here and I can choose Facebook or
Twitter and add message as my keyboard
works pretty nicely with this device and
I gonna post that but that's the button
so it'll be really nice if that shows up
in a lot more apps that a share feature
for posting to Facebook now the video
app has been updated as well you see the
Xbox team has been designing this these
video music apps and you can tell by the
background and the layout until you
tiles or whatnot so we have a lot of
different options here now one thing
that's kind of unclear what if I want to
look at more movies there's only how
many there whatever there's no more
movies button so it seems like I only
have these to choose from but really if
you tap the movies marketplace word up
there then we're able to choose other
movies and also we can search within the
video app
so let's see what's a good movie
definitely piranha and then we see it's
loaded the movie there I can buy it
actually I can't buy it this is not
finished but we can look at the trailer
and it's going to play right there and
that's pretty cool ok now the mail app
is also seen some updates we now have
three columns that were previously we
had only two and you is kind of hard to
find the folders or the multiple counts
over there so now it's a little better
easier to use we have the menu down
there but my exchange account does not
work it loads the folders but it never
loads any messages and there's no way to
add pop3 or IMAP counts yet in fact
there's no not even an add accounts
button here the way I got my exchange
account in there was to go to the People
Hub and add an account there which is
obviously not intuitive and we really
need a accounts button down there here's
the maps app and one thing that's kind
of annoying there's no buttons here is
how how do you do anything you have to
remember with windows 8 the buttons are
down below if you do swipe up we have
some options here show traffic map style
and the other thing you have to remember
is the search feature is always right
here so a lot of apps are going to add
the search button is hidden under the
right edge so now I can search for
something and here our search results
and we see up here you can scroll
sideways is pretty pretty nice and we
can choose one of those and it shows up
here
and we can get more information on that
restaurant braces hours pretty cool
stuff there and the website that's
loading a full screen Internet Explorer
the metro-style version and this works
very very smoothly and if we look at the
settings we have a couple more options
we'll have lots more color options here
we have different little texture options
I kinda like the flat one and we can
choose different colors there's blue and
it changes instantly there's a different
color right now and getting back there
it's very easy to just swipe that and
let's go back to this car you see that
change right away don't forget we got
test switching on the left very quick
two-handed start swap swap swap and this
is my favorite the thumbnails on the
left edge so I can really easily switch
to which other one I want so that's
shaping up pretty nicely of course we
still have the desktop very easy to
switch to that was very quick and you
can run any of your normal desktop
programs here and this is a video
editing program and it works very well
of course we need stylist because a lot
of these buttons are very tiny this is
not a touch-friendly designed for that
up so that's quick look at the windows 8
release preview lots of cool stuff
happening there's lots of live tiles
very cool little animations and it's
working very nicely on my old tablet
from before the first iPad came out lots
of cool stuff going on there anyway hope
you enjoyed this video give us a thumbs
up if you did and that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
