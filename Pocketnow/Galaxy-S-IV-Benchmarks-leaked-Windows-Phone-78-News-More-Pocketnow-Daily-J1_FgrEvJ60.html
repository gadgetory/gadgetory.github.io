countdown to Windows Phone 7.8
apparently begins the UK study plants to
prove that phone shouldn't be sold with
chargers I'm high Meadow iveta and what
am I supposed to sing my finger now into
the wall outlet this is pocket out daily
yes the galaxy s4 is one of the most
anticipated smartphones of the year and
even though we still don't know what to
expect some benchmarks have already made
the public this device will be
apparently called the GTI 9500 sport the
exodus 5 octa processor that we talked
about at CES it also be clocked at 1800
gigahertz but what makes these news even
more impressive is the fact that there
apparently is a GTI 9400 that will be
rocking the Tizen platform could we
expect two devices and for all of you
nine remaining windows phone 7.5 users
out there I hope that the wait for
windows phone 7.8 after so many months
has it been so boring according to o2 UK
they just tweeted that the upgrade will
be available before January ends at
least for the nokia lumia 800 now even
though the Nokia Lumia 800 is a legacy
device there are devices that are much
older that have no mention as to when
they'll be getting the upgrade but
whether you expect from Microsoft
anyways and speaking of Windows phones
for all of you waiting for a windows
phone 8 device on the sprint network
apparently HTC is already prepping to
bring the devices and network very soon
apparently this device will bring the
one sv design that we already know an
Android which is actually both a good
and a bad thing the one sv is a very
nice device but sadly it's an interior
device as well so let's see what spring
brings to the Windows Phone platform
soon now we're just taking so long to
bring their blackberry 10 platform to
the market that even the most die-hard
of enthusiasts are actually leaving the
platform but that said I actually did
have a chance to play with a bb10 dev
alpha device at CES and I will tell you
there are some really cool features
coming out here and if you're interested
well verizon is apparently going to be
the first carrier to use or bring the
platform to the market or at least the
US market for that sense and well it
does seem that the leaks show that the
platform will be running on schedule
though we don't know what that schedule
is but hopefully the guys that RIM do
know and hopefully it will be as good as
I had the chance of tests and finally
for the annoying news of the day you
remember that recently a couple of
months ago HTC and o2 in the UK ran this
pilot program where they remove chargers
from the boxes of the smartphones that
they sold from HTC
because they wanted to prove to the
market that anybody could use the old
chargers from their old devices not
necessarily need a new charger well the
results are in it apparently 75% of the
users that bought an HTC smartphone
didn't actually want to buy the
replacement charger which was actually
being sold at cost and when it makes you
wonder if they actually sold as many HTC
devices as they sold iPhones but that
leads me to the question of the day what
do you feel about this pilot program do
you agree that they sell you a device
without a charger I mean I seriously do
need my charger and I don't consider it
fair that these companies want to do
this just because they want to save a
couple of bucks but leave us a comment
down below and if you want an earlier
scoop of everything that's happening in
the smartphone and tablet well make sure
you follow us on Eircom please
give this video a thumbs up if you liked
what you saw I'm high memory better
thanks for watching see you Monday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
