mean that the other iphones aren't
happening HTC nexus code names emerged
but that doesn't hit very much and
changes to the Google Play Store include
the death of certain products I'm hi
Matt Ravenna and no I have not seen
Batman vs Superman but I could not
resist the t-shirt this is parking out
daily the official news start with
Google but not in a good way those of
you that were in the market for an
Android tablet and I don't blame you if
you weren't well the Nexus night is no
longer on the Google store and products
like the Moto 360 sport that were on
sale everywhere are now removed from the
store clearly either Google is working
on bringing those new products which we
hope or these ones weren't just selling
well and for those of you that have been
worried about Sony including me I am a
big fan of so many smartphones and the
cameras pretty much using one right now
well the company's quarter results
weren't really that bad for the first
time in a very very long time the
company has posted profits 2.7 billion
dollars and even though the smartphone
division hasn't really grown from where
it was we are hoping that the vices like
the xperia x will change that whenever
they do launch now a company that we
were not expecting to post losses was LG
the company has now confirmed that it's
currently 160 million dollars down from
the revenue that it projected for the
quarter and it expected to sell three
million g5 is in that period of time and
it only sold 1.6 million it's rather sad
that phone has received a lot of
negative publicity and that's really not
a bad phone at all I really don't like
the fact that that happens but that's
the Internet hopefully things changes we
have to remember that the g5 barely
launched at the time that the quarter
was by its midpoint so there could be
another opportunity for LG to pick up
the slack now the last time that we
heard about HTC code names for the Nexus
devices they weren't from trusted
sources and now they are it seems that
marlin and sailfish are the code names
for both devices seems that there is an
m1 and an s-1 being worked on and we
don't know which one is the higher and
then which one is not
but given our experience with the HTC 10
those of you that were skeptical about
this company handling the Nexus I cannot
wait to see what they come up with
because the 10 was a really good phone
and finally the very interesting news
today have to do with the iphone pro yes
we've got some lee schematics apparently
it shares the design and aesthetics of
the iphone 6s plus up to the point where
it won't change in dimensions the
changes here are pretty much the antenna
lines the fact that we've got dual
cameras and that there is a smart
connector at the bottom a meaning that
could we expect Apple pencil support for
this iphone pro or whatever it's going
to be called and that would be rather
interesting i'm sure Steve Jobs would
most likely roll on his grave as he did
mark the whole concept as a stylist and
it leads me to the question of the day
do you think that apple will want to
bring the Apple pencil to the iphone pro
do you think that there is a market for
the iphone pro you know it's funny i
think that there is a larger market that
would want to see an ipad mini with
apple pencil support because of its
portability but leave us a comment down
below we'd love to know your opinion
friends you know the way it goes if you
want to get these news earlier before
