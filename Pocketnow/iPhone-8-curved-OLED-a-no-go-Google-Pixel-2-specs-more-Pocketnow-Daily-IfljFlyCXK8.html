bitching curves given some hardware
manufacturing issues the goal pixel two
is not going to push the extra number in
the processor specs and what's happens
here we have just decided to show the
market how it's done with integration
I'm Jaime Rivera and the dear Mel Brooks
bring the t-shirt how about it for us
old-time fans this is bogging out daily
the official news today have to do with
deals to a certain degree we rarely ever
expect anything good when it comes to
prepaid plans from Verizon particularly
because it's not easy to just go walk in
with any smartphone and connect it to
their network but the company is
offering this new $80 unlimited plan and
you can bet that it's going to throttle
a ton of things like video for example
that's going to be stuck at 480p 480p
sorry and then the second thing is that
if you had some point let that phone
deactivate it's going to cost you 35
bucks to activate it again
so Verizon and for those of you
wondering exactly when we're getting the
last year galaxy note again Galaxy Note
7r it turns out that we've got some
interesting dates we thought it would
happen soon like I mean this month or
something but apparently it's not going
to happen until June and Korea meaning
it could take a lot longer for it to
reach other markets now I'm sure that
Samsung is sitting on a pile of sparkly
stones right now so it could not take
that long we'll keep you posted now Siri
and what's happened just decided to show
third-party integration how things are
done that's one of my main criticisms
with Google's assistant the fact that
it's called in a system and can assist
you in very few things given its lack of
third-party integration with many
services as of today in addition to the
able to summon an uber or call a lift on
Siri you can now also get it to read
your whatsapp messages and it's got
another added kick and functionality
that you can learn more in the
description hopefully this is not the
last application to do this
and speaking of the Google assistant and
the phone the product to life the Google
pixel is obviously already expecting a
next iteration smartphone we hear that
HD is going to manufacture it we
apparently don't see is the phone
pushing the bar when it comes to specs
last year Google
every one with the Snapdragon a to one
at a time on the Snapdragon 820 was the
mainstream but apparently this mentoring
an 835 is going to be it and it has a
lot to do with the fact that the
Snapdragon 835 has taken forever to
launch this year but until now with the
galaxy as eight so yeah we can expect
that later this year and finally very
interesting news is they have to do with
the iPhone 8 and the fact that it's
having manufacturing issues again
probably both Samsung and LG are
providing curved OLED displays the
technology is going to be there but the
displayed smokey curve because both
companies are struggling with the
lamination and apparently this
lamination is to help palm rejection
please in the comments whoever wants to
correct me on that one we would love
that but apparently it's not going to
happen mainly because of these issues
which leads me to the question of the
date do you think it's a deal breaker to
have a curved OLED on your smartphone or
not particularly with devices like the
Galaxy s8 I will tell you the Galaxy s8
has spoiled me into believing that
Samsung finally figured that out you'll
see my review next week but leave us a
comment down below we'd love to know
your opinion brands you know the way it
goes if you want to get the news earlier
before the video was filmed while
talking all calm and hit that subscribe
button down below for more videos like
this one you can also follow me on
twitter high-mounted quarterly that i
run into the grandmas hi medley better
please give this video a thumbs up if
you like what you saw I am hi Natalie
