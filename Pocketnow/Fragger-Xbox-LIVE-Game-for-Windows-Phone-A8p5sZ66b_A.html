and we're going to do a quick preview of
a new xbox live game for this phone
let's check it out okay this week we
have fragger now this is a game you
might have played online from miniclip
com it's also available on my iPhone so
let's check it out here's our Start
screen now the basic premises you gotta
throw grenades to kill the bad guys so
let's choose this I guess and let's go
with this one that I didn't play it so
you put your finger here and you get a
little big arrow there and if I move the
finger closer that gets less power so
there's like total all the power there's
a little bit less and then I can change
the angle like so let me see maybe oh
that's just going to get that guy and
let's try it a little bit more this way
and see if I can get those guys almost
let's try like that
there we go and here's our points and
repeat will let you play again I didn't
get three stars and you can also view
solution points just keep racking up
there oh okay this is for cheating so if
you need some help let's not use that I
might need that later let's try another
one alright this guy may be like so and
we get some scored and three stars yay
that's a lot of score counting okay so
you get the idea over here you got the
number of grenades you have this is I
can cancel out and pause or reset will
you know start over again for the
particular level so let's go back to me
menu so obviously we have lots of levels
and we have lots of different missions
so that's pretty cool and of course
there's achievements and leaderboards
already got a bunch and your music sound
options and let's see what the store
does aha we can buy unlimited grenades
and this will use microsoft points so
that's cool there's some in-game content
that you can purchase more solutions if
you want to cheat a little bit so that's
fragger it looks like a lot of fun i
think i'm going to play this some more
this is going to be available tomorrow
in the windows phone marketplace for 299
so check it out later I might have this
video posted a little bit before it's
available and give us a thumbs up if you
like this game I think it's pretty cool
and that's it for now
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
