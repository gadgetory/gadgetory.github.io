Danny Webster here from packing.com and
in this video I'm going to show you new
update to s VB time and it's actually
pretty useful the program before is
pretty much just a clock alarm and a
stopwatch but now you can actually view
multiple time zones and your entire
calendar for who knows how long so I'm
just going to go into the alarm sitting
right now as you can see it says that I
have an alarm is going to go off in one
minute
so I'm just going to go into some of the
settings real quick for this alarm we
have many different alarms and we can
also change the name of the alarm sep
wanted to be a wake-up alarm need to go
make dinner alarm something like that
whatever so here I had the time set and
it's actually pretty cool we need to
select which hour we want to sell right
I have 4 a.m. and 4:45 we can scroll it
over let's go back and click the little
check mark here which will save it we
can also pick which days we want so if I
didn't want this to be on Sunday or
Saturday I can click on this check mark
and it will make those more dim so it's
not as highlighted and it shows that
those days are off we can also change
the way that the alarm is set up so if
you're the type of person that has a
difficult time getting out of bed you
would probably want to select the
paranoid alarm and as you can see this
is the paranoid alarm right here and it
says to dismiss tap numbers in the right
order so we actually have to go in tap
the number so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 it will
actually turn off the alarm so as you
can see if you're the type of person
that has a difficult time getting out of
bed the alarm will not disable until you
actually input the correct sequence of
numbers so we can also change some of
the settings we can have the volume
ascending so it'll be more quiet when
you when it first goes off and to an
increasing volume of course we can also
have a vibrate function and we can also
change the sound so if I wanted to
change it to a different sound I can
click one of these different alarms or
add a custom wave file or mp3 we'll just
click on the check mark here and you can
have an entire set of alarms so if your
schedule is like mine
you have many different weird days that
you work then you can set up many
different alarms and go back and you
have a few different views I'll show you
that in just a second but we go to the
calendar here and it's pretty cool
because you can't really do anything
with the calendar except for view it so
as you can see if I flick through if I
wanted to know a specific date let's say
I wanted to know what the day was on
July 2011 let's say my birthday was the
13th or something I want to know what
day of the week it was I can see that
it's on Wednesday and to get back to the
correct day that it is right now I can
just click on this little icon and I'll
bring you back to the day that it is
right now so go back and we'll go into
some of the settings here we can also
view the world time so you can add as
many different time zones as you'd like
many different cities you can also
change the name of the cities I'll show
you that in just a second but as you can
see we have all these different time
zones here if I was to click on New York
it will actually give me daylight
savings time when it begins in that time
of the year so it began on March 8th and
it also ended on November 1st and the
cool thing about this program which I
like is that it actually shows you when
the Sun Rise and when the sunset is so
that's a great feature to have I can
also change the name like I was saying
you can change the name to whatever city
you live in let's say that you wanted to
change it to New Jersey so then you can
change the city and it will show it back
in your little list of cities here you
can also click on let's go to clue
Seattle you can also click on the globe
and see where the Sun is in orientation
to that city as you can see it's a
little bit difficult but but as you can
see the Sun rise is about to rise over
on the East Coast right now and I can
also spin the globe which is pretty cool
so let's go back go to more features in
here we also have a stopwatch and we can
start hit a lap lap again apparently
growing very fast in these laps and
another cool feature about this is we
can save our results so if we were on a
track and we wanted to increase our time
or what
or whatever are doing in India to say at
the time can also export into our
documents or whatever folder you specify
click done and go back we also had a
countdown this is a great thing to have
if you're cooking or whatever if you
want to know how long it is till you get
out of work or need a timer off or
something they just click start and the
hourglass will actually correspond to
how long your timer is so as you can see
it's starting to empty and fill on the
corresponding side and also reset and
it's pretty cool that it flips over I
think that's pretty neat
ok we'll go back can also change our
alarms like we saw before change the
skin so we have two different styles we
have the default and the default digital
default digital also gives you a
calendar so you are the default right
now go back to the settings and we
already saw the calendar we also get
moon phases on this program which is a
pretty neat feature to have because if
you're a night owl like me you like to
know what the moon phases are so one
cool thing about this is actually says
that on the last day of the year there's
a partial lunar eclipse so hopefully the
weather is nice that night so the
options I can change my language
force-feedback which is the vibration
touch when you touch it'll actually
vibrate globe animation so if I want
that on I can turn it on or off
countdown timers interface you can have
many different timers so you can have
multiple or single and sleep timers and
about information all the great stuff so
this is SPB time 3.0 and i'll post a
link I'm outta comm as to how to
get this program the full version does
cost $14.99 but there is a trial version
available thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
