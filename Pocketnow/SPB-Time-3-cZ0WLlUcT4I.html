packing.com and in this video i'm going
to show you new update to SBB time and
it's actually pretty useful the program
before is pretty much just a clock alarm
and a stopwatch but now you can actually
view multiple time zones and your entire
calendar for who knows how long so i'm
just going to go into the alarm sitting
right now as you can see it says that i
have an alarm is going to go off in one
minute so i'm just going to go to some
of the settings real quick for this
alarm we have many different alarms and
we can also change the name of the alarm
sep wanted to be a wake-up alarm need to
go make dinner alarm something like that
whatever so here i have the time set and
it's actually pretty cool we need to
select which our we want so right i have
four a.m. and 445 we can scroll it over
let's go back and click the little check
mark here which will save it we can also
pick which days we want so if i didn't
want this to be on sunday or saturday i
can click on this check mark and it will
make those more dim so it's not as
highlighted and it shows that those days
are off we can also change the way that
the alarm is set up so if you're the
type of person that has a difficult time
getting out of bed you would probably
want to select the paranoid alarm and as
you can see this is the paranoid alarm
right here and it says to dismiss tap
numbers in the right order so you
actually have to go in tap the number so
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 it will actually turn
off the alarm so as you can see if
you're the type of person that has a
difficult time getting out of bed the
alarm will not disabled until you
actually input the correct sequence of
numbers so we can also change some of
the settings we can have the volume
ascending so it'll be more quiet when
you when it first goes off and to an
increasing volume of course you can also
have a vibrate function and we can also
change the sound so if i wanted to
change it to a different sound i can
click one of these different alarms or
add a custom wav file or mp3 we'll just
click on the check mark here and you can
have an entire set of alarm so if your
schedule is like mine
you have many different weird days that
you work then you can set up many
different alarms and go back and you
have a few different views I'll show you
that in just a second but we go to the
calendar here and it's pretty cool
because you can't really do anything
with the calendar except for view it so
as you can see if I flick through if I
wanted to know a specific date let's say
I wanted to know what the day was on
july two thousand eleven let's say my
birthday was the 13th or something i
want to know what day of the week it was
i can see that it's on wednesday and to
get back to the correct day that it is
right now i can just click on this
little icon and i'll bring you back to
the day that it is right now so go back
and we'll go into some of the settings
here we can also view the world time so
you can add as many different time zones
as you'd like many different cities you
can also change the name of the city's
I'll show you that in just a second but
as you can see we have all these
different time zones here if I was to
click on New York it will actually give
me daylight savings time when it begins
in that time of the year so it began on
march eight and it also ended on
November first and the cool thing about
this program which I like is that it
actually shows you when the Sun rising
when the sunset is so that's a great
feature to have can also change the name
like I was saying you can change the
name to whatever city you live in let's
say that you wanted to change it to New
Jersey so then you can change the city
and it will show it back in your little
list of cities here can also click on
let's go to classy at all you can also
click on the globe and see where the Sun
is in orientation to that city as you
can see it's a little bit difficult but
but as you can see the sunrise is about
to rise or on the east coast right now
and I can also spin the globe which is
pretty cool so let's go back go to more
features in here we also have a
stopwatch and we can start I hit a lap
well I begin apparently growing very
fast in these laps and another cool
feature about this is we can save our
results so if we were on a track and we
wanted to increase our time or whatever
or whatever we're doing an idiot to say
the time can also export into our
documents or whatever folder you specify
click done and go back we also have a
countdown this is a great thing to have
if you're cooking or whatever if you
want to know how long it is till you get
out of work or need a timer off or
something they just click start and the
hourglass will actually correspond to
how long your timer is so as you can see
it's starting to empty and fill on the
corresponding side and also reset and
it's pretty cool that it flips over I
think that's pretty neat okay we'll go
back can also change our alarms like we
saw before change the skin so we have
two different styles we have the default
and the default digital default digital
also gives you a calendar so you are the
default right now go back to the
settings and we already saw the calendar
we also get moon phases on this program
which is a pretty neat feature to have
because if you're a nightowl like me you
like to know what the moon phases are so
one cool thing about this is actually
says that on the last day of the year
there's a partial lunar eclipse oh
hopefully the weather is nice that night
so the options I can change my language
force feedback which is the vibration
touch when you touch it it will actually
vibrate globe animation so if I want
that on it can turn it on or off I
countdown timers interface you can have
many different timers so you can have
multiple or single and sleep timers and
about information on a great stuff so
this is spb time 3.0 and i'll post
Linkin Park aneta commas how to get this
program the full version does cost 14
dot 99 cents but there is a trial
version available thanks to watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
