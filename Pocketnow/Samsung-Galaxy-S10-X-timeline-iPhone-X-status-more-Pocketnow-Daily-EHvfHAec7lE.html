two very important smartphones the
huawei P 20 pro is available in North
America now for a better price tag sort
of and for those of you the thought that
Apple was struggling you'll probably
have to wait until next quarter I'm high
metal Iveta and yes Google i/o is
ramping up to begin tomorrow we can't
wait to see what we get from Google it
will definitely be covering everything
this is pocket out daily if I should
lose today begin with deals if you're in
the market for and LGB 30s thank you in
the United States B&amp;amp;H has got the mass
of today and now bear in mind the full
retail price is 930 bucks but if you get
it now or soon it's available for $200
off it's a great phone obviously there's
also the g7 out there but the V 30 has a
couple of extra things in its favour you
can learn more of the description now
let's talk about Apple for those of you
that have been asking for us to cover
this since Friday I've been reading your
comments yes Alice have been telling us
for months of the iPhone tennis selling
badly and then well apples quarter
results went by with iPhones selling
better than ever and then now we've got
analysts again predicting or telling us
that well the iPhone 10 iPhone 8 and
iPhone 8 plus are the best selling
smartphones in the world don't take it
for me read the news in the description
that's the way it is yeah now for those
of you that have been interested in the
huawei p20 and p20 pro our review is
coming up very soon hopefully this week
yeah
it's now available in North America but
Canada now bear in mind if you want to
bind in the United States right now on
eBay it sells for more than 800 bucks so
in Canada you can get it for 700
something which is less again it's a
great phone but wait for our review
there's a lot that I want to share with
you now probably the most interesting
news over the weekend were the event
announcement for May 23rd from HTC the
fact that many publications just
dissected all the parts of the HTC
device that's not more than the sum of
its specs and as it turns out that parts
are not of an HTC phone they're of
iPhones and other devices and now HTC
has pretty much have to publish the
statement confirming that yes these are
not
parts of the phone that's coming they
just wanted to reference the fact that
competition makes it about specs while
they won't it's just funny that they
chose iPhone parts particularly because
well Apple doesn't make it about specs
but we'll see and finally the most
interesting news they have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy X and the Samsung
Galaxy S 10 I know it's early but so are
the possible product launches as we hear
that
well Samsung is planning to have that
three screen foldable smartphone that
can become a tablet as early as MWC next
year in limited quantities and then we
hear that the Galaxy S 10 will be
available earlier this time so instead
of having the Galaxy S tenant MWC
apparently we're getting it at CES for
production beginning as soon as October
and if all those analytics of iPhones
selling this quarter are true then yes
it's probably because the galaxy s 9
hasn't been selling as great as Samsung
expected I don't even know if I should
trust these analysts anymore but anyways
in today's question let us know would
you recommend one an earlier launch of
the Galaxy S 10 which I would and - do
you want a 3 screen smartphone will the
foldable display and everything and all
this and that because in my case I do
the thing about it is I don't know how
much that thing is gonna cost because
tablets right now can be gotten for
really cheap 200 300 bucks so I'm not
gonna pay $1500 for a smartphone that
can become a tablet but that's just me
