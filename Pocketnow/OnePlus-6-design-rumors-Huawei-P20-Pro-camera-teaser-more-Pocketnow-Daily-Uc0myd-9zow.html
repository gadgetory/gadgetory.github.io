notch and a couple of other changes
Huawei b20 camera teasers point to our
class even the may 10 Pro and thanks for
hearing
despite the iPhone turns bad sales Apple
is ordering a crazy amount of screens
this year I'm high metal Iveta and yes
it's another week of rumors rumors and
at some point we'll have some news as
well this is pocket out daily the
official news today begin with the
huawei mate 10 Pro we had a review
rebuttal very recently I really love
that phone but I do consider it to be
overpriced when you can't subsidize it
in the United States so for those of you
in the market it's currently $100 off do
I recommend the phone yes I do
definitely recommend the phone you can
learn more about the Lian in the
description now let's talk about the
Samsung Galaxy s8 for those of you that
have been waiting for your Oreo update
this is a funny irony as a Verizon units
now have it we also hear that Sprint and
t-mobile are getting it guess who's
waiting
those of us with an unlock unit still
can't get it in addition to those of you
on AT&amp;amp;T when is that gonna happen I
personally can't wait now let's talk
about Apple as definitely the company
has been disappointing analysts with its
sales of the iPhone 10 not saying that
the phone sells bad but definitely not
what the predictions had entailed so as
it turns out we hear that well analysts
are adjusting everything for the next
couple of quarters but even so Cupertino
has just made a crazy order for 270
million displays for this phone so the
question is is this for the iPhone tenor
for whatever iPhone is coming next who
knows now let's move the spotlight back
to wow way as we've got a ton of
additional rumors and teasers of the
Huawei P 20 we're days away from the
event and well we already saw pretty
much what to expect with the light but
in the case of the pro we've seen those
triple cameras and the question is what
exactly are we getting Huawei is teasing
better low-light performance they're
teasing better slow-motion performance
which was not that great on the may 10
pro but even more interesting there's a
sketchy rumor that
points to a possibility of 40 megapixel
cameras and we're not exactly sure if
we're getting the hardware which would
be PureView territory or if we are
instead getting a stitch of all these
photos which is not necessarily new
that's something that phones have been
able to do for a while companies have
just stopped doing it but we'll keep you
posted the event is soon and finally the
most interesting news today I have to do
with the oneplus 6 of aka the Oppo ar-15
aka another vivo device because these
devices share design according to some
trusted sources the oneplus 6 will look
pretty much like the ar-15 and according
to everything we know about the ar-15
it's got a notch a six point two eight
inch display ninety percent screen to
body ratio six case of RAM et cetera et
cetera obviously the specs internally
are gonna be different for the oneplus X
but the most interesting part is the
fact that we're getting a notch
regardless of the ninety percent screen
to body ratio whatever math you want to
do with that because the notch I don't
know if that's being considered but
anyways in today's question we have a
company that tells us to never settle
which is one plus would you like to
settle for a notch with the one plus six
because in my case I don't know why
we're doing this I mean the design of
the one plus 5t was already great
without it why are we gonna change this
if there's no better facial recognition
or at least no necessary hardware that
would require this believe us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion fun fact recording there's a
third time because I wasn't aware that
there was a stain in my other shirt I
had to eat quickly friends again if you
