pocketnow.com and this is the video
unboxing of the eaten Blowfish ex650 it
is really popular device for me 10
because it's supposedly an affordable
device with the BGA screen the GPS so
let's see what I get here these packings
and there's the box pretty much ooh i
knows i'm going to get a purple device
nothing to it high-resolution vga
display and Will shall enable a photo
dialing weather forecast little time and
stuff and here are some specs and
everything so let's start here well I
guess rarity is a part of this box there
we go this is the device pull it out
then see what we get in the box here we
go well we have a wall charger oh and
it's an adapted a wall charger that you
get which is nice probably oh here
here's the adapter just spit it out then
just snap it in here cool really nice I
don't think I'll get any other adapter
split that was really welcomed then we
get a USB cable normal typical and its
mini USB which is that is not
proprietary then we get a little
headphones oh and it's 2.5 inch 2.5
millimeter headphones which is really
great for this device much better than
the mini USB adapter once then we get a
that's what I'm looking for here is the
battery weirder doesn't come in in any
packing it's a 15 15 hundred million
power battery which is really good
put that to one side we got some foam
which is not needed and then let's see
well we get a land we get an extra
stylus collapsible which is something I
don't like but could be good but at one
side and then we get a land yard which
looks like if it were leather really
good then we get this i believe is
microsoft office outlook 2007 which is
great to the trial here but it does
bring a product key so i'm believing
it's part of the software package and
then we get a quick start guide really
good then what else do we get we get a
home we get spb mobile shell built-in
and it's an upgrade to a full version
which you practically get one installed
i believe and then you pay 1495 and you
get it and you get it there spb mobile
shell is currently in version 1.5 and
just about to be upgraded and then here
is the devices there's the leather
covering interesting the it does look
leather but could be mistaken we'll know
after a couple of weeks of usage if it
starts cracking up it's not leather so
there we go and then well here's the
device like I said this is a really
really weird box pull this out here and
pull this down and you get a screen
cover which is good then it says gps
Wi-Fi cpu with 500 megahertz high
resolution screen 640 x 480 480 which is
great you get a camera with a flash and
i'm going to be looking at hardware
further on this is pretty much it for
this device i must say even if i don't
like the purple it's it's not bad it
doesn't really look purple it looks wine
looks elegant looks really nice and it's
really really thin
more to come the parking outcome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
