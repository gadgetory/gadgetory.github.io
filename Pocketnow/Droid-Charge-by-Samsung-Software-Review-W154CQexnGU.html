packing.com and this is the software
review of the Samsung Droid Charge on
Verizon's 4G LTE network so this device
is running android 2.2 along with the
TouchWiz user interface on top so let's
get you the rest of the software so the
droid charge is running similar software
that came on the galaxy s variants of
the devices that from last year and
unfortunately doesn't have the TouchWiz
4.0 that you can see on the galaxy s2
and i'll post a link right about here
you can watch Brandon's video of the
galaxy s2 so if i can pinch to zoom out
i can set my home screens if I'd like so
let me set this one to my home and I can
just go back and so now if I go anywhere
in the phone i'll have to just hit the
home button and it brings me back to
that page that i wanted so we don't have
any new live wallpapers that we see
haven't seen before so we'll just go
into the wallpapers and the live
wallpapers are here and the beach one
does come with the captivate android 2.2
update that came out a couple months ago
we can also go down to here and view all
of our connections we can turn them on
and off which is pretty nice to have on
the TouchWiz user interface to be able
to turn on and off radios if we tap and
hold we can get some of the widgets
let's see we have some Samsung widgets
available along with Android and a few
application widgets that came with this
device so we'll just go home and into
the menu into the settings i should say
and we can view our settings here let me
go to about information and we're
running android 2.2 point 1 which is a
pretty new froyo build so we'll just go
back can also get doc settings this
device is able to connect to a doc using
the micro USB 2.0 port and we'll just go
back home for you some the applications
that come on the device we just going
here and we have the basic applications
for android we have the allshare app
that allows you to share media over a
ready DLNA network so we can go there
and if i was connected to a Wi-Fi
connection you would be able to see the
files on my network so i'm just going to
go back home so back in the apps we have
our amazon kindle application we have
the V CAST apps which is verizon's
market it's sort of
order their android market we have the
backup assistant which allows you to
store your contact information and other
information directly to verizon server
and just go back we have bitbop which is
probably seen before a blockbuster which
allows you to download movies directly
to your android device you can also rent
them available in three days let me see
here so I guess if you have the
blockbuster online movie service you can
use this application we have our browser
which is just the basic android browser
we have a calculator which is a
reskinned to the TouchWiz user interface
we also have a scientific calculator if
we go to landscape mode so let me just
go back out of here whatever Google
Calendar camera camera is pretty
phenomenal not only does it take awesome
videos which we will post on the final
review and we'll post also a video
sample with 720p video resolution it
also takes really good photos which will
post to the final review one cool thing
about this is it does have software so
you can take panorama photos and a
probably post one of those also on the
final review so we'll just get out of
here and the camera is pretty easy to
use we have city ID which is a pretty
basic application i don't know why they
decided to put this on here maybe
there's something more with your
subscription status or with your a
subscription but let me go here all it
does is looks up a phone number so let's
say i was trying to 0 6 205 or something
it will show me that it's from seattle
washington so i don't know why they
included this app but i will just get
out of here we have the clock which is
the basic android clock daily briefing
which is a nice application from
TouchWiz and Samsung which allows you to
view the information for your specific
city we can just scroll over and get
finance information for our stock list
if we like when you see what else we
have we have a tmobile so we can get
some news and current events and stuff
like that well just go over again we
give you our schedule and we can also go
to add and let me just go back if I
wanted to add a schedule I can just do
that from here I can go back and I can
add other things to my my finance list
so let me just go back out of this
application we have our desk cradle
which is a pretty cool application if
you're going to use your device while
it's plugged in it has a day and night
mode and allows you to access some of
your most used
locations directly from this program so
are directly from this desk application
so we can view our weather and get alarm
voice search gallery daily briefing and
our music directly from this app while
it's sitting on our desk we have email
which is pretty basic we have the
gallery which is the default Android
gallery going over we have Gmail Google
search guided tours which gives you
tutorial videos on how to set up your
device how to set up the droid charge
and also how to access various features
on verizon so let me just go back out of
there we have instant messenger which
only works over a 3g service we have AOL
instant messenger windows live in yahoo
messenger it would be nice if they
included facebook on this or some other
twitter feeds but you can also update
those on the touchwiz home screen i'll
show you that on another widget we have
Google Latitude let's golf too which is
a demo that is pretty a simple game to
play it's a 3d game okay so here we are
on the let's golf to game and it does
allow you to play the demo so we can go
an instant play and the video on this
game is pretty phenomenal it's a 3d
style game unfortunately we're getting a
lot of a polarization from the way that
the screen is set up and also how the
camera captures some of the images so
let me just go hero touch just continue
and we can begin playing this game when
it starts loading okay so here we are
and we'll just shoot this golf ball out
here and let's see how accurate we can
get it and the game continues on like
this the full version does cost four
dollars in 99 cents so we'll just get
out of here so we'll just continue with
the applications we have the android
market we have media hub which allows
you to download TV and movies directly
to your android device in which is the
droid charge here so we can download TV
and TV shows for a set fee we can also
rent them if we like so let me see here
if you want to look at one of these
episodes we can own it for a dollar
ninety-nine cents and you can also rent
movies directly from the media hub
application we have google maps we have
mobile hotspot which allows you to share
your data connection from your droid
charge to 10 other devices which is a
pretty cool especially if you're able to
access the 4g LTE network because it's a
phenomenally fast
let's go to music player which is just
the generic and Roy music player that we
have here we can go back we have my
files which allows you to search through
all your files on the device and through
the SD card we have my verizon mobile
but i don't actually have a verizon
account with this device so i won't be
able to use that rhapsody which is just
a quick video that shows you what rap
city is we have a google navigation
google places we have rock band which is
another demo game we have to our
settings which we can get from the menu
we have setup wizard which shows you how
to set your droid charge pretty easily
we have slacker radio which is a free
internet radio application that allows
you to play music directly over a Wi-Fi
or 3G or 4G connection and there's if
you have the paid for service you don't
have any advertisements or commercial so
you can just get out there Google Talk
task manage which is Annie application
if you want to end various tasks so let
me go here I can view my running
applications and I can just exit all to
help save some battery power and also
some memory can go to download and view
all the applications that I've
downloaded already I can go to ram and I
can clear my memory if I'd like right
now it's only at 220 megabytes so if I
want I can clear this and it might bring
it down a little bit less but it changed
a little bit so ignites go to storage
and view our internal phone storage and
our external SD card storage we have
think free office V CAST media but you
do have to have a verizon account and
various things cost money and
fortunately I will access this on this
phone because this is just a demo unit
that we have we have a video player so
let me go on here and we have one video
that we can play and this device is
capable of rendering up to 720p video
out of the hdmi connection so here's
just a little sample video and we can go
back and get out of this we have voice
dialer voice recorder voice search
visual voicemail which shows you your
voicemail messages directly onto the
droid charge that is a paid for service
through verizon and I don't have a
subscription for that we have VZ
navigator which also paid for navigation
Program youtube and
tunewiki allows you to get lyrics so you
can sing along with these songs playing
on your android device and that is about
it let's go through some of the quadrant
standards the smart bench and also the
Linpack for Android to see exactly how
fast this device is run it so we will
launch quadrant standard benchmark and
we'll come back with results in just a
second to the quadrant standard
benchmark is not too incredibly fast on
the droid charge the device seems
somewhat laggy when I'm going through
applications and whatnot as you can see
we get any 972 which has been pretty
average to the other scores that I've
been testing throughout the couple of
days that I've had this device so let's
try another benchmark so on linpack for
android we're getting about 12.21 mflops
in 6.8 7 seconds so that's a relatively
fast it's not incredibly fast course we
have seen some very fast benchmarks for
linpack with of course rooted phones
with like 1.8 giga hertz and that was
like at 65 in flops so let's try the
last one which is smart bench 2011 okay
so on smart bench 2011 we're getting
scores of 841 which has been pretty
average for what I've got on this
particular device over the last couple
of days also and it says that android
2.2 point one stock rom which is what it
has should be running around 2094 so it
seems kind of weird that this device is
running a little bit slower than the
stock android 2.2 point one devices
available so another great feature that
the droid charge comes with is the swipe
texting so if i wanted to write its out
something i'll have to a swipe my finger
across the keyboard and it will spell it
out so let's just choose the house is
white or something like that and i'll
hopefully it works pretty well ok it
didn't get it exactly perfect but you
get the idea so this has been the
software review of the Samsung Droid
Charge on Verizon's 4G LTE network
unfortunately I wasn't able to do a
network speed test on the 4g service
because the service in my area is rather
spotty if you miss the unboxing you can
check it out right about here and we'll
also post the hardware review right
about here and stay tuned for the final
review where we go through everything on
the samsung droid charge and will also
have those video samples and photo
samples thanks for watching
