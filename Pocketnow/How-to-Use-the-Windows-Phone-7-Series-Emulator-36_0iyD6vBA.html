now calm and in this video I'm gonna
show you how to run the Windows Phone 7
Series emulator right now there's not
too much you can see in the emulator but
you can mess around with Internet
Explorer move around and some of the
settings and some other things so it may
be interesting for you to experiment a
little bit it's really easy to do first
download Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
Express for Windows Phone and that's a
mouthful to say we'll post a link on
pocketnow.com on how to do that it's
free it takes some time to download it's
a big file but once its installed you
just open it up and what we're going to
do now is go to file and new project and
I'm just going to click OK on the first
thing I see here and now the next thing
I'm going to do is hit f5 on my keyboard
it's gonna take a few minutes depending
on how fast your computer is but here it
is windows moment emulator ok so here we
are I'm going to minimize Visual Studio
here and it's still thinking somebody
give it a second ok here we are and we
can press these three virtual buttons
here so we can go back to the Start
screen we can swipe to the right to see
the programs list we can do a few things
with these items on the right we can
flip it into a different orientation
some programs will rotate some well not
for example Internet Explorer will
rotate so here it is rotated another
thing you can do is change how large the
the screen is here so we can go to a
larger size this is the actual size or
we can change the zoom to a hundred
percent or something smaller than that
and of course we can go back into
portrait if you want to want things to
look more normal so that was a look on
how to get the Windows Phone 7 Series
emulator working we'll post links on
pocketnow.com on exactly which files you
need to download in order to get this to
work that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
