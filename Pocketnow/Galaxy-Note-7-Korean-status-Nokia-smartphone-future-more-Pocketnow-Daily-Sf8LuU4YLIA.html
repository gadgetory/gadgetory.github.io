working with Samsung on testing the cost
for the note 7 explosions recent Nokia
developments could point to a smartphone
announced at mwc 2017 and US carriers
have already begun preparing for the lgb
20 I'm hi Mary vetta and in the current
state of the phablet market I will be
excited for anything that gets announced
right now this is pocket out daily my
official loose do they have to do with
deals and product announcements those of
you in the market for the lgb 20 which
I've been testing for the last few weeks
and I really love well it's now
available for pre-order on tmobile for
the same crazy price tag that it is at
AT&amp;amp;T but the difference here is that you
get a couple of goodies number one to be
a no headphones which I do like number
two you also actually get a two hundred
dollar deal if you bring in an old
smartphone not necessarily the old one
you're currently using an old smartphone
you learn more than work in the
description they're very interesting
news have to do with AT&amp;amp;T as the company
has just announced the new product
repair program starting as of November
15 for those of you that have ensured
your smartphone you will be getting
screen repairs with a deductible of 89
bucks which is close to what apple
charges but then you're asking what the
catch is and the fact that look at the
list in the link in the description the
amount of smartphones on the list is
very limited mainly focused on iPhones
and galaxy phones now let's talk about
mwc 2017 in Barcelona which is happening
at the end of februari we already have
the announcement that nokia CEO will be
one of the speakers at the event and
this could mean a couple of things we've
rarely ever seen a keynote speaker
announced products but then again we do
know that nokia really needs to return
to the limelight in mobile so many of
the rumors claim that will finally see a
smart phone from nokia this event stay
tuned we will be covering it their lives
and for those of you that were left
wanting the s-pen that you're not able
to enjoy any more in the case of the
note 7 that I spent is apparently making
it to a new Chromebook pro from Samsung
this is currently just leaked images it
looks a lot like a yoga book that you
can flip and use it in different
positions looks really interesting but
apparently the price tag is not going to
be too nice
above the for a dollar tier which is
expensive for Chromebooks we'll keep you
posted as well on that one and finally
the very hot news they have to do with
the samsung galaxy note 7 and more
developments on the debacle number one
the company estimates this much to 7.1
million customers lost to the iphone
obviously number two it seems to the
company was actually testing the
batteries early because new technologies
and number three the Korean government
has already become involved with
independent testing Samsung has decided
to cooperate it's rather interesting it
just gets more and more dramatic and it
makes all the sense of the world a
smartphone is very intimate to consumers
and it makes sense for governments to be
involved but it leads me to the question
of the day do you think that this has
permanently tarnished the samsung brand
going forward in my case I don't think
so because the note was never the
company's best seller but it was the
company's best phone this year and they
made it seem that way leave us a comment
down below we'd love to know your
opinion friends you know the way it goes
