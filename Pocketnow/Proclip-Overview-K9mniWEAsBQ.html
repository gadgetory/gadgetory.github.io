pocketnow.com and today we're going to
give you something a little different
we're going to review the pro clip car
mounting solution for smartphones
cellphones gps tablets whatever it may
be it is a car mount and as you know car
mounts are a dime a dozen so let's see
how the pro clip matches up against this
competition we're going to unbox the pro
clip install the pro clip and then
revisit it after two weeks and see if it
really does up to the hype so let's go
ahead and get started alright guys we're
back I'm going to make this a very brief
unboxing and that's because I really
want to take the bulk of this video and
dedicate that to the installation of the
pro clip mount as well as my final
thoughts on it so we're going to go
ahead and do a quick unboxing a brief
unboxing real fast and just kind of go
over the product itself box keeps
ripping here once again I am doing this
brief so you can see the packaging that
initially comes in and that sort of
thing now the pro clip mount is a two
clip system the clips itself box is now
empty so the first one is actually going
to be what mounts to your car as you can
see here this is for my car the Ford
Focus 2008 to 2010 I of 2010 shows you a
diagram of where it goes which is
exactly my car and give you some
instructions that's the piece itself
right here as you can see it kind of
also gives you some information here
it's a two-part solution etc etc and
this basically allows you to have a
universal system for any device any kind
of phone that pro clip makes an
attachment for so the second piece is
actually you can see here it's an
attachment for the iphone believe it or
not I use the HTC EVO this is this
actually this holster right here is
designed to hold the iPhone with a case
on it so that should hypothetically fit
the width of the Evo no problem as you
can see here it's actually says holster
will tilt swivel right there with the
skin so this should fit my iPhone my evo
no problems you can see here it gives
you a diagram as well alright guys and
we are back and we are now in my car
it's about a hundred degrees out today
on all the a/c on so it's a little
him but we're going to do is we're going
to install the pro clip mount so as you
can see here this is the first piece
this is the piece that will actually
clip onto my dashboard itself now the
picture that the manual shows it
actually shows the amount itself going
over here which my steering wheel is
here as you can see great design and all
however if I put my phone here it's
going to block out my screen here so I'm
not be able to see the songs that are
playing or the phone number that's
calling me that sort of thing so I've
actually gone ahead and decided that I'm
going to put it over here instead so at
least I'll be able to see everything now
my only gripe so far is it doesn't as
dumb as it sounds it doesn't come with
an alcohol wipe of any kind and the
reason why I say that is it has these
little sticky adhesive pads here they
typically will come with the alcohol
wipe this does not hey no worries that's
fine so we're gonna go ahead and were
going to just basically take this
adhesive pad up it's going to actually
clip right between the screen here and
our on top of my vendors you can see
here so we're going to peel this
adhesive strip again this is a two-piece
mount system this first piece is just
the mount the second part itself is
actually kind of what attaches to that
mount so I'm actually going to peel both
pieces of adhesive protective tape so I
do not have an issue when I get to that
alright and we're now going to just clip
it in you can see that was a nice clip
noise and then this one goes second down
here tight fit it fits perfectly
as you just heard so now we have to do
is just attach the second piece and then
we will be all set okay we're now going
to actually attach the clip portion onto
the mount that holds the foam and as a
few different mounting options here as
you can see there's one bag here that's
actually going to give me Phillips or
better yet flathead screws with the
actual nut themselves however I'm not
going to use those I'm going to use
these smaller Phillips heads that are in
this bag and the reason why they give
you different screws is because you can
see here the different sizes for the
mount I'm going to use these two small
ones though because of the amount that I
have the reason why this is this way is
the clip that I have here will fit any
one of the mounts that pro clip offers
and because there's so many different
cars out there
Pro clip has so many different types of
mouths here as you can see this one is
built exclusively for the Ford Focus
however whatever car you may have they
have a fit for it so because of that
there's two different screw sizes now
what we're going to do is I've actually
gone ahead and decided that I'm going to
mount it vertically here so it's a
little more out of the way I'm gonna go
ahead and do that
alright guys and it's officially all
installed I honestly this is going to be
great for me to see while I'm driving
blocks up my temperature gauge just a
little I can actually pop my keys in and
we'll see how it blocks out my
temperature gauge just ever so slightly
actually you know what I can see my
temperature gauge I'm going to pull this
off the tripod right now she can get a
better glimpse and I apologize for the
shakiness I have pulled the camera off
the tripod it's a little warm in here
but you can see this is my point of view
here so you know as I'm driving let's
say and then now you can see my Evo
itself with the sync display and you can
kind of catch the actual temperature
gauge itself which is not bad at all
Bluetooth logo and that sort of thing
now once again this is actually is not
designed for the Evo this holster itself
is actually meant for the iPhone and
many many blackberries the BlackBerry
8300 you know the curve series that sort
of thing
Johan from Pro clip did tell me they are
coming out with a Evo version of the pro
clip so basically it will still be the
same mount I would actually be able to
keep the mount in my car but if I want
to change the actual clip here I can
just get the Evo version that will be
meant to fit the Evo specifically in
terms of width height that sort of thing
so it's a little tall looking but you
know what when I'm driving from my point
of view this is going to be the easiest
to see it
I do use the forward sync that was one
of the main things that I wanted to do
with this clip as well was you know I
use the Ford SYNC and I want to really
take advantage of those features in
terms of you know using the Bluetooth
audio and using the calling features
that's huge for me so now I'm going to
have that so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to drive around with this for
about a week and I will give you guys my
full review and we will go from there
alright we have now been using the pro
clip mount for a little over two weeks
with nothing but positive results as you
can see here the amount itself will
actually pivot so you can actually turn
the phone or device whatever you have on
there to better be in your view now we
were also using this mount itself with
the HTC EVO 4G as well as the samsung
galaxy s the way it works you can see
here you actually just slide the device
right into this little track here and
now
is known for having terrible quality
roads despite that we found that our
devices always stayed very visible and
did not shake around and never once fell
out of this mount itself this mount
overall is a winner this is the actual
iPhone mount that will fit the iPhone
with a skin or a case on it because of
that this fits the Evo and it's 4.3 inch
footprint there are many many many other
mounts to choose from based on the make
and model of your car as well as the
device you're going to be using so go
ahead and check them out we can't
recommend this guy enough as always
thank you very much for watching
everyone please leave us a comment with
your thoughts on this mount as well as
give us the thumbs up and stay tuned for
