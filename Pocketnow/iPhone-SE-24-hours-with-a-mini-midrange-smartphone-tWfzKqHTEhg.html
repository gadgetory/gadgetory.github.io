littlest iPhone still has that new car
smell but what have we learned so far
about Apple's mid Ranger mashup I'm Juan
Carlos bag now for pocket now and here's
day one with the iPhone se I'm
personally not the biggest iOS fan so
first day use is often spent getting
back into the swing of Apple software
it's like speaking a language I'm only
conversationally familiar with and the
muscle memory takes a little while to
overwrite no one double tapping the home
button here doesn't launch the camera
that and there's still a tendency to
feel around for a non-existent power
button on the side of the phone still
there's something charming about coming
back to this form factor in design the
metal and glass back is my favorite look
for any iPhone it's clean sharp modern
simple this throwback to the iPhone 5s
shell also means that the SE is maybe
the best accessorized air quotes new
phone ever launched even I have old
iPhone cases lying around and my
magnetic lens kit came with extra iPhone
5s adhesives now day one is a terrible
time for getting a sense of what the
battery life might be like setting up
the phone is a new device it's not the
kind of usage one would normally put the
phone through for daily tasks but the SE
has held up well considering full charge
in the morning at 8 a.m.
installing a handful of mission-critical
apps over Wi-Fi logging into accounts
fielding a couple phone calls and some
emails and we're down to around 70
percent by noon not really impressive by
any stretch but certainly not terrible
the battery is around five percent
larger than the iPhone 5s though I doubt
that we'll see significant differences
in longevity this screen has been
perfectly fine for covering the basics
there were concerns going back to a
lower resolution display but at arm's
length
text is perfectly readable and photos
look decent enough people who like to
get their noses into their phones will
probably be a bit disappointed and no
one was seriously looking to this phone
for virtual reality applications but the
real test will come when we start taxing
the camera a bit more
using a phone screen as a viewfinders
one area where it's really easy to get
spoiled by larger and higher resolution
displays nor should anyone be shocked by
the sentiment that 16 gigabytes of
storage is really lean these days I'm
not quite through installing my
mission-critical apps and this phone is
already down to around seven and a half
the eggs of available storage I haven't
put on any music and maybe I'll rely on
streaming options and the camera hasn't
seen much action yet but a lightning
connector memory card reader will be in
regular rotation to backup camera
samples speaking of music there's little
fault to be found with the first couple
tracks we've listened to over headphones
there's still a bit of EQ color
delivered on the stock settings but
anecdotally the iPhone se delivers
louder playback than our galaxy s7
review unit we'll have proper tests and
charts to share with the full review any
criticisms we might have though are a
little less frustrating on a mid-range
er phone and to be sure this is a
mid-range phone I can drop a Ferrari
engine in a Toyota and that won't mean I
suddenly have an Italian supercar the
early complaints we might share while
using the iPhone se though just don't
feel as significant on a device which
costs a hundred and fifty dollars less
than a brand new iPhone 6 we're going to
run this little phone hard over the
weekend and report back with a final
review also be on the lookout for a
couple comparison videos so we can all
see exactly where the iPhone se should
fit in the overall smartphone market
even though this isn't a power user
device it's already shaping up to be a
solid recommendation for some of the
people in my circles of family and
friends as always thanks so much for
watching be sure to subscribe to this
channel for future smartphone reviews
and comparisons and hit that thumbs up
button for a little extra positive
reinforcement for pocket now I'm Kwon
Carlos back now you can chat me up on
Instagram and Twitter as some gadget guy
I will catch you all on the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
