lineup Samsung has substituted focus for
features fit and finish for frills and
the result is a formidable phone but has
the company sacrificed too much in its
quest to commoditize the king of phablet
let's find out
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
this is our video review of the samsung
galaxy note 5 not since 2012 has a note
so closely resembled its mainstream
cousin the galaxy note 5 takes its
design cues directly from the galaxy s6
family with a gorilla glass back cover
curling into a mid plate molded from
7000 series aluminum and featuring
charging audio and speaker ports on the
bottom edge the display is quad HD and
Super AMOLED featuring very high pixel
density and a Wacom digitizer to
interpret pen inputs that's nothing new
but it's an absolutely stunning screen
if you're coming from almost any other
smartphone and it's super narrow bezels
make the note 5 much easier to hold than
any other 5.7 inch device it all adds up
to the best feeling best-looking Galaxy
Note in memory the clicky buttons and
the new spring-loaded s pen or a
tactility treat while the mass and
materials combine to give it the sense
of a very expensive product which of
course it is realistically speaking
though you'll probably need to invest in
a case or at least a skin to keep it
looking that way the glass is absolutely
impossible to keep free of fingerprints
and though this particular phone has
survived a waist height drop onto a
hardwood floor I'm not sure it would be
as lucky in a fall onto asphalt pop off
the back cover and oh right for the
first time in note history you can't pop
open the back cover to replace the
onboard battery nor will you find any
microSD expansion slot alongside the SIM
tray instead you're stuck with the 32 or
64 gigs of storage included out of the
box there's not even an IR port here
if you're never used carry them out or
even knew about these features from
previous notes none of this is likely to
bother you if you prone to rely on them
you may want to stick with last year's
model as we said in last week's Note 4
versus note 5 comparison if you do
though you'll be missing out on some
slick software accessed via the new and
improved fingerprint scanner on the home
button if you've seen our galaxy s6
review you already know the software
story here is Samsung's custom interface
is speedier than ever atop android 5.1.1
driven by the company's own Exynos
processor and four gigs of high-speed
ram that combination makes for a much
smoother multitasking experience than we
initially saw on the s6 and the big
screen on the note 5 makes running to
apps side-by-side easier as well
if you're like me and you really don't
like the out of box interface design
there's more good news Samsung's theme
store is full of skins both paid and
free that let you customize to your
heart's content and by default the
screen is set to a higher dpi level than
usual making it possible to achieve more
information density and making it an
even better tablet replacement than
previous notes those usability
improvements aren't accompanied by many
new features the list of apps that
support Samsung's multi window feature
is effectively identical to last years
which itself wasn't much improved over
the year before that given how awkward
the multi-screen experience can
sometimes be the sluggish development
pace here is frustrating there's a
little more excitement when it comes to
the s-pen pop it out with a quick click
and the note is instantly ready to take
down a memo with no button pressing
required just slip the s-pen back into
its silo when you're done to
automatically save the note and return
the phone to standby this is the best
kind of new feature it's super useful
and it's simple as anything and the same
goes for the new built-in PDF reader but
lets you assign contracts and other
legal forms without having to download
additional software you can still use
the s-pen for all kinds of doodles
sketches and notes to self but to me
that's never been the primary appeal of
the stylus
I think the s-pen is at its best when
it's used
violate existing content as a
highlighter for scripts or study guides
as a kind of surrogate finger when the
device is in an awkward or uncomfortable
position as a markup tool for
screenshots and so on the new scroll
capture mode lets you preserve very long
web pages as screenshots for later
reference convenient for sharing long
discussion threads chat logs or long
lists of driving directions by all
indications the Galaxy Note 5 camera is
the same one found in the s6 that means
a 16 megapixel sensor with an F 1.9
aperture made it to an optical image
stabilization system and triggered by a
double click on the home key it also
means the best photo quality you can
find on Android almost without exception
it's not without its flaws as we saw in
our comparison with the LG g4 the note 5
suffers from focus instability in very
low light but there's a full suite of
manual controls including manual focus
to compensate for that HDR mode tends to
wash out colors just like on any
smartphone but it can be a lifesaver in
backlit scenarios where you're trying to
capture detail in the shadows for
completeness sake we've got to mention
Samsung's new software features live
broadcast is an analogue to periscope or
meerkat that lets you stream video on
the fly via your own YouTube channel
video collage is a clever way of
squeezing for brief clips into a single
frame and raw mode lets you save
uncompressed images for more precise
editing later on thankfully you don't
need to use any of those parlor tricks
to get the most out of this camera you
just double click and shoot and odds are
you're going to get a great result
whether it's a video or is still and
whether you're using the primary sensor
or the selfie shooter it's fantastic and
as usual we have many more samples in
the full review at pocket now we tested
the Galaxy Note 5 on both t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T for seven days in the Boston and
Indianapolis markets the phone delivered
solid reception and call quality and
thanks to its slimmer more rounded build
it's definitely the most comfortable and
least
awkward note ever when it comes to voice
calls also the one-two punch of the
powerful processor and heavy Ram loadout
serve it well as with every note before
it this one can handle the most
demanding of titles with a plum just
don't be surprised if apps crash from
time to time that's life on any
smartphone Fitness fans will be happy to
know that Samsung's s health app just
keeps getting better you scroll through
the simple interface take a pulse
reading with the heart rate sensor you
tell it how much coffee and water you've
had you can see that info alongside how
many steps you've taken to get a
snapshot of how active you've been we
used to give Samsung guff for including
this kind of stuff sort of seemed outta
left field but if I bought a note five
today I could see myself using this app
every day to try to evaluate my fitness
trends and maybe save myself from an
early death by a sedentary bloggers
lifestyle speaking of early death while
I didn't miss the micro SD card slot
during my week with the note 5 I sure
wish Samsung had found a way to either
keep the battery replaceable or make it
bigger 3000 milliamp hours isn't all
that much when you've got a phone as
full of power drains as this and the
note 5 gave us an average of four to
four and a half hours of screen on time
per charge on t-mobile slightly more
than that on AT&amp;amp;T that's not bad it'll
get you through a day of light to
moderate mixed usage and what's more if
you carry the included fast charger you
can top it up very quickly from dead to
25% in just 15 minutes or keep it on a
wireless charging pad all day if you're
an office dweller but there's no getting
around it the note used to be known for
outstanding endurance and this one is
just average fortunately for the note 5
nothing else about it can be called
average it's a premium built smartphone
with a jaw-dropping display a
best-in-class camera and a feature set
you can't get on any other device now a
lot of folks are disappointed that it
lacks the power user features that have
always defined the line and that's
understandable those who say the note 5
is just a big galaxy s6 with an S
well to a degree they have a point the
thing is it turns out that a big galaxy
s6 with an S Pen is actually a pretty
fantastic smartphone there's so much
more to learn about the galaxy note5
