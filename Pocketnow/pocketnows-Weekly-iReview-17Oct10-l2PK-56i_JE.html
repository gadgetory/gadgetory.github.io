for SMS included apples / no restriction
pens are going a bit too far this time
and it seems the dev team has officially
figured out how to keep your iphone
jailbroken for the rest of its life all
this and more coming up right now hello
everybody I'm hi everyone and welcome to
the park and our I review the show we go
for all this week school and they're not
so cool is how the world of Apple's iOS
devices as always let's start off this
week with the cool wool verizon has
already begun selling the ipad on their
stores it doesn't really mean much
further smartphone marketing what we
cover but it does mean that verizon and
Apple are getting along which means that
yes the rumors that the verizon iphone
could be true at the beginning of next
year could hold more water as of now so
we'll see how story unfolds eventually
yes iOS 4.1 has officially been
jailbroken by the dev team and suddenly
even though it's not as cool as
jailbreakme com just yet it seems the
geo hot comex and lie marine exploits
are cool enough to keep your iOS device
jailbroken for the rest of its life how
will it seems this works through the a4
chip so it pretty much won't cover the
iphone 3gs and past devices but it seems
that the x-point was so good as long as
your iDevice carries the a4 chip it
won't be able to be fixed by Apple who
holds the cards well you know it's Apple
so we'll see what happens another cool
thing that happened this week is that
amazon is now featuring a barcode
scanner on their iOS app that will allow
you to go to a store look at anything
you want to buy scan it and see if the
prices are better on your Amazon store
and then buy it right then so it pretty
much is trying to get you to leave empty
handed out of the store kind of cool and
yes video chatting is becoming the thing
lately as yahoo has rolled out their iOS
update that will bring video chatting
between your devices Android devices and
also the pc and mac so this joins the
services coming from Frank tango and you
know even the same face time from Apple
even though the service from FaceTime is
not working between pcs or Macs just yet
what can we expect well
let's hope skype you know gets the memo
and they don't take a couple of months
to do the same thing because it's
actually really cool and yeah I'll say
it again it seems the jailbreakers have
all the fun I mean one of the funny
things about iOS is the fact that you
have this clock in there but it's stuck
to 10 15 I mean it's not really live you
don't see the hands moving anytime but
there's this jailbreak feature called
like rock which will actually make it
move towards the real time so again
jailbreak it's really a need guys ok so
let's start off with the not so cool iOS
4.2 beta 3 is out it's rolling pretty
much a week from beta 2 and why is this
in the not so cool well it did bring
some stability improvements but it also
brought some SMS ringtones that really
suck you know I really feel Apple should
pick up the phone call HTC and ask them
who makes the ringtones because HTC does
a really good job at this and it seems
Apple need some help desperately well
consider Ewing on it seems that Apple
has filed a pen that avoids sexting you
know text messaging for you know what
I'm talking about but the thing is it
seems that this pen actually allows
parents to block portions of messages or
the hold message from somebody specific
if it has sort of weird content now why
do we consider it not so cool it's great
that we have more parental restrictions
on iOS devices I consider them to be the
best in the market but you know blocking
stuff or bringing different things means
that Apple actually has a little bit of
a scoop of what you get and it really is
not good for privacy so if Apple can do
this through parents it could do it
eventually through other things and you
can actually have these really control
freak parents just go away beyond what
is really meaning controlling and
actually you know snoop into what you're
typing which is good for some things but
not good for others so anyways and
continuing on it seems that Foxconn
which is a company that builds the
iphones has just raised the cost for
their building of iphones to avoid more
suicide cases within their plant this is
actually cool because
it seems that workers there then have a
really good decent treatment for the job
they did but they're not so cool thing
is you know it'll raise costs so let's
just hope that Apple bites the bullet on
these costs and doesn't make the iphone
5 more expensive we'll see what happens
in the end that's it for today's I
