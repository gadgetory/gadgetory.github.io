we're going to take a look at windows
mobile 6.1 Professional right now
first off let's show you the task
manager this is no longer part of the
settings memory control panel and it's
lies you use see the sake for end tasks
is right there on the left
so we can easily
killed programs and you can see how much
memory each one takes up you can also do
processes
but you can't end any abuse
from here
can also switch applications we're going
to go to Internet Explorer
now the newest thing here is under menu
you have zoom out and you see it's the
default select one so I have to do is
press menu Softpedia and enter
and you can scroll really quickly
some pages are still readable like this
some are not so much and then you can
zoom right in now right now I have the
view setting to fit the screen if you
put it to desktop
none zoom out you can see it's all in
full desktop style rendering
however the problem ere is if you zoom
in you can't read this taxi it goes you
have to scroll all the way over here so
that's not very good for usability
now you can also render one column as
usual
and Saval
and there's a lot more scrolling when
you have it in one column view but
having the zoomit out the capability
makes it pretty easy
so that's pretty nice I really like this
interface for the zooming there's no
double tapping which is undisturbed well
anyway
but this also Scrolls like that
that's with HTC devices it only
now a lot of you probably use mobile
formatted websites
and the zooming is still very useful
with those
so that's a pretty big improvement but
as you can see this is still the old
notes floor rendering engine so it's not
that quick
and also note because amount command is
not accessible while you're still
loading so you actually have to wait
until it's finished before you can zoom
out and navigate the page
and for some sites that can be a long
time
okay I'm sick of that so let me go to
messaging now the new text messaging
here you see it says me that means I
wrote that message right here which is
weird just because we're in the inbox if
I open that it's showing a conversation
but I had a few notice up there that's
an MMS message there's a little picture
icon
and when you type
you see up here it shows the number of
characters out of how many a poor
message and the send button right here
for the left soft key which is really
great unfortunately there's no pictures
of who these people are anymore that was
a nice feature of the previous version
email messages is pretty much the same
also you can't mark as unread anymore in
the text messaging program
carpeted sim is also grayed out but
you can still do if you go to the
conversation and then select a message
now coverage son is available
so that's about it for Windows Mobile
