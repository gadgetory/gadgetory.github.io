drink last night and do it I'm trying to
build a reputation here I'm Anna don't
get effed up on New Year's so you can do
the videos right and that actually works
better when i'm effed up pocket rumors
and probably you're trying to find news
for the wrong industry that's right it's
that time of the week i am hi Mary theta
this is it now and this is the
parking out daily recap for last week or
a couple of weeks ago we're going to do
things a little differently this week
since we're pretty much covering the
week of New Year's we only had three
videos to respond to comments so we're
going to respond to more comments /
video this time just to compensate
starting with monday i asked you what
processor is important to you when
buying a new smartphone is qualcomm was
already teasing something new for CES
2015 and it ended up being the G flex 2
with the Snapdragon 810 we have 532
comments out of which a fond says when
it comes to android smartphones
processors change the whole user
experience not only does it make the
phone perform better but also the
availability of custom roms is a great
importance you have an incredible point
here yes the prom with Android is mainly
that the processor does determine
everything sometimes sometimes users
just want user experience and that's
where the processor doesn't really
matter and the Moto X proves that then
David Jacob says well I'm a gamer and I
also want the best software experience
so smart phone specifications are
pivotal for me when buying phones
nothing annoys a gamer more than lag and
even with the hottest specifications we
have seen lag on Android but I do get
your point Deepak says I look for
high-end specs only when purchasing
Android smartphones and iphones and
Lumias I don't care I have a note for an
iphone six-plus iphone 6 Nexus 6 Moto X
2014 Lumia 735 and Lumia 1520 so not at
all a fanboy of any OS lucky you man the
Jonathan dire says I will want to
Snapdragon 800 and above on my phone
because of its power saving capabilities
but if I have to choose a processor I'd
have the a-10 and I'll tell you this
much the Snapdragon 800 processor was so
pivotal and I'm going to use that word
again for me because of those power
saving capabilities that yes that was
like the first
time that I ever said I want a
Snapdragon 800 processor on my next
phone and in that case it was the note 3
that I had last year so yeah I do follow
your point as well there are some
processors that are just worth it and
then Jonathan Michael ayah says apples
a7 a8 chips have lower clock speeds but
run so well so I'm not a speck head when
it comes to buying phones same goes for
windows phones running older Snapdragon
s4 but still runs perfectly fine and yes
the spec rice only pertains to Android
but then again right now I'm reviewing
the Lumia 930 and because of its
snapdragon 800 processor you're getting
Lumia denim updates and features that
other windows phones aren't getting so I
guess it is moving in that direction
then on Tuesday ask you what do you
think about Apple success in the holiday
season of 2014 as the company had sold
more iphones and ipads than everybody
else and by a significant number we have
better than Maddie ones comments out of
which the Sandman 42 says Apple gives
you quality dependable and class in
their devices and I'm sure a lot of
people agree with that all right kind of
agree with that too but not in
everything in fact your gaming says when
you're using an iphone it's a fashion
statement and when you use an iPhone
people think that you're rich when you
buy an android phone like a note for for
example they think they just can't
afford an iphone and most kids today
want iphones talk to my little bro on
what you want said he wants iphone um
interesting it depends on where you're
from in my country it is a fashion
statement but so our galaxy phones
particularly the note lineup so it
really depends on where you are can you
probably share in the comments and
Phyllis says people choose the iphone
over android phones because the average
user doesn't know about SOC s or
milliamp hours they don't care about
having one gigabyte of RAM versus three
gigs or that the iphone only has a
dual-core chip all they know is that it
looks good it feels premium and it works
like it's supposed to that final part of
the sentence it works like it's supposed
to I think that that narrows everything
down people don't really care about
specs they care that the phone works
well and so yeah that's really what
makes the iphone the iphone but then
right rather have people try the Moto X
that's the android phone to be seriously
when it comes to function now
the usability and dependability as well
but Ivan says iphone sell so well
because iphone always had what people
wanted great camera design apps speed
and now it's finally got what people
wanted which is a big display true
indeed in a lot of the things that you
say but yes people wanted a big display
and finally apple gave it to them so I
think that's the reason why the iPhone 6
is sold by cots cakes and then
coonawarra says I think their stupidity
made them by Apple products and dude are
you calling me stupid and finally on
Wednesday I asked you if you thought
that Samsung was doing the right job
with project zero because rumors are
that the company is experimenting with a
ton of designs that are wild and even
new ways to bring us TouchWiz out of
which we have 809 comments Helen says
yes I'm so glad Samsung is doing what
Apple has been doing for years making
the product that just works who cares
about one to three gigabytes of RAM 720p
or 1080p 1440p or 4k so long as it works
then after it works jump on the spec
wagon ooh that's a very interesting
comment first of all because the Moto X
has not done this and they haven't
succeeded in the Android space and this
is where Samsung is battling against
other Android competitors where the spec
race is important an apple is a product
of its own it's not trying to compete
against anybody even though you could
say that the size changes are showing
that the company is but I'm not sure
this will work for samsung but again we
could be wrong and cipriana says make
the s6 look like the Galaxy alpha and
redo TouchWiz from scratch and then we
will have a winner samsung flagship
because since the s2 we didn't saw
anything spectacular um I would disagree
with that uh sadly the Alpha hasn't
really succeeded and even though the
design is compelling we see it on the
note 4 and I don't know it just it's
hard to tell what Samsung needs to do
right now surely this new concept could
work but then again the Galaxy alpha
lineup would have taken off and it
hasn't so that's really why I'm
skeptical about that then halo shadow
snipe says galaxy s6 will be another FC
plus fake samsung phone sony for the win
somebody's trying to sell their mobile
division dude so i don't think that's
going to be the case jf eleazar 13 says
at least for me Sam Singh needs the
charm
the s3 had in 2012 and a different but
that crazy new form factor hmm I didn't
like the galaxy s3 to be honest with you
and I think that's a subjective topic
but true it could be that the company
just needs a new revamp again just like
we saw with the s3 good point the random
gaming says same thing has to come up
with an awesome design better than the
note fours which is gorgeous and ditch
TouchWiz you know for me the note 4 is
actually one of the better looking
Samsung phones ever I love the design so
I don't know how much can samsung
reinvent the wheel with the design here
think about it what exactly would you
like Samsung to reinvent here I feel
that their design is not really better
build quality was bad touch was was bad
i would keep the design in my opinion
and just ditch touch was and do
something completely different and
better but that's my opinion let us know
yours in the comments that's it for
parking out daily recap thank you very
much for watching a couple of times if
you want your comments to be featured
