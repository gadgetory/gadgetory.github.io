less than a year after a review of the
mate eight were in Munich to go hands-on
with its successor the mate nine Huawei
is delivering an ambitious follow-up to
last year's phablet i'll people familiar
with the may 8 p9 or the Nova's will
recognize this look we've got a 5.9 inch
1080p display cloaked in an aluminum
frame the signature rear mounted
fingerprint sensor returns we still have
a 3.5 millimeter headphone jack the
bottom firing speaker is joined by the
top earpiece to deliver stereo audio and
we get 64gb of storage with the ability
to add more via microSD we don't have
word yet on which regions will receive
dual SIM support what's new for this
mate is the second-generation dual
camera system
expanding on hallways relationship with
Leica a 12 megapixel color camera sensor
with optical image stabilization is
partnered with a 20 megapixel monochrome
sensor attention has been paid to
improving the depth perception for the
mates wide aperture mode giving you
pretty bouquet blur in the backgrounds
of your photos and the extra resolution
of the monochrome sensor should improve
the camera zoom happily we have our
second Huawei capable of shooting UHD
video the mate 9 will be using h.265
compression to keep file sizes smaller
and this image stabilization is
respectably smooth also a new quad
microphone array can automatically focus
the directionality of your audio
recording in camera or for the audio app
will of course have more to report on
the camera once we can tear into a real
camera review but early impressions are
very positive Huawei is looking to
improve performance all around for
hardware this phone is using the new
keren 960 octa-core chipset with and
improved GPU for better gaming
performance our prediction like previous
Kieran's it'll likely be one of the more
powerful multi-core performers available
the fingerprint sensor sees a refresh
offering better depth scanning for
better security and of course you can
still pull the notification shade from a
gesture Huawei will also be adding a
secure hardware element to the chipset
to give users a private locked folder
for sensitive info emui is back in its
fifth iteration and while in the past
this has not been one of our favorite
skins and
interior looking better users can easily
choose between a home screen only or
home screen and app drawer configuration
the top shade is no longer split between
shortcuts and notifications and overall
Huawei's menus have been simplified
we'll have to test Huawei's claims about
on device machine learning that the
maintain will learn about your behavior
over time to improve performance for the
apps you use the most this could be a
compelling addition to the Android
ecosystem
lastly the four thousand milliamp hour
battery gets a speed boost the
supercharge mode works in conjunction
with the technology in the supplied
charger to fully charge the whole phone
in around 90 minutes another feature
were very curious to test especially on
such a large battery it's a big phone
folks but doesn't feel as large as its
screen might indicate slotting in nicely
between the pixel XL and LG v 20 will
have a lot more to say about this beast
in the coming days as we put this
monster through its paces but it looks
like huawei is delivering an exciting
option to wrap up 2016 as always thanks
