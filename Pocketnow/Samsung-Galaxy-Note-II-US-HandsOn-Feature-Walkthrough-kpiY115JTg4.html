pocketnow.com here at the pop-up studio
powered by YouTube here in New York City
the samsung galaxy note 2 launch event
for the Americas I have a galaxy note 2
for tmobile on the table in front of me
right next to my samsung galaxy s3 don't
have an international version to compare
with right now but for now let's just
take a look at the size difference
between the galaxy note 2 and the galaxy
s3 as you can see the difference is very
familiar because we've covered this
device a lot it is identical because the
hardware is identical this is the same
galaxy note 2 you are familiar with with
very very very few differences in
operation almost no differences
physically except that this device is of
course powered the same X no squad
running at 1.6 gigahertz 2 gigs of RAM
backing that up as well not a whole lot
of difference is there the S Pen
functionality also very similar you can
see the hidden home page comes to view
there is we use the as we pull the
device out of its silo double tap while
holding the button brings up the S note
that clever functionality that I much
appreciated on the international version
as well quick actions has been changed
slightly you'll notice a slightly
revised user interface in the quick
command window and we'll just go ahead
and draw an exclamation point to get
into maps while the music outside picks
up it's a party here we wish you were
here joining us you can just jump into
maps that way we hop back out to the
home menu hop into quick command again
jump into maps again we can actually
you'll notice search for a specific
location with handwriting which is
really handy not necessarily quite as
fast as typing but certainly an
interesting novelty to play with you can
see it's pretty responsive they're
hopping to a different use case if we go
into the gallery application you can see
that we play a video here airplay is
here and it is as wonderful as ever that
little pop-up window allowing you to see
what is on the scrubber when
you without necessarily jumping to that
point in the video which is excellent
and then of course when you find the
spot you like just give it a tap and
there's the jump happens there also here
familiar to any watchers of our previous
videos is pop up play so let's the video
continue to play in the background as
you take care of other tasks with the
device nice handy feature there just
give it a little tap to get rid of it
and not quite as handy though as the
pop-up browser functionality go ahead
and hop into contacts here we couldn't
find a Twitter feed but this is very
useful in Twitter go ahead and find a
contact with that has a URL in the name
tap that you're asked for your
preferences as far as which browse you
want to use to open it up sit pop up
browser I'm going to go with always on
this one and clear that later the
browser loads the page in the background
while you go about your business wait
for the page load it may never load here
because there are literally hundreds of
people outside that door page loads or
read whatever article were interested in
and we can either jump to the full-size
browser or we can jump right out we're
going to do that right now finally even
though pop-up browser support is here
what is not here unfortunately on this
American version is multi screen support
pressing and holding the back button
does not give us access to the dual
screen multitasking a little unfortunate
kind of unclear at this point whether or
not we will get that in the future but
we will have to see going forward guys
that's going to wrap it up for us as you
can hear the music is getting louder
outside the party is getting Wilder so I
have business to attend to this has been
a very very brief tour the American
version of the samsung galaxy note 2
coming to every major US carrier almost
simultaneously once again the t-mobile
version it's also on sprint AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
it's a little bit more time to paint
their verizon logo on the button
presumably we don't know what the holdup
is there but it will come to all four
major US carriers in the coming weeks
keep it locked to pocketnow.com for news
and information on that follow us on
Twitter PocketNow tweets follow me on
