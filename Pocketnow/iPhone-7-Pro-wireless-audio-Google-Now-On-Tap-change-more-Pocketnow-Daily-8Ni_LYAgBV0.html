wireless audio on the iphone 7 pro have
been years in the making some of the new
Samsung pens show as an Apple watch
design and it actually has a purpose and
google has finally decided to take now
on tap more seriously I'm hi Mary vera
and I am seriously willing to take my
computer to edit this at the bar in the
corner happy Friday everyone this is
parking out daily
official news today begin with deals if
you want to still get an LG g5 which is
still one of my favorite phones if it
wasn't for that feel at the bottom of
the chassis I would highly suggest you
follow a link in description there is
this limited time offer on eBay $400
unlocked it doesn't get any better than
that other official news have to do with
Google I rarely use now on tap and has
everything to do with the fact that i
feel that Google now got crippled but
the feature is useful and for those of
you that don't really find google now
cards or now on tap cards for whatever
you're looking for the cool thing is
that now you're not going to get a blank
display of Google's not able to find
anything a new update will allow google
now cards to show up on now on tap what
took you so long as all the spotlight
over to Samsung this is interesting the
company has just filed a new patent for
a modular SmartWatch which is awesome
imagine being able to attach things to
your SmartWatch the funny thing is that
it's taken the internet by storm because
Samsung for some reason is using Apple
watch diagrams on that patent filing
that is gonna be rather interesting if
it goes any further whenever Apple
discovers this now speaking of Apple
this is even more interesting there are
some trusted analytics that confirm that
the company is not really doing well at
all at India surely the company sells
millions of millions of phones every
quarter but apparently the company
barely reached 800,000 units in India
reaching a very small fraction of the
percentage of the market where Android
reign supreme at ninety-seven percent
and then windows 10 mobile or Windows
Mobile for that matter owns most of the
rest of the chunk whether Apple plans to
do something about it is yet to be seen
but we do know that the company
considers India to be a big market they
just need to lower those price tag and
finally very hotness they have to do
with the iphone 7 pro in the fact that
the company has been working for years
in bringing high-quality audio through
bluetooth ear pods and obviously it's
second time probably the technology is
not there we do know that bluetooth
audio isn't better in any way compared
to Wired audio but then again we hear
that Apple is doing that become
is also working on bringing wired
headphone to the Lightning connector we
thought we'd get an adapter but they
show us that there is a pair of your
pots with the connector directly which
is rather interesting and it leads me to
the question of the day how picky are
you when it comes to audio do you only
listen with wires and audio DAC etc or D
just enjoy the convenience of Bluetooth
in my case it depends if I'm on the
subway which is extremely noisy i prefer
wired headphones because they sound
better but if not then i'll be fine with
bluetooth i just want to hear what I'm
playing it was a comment down below we
