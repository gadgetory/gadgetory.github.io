weekly hello and welcome to episode
double-oh-seven of the pocket not weekly
the once-a-week podcast from
pocketnow.com where we discussed news
and opinion from the world of mobile
technology smartphones tablets phablets
mobile devices of all sizes i'm your
host fisher michael fisher contributing
editor at pocket now and as always I'm
joined by our managing editor Nagy and
Tandy Nagy good afternoon to you sir
guys listeners greetings good to be here
and editor-in-chief minimun brandon
minimun how are you hi this was uh this
is also the first podcast to feature for
the first time all the way from Honduras
multimedia manager and awesome writer hi
may Rivera good morning to you you
didn't say it right at my old Rivera I
bits leave it like like like this is it
right mod yeah right exactly i'm never
gonna get the intra read yeah yeah but
the whole James Bond intro was the one
that was missing I mean it was i'm
actually the only got its name james
here translated again right that's
complete ya know that is entirely true
well that was uh that was an awesome
idea from tony we kind of wanted to
bring in the podcast with different
music this time but there's some
copyright issues surrounding the James
Bond music so anyway whatever I'm it's
great to have you it's great to be here
thanks for having absolutely this is the
first time this is I actually get to say
something here that I always want to say
in YouTube comments and listeners to the
podcast tend to be our kind of super fan
so they probably already know this but
we don't generally respond to youtube
comments you guys do actually Tony and I
made when you guys have time I think you
do only when when a particular more on
Willie steps on my nerves yeah and
YouTube as we all know is like the you
know the bottomless pit of despair on
the internet but yes but the anyway I
never have the time to comment but every
time I get a comment on one of my videos
word that Jaime has edited raised like
where somebody says like oh
editing dude or you know mad video
skills bra or whatever the thank you
listeners but the man behind the magic
and all that is hi May so for our fancy
videos the review videos and the longer
ones with all the Final Cut Pro effects
and stuff most of the time that time is
Magic at work so publicly I'm a on the
air thank you for making us all look
awesome ah thanks for that but again
it's it's a team work it's it wouldn't
be editing would be nothing if your
footage wouldn't be beautiful well it's
uh and I'm I'm as always happy to be
with the team here on the airway I'm but
before we get leap in here I want to ask
you a question there hi me if you're
alright with that when we had Joe Joe
Levi the android guy on a couple weeks
ago we asked him how he sort of became
this is the android guy and i want to
ask you your kind of a resident expert
on all things iOS so i wanted to ask how
that came about like if you could just
briefly tell us what what what it is
that you know made iOS here your
personal platform of choice well I
really didn't I really wasn't a fan of
the iphone and that actually took some
time um i still am not really that much
of a fan of the iphone to be honest with
you there are certain things that I
don't like about it and that's just
because I come from a Windows Mobile
background where I'm used to having
everything be instant compared to the
iphone where you have to refresh
everything everything every time you
multitask but I actually started with a
mac we we actually begun with this
project years ago with Brandon it was
actually almost two years ago um where
we came to this conference call once and
we were talking about our video quality
and and how much we really wanted to
boost our video quality and it was funny
because that was on a friday i think it
was or thursday and then that's saturday
i just went to a store and for some
reason out of the blue I just bought a
mac it just came to me that I like I
just I need expensive impulse purchase
insurance no I know but I just I went
completely crazy I was like okay why
don't we just do it and I just jet it
and the next monday i was like hey i'm a
mac i just bought one let's do the video
thing let's see what we can do and
that's how for those of you that have
watched in the past there are our first
pilot was the i review that we did
but it actually became more of like okay
sure i have a mac now so let's find
devices to use with it and let's just
take advantage of the whole ecosystem
and let's just say i was actually the
first one to move to a mac so that's how
i got an iphone but it was only after a
couple of months later really unique I'm
sorry we like the black sheep on the
team when this happened don't remind
everybody hated my guts for that but you
know actually it ended up being good
because the investment ended up paying
off for us I think everybody enjoys our
videos now it's a it's been a project in
progress everybody seen the evolution
with with in the months and then you
know it seems like the iPhone was like
the next best thing and integrated fine
with the computer and a lot of things
went well I was just really disappointed
with Microsoft bitching windows mobile
so this was my way of being back on
Microsoft I guess I see so it was more
of a like a retributive move than a and
an integrative move with your Mac
purchase exactly exactly that's funny
because I think I came out at the exact
opposite way where I got the iphone and
then i got a Mac I mean it kind of
brought me in that way but I understand
exactly because when I snapped up my
macbook that was when i started doing
all the stuff with video that i do
outside of pocket now no it's not
scandalous listeners but you know that's
other kind of stuff so yeah I completely
get where you're coming from thank you
that's uh that's awesome i'm glad that
we i'm glad that that happened hi maybe
cuz i don't think we would necessarily
have an iOS well well no that's not true
Tony you used that an iphone as your
daily driver as we've discussed yes and
i'ma can testify to this he he and my we
have discussed this at length he was
like come on Tony you have to try a Mac
you have to try an iphone what I don't
want an iphone and this conversation
went on for months and months until I
finally gave in and I'm happy that I did
so you were the reason okay I think I've
corrupted everybody asked Brendan yeah I
got one too did you how long was it
Brendan before you jailbroke your first
I device uh it was actually pretty
pretty quickly after I got it but you
and I quickly realized how ugly
jailbreaking
iOS devices can be theirs they I did a
whole series on a sort of what you can
do when you jailbreak your device which
is pretty much limitless but the problem
is that you quickly slow down your phone
and these these widgets or these these
enhancements that you download quickly
are unsupported and they they don't
evolve and there's no you know it
doesn't there's no like paradigm like
there's an Android where there's a rom
where everything can be bug fixed in one
package and everything's modular an iOS
jailbreaking or at least last time I
checked so it wasn't a pretty picture oh
you're right you're right and probably
the you know the good thing about
jailbreaking is it's so easy I mean
compared to rooting Android that Gil
Brielle's just a walk in the park yeah I
still I feel embarrassed at times to
have to be emailing Joe every time I
want to root a phone it's just it's
crazy and then compared to the iphone
it's just hit a button and that's it and
probably like brandon said it's great to
jailbreak but once you do what you can
do with the phone has really become
limited with the years in the past that
made sense there was no multitasking but
as you know as Apple has polished the UI
within the years it's just it for me
it's pointless to jailbreak anymore it
was at some point that's crazy because I
mean it seems to me that the ease of use
that iOS sort of stands on that that is
its foundation translates even to using
it in a manner not intended whereas the
Android kind of like on it's on it's in
its underpinnings is still a very very
they're both very complex platforms but
android does less to hide that when
you're when you're you know tweaking it
which is interesting yeah yeah i think
the last time that i did anything like
at a root level with android was when i
put android on the beer or something so
maybe i need to get back into that but
no comment of it I'm bringing the veer
to to Berlin to so Tony can actually
handle a web OS device you barely yeah
yeah yeah I want to take a picture of
you holding it Tony because I think
it'll look just even more microscopic
and you're in your palm you haven't
standed beside Tony Tony is huge
like a frickin shovel look like a
motorola pebble hey yeah he's good he's
going to accidentally crush it just by
holding it with his neck I know I know
then I'll have an excuse to get a white
one ah they don't make them anymore my
god has let me read the news what am I
one of my twitter friends was giving one
away the other day is like I gotta get
rid of this white beer I will trade it
for anything that's not a webos device
my calm and I got a ton of stuff I got a
busted galaxy nexus for it I was about
to say yeah all right before we leave
bend the topic list here do you uh
Brandon have you got to got something
for your editor-in-chief spot here I
want to do something potentially stupid
and it's great it's really weird so I
was watching Michael your unboxing of
the let me get this right yes sprint the
sprint motorola Photon Q 4G LTE nice
good work that's that's the entire name
it's six words Brad with a beggar what's
a rat Fox dog gonna make woodpecker what
other names they miss their yeah i mean
i think they add that's the abbreviated
name and I was thinking back to that
kind of gave me a um what's it brought
me back to the the epic 4g you know that
that one which had also equal equally
long names and i just started to think
about what the conversation was like
inside sprint when they were naming this
thing so i thought it would be kind of
fun if Michael you and I did a little
role-playing and again this might not
work out very well but I want to I want
to do this for like two minutes where
you are the CMO see chief mark marketing
officer of sprintin so you're sitting at
your desk can you call me into your
office I'm some sort of underling and
you're so like Brandon what should we
call this thing Mulder ola has this new
phone and we want to figure it out so
that's any of it I love it listeners
this is actually this is legit improv
because we this is not something that
was planned on the topic list so awesome
i love this okay cool yeah Brandon
banded great to see it brandon for
motorola nice to see you how you doing
brother hi I nerds i work for sprint i
talk like this i don't know why we gotta
we got it in this new phone uh yeah yeah
yeah go ahead I want to name it well
yeah go ahead good I think I think we're
gonna have to go with a long name of
this one cuz it's got a keyboard and the
device becomes very long when you slide
it out I think it should be called
something with the word professional and
yeah um yeah I like it already yeah i
like i like the letter Q I had a dream
last night the letter Q yeah we approach
a wonderful slab phone back in the day
was called a cute was wondering we gotta
bring that name in there yeah but but
also a this looks like like like a light
particles so we gotta we gotta we gotta
head that you know we gotta make this a
photon as well yeah we had the phone
time before so but we gotta make it
another photon yes that's good i was
thinking that too photo proton cute but
don't forget it this is a 4g phone so we
got to fit that in there son oh yeah now
you're ready you make a good point it's
not just a 4g phone so it says so but it
was it what is it why max phone there
would you would you bring it's an LC
it's an LT phone we have we talked to
your they went biased and we don't have
the network turned on yet that's right
all right it's expanding this year it's
alright alright people know i will put
it all together alright alright alright
so yeah let me go sprint you go then we
gotta have motor role in there for a
sprint motorola all right the light
particle thing yeah yes bring motorola
Photon and then the keyboard Park you
yes yes yes it's been troubled with
sprint motorola Photon Q and then a
high-speed part WiMAX 4G 4G alright 4g
member yep uh-hum come and then 2 4g
qualifier on the end god you're right
sprint motorola Photon Q 4G LTE wimax
where climax I actually have embarrassed
me neither have some laws special
effects I've actually got an echo on the
room so it'll sound great oh that's
that's terrific yeah that sounds like
there's a whole audience thank you thank
you very much Brendan there was a lot of
fun that was next and next week it's is
the epic 4g touch will break the podcast
when these guys reach the neutrons and
the electrons man that's right gonna be
really out
troll this thing is going to have a very
high valence when it reaches store
shelves seriously what compels them to
name something so incredibly stupid you
know I feel like it's this discussion
that that is like that is just these
guys trying to get as much of their own
respective brands represented you know
as they can because you need you've got
sprint pushing for 4G because it's a
buzzword but also they've got to fit LTE
in there because it's they got a
differentiated from wimax and motorola's
like okay yeah but I mean well did
motorola called the photon was there a
photon version not for sprint like the
original photon yes there was i believe
the no I believe the photon is a sprint
brand what was the spring phoniest do
you mean oh no I know it was a sprint
phone but like it did did they sell the
photon on other carriers or did they
call it the photon when they sold in on
other carriers that the frown oh no
they've been calling it boton on sprint
it's the drawer right on on verizon it's
the atrix on AT&amp;amp;T that's like the you
know yeah you know I know but I mean I
mean like these particular models like
the I've been wondering if the photon
that original motorola photon 4g was was
sold on other carriers and whatever I've
done kind of haven't started doing the
research on the review yet because I
just got the device for its but I don't
know we'll talk about it in the in the
full review but I was happy to see
despite this long product name that that
is always kind of a laughable thing I
was kind of happy to see the cube
branding brought back it seems like
Motorola more than any other
manufacturer is kind of immersed in this
nostalgic thing where like they've
brought back the razor you know they've
they've even brought back the razor
variant in the razr maxx which also was
a razor sub-brand back in the day and
now they're bringing the Q thing back
and I had a motorola q on sprint when
the original one was was around and I
loved it it's funny you mention that
because IIT Ramon remember the QI use it
as my daily driver for like two straight
years but I it never occurred to me
because they didn't put the cue before
the photon that this has to do with that
keyboard device of the past oh yeah you
said when you when you brought that up
in our little roleplay I was like
that's kind of clever I wonder if that's
actually you know the case and it
obviously is keyboard device rotation
they should have called it the motorola
q photon 4g LTE I think that's what I
tried to call it in my really sleepy
unboxing when I got all the words messed
up yeah I don't know I it makes me happy
because as I mentioned in a recent
editorial like I'm I can be a pretty
sentimental dude so I i like when brands
are kind of resurrected I don't know yet
if it's worthy if this device is worthy
of the Q brand because as many failures
as as that device had as many times as
it got product returns and like had to
be service and repair exchanged when I
was at sprint it was still such a
wonderful device that I kept it for
longer than any device up to that point
and it wasn't that wasn't surpassed
until my time with the preso yeah yes I
I don't know it's it's a long product
name it's a pretty cool device so far
I'll tell you I busted my butt to get it
because as I've said in the unboxing hi
man I ran after that FedEx truck like a
madman I mean I was shouting at the top
of my lungs like FedEx since so we're
doing the mission so we're doing the
James Bond thing today and yesterday you
were doing the mission impossible i
right yeah or do you same ol thing I
mean like you know a suit and I'm
gradually as I run like pieces of my
shooter coming off I'm like throwing off
my jacket and my side transformers yeah
yeah you're willing to do whatever it
takes and never Minds me when I was
talking to Michael on Friday or Thursday
of about some things and our first
attempt didn't work because he didn't
have reception where he was in Long
Island and so I wait like five minutes
I'm like I guess wife to reschedule call
and he calls me back and he's like
Brandon I'm driven a mile and a half i'm
sitting at the bottom of a cell phone
tower and i was like oh is there a tumor
growing in your head right now you know
he was willing to do any sunny it's yeah
and I wrote I wrote that editorial while
i was on Long Island about not having
coverage anywhere and stuff and it was
just really nice to have this to have
intimate knowledge of my hometown's cell
sites because there are so few of them
you can't help but notice them so yeah
anyway thank you for the thank you for
the role play
it was very nice to be terrified before
10am let's uh let's jump in because we
have I'm a on the air I want to change
up the order a little bit into iOS first
oh great yeah and that is because that
is also because you hear that Long
Island coming up because I the Apple is
now depending on how you do your math
and I want to bring this up in a second
but Apple is potentially now the most
valuable company in history which is a
fascinating thing to say I want to talk
about the details in a second but what
what this is madness right I made you
wrote this piece can you just give us
just a 10,000 foot view on this it's a
thousand foot view wait wait before
before before honey does that I that the
finance major here should should really
quickly specify what that means most
valuable company in the world yeah yeah
oh please Brenda um that that means that
their market capitalization which is the
number of outstanding shares time the
share price is the highest that that any
other companies ever been which which
means that investors think that if
another firm were to buy Apple they
would need to pay around the market
capitalization price which is right now
about six hundred and thirty billion
dollars so that's what that's what it
means when when when when it is said
that Apple is the most valuable company
up any we can suggest somebody translate
that to plain English really that's
pretty good numbers i did with words i'm
i'm i'm journey applause so Tony if you
if you wanted to buy apple today you
would have to find six hundred and
thirty billion dollars oh that's not a
problem no I got as do i want to buy
apple or not all right you felt probably
the most amazing thing about this is the
fact that well think about it's a
technology company I mean in the past
the the highest market market cap
company was ExxonMobil but currently
it's at four hundred and six billion
it's actually a difference of almost
what 20 30 billion between one company
on the other and if you think of it
Microsoft was the company that had that
title almost what 12 13 years ago at six
hundred and eighteen billion back then
and it's just interesting just to give
me an idea the difference between
Microsoft back then and now is
Microsoft's current marketing Kappas 258
billion compared to apples let me see
here 629 so just think about I mean if
Microsoft would have kept their cool for
the last decade that they've lost in my
opinion they would currently be at eight
hundred and something billion dollars
you're using the inflation and
everything and it's just it's just to
imagine I mean Apple was worth seven
dollars ten years ago seven dollars
seven bucks a share that's yes yeah and
they are currently worth 671 bucks a
share that's that's amazing and as think
about it I mean just think about how
many products are being launched by
Apple in comparisons and Microsoft the
amount of risk involved in the products
that Apple brings to the market you know
hardware and everything investment it's
so broader than compared to Microsoft
where all they do a software and there's
really not much to lose its only
brainstorming happening there so it's I
think it's really amazing how a company
can come from complete dirt it's a
complete success out of just a couple of
products being well focused I think it's
amazing it's kind of inspirational
because you know at what Apple is as at
it scores ideas and so that that is is a
nice feeling because if you've got a
good ideas and of course if you're
willing to execute an able to execute
you can create a great company indeed
and just think about it I mean it's a
company that started in a garage I mean
how would you feel if you thought that
the project that you're doing right now
would be worth 600 billion dollars in
the future just think about he did
invent the time machine yeah well you
know it actually it's really interesting
to see the flip side of this too because
another company started in a garage in
almost the same neighborhood I think and
it was HP and right you know which was
kind of on top of its game for a very
long time and now is you know not at all
and as it doesn't the prospects don't
really look good for for the future so
it's it's fascinating to see to kind of
divergent examples of that good starting
from a garage you know place and the ups
and downs and I think Apple needs to
probably you know not at this point
obviously is no danger right now the
that is terribly evident but they really
cannot afford to rest on the
laurels which I think they've maybe been
doing on the software side a little bit
but that's maybe not an opinion you
share justjust again a girl go ahead go
ahead just just to give you an idea HP
is now worth forty billion dollars
compared to apple it's it's like amazing
and this is just to give you an idea i
mean i think that the probably one of
the most important things about apple is
there counterculture there it's funny
because they're turning into big brother
but then being really smart about it
because after you know microsoft has
become just this big blob white elephant
and they look like a government they're
so slow in acting and they're always
with this wait and see mentality that's
just made them so slow and sluggish that
they haven't been able to innovate and
it's like it they don't really know what
they're doing but everything they do
that's good they'll just copy and that's
not the Microsoft that I remember from
10 years ago sadly and well I don't know
is that true relating to their I don't
think that's true relating to Windows
Phone I think Metro is you know the
freshest thing I've seen on the market a
long time you know it well just to give
you an idea i mean i think they had a
good product windows mobile and out of
the blue they saw that apple was being
successful with something else and what
they did was revamp windows phone into
becoming a closed ecosystem just like
iOS I mean windows mobile was like the
counter product it was like the device
you could do everything with which is
currently Android sadly and I say sadly
because andrew is a great product but it
you know it's windows mobile was just
special it was different it wasn't
perfect at all it was really sluggish in
many points but if any of you remember
pocket pc 2000-2002 or Windows Mobile
2003 it was just so good it was so fast
it was so unique saturday was stuck in
RAM so it didn't have persistent storage
it had to evolve to become a smartphone
but it was great at its time and I just
miss those days really I do I I
understand completely whether what it
feels like to miss some some some old
times I I've carried you know windows
mobile devices back in the day and it
was it was cool it was just uh I think
that Microsoft needed to evolve too I
think it I don't know if it needed to
adopt a closed ecosystem approach that
that Apple did but I certainly think
that it could not have you know a
Windows Mobile had reached its point
of its innovation limit right I don't
think they could have gone any further
with Windows Mobile to you that I think
I think that they made a couple of tough
choices to bring persistent storage they
slowed out the operating system just too
much they could have gone further if
they if they were a little smarter but
again I go back to the topic I feel that
you know apples doing something really
smart they're behaving like a start-up
and this is what big companies are not
doing I mean if they're there was this
book that I that I found from the steve
jobs biography that's called the
innovators dilemma and it's the fact
that these companies there there are so
many good examples of companies that are
extremely successful they hire the best
talent but they become so bureaucratic
that they don't innovate Lindy and they
think they can repeat what they did in
the past against to become successful
exactly exactly you see with Motorola
that's pretty much to come to Google and
it's just happening so much companies
that they're focused on being these
corporate giants where CEOs or business
administrators and they're not really
technology geeks they don't really
understand their products it's just out
there to make money and to make
investors happy and that's really the
mistake that other companies have made
mm-hmm and when then you have the
opposite situation at like rim where the
the guy one of the two co-ceos was like
the guy who designed the product it was
so married to it that that he kind of
couldn't couldn't see the forest for the
trees when it started aging you know in
elegantly so you're making a good point
there yes yeah there's there's a as with
most things the real road to success and
truth lies in the gray area but that's
for this for philosophy I I do want to
make a point though that I think it was
it actually it was it was TechCrunch
that posted an article yesterday where
it was like pointing out that you know
none of these none of these stories
about Apple being the largest company in
the world it take it take into account
inflation and I mean you did make
mention of this in your post yeah yeah
Microsoft would be worth eight hundred
and something billion dollars right now
they would have been smart about right
and I when TechCrunch was pointing out
that at the historic winner the for for
the for the highest values in 1967 would
have been IBM
which translates to 1.3 trillion dollars
in today's dollars so that's that's
something it feel like that's you know
none of that diminishes the significance
of apples accomplishment here but I did
want to throw it in there because it's
it's easy to forget about IBM and its
role as you know in creating our current
computing culture and landscape so I
just wanted to throw it out there give
them some love too big blue add before
we am successful then you remember that
song yeah that's uh let's keep going on
the apple thing here the there's your
Tony what did you say just now you are
you are attorney at law Anton Dina I'm
I'm actually not attorney i just
finished law school yes that's right
that was I like to do my part but I
still liked it though it's nice please
tell us what's happening here Sam's this
Tony posted a legal roundup just today
with an apple samsung settlement talk
falling through motorola filing for an
iphone ban in the united states Tony it
hit us with with the some knowledge here
what's happening well the judge lucy koh
if i say this right ahead i think it was
back in mate another try out the apple
and samsung were ordered for a
settlement talk on may 21 22 and just as
this settlement talk that one failed and
i think at this point neither apple nor
samsung wants to settle because hina
will understand this and so will some
other listeners it's all about the
cojones you know if anyone of apple or
Samsung give up they will be losing in
mvi of the of the market of their users
and so on so neither of one wants to
settle samsung as well as Apple they
want to win this because they need to
they need a win to to put out there on
their front page or on the front page of
every newspaper that they are better and
that they have won this lawsuit
regardless of who wins acai juice all I
still remember when when Brandon embarks
the galaxy s2 and he's like man this
so much like an iPhone did I just I find
it funny i need i was a big fan of the
motorola blackjack at motorola samsung
black the black do you remember that
there was an excellent misspeak there i
like the original black jack better than
the left do they messed that up they
made it all shiny and sticky and i like
a motorola q better than all of them cuz
it was the same phone just to happen
first but you want a better keyboard but
but the point is i mean think about how
much samsung's design changed after the
iphone i mean i i i feel i'm not saying
that samson design is not really cool i
do i love it i if there is one thing
that i enjoy and this has to do with
your Galaxy Nexus um after the buzz is
how great the Galaxy Nexus feels in hand
oh yeah III there's this thing about
jumbo phones lately that's just my God
my pinky finger is just going crazy
trying to hold the phone and trying to
type on it and I've got big hands and I
mean there there's just things this
thing about Samsung designed that I
really enjoy but the problem is you
can't avoid the fact that the icons just
frickin look like an iPhone whether you
like it or not that Android was moving
vertically for their app tray and then
Samsung just went horizontally like the
iPhone there's just so many things going
on there then you know it doesn't really
matter who wins i feel that the point
being is we as users have been really
benefited by this whether Apple wins or
Samsung wins it doesn't really matter
technology has evolved into better
products I mean if we if we compared
Samsung products before the iphone and
after there's a big big difference and
you know probably the only thing that
upsets me about what's going on is if
everybody remembers when Google was
buying motorola mobility their first
order of business was we're not going to
be using motorola for their patents
we're not going to be using motorola for
their patents and then everybody was mad
because google wasn't doing anything
with this whole samson trial and now we
do see that google is doing something
they're using motorola with their pens
they've been the cell phone it really
think they've been to the cell phone so
hey daddy they're using their
now sure back back at Apple that's
what's happening now and that's good you
know and I feel like it was a good
strategic move for them I I think they
were I think it's true that they're not
they didn't buy motorola just for the
patents you know because obviously
they're planning some some hardware
stuff and we'll get to that in a
listener mail is be a component but I
want to just I don't want to let Samsung
go without kind of saying that yeah they
do there they are a strange paradox in
this kind of legally exploitable way
where Samsung does copy a lot of design
I think I think they copy a lot of
hardware design and I don't think that's
an accident and I think that's closely
related to a cultural thing but samsung
also comes in and they like release a
product like the galaxy s3 where they'll
just have 25 new innovations that no
one's ever thought of before and sure
maybe 19 of them are just like this is
ridiculous i'll never use it but it's
kind of creepy in a futuristic way but
you know like samsung is full of
innovation and i think that they
wouldn't be embroiled in this mess if if
they weren't so bold about some of their
just more blatant rip offs and let's be
honest about this like the black I'm
sorry we just talked about the blackjack
like a black track and it ripped off the
queue it did like you know whatever just
drop some hate comments it's fine it's
true it's true it's true but hey what's
the biggest copy cat in the world Apple
I mean they didn't have an operating
building was come on man the Mac
operating system came from Xerox PARC
sure I'm sure they did surely they
invented the design of the original
laptop true that's fine they invented
the Newton true that's fine but a lot of
things like they didn't invent the
tablet computer it was a full bill gates
concept concept firfer for Microsoft so
they haven't invented a lot of the stuff
that they're doing didn't invent the
smartphone they didn't invent the
touchscreen only device they didn't
invent finger interaction he either
didn't invent capacitive touch either
they've been doing a lot of copying
themselves they've just been really
smart about pending everything that they
do and as some commenters pointed out
they also I was not crazy they did not
invent multi-touch no yeah so no you
obviously
the kind of cliched thing to say about
Apple is like which is true is like they
don't do stuff first they do it better
and that tends to be the truth but the
you know I think the issue that I have
sometimes is that then other companies
will come in behind them land this the
way the market works it's like oh okay
well apples making a lot of noise we're
going to make exactly the same noise but
you know whatever it's yeah that so this
is all the stuff factors into how why
we're kind of embroiled in this in the
legalese stuff and we'll continue
reporting on that but while we have I'm
I still in the hook i still want to ask
you about and everyone about a
widescreen iphone imma had a cool
editorial presa i've been getting a lot
of hate not because i bet you have man
well you know it's great because you
introduced this idea that's not very
popular I think none of I think people
have forgotten how the iphone 4s was
born let me just let me set it up for
the headline is listeners if you haven't
read it why a white screen iphone
doesn't make sense so hit a diamond okay
the problem is people don't remember
this time of year of last year
everything was filled with the iphone 5
the iphone 5s coming it's going to be
teardrop and it's going to be all curved
in the back and it's going to look like
this ipod touch with a cellular radio
and boom we've got the iphone for us I
think that Apple learned a lot from the
gizmodo debacles they ended up figuring
out a way to throw prototypes on the
road to make people just go crazy
thinking that's the next iPhone and what
we're gonna be getting is the iphone 4g
LTE probably or something like that i'm
not saying that's going to be the case i
just find it very unlikely that apple
will adopt the 16 by 9 aspect ratio and
the reason being is first of all 16 by 9
is complicated a lot of people and I've
seen use the iphone ad with the keyboard
in landscape mode a lot of people just
want a big keyboard and the problem is
when you do the 16 by 9 thing and if
you've done this an Android you'll
notice that the keyboard covers
everything there's no content there's no
Rupert hunting at the top and apples all
about the content that's the thing they
first of all that's one thing the second
thing is have any of you guys ever
right to watch a 4 by 3 movie on a 16 by
9 screen no you it should be the reverse
right and contents in 16 by 9 and when
you have 4 by 3 you get black why are
you talking about like old school TV
like standard definition stuff well yeah
a lot of people you know there's this
dish this case in marketing where you
focus on you focus products on the
people that are able to buy them and
currently the buying capital for the
iPhone or people that watch movies in
the 80s and 90s and we are so the
problem is that a lot of these movies
and series are stuck at four by three
aspect ratio you can't fix that that's
the way they were filmed and while we
are the people that are still able to
buy the product the most with bus that
are in our 20s and 30s the problem is
that we will still be getting products
that fit these case scenarios so I think
that's why 4 by 3 is not going to be
abandoned that easily if not they would
have done it with the iPad just think
about it the ipad is like the perfect
device to consume movies so why would
you make it four by three if it wasn't
because it's still in point to embrace
these people and you know it's easy for
you to watch a 16 by 9 movie on a four
by three screen all you do is get black
bars at the top and bottom but when you
try to do that backwards the black bars
on the left and right are just so big
that it becomes cumbersome I just don't
think they're gonna do it so you think
they're just gonna go I did that they're
just going to blow the screen up in in
in all dimensions and keep it at four by
three quarters my wishful thinking is
that they'll figure out a way to get rid
of as much as they can from the front of
the panel and make the screen larger
within the same size of the phone I feel
that they want to make one handed
usability fetter other than they don't
want to lose that paradigm and I just
don't see a long screen the iphone I
don't know I just don't and if they do
it i'm not saying that they won't i'm
not saying that i wish i was wrong and
Brandon knows the way I am I would I say
things that doesn't mean that I wish I
was wrong I mean a longer screen article
i do want one but it's very good it's
just so anti apple Apple's been really
good at doing the complete
opposite of what everybody else is doing
they move the way away from the floppy
disk when the CD didn't even allow you
to burn anything on the imac they've
done a couple of times but I've never
seen them do something Oh party foul
absa scalar right against themselves so
I don't see that happen who knows that's
just my two cents okay what's it Brandon
Tony you guys got I've got something to
contribute there cuz I I'm at a loss for
this kind of screen talk well first of
all I I look at a lot of content and um
I think it's crazy to think sorry Jaime
that that people care about four by
three aspect ratio content I mean maybe
if you're watching The Wonder Years on
Netflix which was filmed in the 80s and
I definitely do all the time yes go
ahead right um there there's just it's
just there's there's just not much cut I
mean maybe like one percent two percent
of the content out there is four by
three I think you're sixteen by nine is
a tremendous challenge because of the UI
and as a high main points out when you
use a landscape keyboard it just looks
bad even if you have like a huge screen
that's super high resolution it doesn't
matter because it's the same ass but
it's a bets about aspect ratio I mean
you can't make a keyboard that has these
keys that are like one millimeter high
or two millimeters hi um but um I I
don't know I I sort of agree with Jaime
that he that apple will figure out a way
to keep the four by three because then
if they do 16 by nine they're gonna do
the ipad and 16 by 9 and imagine a shape
of a 16 by 9 10 inch iPad it's gonna be
like a bit afraid it's gonna be like a
surfboard essentially like a motorola
xoom though it's gonna look like a
galaxy tab 10.1 so I don't think apples
gonna go that maybe we've without the
the front facing speakers that make the
the new 10.1 and and the tenth the note
10.1 so awesome I don't know yeah it's I
guess I guess we'll have to see on this
i would like to kind of dwell more on
this topic but we do kind of have to
move on we ready to talked about the for
the photon on box and there's a review
coming up on
uh the while we're talking about Samsung
the the galaxy s3 mini is rumored to to
join the galaxy s2 plus in this kind of
like strange Samsung mid-range offering
while we're talking about sizes i feel
this is kind of a good segue because
what is going on here Tony you haven't
spoken in a while and I think you wrote
this article so like is this Samsung
kind of getting into mid-range sizing to
flush out its galaxy offering or what
yeah Samsung has a lot of phones samsung
at any point has a truckload of phones
on the market and this is usually the
reasoning I go with when I compare Apple
toward Samsung people say that Samsung
is selling more phones than Apple of
course Samsung has 55 phones on the
market Apple has two or three but that
aside as I said in the article there is
the iphone 5 which is coming up with a
new iPhone or the iphone iphone 4gs
regardless of the name in
september-october now the next flagship
Samsung is not coming until next March
April or May so Samsung needs to build
up the hype and come up with something
but the galaxy s2 plus was also rumored
before mwc in Barcelona and we expected
to see that because we had a Galaxy S
Plus so I'm more inclined to believe
that there might be a yell xes 2 plus
but there might not be an s3 mini I mean
just think about it why why take
something which is the flagship phone
and put it in a smaller shell and maybe
strip off some of its raw specifications
and still keep the brand which is
keeping in motion the phone anyway I
don't think so if you do that this is
interesting if you do that to the galaxy
s3 if you make it smaller well let's
talk about this real quick what makes
the galaxy s3 Samsung's flagship what is
it about it that makes it so high end I
mean it's got the biggest display the
side of the note okay it's got its it's
got a big display which a mini can't
have what else I would still the fastest
smartphone pretty much in the world I
think okay it's it's fast which I guess
the mini could have if it was a little
bit thick to accommodate the you know
quad-core exynos
what else it's got some software stuff
like s voice which really isn't that
interesting it's got TouchWiz which
really isn't that interesting so in all
this it the only reason Samsung would
make a mini galaxy s3 is to take that
brand that now has lots of recognition
and put it on an additional device and
hopefully you know increase sales I mean
it's it's not like a typical scenario
where you have a phone that has certain
key characteristics and they make a mini
version of it because they're taking all
of those characteristics and just
putting it into a different form factor
it wouldn't be like that with a galaxy
s3 well that's the thing I mean probably
over there in the United States you
don't see that that much but over here
in third world countries it's common for
you to see the the cheap iterations of
whatever good product is out there so
for example here is like the galaxy ace
and I'm like what's ace about that thing
that thing is like the galaxy dud it's
like terrible in the galaxy BS that's
why they give a stupid name like the
east yeah well ace is not really bad if
you think about combat white stuff but
the point is the point is I mean um i
would really and this is my particular
dream i would really want another 4 inch
phone 4.3 four-inch bone with all the
galaxy s3 specifications yeah I wish
that we had a varian like that and I was
expecting that from the HTC One X that's
not the X and it turned out to have a
small a less resolution screen um and it
just wasn't a great phone I mean it was
a beautiful phone but it wasn't a great
film and I just wish that somebody would
do that I mean not everybody wants a
jumbo okay I've said this in like
editorial editorial where I'm like did
that why do we have to tie high-end
performance exclusively to oversized
devices it's so funny you guys are
talking about this the other day I was
the best buy and I saw the Xperia ion
which is it's got a pistol large screen
four point six inch but the bet it had
awesome hardware and this is the first
time this year I felt Sony's 2012
hardware and then I thought back to the
Xperia S which is among maybe two or
three devices ever that have the
four-point support 4.3 inch screen size
with the 720p
Lucien and as high menos that makes for
a ppi higher than any other device on
the market about 343 pbi yeah and
there's just not yeah the screens
insanely gorgeous and there's just not
many phones but it's like when you get
to 4.3 inch or four inch you know you
got to have a low res crappy screen and
it's ridiculous they should they should
bring it down to the smaller devices
yeah you know in the total irony about
that phone that I wrote in my review is
it's got the most beautiful screen i've
ever seen i mean i think the camera on
that phone wasn't as good as the fact
that the display was so great at
portraying photographs that the time you
really really thought that the camera
was great but it was really just the
display booths because you know boosting
it i hate that that happens all the time
to me it happens all the time but you
know the problem is you have this really
gorgeous screen and then they made the
housing insanely big and I'm like you've
got why did you make this phone so big
you've kept you could have made a much
smaller phone with this beautiful screen
and it would have been great and they
just didn't do it I don't understand
some people at some times but anyway
they've got these marketing numbers I
don't know who's feeding them up because
you know you've got these jumbo phones
and surely they doin tell to us the male
population but then you go to a lot of
place in the United States and they're
just filled with iPhones so even if
these people think that people want
jumbo phones that you know the the most
the largest portion of the market just
wants an iphone that's the problem mmm
wow that's sobering second it's like a
sad observation for some reason it is
but just think about it I mean how many
Android phones do you really see in the
hands of people on the street well
compared to compared to iPhones I don't
you get into that kind of observation
that you're like well then where are you
you get into anecdotal territory and you
can kind of you know refute or reinforce
wherever you want right that's a good
point in fact you know we I think we
talked about so the pod we have how we
like never see these phones I was at a
concert three weeks ago and I meant to
talk about this but I turned to the
right and there's a galaxy s3 I turned
to the left there's a Galaxy Nexus the
guy that I came with to the concert with
which I never met was a friend of a
friend had an HTC One X it was like the
just thing I've ever seen it's like
everyone here has a has the latest and
greatest Android phones and yet if I go
out into the regular fight if I go out
to the into the public that there's none
of that it's like all iphones yeah and
it depends on where it because I do a
lot of traveling and I between Boston
New York and Long Island so I'll see
different phones depending on where i am
and it's even more interesting to go out
into the boonies where smartphones do
not offer a great experience so they're
not very popular you do some you have
some real cool opportunities to do some
fun double takes at what people are
carrying because you know they're it's
like wow that's a dumb phone then and
it's not like a dumb phone from 2007
it's not like they've been lazy and
upgrading like you just bought a new
dumb phone you know because I could you
know it's because that's what suits your
needs you know and so it's it's it's
just crazy I love people watching and
did we talk about this on the podcast
that that commercial that was out I
don't know if it was a best buy
commercial a couple of years ago were
the guys out to dinner with his
girlfriend and he keeps looking like and
she thinks he's checking out other
chicks but he's checking out other
people's phones and she like hits him on
the head with a water pitcher or
somebody then walks away and I thought I
thought I was the only guy that did no
yeah we I think we all do it right and
you and your date or whoever is like
you're like no no it's okay i'm just
checking out phones it's kind of that
it's kind of that way with cars like I'm
out with my wife and I'm like oh my gosh
that person like this is right after the
galaxy s3 lunch and and I'm like oh my
gosh the person's galaxy s3 g do you
know what that means just the same way
we're walking down the street I'm like
oh my gosh it's a Lamborghini Murcielago
you know what that is yeah yeah shut up
the worst for me is when you see
somebody else with with the phone that
you just bought like you just went to on
launch day and you're like I'm the first
person's gonna have this phone and I'm
the only one who's got it this is great
it's like nine in the morning and like
two hours later it's like somebody else
with that brand new phone is walking
around like no it's depressing no and
it's it's changed a lot because back in
the day likes you know four years ago
I'd have you know the AT&amp;amp;T took two well
and no one had a smartphone and I could
impress the hell out of people if I said
look this thing can tell me where I am
on a map and they would be like war and
and now I literally cannot impress any
any
with any phone that I have because they
all are pretty much the same they all do
the same thing yeah I'm no longer cool
around here no yeah the new the new
impressing people game has turned to
what apps you have and what your what
your app can do and then they can go buy
one yeah now what now we have to say is
look at how big my phone exactly and
speaking of which that the whole world
is about to see the optimist view LG is
bringing the optimist view to everyone
except America in September um who's
excited about that Tony Tony I think it
was the one they used it at nwc s know
that there was this house beside Tony
that was just making Tony's life
unbearable really yeah donate what was
the deal Tony well every time I started
to record and to say something about the
phone he started showing off the specs
on the huge loud speaker and amplifier
and I had to do double triple quadruple
take takes and stuff like that I'm no
longer excited about the LG optimus for
you and I'm no longer excited about LG
and these are both statements i'm no
longer excited about any company in this
world on this planet who announces a
phone in February and makes it available
in September no no I'm never gonna buy
that you don't like Microsoft anymore no
I'm an apple guy now Tony Tony's made a
valid point I mean first of all talk
about that Optimus view I just feel like
if I'm gonna get hurt with that thing I
mean it's got the sharpness corners in
the world it's like damn you should have
just replicated a piece of paper and
just drew a bone in and it just
published it as a phone but you know
speaking of such I mean think about it
how much how much do you lose by taking
so much time to release a phone you can
ask Microsoft that question because
they'll definitely have an answer I mean
they announce things in January they
publish them in the fall it's just
terrible mm-hmm it's just terrible in
this day and age that's just a way to
give competitors what to do when
patented before you do particularly when
it's not a product that people are just
really holding their breath for it's
like I saw the view come out I'm like oh
all right cool this is a this family to
me think about phablets and so let me
write a piece about fab
no compared to the Galaxy Note and even
back then I was like well at least I
mean the notes a monster but at least
you can hold it like that you and Tony
you can you know just prove me on this
or no excuse me I think we you and I
agree like the view is very
uncomfortable to hold because it looks
very comfortable yeah yeah so it's like
it's going back to a role playing
Michael I think the marketing head at LG
was like all right take the galaxy note
and make it impossible to hold with one
hand and we got a winner we gotta
sharpen up those corners if I can't feel
this thing brushing up against my palm
yeah I don't want that part of but if
I'm not gonna get a blister it just
won't make sense it won't sell let's
just make it different let's make it
edgy mr. hahaha dang they said that they
said let's make it edgy and someone took
it literally right exactly um well
alright well we'll see I mean it's never
coming to America it's like the peer
review it I which is available in
America but whatever nobody's going to
adopt the view here if if somebody does
I feel like AT&amp;amp;T will in the States if
LG ever released it here I don't think
it's going to move and they'll probably
do a view to and it'll probably go down
the same road I would like to see LG do
something impressive again nope LG's
been losing a lot of money lately my
phone department and you know just funny
because they build the IPS display for
the ipad um all you know all my
televisions at home or LG it's just
they've got this really good technology
for plasmas and LEDs um and they could
make something really good if they just
met they ain't no the guys from the
smartphone department met the guys at
the you know at the screen department no
just such an iron it's crazy when when
companies do that yeah there are
different branches of companies that
perform very differently like Motorola
has a motorola mobility but all their
identifiers built by motorola solutions
and if they could not have been more
different but LG used to be back in the
day in the day of you know feature
phones i mean LG had some really
innovative stuff going on him and they
were responsible for you know that what
the chocolate series was big on verizon
there what am i missing there's the they
were really really oh that they built
the voyager right like the dumb phone
answer to the iphone on verizon they
build the product that's all I I think
prada was the first capacitive
touchscreen display I think it was
that's it the original Prada was the
first capacitive touchscreen display i
think it was i think it was yeah yeah
i'll do some research but I'm yeah
finally LG has done a lot of innovation
when it comes to displays um it's
incredible I don't think even people
people remember that LG was actually
called gold star like 20 years ago lucky
gold star yeah exactly but you know
they've done some really good stuff they
just haven't figured out smart phones
and you know it has nothing to do with
the design design is actually good their
software is just terrible I mean we were
doing the the Optimus 4x video and the
guy was just showing off the four cores
and he's like look at this and look at
this and crash oops and then fragile I'm
like yeah this is it forex crashes what
this thing should be called it's just
the way it is and and it's funny how how
can you release a product that you don't
really test that's terrible yeah yeah it
is it they make they make good washer
and dryers though I gotta handsome you
look really funny yes they look like a
boom box um what I want to I want to get
off phones real quick before we happen
to Windows Phone we don't have the
occasion to talk about non non phone
android devices very often but Samsung
is releasing another galaxy player which
listeners if you're not familiar is kind
of their answer to the ipod touch
brandon wrote this news post i wrote an
editorial about front firing speakers
that references this thing so it looks
like a galaxy s3 with speakers with
speakers on the front it would like
vertically oriented dual speakers and i
actually i think it kind of looks cooler
than the galaxy s3 from the front ends
in some ways maybe maybe i'm weird yeah
well you die alright so we're both weird
we're weird together uh what what what's
this does anybody buy these things
anymore even Apple is pricing the ipod
touch at ridiculous price points
relative to a subsidized iphone so it's
like what i don't understand who's
buying these this is this is perfect in
a situation where you got like a
eight-year-old kid saying daddy daddy
get me the galaxy s3 get me the iphone
and he's like shut up to take this on
phone no take tick this thing it doesn't
have a phone and it's one of the word
the damn data plan and I think it I
think it makes sense in a lot of
situations it's kind of training wheels
for you know when kids are old enough
where the parents are I guess rich
enough to pay for a smartphone what's
good for all the kids they have to be
rich enough to pay for the the device i
mean you're saying like the galaxy
player and its ilk are like training
wheels smartphones for rich people's
kids something very interesting is
happening now and just think about it I
mean an eight gigabyte ipod touch cuz
costs the same as an a gigabyte Nexus 7
I think I think these products are gonna
I don't I don't think that you know mp3
players are going away I just feel that
there will be a point where phablets
will just end up becoming the next mp3
players and I not mp3 players but
they're trying to build these dedicated
game players for kids to use and I think
that these are really going to be the
substitutes for game consoles in the
future I think that that's wicked that's
what's gonna end up happened and I keep
calling Gianni rejecting my class was
wondering what the hell is the Brandon
is the only person I know that can love
smartphones but you use landlines more
more than a smart phones to make phone
calls I was I thought that was I VII was
confused as to what that sound was and
it took me a while to realize that it
was a landline it was a copper base to
communications doesn't mean let me
explain for a sec uh back in the day I
saw the vonage commercial and I'm like
this is a good idea turns out vonage has
a very very good voice quality and I
don't know about you guys but I kind of
get tired of the holding cell phone to
my face thing and sometimes I just want
a landline and sometimes I leave it in
the same room but I'm podcasting in and
sometimes it rings two times while I'm
doing it I'll be honest I'll be honest
with you I don't know the phone number
of my landline I don't know it yeah I
haven't owned I've never had a landline
of my own the last landline phone i
encountered on a regular basis was at my
parents house in 2001 in a rotary yes i
was had a hand crank and you had to talk
to Jenny to connect you um I love Jenni
she's nice and juilin good but but again
going back to the to the topic of what's
happen with these mp3 players you know i
think that the concept is not having an
mp3 player they're trying to create this
product that competes with game consoles
and it also allows you to do email
social networking whenever you're on
Wi-Fi and stuff but at some point it's
going to end up by they're converging
into a phablet or turn or it's gonna go
away and move into the 7-inch tablet
form factor or something's gonna happen
but it's really it's really gonna make
game consoles the portable game consoles
obsolete that's probably what I like the
best about my nexus 7 I've got my my
iPad filled with games and to be honest
with you I never play them because the
thing is just so big ya don't mean to do
that with the Nexus 7 it just makes
sense and well you know I have my sons
ipod touch with me right now and playing
a game with an ipod touch is just too
small so we can find like a sweet spot
in the middle you can end up with a
really good game console and as
quad-core processors are evolving with
the Tegra 3 and with everything that's
coming I think it's gonna make sense in
the future it's not gonna be really an
mp3 player but it could also do mp3 you
know just that I feel like the gaming is
probably the only salvation for this
particular device i do think mp3 players
are going away completely I don't think
there will be a category left for those
once every dumb phone becomes a
smartphone which is sort of inevitable
in my opinion I don't know I i think the
ipod touch and its and its ilk are kind
of going to disappear and gaming and but
not even Wi-Fi access is gonna is going
to say that because when everyone has a
smartphone nobody's gonna need a like a
phablet unless it is a smartphone like a
phablet with just Wi-Fi good and we
gotta move on but I totally disagree i
mean the cost of ownership for this
thing is gonna be like 200 bucks
lifetime the cost for a similar device
with it was cellular data is hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds and thousands
of dollars over a lifetime and this
provides every possible use case
experience to someone who doesn't want
to incur that thousands of dollars
lifetime costs just without the
convenience of being able to do it
anywhere and it's a perfect device for
so many different kinds of people i use
the example of kids which i think is is
good and it helps to develop brand
loyalty for samsung um but it's also
good for you know that the college kid
you know who still doesn't want to be
able to still someone have to pay for a
data plan
again and I pray and and wants to be
able to use you know email on a mobile
device and all of the apps and then
communication tools and the internet
while he's sitting in you know bed or
whatever's okay it should I I get that
completely and I think in today's world
you're completely right I don't think
that that is the way the world is going
to continue to be though I think
smartphones will be will become for most
people as essential as cell phones are
today as mobile devices are today in
general I think you know I think that
that kind of monthly cost for data plans
is just going to become one of those
things like 10 years ago you know you
buy a cell phone and people are like ah
well you must be a very important person
you can afford to pay an extra 40 or 50
bucks a month why don't you just use
your home phone and you know now
obviously oh that that world is getting
completely unfathomable because everyone
has a cell phone and we all need to have
cell phones if you want to be
communicated with basically and just
think about it could go the other way I
mean what if you know voiceover LT is
something that is going to happen mm-hmm
I would we've got devices like the iPad
where you can just stick a sim card in
there and pay whenever you want to you
can pay for a day or pay for a month and
you know with voice over LTE being a
reality and having applications taking
advantage of that like skype it could be
the case where we are going to end up
with devices that just have an LTE radio
for data and can also do voice but it is
not really a cell phone anymore yeah
yeah it is looking at the future
landscape there's going to be a lot of a
lot of stuff interesting developments as
always I think I think with all the
galaxy player stuff we've put Tony to
sleep so still he's still alive over
there can you hear me scouring let's uh
I just want to briefly touch on one
piece of Windows Phone news which
masquerades as two pieces in the lineup
here but um basically within this lull
before the sep tember fifth announcement
by the way September fifth there's a lot
of stuff that's going to happen all at
once but there's some just basically
some hardware pictured nokia you know we
have another bezel picture we've been
talking about this for weeks and we also
have some details on the new samsung
windows phone 8 model
um I don't know guys I don't even know
if we need to really discuss this unless
there's something really huge but you
know I feel like we're just in the
speculation phase where it's like how
much more can we say we just need more
information here which is going to come
at this point from a last-minute leak or
from a product announcement I mean we're
all waiting on nokia and samsung windows
phone 8 hardware so i mean i think a lot
of people are waiting for like a galaxy
s3 or variant or Windows Phone and we
ended up getting that with the Samsung
which was it the focus s the focus s
which to be honest with you I really
like that phone um I I don't know I
don't know what to say about Windows
Windows Phone sorry it's just it's been
a rough couple years for them and I know
that Samsung and HTC are doing their
best to support the platform but sadly
the platform is not taking off as it
should um and I don't know I i do see
Samsung doing it because obviously they
just want to be everywhere they've got
bata they've got this they've got that
they just want to be everywhere um and
they want to wait and see and not have
all their eggs in one basket but it's
just gonna happen that way whereas
opposed to nokia it's everything is it's
pretty much being set on windows phone
would just it's still not taking
opposite i mean and don't get me
wrong i always get this hate mail about
people thinking that I'm I'm against
windows Sean and i'm not against windows
one I think I like it more than a lot of
platforms I just I hate the fact that I
feel the same as many developers where
they just wish to see the numbers before
they actually invested in it and that's
really what's going on there right and
then then you know as much as I love my
windows phone devices Microsoft has
decided to make them obsolete with their
windows phone 8 announcement so it's
like do people will people really trust
Windows Phone going forward that's a
really big question I don't think is
going to be an answer that a lot of
people are going to want to hear hmm and
we'll have to see once the landscape is
shaken up by eight when it when it
arrives but that's that kind of services
and I segue into our two-minute sort of
debate corner here because the future is
very interesting we don't know who's
going to be on top in the
the days weeks and years to come so when
it comes to smartphone OEMs I want to
hear what you guys think about who the
next Apple is going to be that's about
as simple as it because I want to
confine this too I want to confine this
to mobile devices if we can so who would
like to go first because I don't want to
force this on anyone I want to be gentle
i want to be a you know a kind host to
y'all huh not everybody yeah very yeah
everyone everyone not everyone at once
okay let me start yes I don't think that
there will ever gonna be another company
which will be like Apple Samsung is
trying hard and they have succeeded up
until a point but I don't think that
there will be any company on this planet
or not not in the at least in the near
future that will manage to generate that
certain that huge amount of buzz which
is surrounded with bye bye bye I don't
know every product which Apple gets to
the market and with their policy of
being available now or available today
or pre-orders starting today it's just
if they come up with the same iphone
like the iphone 4 or the 4s or the 4s 2
and it will sell millions and of course
samsung as i said is doing a good job
but i don't think that they will manage
to be the next Apple so bottom line
Apple is apple and nobody in the near
future we'll get close to it okay okay
nice please brandon i agree with the
notion that no company will would be
like Apple but I think Samsung is is
brilliant with their strategy and it's
going to pay off huge they're hitting
every angle of the market every
different device size they're releasing
devices quickly they're strategically
releasing devices to to take the clouds
away from other device announcements and
there they are marketing aggressively
like I see galaxy s3 everywhere I saw
galaxy s2 everywhere and they're they're
in it to win it and
and you know they're kind of sharks
there what's the word they're kind of um
I don't know the word is the other kind
of sharks you know the little screwed
over people though they'll do whatever
it takes to win and you know i think you
know they've earned their place as the
top handset manufacturer and there
they're gonna they're gonna grow and
they're gonna do some they're gonna mess
up of course but it's impressive how
he'll daivam they've done a lot right
and they hit the market from every
different aspect mm-hmm I don't know in
my case in particular I you know I wish
I could say HTC it's just the weird
thing I wish I could say it but you know
the problem with HTC is and I wrote this
in an editorial a couple of weeks ago is
the fact that you know one thing I do
love about Samsung products is that what
they market they deliver um whether it's
the best product in the world or not
it's really tough for you to stand and
say oh this is the amazing camera
authentic sound and it's it's not really
that and I you know I think that what
Apple does a lot of people are like man
Apple's marketing is just so beyond
reality and it's really not I mean the
camera on the phone is really as good as
they say the video quality of the phone
is really as good as they say the UI is
as reliable as they say so I think that
it comes down to which company is able
to deliver on their promise and which
company is able to grow beyond the
promise and that I think Samsung is it i
think that samsung is not gonna be the
next Apple I think Samsung is gonna be
better than Apple at sum total Wow
samsung view the next Sam son yeah I
think so I think so and listen this by
far is not me being a samsung fanboy I
hate the quality of their said the of
their Hardware I mean yeah at the Galaxy
Nexus you broke your Galaxy Nexus last
week sure do I broke my galaxy nexus
three week a month ago with just one
fall they do have things they need to
improve and then you know Samsung
engineers can come up to me and be like
hey bones are to make phone call not to
drop them and they have a point there
but still I mean I first there there are
a lot of things that should happen in
the future I
think that Apple has thought one thing
two companies and it's the fact that you
don't need corporate culture and and and
you don't need these committees to be
able to build lasting companies what you
need is to behave like a start-up and
there are a lot of companies that are
doing that and you know Samsung is doing
the complete opposite but they're being
smart about delivering great quality
products when it comes to their you know
to their offerings I necessarily to
their hard work call it quality but
again I just feel that they are just
going to create a separate category in
their own that's going to be able to be
better than Apple at some point that's
that's a that's nice that is a that is
interesting i did not consider it I love
the my favorite part about your argument
hi Mei is I wish I could say it was HTC
and I do too but i can say i don't i
don't think it will be will be but i
really really wish i could cuz yeah a
big fan of acc products ever since the
dye pack that i bought initially in 2001
it was the most beautiful product that
i've ever owned you look I remember like
the privilege of my first bit of
employment here at park and I was that
my first review got to be the one x
which I just completely unexpectedly
fell head over heels for and you know
that's what really respond my interest
in HTC after you know I think the last
time they impressed me before that was
with the like that the original touch
maybe but yeah I feel HTC HTC has the
potential their biggest problem is again
they don't really I don't think they're
they're focusing so much on software
that they're not doing really great
hardware you know totally great I don't
know no one x is great okay the problem
with the 1x is it's a gorgeous device
it's beautifully designed but it's
designed to be beautiful not easily easy
to handle that's the problem well
they're petite you yeah well I'll hold
on it that's that's like a whole week we
can't because I will talk about this for
20 minutes and we just done at the time
I I want to here's the thing hi may you
may have listened last week we didn't
get the listener mail as well last week
we have a lot of kind of divergent
opinions on listener mail we may
continue we're going to
continue to do it for a while we may not
continue to do it based on the volume of
stuff we get I'm not really sure we're
going to talk about this going forward
but we're going to do it for now I like
doing it when listeners right in they
bring in common topics of discussion
that ordinarily wouldn't cover so I've
kind of boiled them down somewhat and I
want to get to to a couple the ones from
last week just to let you know a couple
ones that were like essay length we just
can't I couldn't boil them down so I
really we appreciate the input listeners
but we just can't get to something that
long on the air just to hit these real
quick guys Remington Jackson is asking
us great name it isn't it a great name
that's kudos on your name Remington
Jackson I indeed my questions are in
regards to rumors I've been hearing
about multiple OEMs making Nexus
products is it true and if it is who do
you think the OEMs will be obviously
Samsung and HTC but who else motorola
man you absolutely the atrix i have the
atrix they are the only ones that are
doing the real soft key button whole
family you can just see how Google is
already influencing it's come on
motorola that's that's gonna be the next
Nexus device I just wish they'd gotten
rid of a lot you know they're doing
something smart they're doing stock ICS
with motorola widgets they got rid of
blur which is really smart but the
problem is the UI is still not polished
it just feels sluggish but I feel that's
the next Nexus yeah I completely agree
that I think Motorola's definitely up to
bad on this one and I think the
acquisition of Motorola maybe has
derailed maybe another HTC nexus product
because unless I'm having a brain fart
they made the nexus one right want me to
throw something at you I think that
factor eight apparently that razr HD is
actually gonna be the next Nexus it
could be mmm but it's it's it's I I hope
not because it's going to be like the
atrix HD possibly a bit thinner and the
atrix x 8 HD is uh you know it's all
right yes yeah I let you know the atrix
feels great it's just the UI needs more
polish and i-10 but but I do feel that
that's what's going to
happen you know Motorola's going to be
their next Nexus provider but it would
be cool to have a 1x variant for stock
Android I mean I just look at this I've
said this before you you've all heard
about this microsoft windows what's
windows signature experience where you
can buy a computer but it's really stock
windows on the computer I wish Android
would do that they would have all om
products that you can buy but you could
choose a signature product where you can
get stock android on it that would be
just the beautiful experience that
everybody's waiting for I think yes it
would it's a that's actually not not
though that's in the Nexus vain like
with this sort of the Nexus aspiration
of the signature experience but that
actually kind of goes and nicely to it
an email that we received from a guy
named Thomas who is asking is our
opinion on trading in his phone he's
getting his upgrade availability window
soon from sprint she's an American he
currently has the iphone 4s Sprint is
currently offering the galaxy nexus for
free he says which I didn't know about
by the way that's pretty wild the galaxy
nexus is always seem pretty cool to me
and i love free phones I've wanted one
from launch day but at the time it was
not sprint what are your thoughts on
trading my iphone in for the Galaxy
Nexus and you already answered that my
god stay with what did I say yeah they
way they run away from this phone not
because I want to be clear not because
the device is a bad device it is a
wonderful device and I even said this in
the after the buzz Thomas that was for
the verizon galaxy nexus but it's the
same thing the Galaxy Nexus LTE version
is a beautiful android phone and it will
serve you so well if that's all that you
want but if you're looking for a nexus
experience and you're even thinking
about looking at the verizon or sprint
galaxy nexus you should not be you
should be going to a gsm carrier with an
HSPA galaxy nexus if that's what you
want at this point i think though in
august of 2012 thinking about any nexus
device at this point may be a little
premature i mean we'll probably see
another announcement in the next 14
months guys five months yeah wait for
the fall lineup
he really his name's Alex Thomas but
close really once he really wants the
free phone and if you know if that's
extremely important to you um you know
listen that you can if you if you've got
the got the balls you can root your your
Galaxy Nexus and put the cleanest most
sterile jelly bean ROM that exists out
there on your phone it'll take you about
an hour and that's it you're done so I I
think you can undo the the shameful
bloat that sprint has put forth on that
phone bye-bye just tacking a little a
little bit but if you don't want to do
that you know listen to these other guys
that's a that is a good point Brennan is
always here to remind us of the benefits
of rooting and of custom roms I that is
true then and and a good point
especially if it's a free device then it
would be certainly worth your while
Thomas so finally we there's a question
from from a tebe from a TB J aka aeon
flux sir you have a very long internet
name hey pocket now I have a question
concerning the growing trend of making
smartphones with embedded batteries I've
spoken on this a little bit everyone
hates my answer I'm planning to buy a
new phone and the decisions between the
One X and the sgs3 since I prefer HTC
I'm still will not one hundred percent
sure because the embedded battery is for
me seriously a downer and basically J
atb am flux wants to know if he's being
overly concerned or if it's a matter
that D values smartphone I will just go
here this is a last piece of listener
mail for this podcast so I will just say
something then you guys can chime in I
want to hear from Tony too I wrote an
editorial that everyone disagreed with I
said we need to stop complaining about
this we need to embedded batteries let
manufacturers make cooler designs and if
you really need a extra battery power
which we all do you can carry around a
spare charger instead of carrying around
a spare battery yeah it's a little more
bulky whatever I don't know everyone
hates my idea everyone loves carrying
spare batteries in their wallet cool
whatever for me atb J aka and flux no
it's not it's not a big impediment
if it were between those two devices it
would be a hard choice but the embedded
battery on the One X would not be an
impediment for me that is where I stand
gentlemen have at it I'll tell you what
android 4.0 point for that was just
released for the 1x does a very good job
with battery life it it is far better
than it used to be with the previous
version of sense it all depends i mean i
wrote an editorial last week about how i
wish phones would not be sealed anymore
I mean if I had a choice I would prefer
the galaxy s3 just because of the fact
that you have the choice you're not
stuck with the fact that you have to
charge the phone because it's it's not
going to carry a wall outlet with you um
but it really depends on your usage and
my particular usage it doesn't really
matter i could go for the one extra the
galaxy s3 I like sense a lot better than
touchflo the TouchWiz sorry but that
said it all narrows down to your choice
the problem with the 1x is if you ever
want to switch that battery in the
future it's pretty much impossible the
motherboard is split in two and it's
just a praise it's crazy right I kind of
like I kind of agree with Michael I mean
if you think about exactly what it takes
to get a replaceable battery you've got
to go online and find it it's usually
about 50 bucks and then you've got to
keep it charged and in the right
location and that's a big a big pain I
mean you know if you have a problem with
battery life you have a charger at work
which you probably got for ten dollars
you have a charger in the card probably
got for fifteen dollars you have a
charger at home and hopefully you don't
need to obsessively charge cuz the 1x
has reasonably good battery life but I I
agree that people need to stop
complaining about the batteries being
sealed in it it's uh I think it's
unfounded for for most people when you
consider the pros and the cons of
carrying a battery versus just charging
it a little bit more and and a phantom d
nadja is still with us I I agree with
Michael I don't care if it's removable
or not but it will die and we will get
frustrated so regardless of which one
you choose it will die so regardless of
whether it's replaceable or not you just
even it's not it's you you you argue
that it's not critical that's not a
deciding factor for me
another problem with to go on the other
side another problem with not being able
to take the battery out is what if your
device freezes you know means and in the
worst case scenario and this has
happened to me a few times you cannot
soft reset it by the power button so you
have to let it die you have to let it
sit there for like five hours with the
screen blaring on which it makes you cry
and then it just turns off eventually
and that's what you have the you have
the long seven second breasts of the
power button yeah once in a once in a
while very rarely that does not work for
whatever reason it's so yeah that is a
very good point that we need to make
mention of yeah if you get a phone with
a non-removable battery you better I
know reading the manual sucks but read
the manual at least to the point where
you learn how to soft reset it with the
hardware key because the Lumia 900 did
that to me like when I had it for like a
day and it just SAT there showing me the
time in the upper right corner and
nothing else and I couldn't do anything
because I was out on the town and I
didn't it was my first Windows Phone
device in about six months and I was
like crap I don't remember how to soft
reset this thing and I can't google it
