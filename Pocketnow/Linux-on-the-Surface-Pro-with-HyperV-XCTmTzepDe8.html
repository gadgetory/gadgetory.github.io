pro runs Android apps and full Windows 8
desktop apps what about Linux this is
Adam Lang for Pacquiao comm in this
video I'm going to show you the easy way
to get linux running on the surface pro
using hyper-v ok so first we have to
enable hyper-v on the surface pro does
not come enabled by default but it is
supported by the hardware so I'm going
to type I'm going to go to the settings
and then turn Windows Features on and
off and from here you see hyper-v I've
already turned it on but this is
something you have to do first on the
surface Pro check off hyper-v platform
and the management tools if you want and
that's going to install the hyper-v
support and then over here we already
have it installed go to the hyper-v
manager and now I'm going to create a
new virtual machine let's call it Linux
that's let's give it some more memory
how about a gig we'll use dynamic
connection how about the virtual switch
and let's put it that looks like a good
place sighs I'm going to give it five
gig
so that's creating a new virtual hard
disk and I'm going to install the
operating system from an ISO image so
before you do this you're going to want
to download you know whatever Linux
version you want as an ISO image file so
I have one right there that's the Mint
14.1 open it hit next finish and we are
creating a virtual machine so there it
is and we're going to start it
connecting and there we go and it's
booting to Linux there we go on that
boot
and we wait for it a little bit and here
we are
there's Linux that was pretty easy I'm
going to change the display preferences
just change the resolution a little bit
that's better
and it is working pretty nicely let's
open GIMP
not too bad let's look at some office
programs where's your writer
and I can always you know resize the
window there's my linux window and it's
still going pretty nicely and look I can
still do everything that Windows 8 can
do so there you go very very easy to run
Linux on the surface Pro sure give this
video a thumbs up and that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
