is brought to you by XCOM global we've
already checked out the bigger brother
nova plus so let's spend a little time
with the smaller of the two kwame phones
revealed that this year's Aoife overall
it's similar hardware to the plus
shrinking the 1080p display from 5.5
inches to 5 means we get a slightly
tighter pixel pitch powering the phone
we have the same welcome 625 with 3
gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of
storage the camera specs are trimmed a
bit the novel loses optical image
stabilization in favor of a flush camera
housing and larger pixels that reduces
resolution from 16 to 12 megapixels but
like the plus we still have access to
you HD video battery capacity is also
slimmed down to a 3000 20 milliamp hour
cell but with the smaller LCD that
should balance out in terms of overall
runtime expect to see EMU I is the main
face of the phone a polarizing software
skin which has a bit more in common with
iOS than traditional Android and I'll
reference the same pun hear about soon
installing nova launcher on my nova
phone in the hand i might enjoy the
shape and design of the nova over the
nova plus the aesthetic here borrows
from the same playbook as the GX eight
but the rear gracefully recalls phones
like the p9 in nexus 6p it's more in
keeping with devices like the MediaPad
m3 expect a price of 399 euro when it's
released later this year instead of
paying terrible roaming fees when
traveling abroad or the hassle of buying
another sim card why not try a smarter
solution XCOM global gives you unlimited
internet connectivity through a Wi-Fi
hotspot rental for just seven dollars
