spilled the beans on WWDC what's this
about Twitter being integrated into iOS
in our predictions on what the one more
thing will be on WWDC all this and more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
hi Mary Beth and welcome to the pocket
now i were really sure we go through all
this week school and the not so cool
inside the world of Apple's iOS devices
let's start this week off with the cool
in the weirdest move in history Apple is
just offered a press release where they
make all their WWDC intentions public no
more need for rumors the document states
that none other than Steve Jobs will be
releasing the next generation iOS 5
iCloud and Mac OS 10 lion no iphones
were mentioned in the document but again
this is the weirdest move in Apple
history they never give out information
on what's coming on their events so
there could be one more thing and this
could just be a game but again stay
tuned for WWDC predictions at the end of
this i review to tell you more on what
we think about it well Twitter recently
announced that there will be all about
photo galleries from now on aside from
tweets and well alongside with that
rumors have just surfaced about iOS 5
bringing deep Twitter integration with
photos not really sure what to make of
it because anything that's deeply
integrated into iOS is pretty much just
a button somewhere that says upload the
Twitter or tweet or upload to Facebook
and that's just pretty much it again it
could be just the rumor but it could
also mean that iOS 5 could probably be
deeply integrated not only to Twitter
but probably to Facebook probably to
YouTube in some other ways that we
currently know so stay tuned in another
weird but interesting move Apple has
just released their I work productivity
suite to work on your iPhone or iPod
Touch meaning that yes Pages Numbers and
Keynote they used to only work on the
iPad we're now downscaled to work on
your iPhone or iPod touch it's an
interesting move because it's kind of
weird that Apple didn't wait for WWDC to
release this which could also mean that
the Kino will be so long with new
enhancements and good things that
well they just pretty much thought that
I work wasn't that important and they
could just release it now so if you
already had it for your iPad this is now
a universal application all you have to
do is update it and then sync it to your
iphone or ipod touch and if not well it
will cost you ten bucks apiece
well that does it for the cool that's
continuing on with the not so cool you'd
ask how much music are you actually able
to stream over the future iCloud service
with the current limitation of only two
gigabytes of data plans on pretty much
every carrier out there now well the bad
news is that you can pretty much only
stream 45 hours of music over those two
gigabytes and that's if you only stream
music so that's pretty much less than
two hours a day that's really not cool
so we're really hoping that Apple pulls
up something really cool off their
sleeve for this event because two
gigabytes of data are really not cool at
all this not so cool section is
dedicated to you carriers lighten up
okay so just as we do for every Apple
event what are our predictions for WWDC
whatever we get right hey say we said it
and whatever we don't get right low or
not psychics cut us some slack so first
of all for iOS 5 we do see that Apple
will work on revamping the UI
significantly we'll probably see that
settings notifications and music are
probably available all around the OS
through the status bar just tapping on
it or probably with some sort of gesture
aside from that well we do see that
Apple will bring some sort of
multitasking you I enhancement that will
look a little like expose looks on a Mac
even expect some multi-touch gestures to
bring that out as Apple moves away from
the home button aside from that we do
see Apple working on probably bringing
widgets though remember that's something
that android does so don't hold your
breath on that one ever will probably
work on making their home screen icons
dynamic but that will also look like the
towel base windows phone 7 so I really
wonder what Apple will bring to the
table because it's really difficult for
them to no.8 over something that works
really good on Android and Windows Phone
7 so let's see what they come out for
iOS 5 ok so for iCloud we are expecting
a whole revamp of innovated services
coming to iOS devices first of all a
full mirror of your device on the cloud
now how Apple is going to negotiate this
with carriers welder
you just make the iphone either a little
expensive or Apple will have to pretty
much get rid of a little bit of their
premium to have you know the device cost
the same amount of money but then you'll
get an unlimited data plan if you own an
iPhone now within these services we do
see a full mirror of your device not
just wireless syncing but your device on
the cloud completely we also see that I
cloud will work to bring music
enhancements to your iOS device meaning
you'll also be able to sync your music
fully to the cloud and Apple will bring
you that enhance music for whatever
pirated bad music you have there that's
going to be kind of cool aside from that
will mobileme will merge with iCloud so
most probably iCloud won't be free
rumors have it that it'll cost 25 bucks
rumors have it that it'll be free rumors
have it that it will cost the same 99
bucks that mobileme cost so we'll see
what happens because given we don't see
those many enhancements for iOS 5 our
cloud will really play a big role in and
if apple charges money for this they'll
pretty much lose it so well let's see
what happens we do see that everything
works just like on the apple TV were
your music will be streamed from the
cloud and then your device's storage
will be used strictly for apps so let's
see what happens because icons of iCloud
have already been popping up we already
know how the logo is going to look so
it's going to be kind of cool hopefully
and well no apple event could be the
same if Steve Jobs doesn't come on stage
and says wait there's one more thing so
what are we expecting for this one more
thing to be we're kind of skeptical
because pretty much Apple has already
spilled the beans on what to expect for
the event so given we think that this is
a sort of game for stocks and for
competition to underestimate what Apple
is going to do we are expecting for
Apple to release the iphone 4s we're
hoping for that but not really sure what
to expect but what if it is the iphone
4s well we are seeing Apple bringing the
a5 chip to the iphone 4s or 50 whatever
they're going to call it we're also
expecting them to bring double the RAM
double the storage for more app says
apps get larger time and time again in
the App Store aside from that we are
seeing that it'll be the same I iphone
for the design with the same Chace's
only that
with a larger screen and yes Apple will
most definitely work on glass gate and
antennagate now we are seeing that the
iphone 4s will work on sprint and
t-mobile as of this WWDC event but it
could also mean that Apple will probably
just use the events and the one more
thing will be to launch the iphone 4 to
work on these carriers and that'll be
pretty much it again not sure what to
expect so cross your fingers and hope it
is the iphone 4s that will work on all
carriers there'll be a world phone there
will be a faster device and that we also
get the same goodies that we also
mentioned for the past iphone 4 we'll
see what happens that's it for today's
show thank you very much for watching
I'm Hyneman better remember to give us a
thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now
