to take a break this week from running
down the news from all across the mobile

facebook account is that what that was

need to import something which means
nothing to you and making it your own oh
why do people celebrate hello like oh
yeah it's like it's like the biggest
thing around here and Valentine's Days
like it was like it's our thing really
that's why I'm so pissed oh man well I

beard into the Tony Stark beard as well
what about the audio that oh well I
gotta go steal one of those but
thankfully the Red Sox won last night so
I think they're like seven or eight
Audi's flipped over out on the streets
okay I can't has become more important
oh that's right oh you should be wearing
your cap with with a lot of pride now
okay that's what all do are you gonna
don√≠t good well it's not a video
podcast nobody will know but I know we
all we all take pride but we all have
the picture in our mind exactly Joe is
having the the most busy day of us
although because when you have kids on
Halloween it's just nuts do I was up way
past their bedtime hollowed-out gourds
and lighten them up Oh criminy having to
six-year-olds of an hour past their
bedtime that's just insanity that is
nuts and I do feel for you I hope the
rest of the day goes well for you
fortunately the silver lining is we have
a new device that's right up your alley
and it's this this nexus 5 now we whoa a
nexus 5 i'm like 'i on the for yah yah
something new and like not quite not
quite a seven and then amazing survive
in we a little tip for those of you who
don't know listeners we record this
podcast early in the morning generally
and early I mean it's early for Joe it's
not early for Tony everything before
noon is early for me so we record this
podcast in the morning and we use it we
use a rundown from the night previous so
our news is is dated that we're talking
about yesterday stuff
actually exactly but we are I do want to
augment that with a few with a few bits
from the Twitter scape so I saw a huh a
user I tried to email myself one of
these tweets by the way and normally
that works and then it actually didn't
this time which is very annoying but
there's a user I follow called nitro z1
and he follows me and I follow him and
it's all very lovely and apparently he
has found himself next to a carphone
warehouse over in the UK where they have
received stock of Nexus 5 stuff so we
have this this wonderful feed i will see
if i can once i get Joe to talk here in
a second or Tony i will see if i can
find his username again because i'm
really annoyed that we didn't work but
the point is that some stores do have
stock have you guys seen any other
reports from around the internet where
there's kind of popping up all over the
place where people are taking selfies
with Nexus 5's union locations that are
obviously back room not today that you
haven't seen it really not today yeah
you've seen that the pallets and pallets
that have the big empty core and you
wonder why they didn't throw some swag
or extra phones in the middle right yeah
it's the username I'm talking about is
is night Rosie but the handle is n1 TR 0
Z is what I'm looking at and 10 it's
like night rose yeah yeah exactly leet
so this is cool i love i love the story
like he kind of like he was like there's
a tweet from hours ago Razak i think i'm
gonna go to carphone warehouse just see
if they have any and then since then
there's been like every sleet around
their loading dock apparently I'm using
air quotes here inadvertently flirted
with with a carphone warehouse retail
associate and she took a phone out and
showed him so what we're getting is a
lot of confirmations of what we expected
doesn't that all it takes any more wet
you just show a little bit of leg
carphone warehouse you got to do you
just got to be nice to people Joe Levi
you know this you're the nicest man on
the team I think what what do you think
Tony do you think I'm wrong on that I do
agree with you that you are not wrong
out of thank you guys on the team who
owns guns oh yeah I know true look at
that look at that who was it that said
speak softly and carry a big stick there
you go we're seeing so night Rosie is
really excited here insta buying the
nexus 5 he says Google killed it plain
and simple as far as you can tell
they're not stereo speakers just a
single grill on the bottom the phone
doesn't feel all that big either just
feels like it's a nexus 4 shell with
squared-off edges it's good to hear a
lot of good stuff there so I feel like
that's a nice on ramp into our rumor
roundup which so yeah let me just
comment on that then we'll be legal
thing yeah um I saw a teaser on spy
jeans I think that's how you pronounce
that their Google+ page a while back
teasing their quote unquote ultrafit
case and I went ahead and kept an eye
out for it and found it on amazon a
little bit later and bought it so i
actually have a screen protector and a
case in my hand for the nexus 5 that for
all we know doesn't exist Rhea and by
the way Michael when when Joe mentioned
this to me my first question pop into my
mind what was it like are you getting a
nexus 5 no I just get cases for stuff
exactly like my iphone Oh naturally yeah
a little fit but yeah so i'm holding the
empty shell and I'm holding the nexus 4
and they feel the same in hand you know
obviously I can see that they're
different but it doesn't feel like
there's any added bulk but man the nexus
5 what's really light I know phone
you're making me yeah there's no phone
in it you're making me you're making me
feel like I you're making me a little
sad I'm gonna be honest with you because
and I Tony can tell me a few months Ben
take this out later but I don't think
you will we were going to have something
cool earlier this week we had a we're
supposed to be able to say their name
but I don't want to say their name so we
had an accessory maker approached us
with some some photos of a nexus 5 am i
right but they never materialized yep so
we were actually really jazzed it was
like oh great we're gonna have some
photos of the nexus 5 done up in this
really cool skin or case whatever it was
and locally let's bring on the news
nexus5 cancelled yeah so yeah exactly
then Google recalled all the inventory
and burned it they're not inventory
they're empty boxes floating on barges
with google glass accessories so it's
just it broke my heart a little bit that
that we weren't able to get those those
shots but we are all going to see this
thing pretty quickly we have our roundup
I want to talk a little bit about this
we did the rumor roundup that Stephen
shank put together assembling all the
facts we know about the nexus 5 guys was
published on october fourteenth that's a
long time ago and it's because this has
been and I feel like I've been saying
this for a lot of devices and i feel
like i've said that I've given that
qualifier before saying that we've heard
this about a lot of devices a lot this
year because leaks have been crazy but
the nexus 5 takes it to an entirely
different level because this is a phone
that's been leaked extensively and has
had what 56 like tentative review
release dates and rumored rumored
related that's exactly right it's not
I'm not saying that this is a google
thing I'm saying that this is a Oh what
it is but as well but but but yeah but
it's google playing on the very very
excited soviet so we take all the stuff
that we've got through our normal
channels and there's been a little bit
more than normal and if my memory serves
but then you also add into that the the
combined co-branding with nestle which
we really haven't seen before and has
been really fun and I've gotten more Kit
Kats in the last couple of weeks than I
haven't gone okay really I have an
eigenvalue every of stuff in the Play
Store my neighbors are you gonna save
like a bunch of good kid cats like mint
in like a non humid refrigerated in the
humid order yeah but it was safe but the
other thing that we've had that's been
kind of unusual is we've had all these
quote-unquote official google events
yeah and we've been so excited hey this
is it it's coming it's a riot and then
the event is what we're releasing like
album
aren't on Twitter and that's it yeah
what's so combine all that and they're
really I think they're just looking at
us and enjoying all the hype that we're
generating for them and for this product
because we are their advertising they
don't have to pay for anything they just
sit back with you know cup of hot
chocolate and break off a kit kat bar
and enjoy so I have talked to Taylor
actually I talked to everybody on the
team about this but Taylor said an
interesting thing that somewhere in the
lines that Google is is probably the
biggest role these days yeah and i would
i would rephrase i would say that this
is pathetic i mean if you are who obey
or why not even even nakia a third or
probably the last from the top ones and
you need the attention and you're
desperate for it yes you can do it but
your any leading position and you are
doing this it's kind of pathetic I mean
get back to your corner and just release
the phone already I thought it was
brilliant and fun and fattening yes I
was going to say this isn't gonna be any
good for our waste lines no I just had
during that intermission I just had a I
message message come in from somebody
who I don't know which is why i hate I
message and Taylor Martin is also
bugging me about something else so
Taylor stop it we're podcasting it's
very important you know I think you sure
isn't ringing Tony yeah and he's going
to hear this in like three hours when it
publishes he never listens when he's not
on the air just like you do this with
you know so it's yeah the crap out of
everything I was talking to Tony oh um
here's here's my question though like
yes we're getting very amped on this
nexus 5 as a is a media as the media as
a whole users android fans but I guys
why I I've been hitting myself up the
upside the head with this question what
why is this so exciting is it because
and I would like Tony to answer this
first because I want to hear from the
non android guy first like because for
me it's taken me a while to arrive at
this answer like why am I not excited
about the Nexus 5 and in general I mean
and we're going to talk about that a
little bit later as it relates to
another device but for me it's because I
really have the moto x
I'm getting an experience on the Moto X
that I really really like and it's as
far as I can tell superior for my needs
so that's my stock Android thing Tony
are you excited about the nexus 5
personally why or why not no I am NOT
but I have not been excited about any
Nexus device ever because i am not a
pure Android aficionado and I do with
all the respect to every Nexus fan out
there everybody's got their own choices
I would very much prefer even TouchWiz
or since five opposed to the pure
Android experience and to answer your
question I think that there's a lot of
buzz not necessarily because it is a
nexus because we know that Nexus devices
are just a small small small part of the
entire Android the user base I think
it's more because we are hoping and we
are likely to see a high-end android
phone at a very affordable price and I
think that that's the main reason why we
have the buzz i think you're right i
think price is a major major factor and
the Moto X has certainly like the iphone
5c has not been the affordable device it
was at one point rumored to be and I
don't think it's ever needed to be but
Joe you're obviously your answer to this
is obviously yes but tell us why
specifically you are really amped on the
Nexus 5 why are you buying cases for
this phone that you don't have yet
you're so just because I don't have a
moto x what you do have a nexus 4 I do i
do and and that's something that I try
and do on when I buy my daily drivers I
try and buy my daily drivers it's not
something that is a corporate thing most
of the time yeah I'll have to go several
weeks through the year have to it's so
hard what we do using the latest and
greatest phone from whatever you know
and do a review on it so tough but my
daily drivers one that I personally
invest in and I do that basically so
that I still maintain my editorial
integrity I put my own personal money
behind my choices and the nexus 4 is
doing everything i need it to what i
like it a moto x sure you bet is it
worth buying it when the Nexus 5 is
coming out in possibly hours or maybe
already by the time the podcast hits the
air
and I didn't think so so I've just kind
of held off I really think it's really
cool what they're doing with it and ind
everyone out there who has it and I'm
not going to look down my nose at you
she's got a Moto X and bless your name
is Michael Fisher but you know that's
for other reasons something it's the
moto air naturally ya know those are
Star Trek differences but so so you're
making a good a good point Joe I mean
like not everybody's got the has got the
Moto X not everybody wants the Moto X
and the Nexus line has come to represent
not what it once stood for which was
showcasing the very best of Android what
could what you can do with it but now
it's become this sort of half consumer
eyes thing that isn't and is now very
very affordable as Tony rightly points
out I mean if this thing sells that's
one thing that we're seeing a bunch of
leaks on but nothing confirmed yet
through the same 349 price point would
be stunningly weird but let's talk about
the hardware that we're actually getting
excited for this panel this display is
the same panel as on the g2 right is
that what we're wrecking ok so and as as
much as I really didn't like the g2 as a
whole mostly on software yeah I know I
really like the display though the
display is absolutely gorgeous on that
phone and so that's that's exciting you
can't necessarily you know I'm generally
an AMOLED guy and you really can't yeah
about the one on the on the g2 that
respect whatcha I was just yeah you know
AMOLED has really really cool advantages
but you know different technologies have
different features and yeah I'm kind of
wishing that it adds some moto x e
screen goodness on it but hey like you
said that the g2 screen is nothing short
of gorgeous so I don't think I'm gonna
be disappointed yes there's no need to
be sad about that no real since we're
talking about specs and I would just
want to make a bridge between what we
talked about earlier price and specs now
what will the nexus 5 in is currently
rumored specs form do that the LG g2 or
the Xperia z1 does not nothing it has
the same specs thing is it's half the
price is right and that makes the point
those specs that we're talking about
we're talking about a Snapdragon 800
right
at we don't know the clock speed but
they usually run around 2.3 gigahertz
right that's as fast as they can run it
yeah okay wait is that as fast is that
their top like there that's not their
upper limit I mean people can people get
overclock I'm gift that dude who just
wrote an article a pocket now about the
Snapdragon 800 knew what he was talking
about then that's that's the ceiling
there are rumors that there's going to
be a refresh of the 800 whether that's
going to be the 900 the 1000 the 801 we
don't know we're just now seeing the 800
land on Hardware looking over though I
know but this is that's why it's a
refresh and it could potentially push
that clock speed out to 2.5 so nice
hugely but here's a question and not
necessarily for Michael because I know
he would never do that there's something
like this but for you Joe well I
understood that we were overclocking our
single core processors our dual core
processors but why on earth would
somebody overclock a Snapdragon 800 at
2.2 meters they're not why would they
overclock it faster than that yeah we
all want more speed because they can you
know these guys be differences is just
is just not perceivable among that speed
above that speed yeah you know you hit a
certain ceiling and you're not gonna
notice anything in day-to-day activities
in fact what I do with my phones
typically I'm underclocking them I'm
running them slower than they're
designed and I can understand to save on
battery life right yeah yeah yeah it
extends the battery life out I don't
notice a difference so this from what
the rumor mill is churning is not going
to be an oem who is overclocking what
the 800 is designed to do the rumors are
that it's going to be a refresh actually
from Qualcomm that is designed for some
other product whether that's a
higher-end tablet or whatnot that just
ups the speed and maybe gives it a few
other bells and whistles along the way
so not a huge improvement as far as what
everybody's thinking but you know it's
just a step up in speed a little bit and
I can see the difference you know
between a smartphone and a tablet
perhaps or a smartphone and a notebook
for example whether or not it's true I
don't know but come on guys two point
three gigahertz quad-core that's that's
more power than we know what to do with
absolutely and I mean that's the kind of
power where you instinctively say why do
I need to even worry about this anymore
this is more power than then you will
ever need in the palm of your hand with
today's software but generally you're
not only that it's only you also future
brutha well that's true but generally
when we're talking about Android devices
that sell in the in the millions and
millions we're talking about heavily
skin to touch wiz devices and in that
case you know this is simplistic
thinking and I'm sure it's more than
halfway wrong but I got at a I gotta say
whenever i'm running a device that's
running a skin as heavy as TouchWiz i do
want the best specs i can possibly get
you because i know it's gonna just slap
down yeah Joe's gonna have an obese on
that and I don't want to spoil the
entire thing but one observation which I
had is that it's that often the problem
is not put android and it's not even
with specs the problem is because of
crappy software optimization yeah it's
the third part of you I that's not being
optimized properly I'm so he's gonna
stay off topic it was just like you guys
are quoting from my article it's all
good well that is when I will look out
for them because I mix I'm always
excited for Joe's articles but those are
gonna be cool well it's usually because
I put your picture and I'm just exactly
right it's usually it's only the
shoutouts that I that I i I'd pick my
own quotes but in Joe's article so with
the rest of the nexus 5 kind of physical
existence we're looking at my favorite
presenta but I want to guess of my
favorite feature on this thing the
optimal the obstacles the oh I escape
that that didn't even take a second
thank you Tony and it's got to be your
favorite feature too I mean I know you
had one mind on this right yeah yeah
optical image stabilization as it was
implemented on the Lumia 1020 was great
in my experience and I loved it but it
wasn't until I got my hands on the g2
which I otherwise wouldn't wouldn't
carry personally that I realized just
how smooth Oh is can make a camera
experience oh man I mean you're just
walking around even with the viewfinder
active you're not shooting anything
you're just getting ready to take a shot
and just
youyou kind of prefer to view the world
through the phone through the phone
because it's it's smoother it's not it's
more stable than you are yeah way more
stable time because I shake all time and
drink coffee all day so you know it's
just amazing and if they port that
technology to the same technology to the
nexus 5 or if they have already if it's
sitting in boxes waiting to go with that
same technology I kind of don't care
what the sensor size is because we're
talking about an 8 megapixel unit
instead of a 13 Megan sensor which and I
have a piece coming out today I think
that talks about why megapixels are not
as important these days but of course
everybody has said that but the new
buzzword that actually delivers on its
promise is 0 is optical image
stabilization is one of the best things
to come to smartphone cameras in history
I think and so to have it on this device
even if it is an 8 megapixel sensor
versus a 13 megapixel one it's it's
great and there are also disadvantages
to going up to 13 as well because I
think you you have some light collection
problems the more den to go isn't that
right it could be I couldn't say for
sure but now that you're talking about
the camera I'm looking at the leaked
photos and I realized what my problem is
with this nexus 5 that big ass Kim repre
dr. lense you don't need amra no camera
is obviously much smaller like half of
that why the need for such a protective
lens on top of it oh you know the answer
to that it like dude look at my camera
or exactly yeah yeah I 10-20 look at
this right so you got Lumia you got an
okay out there with the Lumia 1020 and
that big Oreo on the back you gotta
compete with that somehow in a in a
visual marketing standpoint you know
like when you see the glass and in the
right in the middle of it that that
small small camera sensor which is
actually the lens it's kind of think you
want to laugh the police I do do you
guys remember the original fan renders
that we got based on the the leaked
video stills and whatnot where we kind
of knew the layout already we knew where
the LED was we knew where the camera
lens was and whoever put that render
together made like this big honkin
fisheye lens going over the top
whole area oh no I don't see that I was
excited for that but now looking at it
it's just like you know they need to
like make arrows pointing to the little
camera sensor in there or maybe I don't
know paint a target on it Hey look at me
I'm the camera and I'm right here you
know what I want I want to hazard I want
hazard striping around my camera lens
yeah black and yellow stripes this is
great yeah so I'm still looking at
you've you've put me in mind of
different hardware elements on this
phone and the OAS I'm very excited about
of course but also i'm really a fanboy
on notification lights and guys refresh
my memory the nexus 4 does have one down
low is that right I don't have one but
Joe's got one another's got you doing
the nexus 4 oh yeah hey I bought its
downs about it so it seems about as the
nexus said the new Nexus 7's blinky
light right down in the home button
position relatively yes yeah if there
were a home button there soon well
apparently they've carried that forward
to this one here and getting to the most
the most granular of details nitros
night Rosie reports that that is a very
bright light on this unit wait a second
wasn't a rumor that there will be no
notification light and instead android
for that for will bring those Moto X
like screen on notification thingies I'm
sure that's a true Maria I'm sure active
notifications will be present in some
form actually I'm not sure about that I
assume that but I also still like the
idea of a notification yeah absolutely
don't get me wrong it should get must on
every phone i was just it's just
conflicting rumors yeah reports and they
are conflicting a bit because the active
notifications yeah i mean they they
obviate the need for a for a
notification specially on an AMOLED
screen yes well I gotta I gotta disagree
with that an AMOLED screen and active
notifications are a great combination
active notifications on anything but an
AMOLED screen you're gonna run into some
some battery impacto applications Wow
doing it to a degree yeah but Sir there
at your line right did their active
notification is that they're smart so
the phone is yeah ideally if the
the software is leveraging the hardware
properly the phone knows when a tenant
pocket doesn't turn on the screen it
only you know activates the screen yeah
but strictly on paper on lcds they
illuminate the entire screen on amyloids
they only light up no I I get that right
but it's only lighting up when it should
true if it's implemented properly so
it's but the same time hold on guys what
does the the Snapdragon 800 has a
discrete subprocessor for to do some of
that contextual stuff doesn't it like it
has some of those capabilities right not
that I'm aware of not in the same sense
that we have seen in the Moto X and in
an Apple's latest product yeah I'm 7 but
i can't imagine that you're not going to
have something in there that that's
functionally equivalent even if it's not
you know exactly the same thing so we're
gonna see a lot of that especially in
the high-end chips like the 800 but no
it's not gonna have the same advantage
that the the Moto's have so it will
basically wake up the entire processor
to notify you and then put it to sleep
back remember it's it's got various
states inside the processor so it's
gonna wake up in a very very low but low
speed if you will in an almost an
ambient state but yes it's it's the
processor it's not yeah a dedicated
ambient processor like we have in the
end it that's my term guys I'm the one
who coined it as far as I know so we use
the crap out of it I'm seeing the guys
it's at SlashGear were reporting on this
back in April or May and they're saying
in a piece that Qualcomm actually did
build the same ability the same
effective ability into the Snapdragon
800 as in the the custom core on the
Moto X in the drawer I'm not questioning
their report but I think that if it
would be true then we would have heard
about this as a market and catch for a
long time and all these never going to
end the processor power phones I'm
mentioning here the z1 and the g2 would
at one point have offered this well you
know what it it's true but there are
other features within the Snapdragon 800
that that have that are not taken
advantage of by every piece of hardware
like that the quick charging that the
Lumia 2520 has that's it should be on
yeah well that's a first but like you
have to build
hardware that takes it that leverages it
because it requires other stuff so you
know I think that I see the 800s this
kind of like a never-ending bag of
secret tricks you know where it's like
oh yeah well we forgot about that
feature when Qualcomm announced it back
when they rolled out the 800 but this
new piece of hardware takes advantage of
so and I think the Nexus 5 is just the
right device for Google to come out and
say like oh hey yeah so this is an x5
and it does this really cool thing that
you've only seen here before you know
yeah and one other thing to keep in mind
is we have a we're trying to make a
clean separation a distinction between
hardware and software you saying we
can't do one without the other which to
a certain extent is true but once we
start looking at look at this really
really cool processor let's now look at
software that may not exist today that
can do stuff with that hardware you know
inside that processor that we didn't
think about before now the manufacturer
of the processor didn't even imagine
that use or that functionality but hey
it can do it because it has the
capability of being an ultra-low mode it
knows whether it's in a pocket or not
even though it doesn't have that
dedicated chip the software can be smart
enough to have it emulate that or
something along those lines so software
taking advantage of these really
high-end processors really is an
untapped thing going off into the future
and it always has been and that's yet
another reason and I didn't mention this
by name but why you want to get the
latest and greatest that you can
whenever you're going to get something
whether it's a desktop for whether it's
this one phone or tablet it's gonna comb
and power management we were talking
about is a big concern for devices like
this and I kind of want to use this to
wrap up the hardware before we go into
KitKat the battery was rumored we had a
lot of rumors friend the battery on the
sucker of variable capacities depending
on model you bought but it looks like
well that is settled down right we're
looking at what Tony at 2,300 milliamp
hour cell yeah and the three thousand
something which was also rumored with
the 32 gig model right yeah it looks
like that's completely in the dumpster
now right oh and by the way it should be
instead of eight and 16 16 and 32
gigabyte options well but still without
the SD
that makes me so much more say it makes
more yeah then rather than 8 and 16 yes
yeah why on earth can she put a microSD
card on it hey you know I just think
philosophically that's not where if they
want to be you know in it's funny
because we do have variances in this
like I would never I never thought I
would see the day when HTC would
reincorporate micro SD cards and they've
done so with the one max and the loom
nokia i keep calling nokia lumia nokia
has done so with the lumia 1520 as well
you've got a micro SD card in there
never would have thought i would see
that so it's interesting that some
manufacturers are kind of backtracking
in response presumably in response to
consumer demand and others are like no
no this is not that is on our philosophy
if you want more storage here take 50
free gigs of Google Drive and run with
it you know and it looks like obviously
we know which which boat Google's in
here yeah so the boat that I'm in there
yes I want an SD slot everybody knows
that I know why Google's doing what
they're doing um if I were working for
them I'd probably agree I'm not so I
don't necessarily but please please for
the love that is all that's good and
decent just give me USB on-the-go so i
can plug in something to the bottom you
don't have to mess up your phone or
dirty up your phone but let me throw a
freaking thumb drive on it so i can take
my movies with me wait hold on USB
on-the-go refresh refresh the minds of
the listeners because i'm not sure that
all of them remember what that is and
that's right for i don't know what
you're talking about you all right so
USB OTG to put it in acronyms that sound
like Star Trek for you yeah it
essentially lets you plug in a little
dongle into your USB port on the bottom
of your your device your tablet your
phone whatever what an attic or yeah and
it exposes a real dedicated USB port
that you can plug in compatible devices
so you could plug in a mouse you could
plug in a keyboard you could plug in a
thumb drive you could plug in a hard
drive but that support is is it's
required that the support is in the
hardware on the smartphone or in the
software or bucks
yeah the software did yeah mostly it's
its software and that's the part and not
to disagree with Tony entirely on this
but we've seen on the ghost support in
other Android devices and then we've
seen that quote unquote patched out of
it with updates so we had it and then
right when people are saying hey cool
look you can do this and then we get an
update and I can't sorry goodbye you're
done and that tip pisses me off don't
give us stuff and then patch it out now
I'm giving us more features with updates
not let it be as securities worry I mean
it's got to be something because android
does not need a bloody nose right now as
far as you know security goes they want
those those enterprise customers you
know they we have samsung building an
entirely different suite of stuff under
Knox to like you know pursue those
enterprise customers knocks on wood oh
he's finally gotten American puns I
agree oh yeah oh yeah Oh Tony's way
ahead of the game on those these comes
out with new ones sometimes and I'm like
oh wait wait wait right let me write it
down I'm gonna bring that over to the
states and I'm gonna pain that never
works i'm gonna try and get everybody
into that doesn't happen i'll ever see
he gets wrong I know apparently I can't
roll my r's like hi may i can't i can't
pronounce like you Tony before we move
into KitKat we have two more things Tony
has something to say I did jump the gun
on that a little bit we have to talk a
little bit about a cdma Nexus 5 and
we've talked about one of the packaging
guys would the last time we had a cdma
Nexus product do you remember what it
was yeah yellow sea Nexus yeah I had
that thing and when I broke that thing
on the boat I remember announcing it on
the podcast it was like it was like
episode 10 of the podcast or some was
like guys I broke my galaxy nexus on the
boat because I shattered the screen when
I sat on it or something and I was sad
because I really really liked a Galaxy
Nexus put on the same token I was
excited that I would never have to write
another editorial about how they Verizon
Galaxy Nexus was not a real Nexus device
amen oh man beak down to the accessories
it wasn't a real Nexus just ah so the
problem there depending on who you
listened to could have come from a
variety of sources but I think the most
commonly accepted one and I remember
reading somewhere that this was wrong so
I don't know but that the the cdma
binaries are locked down by this kind of
proprietary of system because cdma is a
Qualcomm property and there's there's
all these these keys that are required
for that network to to operate for
devices to operate on the network and
they Institute they introduced another
layer of difficulty into the software
upgrade process which is why you had
people with the Galaxy Nexus on verizon
wireless ostensibly it's a Nexus device
they should be getting updates right
away waiting months for the latest
version of Android yeah they're still on
honeycomb are they yeah I mean that's
what it felt like carrying the Galaxy
Nexus LTE so when the nexus 4 came out
we didn't see support for for CDMA
networks and I think everyone kind of
assigned that the reasoning for that to
the whole disaster that unveiled on
folder with the guys and axis we also
didn't see support for LTE it's all
right which was a very frustrating and
as you go ahead and buy the nexus 4 of
among other reasons but I have it yeah
you know but but sprint is rumored now
in these rumors are I think very
credible right this is from efflux
reporting that the sprint Nexus 5 does
exist which means that a nexus 5 only
not only with LTE obviously but with
cdma support exists so my question to
you guys is do you think we'll see the
same disaster happen this time with
nexuses that are waiting on months for
updates if flying in the face of the
whole Nexus program Tony what do you
think no I don't think so i think that
they have learned especially that the
they have skipped one Nexus device and
they had a little bit of time to read
all the complaints from from customers
and possible future customers which
decided not to be customers because of
the skip the nexus 4 and with the
complaints from the Galaxy Nexus now so
bottom line I think they have learned
and I think the nexus 5 the cdma version
will indeed BTW is your words
true Nexus hmm ciao do you agree no of
course it's excuse me it's early in the
morning here it's nice when an editor
can disagree with his editorial director
so blatant and on the face oh you agree
with me if you want beer disagreeing
with your managing editor yeah I don't
know what your titles were max s sleep
Joe Levi my main boss guy Tony so I
agree with where Tony's going um I think
Google has learned a lesson I think that
they're going to do everything they can
to make sure that this is a smooth and
and unfair it's a true Nexus experience
however sprint and verizon and really
that's pretty much the only carriers
that we're talking about that are still
cdma are notorious for having the most
lockdown network and especially when we
talk verizon one of the most locked down
approval processes for letting anything
at all ever touch their networks they're
cdma networks verizon finds himself in
an interesting situation with their
whole LTE 700 megahertz spectrum that
they signed a contract with the federal
government that apparently they didn't
read that said they had to keep it open
but that's kind of made them a little
bit more open than they would have
otherwise like to be in my opinion so
there's that part now over to my article
that I'm pimping the crap out of today
he has teased article in history I know
isn't it great I didn't mention this in
the article because it really wasn't
applicable to that article but it's
applicable here the Snapdragon 800 comes
in four different individual chipsets
the one that we are going to see Wow
yeah the one that we are going to see in
the in the traditional Nexus 5 here is
the 89-74 which has the LTE radio is
built into it okay the 8674 has they're
cdma radio in it so that's what we're
going to be seeing I would assume in the
sprint version and presumably if there
ever is one
in the verizon version as well I'm
wondering if they'll just not do verizon
because verizon is LTE and they'll just
go with a mini tablet you know get the
LTE version but who knows man you know
what that's a lot of acronyms it's a lot
of letters and numbers and yeah yeah I
want to talk about candy before we go
there though yeah well it's just good I
don't worry angry he said before are you
gonna Taylor Martin onion that's all
right no pastor ed Tony what are your
thoughts on on what we haven't covered
yet so i wanna i wanna slightly
calculate even though i hate numbers and
i'm sure you guys also do hate members
but just bear with me for a second yeah
now as if my memory serves me well the
latest numbers reported for sales as far
as the nexus 4 was concerned were dated
back in May when we heard something
along the lines of 3 million so if we
extrapolate to today let's say Google
and LG soul together a total amount of
56 million devices now if if there is a
certain growth like there has been in
the best for the Nexus brand it is safe
to assume that in a year within the year
of the Nexus 5 LG on Google will sell
probably around the lines of 10 million
devices just for the sake of example
okay now refresh my memory guys how much
does the g two retail for oh gosh the
retail price on that thing has got to be
599 at least in the States okay let's
say just just five minutes just five and
we are being gentlemen so Google is
google is covering about one hundred and
fifty dollars out of those costs because
basically the Nexus 5 is the G 2 minus
the probably slightly smaller sensor on
the camera now if you extrapolate that
to 10 million devices that's a lot of
money so my question to you guys is is
Google winning or losing on the Nexus
lineup specifically on the Nexus 5 you
mean like financially yeah i think that
the nexus story for them is the exact
same thing as the motorola story for
them it's a thing that they're they're
perfectly willing to lose money on in
terms of the hardware sure and they have
where to lose from just like Microsoft
can lose money with Nokia and so on but
but if you just take the Nexus brand out
of the entire googled context do you
think it's a profitable thing or do you
think that it is an accepted loss just
because they want to push the nexus
brand forward that that's it that's what
I think I really don't think I think
they're accepting that and in fact
accepting it with glee because they're
getting a lot of look at what we're
talking about this is entire podcast
dedicated to talk about the new Nexus
people are so worked up over this thing
because the tech media is so worked up
over this thing and the Nexus brand
continues to be pushed further and
further from its roots as a developer
centric thing to more of a consumer eyes
thing and all that does is boost
androids cachet and it's you know war
with the other platforms and it also
advances the cause of the platform
developmentally because you have a whole
lot more people out there you do yeah so
I think they're totally willing to lose
money on this it doesn't because i hate
numbers and i'm not particularly good
with them i fired up my calculator and
in my example losing one hundred and
fifty dollars on every unit 410 million
units is one and a half billion dollars
and that's a lot of money to lose yeah
but you know that what do they make
their making it back on all the extra
all the a bowl ads all services right
yeah yeah yep and the ads and everything
yes absolutely yeah i think i think in a
net sense they're definitely profiting
rather extremely from these units by the
end of their operational lifetimes mmm
ok so my thoughts on it google doesn't
want to lose money their business the
the whole if you guys didn't know this
businesses around to make money that's
what they do they're not a charity so
yeah deep wisdom from jodi android guy
here how about that so are they losing
money on the hardware of the nexus for
the nexus 5 in the short term possibly
so but when you look at it you know like
like Michael was was going you've got a
whole bunch more to factor into that and
that's the the revenue stream that they
get from advertising partners and
whatnot the entire time that you own an
Android so once you factor that in even
if you're just factoring that in the
life cycle of that individual device
I've got to assume that they're at least
breaking even
and by that I don't mean you know just
zero net some there they're making all
the money that they need to be
profitable enough to show shareholders
this is okay you know we're not throwing
money down a black hole here they are
showing an operating profit that's that
may be nominal but it's it's enough to
to continue it let them eat behavior
there for 10 seconds and what about the
LG are they losing money with this or
are they getting exactly what they are
requiring from google I think LG is
getting exactly what they need you know
they they're selling their product to
them at cost you know it and that cost
includes all the overhead and everything
they need to keep the lights on and pay
the employees so they're making what
they need to to be able to sell to them
they're there again in it to make money
so there even though they're from Korea
Koreans like making money two guys okay
it seems to be a universal thing but we
shouldn't we shouldn't underestimate the
the fact that LG also needs this kind of
mindshare push to especially in the
States I you know I i'm not saying LG is
like Sony or Nokia in the States and in
terms of like consumer awareness but
they're not anywhere near where their
competitors are at so they need the you
know kind of grafted on legitimacy of
being the Nexus private and and more
than that more than that let me finish
my other thought and I'll come back to
this is a dovetail together yeah what we
have here is and this is what I think
Google's true intent behind the Nexus
program is and I could be wrong and if
you disagree with me you're welcome to
but then you know you're wrong to the
Nexus program is all about getting
really really good hardware available
and out there at an affordable price not
just for us the geeks not just for us
the end users but to show everyone else
to show motorola which i know is google
to show HTC to show sony to show samsung
you can make really really high-end
stuff for lower price and still be
profitable still make money and not not
have to charge the same Apple
like prices just because it's a samsung
or just because it's an HTC the good
Hardware can be had at lower prices and
by doing that we're seeing it with the
nexus 7 they're forcing the prices down
so that's good for everyone all around
now back to the point you were making
with with legitimacy LG is a small name
in the smartphone industry shirt they've
been making consumer electronics for
every well in the States there had their
small and smartphone they're not smut
globally their their relative largest
like shipper of stuff yeah right so once
we start looking to that I think it has
less to do with legitimacy because LG as
a name and as a company i think has
plenty of legitimacy getting the name
out there is a smartphone maker that's
what they're working on right now but
that's also an entirely different
production line production fabrication
blah blah blah it's different than make
and say a dvd-rom drive which they make
as well by the way so when you start
looking at that you've got economies of
scale to factor in the more products
they make that are based off of their g2
which this is pretty similar just like
the Nexus 4 was to the previous one
whatever if not nasty you've got
economies of scale the more stuff they
can pump down that production line the
less expensive it is per unit for them
to run stuff down that production line
and that helps not only them make more
profit but it also helps keep the cost
down so to both of you especially to
Michael who talked about the mindshare
that LG needs here's a quote quote the
Nexus 4 was a great success despite the
production problems for us and Google
however we do not need such a marketing
success again do you know who said this
know who said that said LG's Vice
President Kim Juan really and that was
back in May when there were rumors about
LG making the Nexus 5 of course LG gun
came a record and they said that it was
misinterpreted and the new statement was
that what mr. want Kim said is that we
are not currently working on the Nexus 5
which is true but that doesn't mean we
would
turn down the opportunity so this this
what this translates to me in as early
all she does not need a little anymore
well that's of course and i would
absolutely say that too if I were you
know I mean they don't need it but
they're not gonna turn it down and it's
gonna help both of them III really think
it's it's a mutually beneficial
arrangement which is why they've done it
now for two generations in a row it you
know to to the chagrin of old fogies
like me like other other designs but
yeah what you know this is stuff that
we're going to be able to dissect going
forward Joe I think you have a very good
good grasp on the business realities of
the situation Tony I completely agree
that statements from the company are
important I just don't never believe
them not just from LG from anyone it's
all it's all corporate face-saving and
so on alright so breaking news since I
know this is the podcast and you know
breaking news is completely relevant oh
absolutely yeah yeah following a night
rose at n1 TR 0 z who by the way thinks
it's awesome that we're mentioning him
on the podcast so you know I'm hoping
he's blushing right now he has said that
he's seeing rumors from various sources
that we're going to see a release at 8am
which is now 45 minutes from the time
we're recording this yeah of the Nexus 5
so you know about an hour after we've
published this it will have been so or
an hour so by the time people get at
this time time in the but guests like 50
minutes in is already so no but what's
gonna happen know what's gonna happen is
by the time people get to this point the
podcasts are going to be four hundred
fifty thousand stories across the
internet saying Nexus 5 misses another
deadline I don't think I think that
various sources that you were citing Joe
I don't know if they exist i don't think
that night rosie was was talking about
any particular sources there she
mentioned did he go back to the carphone
warehouse to do some more flirting let
me tell you some words of wisdom for
myself what I personally and truly
believe is that the last year's Nexus
announcement was a silent press release
announcement because of the hurricane
and I don't think that Google wants to
repeat that given the fact that the
nexus is for the five is so important
that they have apparently leaked it all
over the internet themselves for the
past four months so what I think is that
this week we will not see announcement
it will be probably next week and it
will be an announcement with mbytes and
since we don't have invites yet we will
not see anything this week but they
might prove me wrong but this is what I
believe in we'll see well yeah I was
afraid you were gonna say there was
gonna be another hurricane I'm like
those guys are still digging out in the
last one yeah man can't be having one of
those again to all my friends and out
there in the Nuge or technique wow I
almost said New Jersey New Jersey I've
been watching too much british comedy to
everyone in New Jersey and on the East
Coast who was affected by that wow we
know that you're still struggling with
that that was later by the way we stand
with you a year later I want to say
before we head out on on hardware here
that the that phone arena is has posted
about three hours ago that a nexus 5 has
been torn down and these are not blurry
cam photos these are this is a tear down
that has been documented with really
really nice photography from fanatic
phone.com yes did we Tony w do we repost
this no not just yet oh yeah so I'm
looking at these images right now which
I will go ahead and drop in there for
you and listeners once we once we get
our piece reposted on this you will be
able to see it I'll drop it in the
description but i'm looking at a twenty
three hundred million power battery as
we were saying before and see a lot of
components that people who get the tiny
camera talk about and the tiny little
camera sensors so i'm gonna call it the
Tony camera from now on I think Tony see
this is the only thing this is why I
think Tony that we are more likely to
see a launch in the near very near
future than I am one like even a week
from now is because all this stuff is
popping up at a feverish right now and
there's actually stock in stores which
we know now so I I just don't see stock
sitting in stores for for a week waiting
for a launch here and I they could send
out the invite
Friday for a Tuesday event they could
but doesn't November first sound like a
like a like a Google day to do like
doesn't now like they did it well
they've done before it was oh well guys
look at this kit kats our little teeny
straight things right there she rate
candies like 11 1 uh-huh get out like
get low get off the show going wow I'm
gonna go have some candy am I missing
something yeah there's been a whole like
batch of conspiracy theories like trying
to find like little Easter nails in
there oh yes the reaso skipped let's
look yeah let's let's talk about that
before Tony Tony's got to get it apart
and what about 90 seconds Tony so two
minutes all right before you head out
the door I want you to tell us so let's
pivot is software here tell us what your
your favorite things that you're looking
forward to an Android KitKat for that
for our well um I will give you a very
politician like answer because Android
in its 4.2 in his 4.3 iteration even 4.2
do that one and two is good it's it
answers all my needs whether it's God
sends touch with or anything else on top
of it it is fast thankfully and we are
no longer seeing laggy phones except the
fewer samsung tablet but still so for me
personally android for that for doesn't
have to bring anything it is already
enjoyable and that's that's important
for me but what what there will be I
predict it will be nothing major it will
be just a point a bit like we've seen
the last 4.2 update it will bring some
new features to the table some tweaks
maybe in the user user interface just
like the transparent notification shade
and stuff like that just small light
weeks and then Google will be bringing a
huge overall with five point oh that's
it that's not a bad perspective and I
think with Google's increasing shift
toward delivering new features in terms
of individual packages rather than total
Android point upgrades it's reasonable
to assume that for that for is going to
be quite similar to what we already have
I agree yeah I can't disagree with
that Tony I would love to get into some
more stuff but I would also love to get
you off the air in an expeditious manner
because you have business to deal with
thank you very much for being here for
inviting me and hope to talk to you guys
next time with the nexus 5 on the market
which i'm not saying i hopes talk to you
guys in two months tomorrow the nexus 5
on the market that sounds good we are
gonna be doing a pocket a live tomorrow
is that correct there will be one
whatever Google decides to bring it Oh
Devon no not an editorial round round
table but a regular pocket a library the
live is here to stay alright excellent
well i will see you on the live tomorrow
then sir absolutely guys have an awesome
awesome show thanks Tony ok see you
matter Joe what were you gonna say uh
something about how Tony's brilliant and
a way he's not listening anymore is he
no and he's not gonna listen past the
past the point where a two-part either
see no I was I was just looking at these
pictures and by the way if you haven't
if you're listening to this head over to
pocketnow.com at the article and look at
michael's link for these this nexus 5
tear down that earphone little grill
thing wow that looks stylish and nice
hmm I didn't see that hey shut up it's
an extra seven out of 10 for people who
like style and simplicity okay
information out there ya know that's it
so all right we're supposed to be
talking about a kid cat but there's not
a lot to talk about until we know more
so I just don't like no this is what I'm
talking about Joe like there's this
whole philosophy that I understand
completely that the software is what we
want to showcase particularly with a
nexus product so the hardware needs to
get out of the way the software and the
tree just needs to be a window into the
software experience fine I understand
that and I respect it but I don't like
it at all I think the hardware plays
such a crucial part of the device
experience not just because you have to
physically hold something to view the
software but like it should play very
nicely with you with your ecosystem of
other hardware that you've bought it
should exist in the real world in a way
that's significant and in my opinion
cool and you just don't see that
the Nexus 5 it doesn't excite me from
what I've seen so far it just kind of
looks very very commonplace and
understated well get one taking on a
boat and sit on it and you'll be fine
you'll be happy I get what you're saying
and I completely agree we're not talking
about hardware we're not talking about
software at the end of the day we're
talking about a total user experience
and that total user experience is the
totality it's the completeness of
whatever this thing is until we can get
into into the whole Pandora of look at
me i'm using my hands to illustrate what
i'm talking about on the podcast I'll do
it closer the microphone so everyone can
see and until we get virtual reality
where the hardware is literally
invisible as far as the the interaction
with the interface goes literally
literally invisible it's not even there
it's literally so we get to cloak phones
yes it is essential well not even phones
here but if we're talking to some kind
of device Google glass is kind of a step
in that direction where you've got yes
you've got hardware but you're looking
at the interface through the hardware as
if the hardware weren't even there
you're interacting with it with with
touches and with voice and with all this
other stuff and with what's going on
around you until we do that yes the
hardware is a vital component of this
but at the same time it needs to be
simple it needs to be elegant it needs
to just work and do what it's supposed
to do and enable that software
experience without detracting from it
but like you were saying it's also got
the you're holding this thing that's a
huge part of the whole user experience
that tactile experience has to be there
so one of the reasons why i love the
nexus 4 so much it's got those rounded
edges and i hate that i can't put a
screen protector on it without ruining
that nice bevel into an out that rounded
screen even though it's it's an up brown
not a down round that concave convex
whatever those fancy words are
yeah I wish my when I take our money but
that was just that little subtlety that
subtlety right there well was enough to
Tim just make the device feel good to me
and I get what you're saying to me the
nexus for it was was the beginning of
the downfall actually for me I hate last
back absolutely well of course you do
because you shattered yours too now no
not my wife did what I did one oh god
you broke to him well well your wife
what fun here's the thing yeah but well
you know hey you know you're together in
marriage or together in blames right
yeah okay no but uh join it before the
Nexus right but the for the nexus 4 look
what we had the nexus one which was
probably one of the more understated
Nexus devices but because it brought so
many groundbreaking specs it was a it
didn't need to be crazy and like it was
a first gigahertz processor device if I
recall or one of the first Elise and at
a cool light up glowing travel right
exactly people love to just glom that
thing all the time that's a nice set off
right so that's like oh this is very
cool when you had the was the nexus s
after that we don't speak of that no but
all right now I know you don't like the
next I know a lot of people don't like
it but for me I loved it you had this
big old blob on the bottom that that was
like that was like a reverse chin and
you had a curved glass over the display
listen i loved it i thought that thing
was cool looking I thought it was
special it was definitely special but I
thought it was really cool looking and
really really awesome and then you had
to kind of the evolution of that design
with the Galaxy Nexus which kind of
conventionalized it a little bit made it
a little safer which I didn't like but
that would that was actually the
beginning have you had this thing as ok
well the nexus s was exciting and bold
and this is kind of like well it's like
not as bold but I mean it's cool so by
one and all have you know I have four in
the nexus 4 is what you were talking
about yes it's joe i get your that you
like that it's subtle and awesome but
you have to look so closely at it i
don't know I just like Boulder choices
that's why you have cases you can
bedazzle it out old cases are lame I
agree so yeah I absolutely hated the
Nexus S I didn't use it I skipped that
generation entirely on not because of
that out
side not because of the tactile
interface but because it was so slow and
just underpowered fraud I needed to be
it was an embarrassment to the Nexus
name the Galaxy Nexus on the other hand
yes it got rid of some of that boldness
it's got a lot more subtle a lot more
streamlined and I am running three of
those in the house today my two teenage
kids and my wife are all running galaxy
Nixie and they're running just fine and
absolutely love them she's running stock
and they are running I believe
cyanogenmod 10.1 point 3 after the old
man I love ya island it's great it does
what they need to do its industrial
enough that it survives the rigors of
life in a teenager's pocket not on a
boat yeah well I said a teenager not
someone who looks like a teacher I'm a
teenage heart okay somebody called me
although they don't like it was when I
was interviewing Marquez and like some
commenters before I permabanned him and
deleted him and sent an assassin after
him you can't call me old man use so you
guys should get taylor martin to talk to
marquez michael fisher is too old what
are you talking get out of here yeah but
old are you I don't know I'm 22 23 or
something yeah and I'm 24 good see there
you go ya know exactly so let's talk
about Kit Kat before we move on to misc
um we've talked a lot about the about
misc already but for dot for thought for
God wait hold on a second speaking of
that life not 540 for now five but for
dot for speaking of taylor martin he is
he is prompt btdubs i'm adding under the
call we it just doesn't feel right chest
we can't badmouth him while bringing him
on and it's right that's exactly right
it didn't feel right to have his ears
burn infra nervous hello Martin Oh
welcome welcome back to the pocket now
weekly and Tony just had to leave us so
you're our substitute for 20 minutes you
are live and on the air so don't say
anything that'll embarrass this is 0 NE
curson well I am swimming here ironing a
shirt well that sounds very lovely we
have to walk my dog using my built-in
microphone on my
macbook ooh yeah yeah yeahs sound you
just gonna say like you're reporting
from the field you didn't you sound
blue-ish but it's not as cool as
reporting from a bus stop right Sam it's
not as cool as reporting from broken
down hooters but let's let's let's stick
with it Taylor you can go anyway today
just wanted a view here for a second
what no no no I I wanted to ask about
Taylor's thoughts on Android for that
form we've talked about the nexus 5
Hardware ad nauseum and a lot yeah and
we've also talked about this kind of
philosophical shift in Google from doing
point upgrades with massive waves of
updates to this kind of prepackaged
thing where it's like okay we're going
to update this one component and push it
out separately so but it given all that
Taylor what are you most looking forward
to from from the KitKat / nexus 5
release I mean do we have any sort of
leaks of what it's going to include yeah
and they all are like the most minor
things you can imagine from what I can
tell like the transparent notification
shade and but only on the home screen
right and like quote unquote general
note and UI enhancements yeah and and
that's probably all major updates are
gonna be for Android from about my dog's
drinking water by the way yeah thank you
for that update breaking everyone needs
to drink what if you're not drinking
water while you're listening to our
podcast wrong with that so I mean mmm
it's not like pee drinks quietly no no
that's true it's definitely so but so ya
know continue continue yeah so I mean I
think you're most of the now he's eating
food I'm sorry he just decided one one
more one more dog update and your we're
hanging up on you I figured most of the
updates are gonna be UI changes and
improvements more so than polish yea it
paused rather than you know major
features in and yeah they're gonna
integrate some new features who knows
what maybe i don't know like joe said
and this prompts that i've yet to
publish it's about to go that looks
beautiful by the way Tim pimp right
there oh the collaborative piece on
whatever but we want our smartphones to
do yes yeah thanks
see ya you were talking about how you
wish your phone could anticipate what
you're going to do next and I think to
an extent they already do that was as
part of a tragic butter correct where it
kind of wraps up in anticipation it
doesn't anticipate what you're going to
do but it anticipates when you're gonna
do something right yeah yeah so we've
already got kind of the framework the
foundation laid for this anticipatory
stuff especially with you know and I
didn't even think about bringing a
project butter but you know your ambient
processors is where I was thinking but
you're absolutely correct we have the
ability now to be aware and to get ready
for stuff now all we gotta do is figure
out what to get ready for cuz the stuff
that I'm getting come on it's not me if
this is what you're telling advertisers
that this is what I like and they're
paying you for it wow I'm in the wrong
business yeah future addictions where
the money is at exactly yeah come on we
need to get Miss Cleo there we go and
Android five is going to be uh with Miss
Cleo there is broken a site for those of
you who don't know Miss Cleo I I
remember miss cleo from my youth yes yes
indeed looking for this one you're 23
right Michael right okay it's like
yesterday that's exactly right I'm still
in the midst of my youth exactly I'm 23
Taylor Martin's like 15 so I was gonna
rethink our Las Vegas drinking plans so
guys oh yeah we won't do that good the
hat says it all and it helps to to cover
in KitKat before we kind of move on i
just want to tailor and you can feel
free to i know you gotta like put on
that shirt you're ironing and like go do
things so Joe and I are about to jump in
the listener mail but before I let you
off the hook what what is your number
one most favorite thing that you're
looking forward to from the nexus 5 as a
whole Oh Nexus 5 stock Android with a
Snapdragon 800 chill yeah I was one of
the first things we covered absolutely
yeah I mean somehow we've seen we've
seen what the Snapdragon 800 could do
for TouchWiz
if you've seen the note 3 not necessary
well note 3 review and the note 10.1
review the note 3 that I had was
snapdragon 800 had zero lag the thing
was just flying through everything all
you could throw at it I had six
applications running at once and it just
odd in touch with ya down and then I
switch over to the note 10.1 with the
engine ozi pasa yeah and it's just a
blag blag you open ok you can have a pin
windows with one of the floating windows
on the home screen and try to scroll
through the home screen and it just is
you could hear gears turning yeah so
when I think your vibration owner needs
some service you might wonderful
warranty repair that without that big
that giant software footprints thawing
everything down in even though it didn't
slow anything down on your note 3 by the
way I take issue with your claim I've
managed to slow down my Snapdragon 03
but didn't know no you didn't yeah but
it without that all of that TouchWiz
like gumming up the works there I agree
I've stock android on Snapdragon 800
just sounds absurdly responsive to me I
I would be very surprised dicta vol most
yeah let us fight the home screen and
before you touch the screen it's like
Don yeah welcome guys again more than
that before you go to swipe the home
screen it's woken itself up read your
email sent the responses and ordered you
pizza for lunch you talk abou this is
crazy Chuck right there this is like my
friend my roommate not talking about the
mac for a new mac pro oh yeah the bigger
Catholic anybody ever need that and
that's it well I could use it for video
editing because my export times will be
dramatically improved click on yeah and
and you can use it to throw garbage in
beautiful true yes um my question is do
you guys think this is this is I lied
before the teller this is the last thing
I'm going to ask you do you guys think
that for dot for is going to bring any
measurable improvement to the Google now
voice interface experience I know they
just redid it in with the Moto X but I
there people saying already that they're
hearing
different voice with Google now as of
this morning that it's smoother that is
more human I don't care if that I really
don't because I mean it's not like it's
gonna fool anybody you know I don't get
the point but needing sound more human
but did I I don't think sound more human
is the important part I think being able
to address it contextually like being
able to address it in a more casual
fashion rather yo google know like not
like the trigger word can be the same
but like it's up my Nexus homes it's
just like it no it's just in the sense
of like you know take take me home then
knowing that it wants to navigate it
wants you to navigate that it wants you
for it what have you put a horrible
sentence if you know it's reading it and
said take me home it would start singing
to you or something yeah like John
Denver take me home no but Syria do that
though I mean you tell Siri to take me
home and Syria like understands that
that phrase like Google now is still
lacking in terms of address ability i
think yes so so common language both
asked questions and spoken responses
that's the big thing right there's the
spoken response that's got a long way to
go on both sides and you know Google+
Google now whatever they're calling it
it's sure absolutely yes they need more
they're more conversational you can ask
follow-up questions to Google now yeah
and and that's cool unless you wait too
long and then it forgets everything and
you look like an idiot when you're
trying to show off to your friends so
they got to work on that because come on
Google don't make me look like an idiot
that's not cool yeah thought everybody
was what the past week my Moto X has
failed me every time I've said ok Google
now all that's sleeping and asked you
the question it says couldn't recognize
retrial well as weird mine has not done
that or no have you tried turning it off
and back on again yes i have also i want
their friends with who yes i know it is
clear watching it yet that's one of the
big guy going through this episode is IT
Crowd it's wonderful that's right all
right but taylor get back to making that
shirt wrinkle free and we
we'll probably be seeing you for a big
ol news blessed and a little bit if if
this lady you know at ninth time is the
charm so maybe this news blast will be
accurate well the face steep in a video
wait well we'll see what's going on I
think ap is finally reporting on this
now according to two breaking news
source night Rosie so it's god we should
start charging them for them these are
inside for quitter pimping I love this
this is great this ma'am I just wish we
broadcast live we're gonna be
broadcasting live soon we found a client
so anyway should we say should we just
drop hints that we're looking for new
VIPs to feature on the show no no we
shouldn't we already have a list that
would give es hopes up way to every time
we do a VIP we get 40 million
suggestions and I'm like oh some of
these are really awesome Stephen Hawking
Stephen Hawking somebody wanted to get
flossy carter on the show and then i had
forgotten about flush starter for a
minute i'm like oh yes we got to do that
then i'm actually not at all being
sarcastic like I really offered Ricardo
oh well yeah well I'm naturally we got
to get the doctor Taylor Martin go away
we'll talk to you later goodbye I want
to thank you for coming on the show for
real we'll we'll see you next week yeah
whatever yeah give us some Southern
drawl before you go don't do it don't
I'm tired of it I don't know site yeah I
heard of it oh look at this I can hang
all that work hbu this is magic I can
hang up on Taylor and this is great what
is waiting for I just don't feel right
oh now I feel right okay he's gone it
doesn't make that satisfying clunk sound
doesn't it doesn't I can't snap shut a
flip phone than I don't want to do so
we're you know I think we're scraping
the bottom of the barrel on kitchen no
we don't before we go listener mail
before we go Lister mail I wasn't gonna
go to listen to me I was gonna talk
about hey go read my article on why I
like the Flex better than this nexus cuz
that's where I was going you were
hitting towards reader Marilyn like no I
want to know why you like the LG G flex
more than the nexus 5 there's gotta be
at least three reasons why and i got i
was just gonna point you to like a text
piece that like i have three very well
defined reasons why when the picture of
George Bush scratching his head very
important gotta gotta gotta have that
beautiful now the the Nexus 5
is this is exactly what I was talking
about before and just I can't move the
headline from misc so I just will say
that I think LG has done some cool stuff
in the past LG is a cool company that
has managed to surprise me several times
good yeah I mean it's it's cool they're
not doing it with a nexus 5 I mean it's
it's it's shut up it's very it's a very
conventional you know the progression of
their design concept for the four but
look at this flex yes it's gonna be a
pain to carry in your pocket maybe um
yes it's probably gonna sit on a
tabletop wonky yes before with the
before you continue I've just gotta
clarify mm-hmm is your buttocks curved
hey man yeah man oh yeah big craze is
the phone curved phones curved do you
not see a perfect marriage of buttocks
and phone right but like if you like
like super imposed the curve of the flex
over like a buttock like that that would
have to be a buttock the size of Arizona
no no no there's no there's no there's
no buttock size comparison on that I
just like saying buttock anyway Jessica
Alba come what well see that's the thing
like for regular butts you have to have
a have like a curve of like 30 degrees
for that for a phone so that wouldn't
work but you know put it in your thigh
pocket whatever the galaxy round to be
better for that but this the Flex
adheres to the curve of her equates to
the curve of your face your cheek yes
yes and that's what it's designed to do
exactly and so so help me out here and
like this is what it's doing what the
nexus s did that i liked its being
different and doing so in a smart way
like in my opinion the galaxy round is
different just for the sake of being
different because it's a prototype that
they build to prove they could do it at
giving that's basically what did what
the couch around is it's curved the
wrong way who's gonna want to use that
no one it's bizarre is what it is yeah
if it were a tablet is he a key being
curved that way yeah you know but the
Flex is exactly like we talked about
last week or the week before whatever it
was like it does the same thing the
original pre does where you you slid
open the original pre in it assumed this
banana shape there was also a motorola
phone that did that like a sliver or
a riser modification the other visor do
i yeah like the slider version of the
sliver and except this one like it had
this accordion style thing so when you
slid the screen up the keypad would
accordion town and it would lock into a
position like a banana phone shape and
it was awesome I've loved that thing
banana banana phone so anyway as this
how this relates the Nexus 5 is once
again as with the g two LG as shown that
they're capable of doing interesting
stuff and bold stuff but they don't want
to make that bold choice because it
intelligently I understand it's a smart
choice because they're doing it for of a
wide swath of consumers and they don't
want to take a risk that big that people
are gonna look at a flex phone and be
like that's stupid cuz I'm yeah because
I just look at the comments on that
article like some people like it some
people don't the people that don't
really like amped on the fact that they
don't like things like okay to two
questions what how many people do you
think you're going to take this thing
and whether well they're probably not
going to do it sober in a drunken state
hand it to their friend or themselves
try and flex this thing and snap it in
half how many people do you think are
going to do that and is that going to be
covered by warranty because it doesn't
really flex first question no people are
not going to know that people it's not
gonna be covered by warranty and anybody
who does that deserves what they get I
agree sit on your phone on a boat like
normal people okay that's what we do
okay did the glass impact a buttock
Illaria yeah anyway Japan back to this
so we've got three phones from LG
alright or two and one that we think we
might get some time eventually maybe if
we ever do in 16 minutes maybe any time
ng2 next to sweet guy yeah I got the g2
nexus 5 n G flex ah are they essentially
the same phone now if you take hardware
if you take processor if you take
storage if you take ram if you take
screen resolution and rough screen size
are they the same phone know how is a
difference to the G flex is a six inch
720p panel so it's inferior in
resolution well it's cemetery
HD that aside how about the rest the
specs yeah I'll take a you're bigger
yeah well made point yeah basically the
same lesson is different but yeah yeah
well you've got the samsung button on it
what what oh I'm looking at the samsung
phone now look at that I'm sorry oh I'm
looking at your article I'm to the round
oh lame yeah I confused around with it
it so what are you driving out there
what do you believe I'm not driving at
anything I'm just saying it's
interesting that we're taking the same
the same core makeup if you will the
same processor the same the same
configuration and all we're doing it is
it were wrapping it in different pretty
outsides it's essentially the same phone
just with a different exterior which
goes back to your point from earlier
wouldn't it be nice if they were doing
something bold with it it's the same
phone boom it is yeah just a different
package done beautiful mention Lee dumb
to get out of the way of the software
which i think is fundamentally missing
the point but we've been there before
we've been there we've done that we said
that having having said it I think it's
time we owe our listeners a service that
we two of them actually the first one is
to get off the air so that we can cover
the nexus 5 if it actually launches
second one being to read their listener
mail yes please let's pong bomb the
first one here is oh you don't add the
bong bong in live that's after editing
yeah dematic here i'll throw in a little
bosun's whistle for you there hold out
is beautiful better guys when when
you're on the show you miss out some of
the magic and we do you don't get the
intro outro tunes we had balling horses
their lives did I listen to didn't
leaders that the one before I know it's
too bad that was in the show because
Taylor interrupted me but see this I
problem you get too far away from the
initial announcement of listener mail
then I have to do it again because we
you know it's why on earth would someone
interrupt you dude that's that's easy
that's no time for listener mail
the first one is from John Martin says
hey pocket no team I was wondering what
you guys thoughts are on the possibility
of an unlocked nexus 5 that's both gsm
and cdma and can work on all major
carriers in the states with no contract
sounds like you're talking about a pipe
dream John we saw the new Nexus 7 launch
this year that is capable of being used
on verizon wireless as well as the usual
gsm suspects usually I would doubt this
idea because verizon's a control freak
amen and I think they know best but with
the Nexus 7 I was also hoping of the
same result with the nexus 5 just wanted
to know you guys opinions love the site
really enjoyed this in your podcast
every week keep up the great work John
thank you awesome question thank you
John yes we take a little bit about this
earlier in the show if you skipped right
to listener mail go back and listen to
that but I will admit this I don't have
a new Nexus 7 I've actually not spent
any time with one so I did not know that
the nexus 7 the new Nexus having also
supported verizon and other carriers but
is what's yeah but isn't that just what
are you surprised about my surprise they
don't know yeah well tell me about that
but is it is it it's not just LTE its
LTE and HSPA and cdma data no alright so
what is it to the best of my knowledge
it's it's LTE it's just LTE i if I'm
wrong then I'm I'm probably disappointed
that I still can't use it with tmobile
to be able to test it because of reasons
that I think t-mobile is stupid for but
no it's it's LTE it's not ze radio and
it's basically that if you've got a
carrier that supports one of the bands
that this device supports do you're
probably good to go you just have to get
us in pop it in and go so I'm looking at
this right now I'm sorry to interrupt
you Joe there's a look no you're not i'm
looking at i'm not i'm looking at the
new nexus 7 in the google play store
right now and I've got options for Wi-Fi
only LTE LTE parentheses gsm networks
LTE with AT&amp;amp;T LTE with t-mobile those
are my only choices I don't see a
verizon option here the LTE LTE
of course just final fer Eisen just pop
in the sim go mmm now when it originally
came out uh yeah that is where gsm
network mmm when it originally came out
it was just LTE there was no three
varieties it came out and it came pre
packaged with a tmobile sim that you
could very quickly and easily fork over
more of your money for to activate and
make work but you couldn't use the sim
out of your cell phone with unlimited
data because that would just be too
wrong apparently what this is this is
just different packaging the LTE
parenthesis gsm networks means it's a
generic one the LTE with AT&amp;amp;T means it
comes prepackaged with an AT&amp;amp;T sim and
then t-mobile is the same thing please
if I'm wrong here is someone who has
verizon let me know you should be able
to just pop your verizon LTE sim into
your really any one of those gonna fire
ipad sims on verizon they've popped in
the next seven to work but there was
some there was a kerfuffle back in
September about verizon not certifying
the nexus 7 for its network and then
kind of delaying that shuffling its feet
and there was a lot of news on that so
anyway it does work though so I think
that's the end of the bottom of it and
when you think about that possibility
and you think about incorporating that
into a nexus 5 with cdma radio with the
gsm radio with LTE radios it's just you
know that that's that's the big problem
you need that voice support because all
we're talking about here is verizon LTE
right with the Nexus 7 we're not talking
about cdma data and Bradley amazed the
problem right exactly and like we
mentioned a little bit earlier in the
show that's a different version of the
800 it differs in the Snapdragon 800 yes
to include cdma yes it's got a different
chipset so there it is John I mean you
know the it would be lovely for to have
a gsm and cdma Nexus 5 we know where we
don't know but we suspect strongly that
there will be a sprint Nexus 5 which
means that there's Nexus 5 that will
support cdma whether or not thats
verizon cdma has yet to be seen but well
print those chair cdma bands i mean it's
nineteen hundred and eight hundred and
that's it it's only LTE where they were
verizon gets weird and and such but go
back to the the galaxy nexus yeah we had
we had separate devices for both of them
we may or may not have the same thing
here yeah so it's John it would be great
I I don't see that that kind of
simplicity happening until all the
networks are running the same technology
and and when that happens I think
there's gonna be a whole lot of other
stuff to worry about so yeah it did to
put it all in a nutshell we've got we
got two things happening and one may
happen before the other and the other
may not happen at all we've got gsm
weave got cdma as voice networks and
they are separate and will always be
separate we have chips that are kind of
hybridizing and some of them support
both cdma and gsm not many do just
because that's kind of a unholy marriage
but just weird I feel we're just saying
it maybe it's because it's Halloween but
you've got that you know obviously if
you can do one thing on one chip and
make one chip that handles two things
you're going to save money as a chip
manufacturer so yeah the desire to do
that is there absolutely on the other
side we've got LTE and we've got voice
over LTE and we've got that path that is
coming it's not here yet you may have a
few pockets where you may be able to do
it with the right hardware blah blah
blah not here yet but we're going down
that direction as well I think the
writing's on the wall LTE is the future
voice over LTE is most likely going to
be the future since everyone out there
sprint and verizon included support LTE
to me it seems like the natural
convergence is going to be everybody has
LTE and everybody does voice over LTE
and that way you have one unified
chipset and there is holy matrimony a
beautiful future I we got it we got to
move on no I wanted to blabber more
we have android police now saying that
the that after speaking with no less
than five different sources with not old
less than five no less than five this is
artem russo kofsky is ready to confirm
that the lg-made nexus 5 should be
unveiled later on today seven today
October thirty-first along with Android
for dad for KitKat additional details
which were leaked last night by former
wsj reporter Amir efrati that's cool
Amir good guy we're thinking of we're
sitting there seeing a major wallet
announcement is likely this is all from
Android plants calm by the way major
wallet is hearing the embargo is
officially lifting at 11am Pacific which
would be that's lunchtime mountain time
it is and it's lunch time eastern time
to feed a little later and been around
lunch lunch time wherever you are so
this is weird that if the the embargo is
lifting purportedly at 11am pacific but
the announcement and possible Play Store
available it could come earlier should I
make any sense to me no I see that
because they want to have the exclusive
on it you know here we go have their own
exclusive yeah I mean come on you
haven't seen any leaks they're holding
this really tight to the belt they do
they want to be the ones to break this
not now websites and stuff no I guess I
guess we'll see and I'm just adding our
break news sources to the description so
people can click on these when they
listen to podcast four days after this
thing is dropped and it's all irrelevant
let's move on to work out pieces mr.
mail Joe read the one from Stephen Toth
King if you would Stephen Toth King
rights hey pocket now team I'd like to
thank the whole team for the great job
that you're doing white Thank You
Stephen we try it it's what we do there
are some experts in the team so well
that's Dana primarily me so maybe you
can so maybe you can answer my question
regarding processors is the Snapdragon
800 really that much better than the s4
yes I'm asking because the Nexus 5 is
rumored to have the 800 I sure hope it
will but I can't get the
I cheaply from the play store in my
country I I hear you there dude and I
hate that so don't complain to me I'm on
your side so I'm not sure whether it's
worth the upgrade or not thanks for your
and thirst even talk king who has a ba
three in psychology I'm hungry is
attending the University yeah so what
that means I thought it said yeah I
don't think so but anyway Stephen
whatever the case Stephen thank you for
writing in cho just thank you to us in
brief why the 800 is better than the s4
in brief we're going to go back in time
yes the s4 pro and the s4 Prime were the
they were the bee's knees this time last
year we didn't really see the s4 Prime
anywhere I didn't suspect that we would
everybody had the s4 pro or one of the
the smaller brothers to that and it was
great time is fast and technology has
improved and those improvements have
been bundled into the latest generation
of processors the Snapdragon x-hundred
series and that's a term I'm coining the
400 600 800 they are the new versions of
the s4 pro and they are all and okay
maybe not the majority of them are
significantly better than the s4 pro to
the tune of just raw processing power
we're talking seventy-five percent
faster with it some people are reporting
forty percent better battery life so
you're getting a significant jump in
speed you're getting all kinds of new
features and benefits that you know the
s4 pro could do but it wasn't optimized
for them and didn't do them nearly as
fast so is it worth it yes absolutely
yes there is no doubt yes is it worth
the premium in your country I don't know
what the premium is in your country so
that's something you're going to have to
decide on your own in in the States
absolutely yes in the states plus 200
bucks I think so in the states plus 400
bucks and probably then it starts to
fall apart yeah yeah so that's the
subjective you know think you've got to
decide for yourself but is it worth the
price well it's definitely worth the
upgrade
it's just up to you whether it's worth
the cost in your country or not there
you go that's it's even that is a
awesome question and I'm glad we had Joe
and they are to answer it for you as he
answered it better than anyone else
could well in that article that's on the
side today baby speaking of things being
on the site today we really have to wrap
this up because we have to push this
thing out the door before the before
anymore nexus 5 new drops because the
wellbore the Nexus 6 is announced right
exactly where we're running running out
of time every second with last question
from Michael loved loved the podcast
thank you sir if someone was looking to
get into Android would you recommend
nexus 5 or Samsung Galaxy s4 Michael
loft sent from my iphone 5 another
defector Michael thank you for your
question this is a very good question i
think it's a great one to wrap up the
nexus 5 special edition podcast on I
think Joey I feel like I know your
answer so I'm going to go ahead and say
mine first absolutely the Nexus 5 yes
the samsung galaxy s4 offers a lot more
in terms of raw feature count but as
we've said a few times on the show
before and in our reviews the samsung
touchwiz feature sweet it is not
complete in that I think a lot of those
features are quite half baked and some
of them are just more frustration than
they're worth plus the stock Android
experience you're going to find on the
Nexus 5 is much more akin to I think
what you're used to on your iPhone 5 in
terms of reliability responsiveness and
a unified aesthetic that I think you
will appreciate much much more than you
would touch with so that's my answer the
nexus 5 hands down I didn't even have to
think about it although I did so that's
my answer Joe wow it was like you
pre-planned that or something response
can't read a thing but ahead of time so
this is a question that I've been
receiving a lot and to everyone who I
have already replied to whether that's
by email or some other method I'm sorry
I'm going to give different advice here
so please consider this me updating my
response to all of you the question is
essentially and not just comparing the
nexus 5 in the galaxy s4 which phone
should i get the HTC one the one max
the the galaxy s4 the latest from Sony
etc etc and they throw in the Nexus 5 as
well and my answer has always been
you're comparing the best of everything
anything that you get is going to be
great it just is it's look at the
individual whatever you liked you on a
bigger screen do you want more touch
with stuff do you want some of these
other features they're all essentially
on the same playing field yes some are
faster than others just some are better
than others yes some have front-facing
speakers those are all just little
things but as far as the guts and the
the overall experience goes you're
getting the highest end that you can get
and I have lumped in the Nexus 5 into
that answer as well today I'm changing
that no the Nexus 5 is not akin to the
galaxy s4 it's not akin to the HTC One
anymore it's it's it's not it is the
next step up the only thing I think we
can really compare the Nexus 5 2 is the
Moto X at this point and possibly the
the LG g2 and if you want flexi things
what we already talked about the LG G
flex so those if we're comparing those
the the question gets a lot more
difficult to answer this question nexus
5 or sgs4 get a nexus 5 hands down if
it's going to be released ever get get
that one if you can't wait the hour or
week or month however long it takes to
release it then then go with go with
what you think that the g4 or the sgs4
had too many acronyms it's another bad
device but it's a great device it's a
wonderful device and if you can't tell
I'm just trying to make Michael just say
say wrap it up as many times as foster
their further into the past because
pocket now readers and pocket now
listeners deserve a full-fledged out so
much to do you have so much to do today

get Robert loggia on the podcast just to
say we're out of town
we're outta time you can't handle the
dream I'm out of there so all right
anyway so that is my answer right now
it's a wonderful lead pants answer it's
lovely the nexus 5 get the nexus 5 it's
probably out already if you're listening
