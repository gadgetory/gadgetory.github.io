pocketnow.com and this is part 2 of the
software tour of the new Samsung omnia
in part 1 we took a look at the widget
interface and the multiple home screens
so if you didn't get a look at that I'll
put a link up on the video right now so
you can go back and take a look at that
if you're interested so in this video
we're going to take a look at the whole
TouchWiz interface this is Samsung's
interface that runs on top of Windows
Mobile and for a few moments you're
going to forget that you're using
Windows Mobile because it's so deeply
integrated in this video we're going to
show you the major functions and the
interesting things about the TouchWiz
interface but when the review we're
going to cover every little thing so
let's turn on the device and we get this
unlock screen that you've probably seen
before if you saw the previous video
that we did so I'm going to unlock it
and then we're taken to the widget
screen and we talked about this before
how you can you know bring widgets onto
your on to one of three different panels
so let's go through a few things for the
first thing I'm going to do is press
this cube button right here this is not
a d-pad it actually is a program
launcher so what we have here is a sort
of iPhone like program launcher with
four different panels and you can
actually add panel so one two three and
four what you do is you swipe to the
right to get to the next one and you can
change the order and the grouping of all
of these panels if you tap on the edit
button down here by the way the
sensitivity of the screen is quite good
a lot better than a lot of the windows
mobile devices of the past almost as
good as the touch pro2 in the diamond -
which have resistive touch screens but
they're very very close to capacitive
and this falls into the same category
very good screen so from here we can
delete certain icons by pressing that
button we can add certain ones by
pressing the plus button and we get the
list of items and we can move them
around by tapping and dragging or we can
actually slide them over to other panels
and we can make new panels here's the
fourth one here's the fifth page and the
sixth page so you really could have a
lot of different screens of icons which
is especially helpful if you like to
group things together so I'm going to
click Save there also from here you
get to the cube interface which is
pretty much a novelty it's really really
cool-looking but it probably will slow
you down if you're trying to use this as
a program launcher so the idea is that
you have this beautiful 3d cube and you
can go to any side of it and tap and
let's go to the gaming side this will
actually let you jump right to a
specific area and then you get this kind
of cover flow like sort of touchflo 3d
esque scrollable carousel where you can
flick through the games and you can tap
on the games and it'll open it up on the
screen and this also applies to other
things in the cube as well so we can go
to web for example and we can flip
through our internet favorites again
this may not be the most productive way
to get to one of your internet favorites
but it is kind of nice looking let's see
what else we have here we have favorite
people so we can flip through a picture
of our favorite contacts we have videos
we already did web there's music and
there's also photos and photos we'll
give you a it's going to open up because
I tap twice will give you the ability to
flick through all of your photos kind of
with a little Polaroid frame to it so a
pretty neat interface I probably
wouldn't use this ever because it's
really slows you down and it probably
uses a lot of battery life I'm more so
going to stick with this launcher
interface which is very customizable
now also kind of cool is the task
switcher which gives you a Palm Pre like
way to see which programs are open since
it takes several taps to get to this
it's probably again not the most
productive thing but it's a good way to
help you visualize what programs you
have open I know the cameras having
trouble focusing on that right now
because of the weird contrast but we can
go into say the calendar and here we are
now the omnia 2 doesn't have great
memory management meaning if you load
lots and lots of programs it's going to
keep all of them in program memory
unless you're exiting them with the exit
command well some programs don't have
the exit HTC brought the HTC task
manager which actually forced programs
to close when you press the X not the
case on the omnia 2 so what I have been
having to do is every you know every day
or so after opening lots of applications
I go into the test switcher I click end
off and then they are
out of here something else I want to
show you with the test switcher but I
first need to open up a program or two
is a different view of the of the task
switcher so here I'm going to go back
into it and I'm going to click the grid
and it gives me a grid instead of a sort
of rotating Palm Pre like interface so
just another way to view the programs
that you currently have open now let's
go into the settings menu which has been
completely re skinned here in settings
you're going to notice a lot of white
text on black Samsung is really taking
advantage of the fact that the AMOLED
display produces very dark blacks and
where you see black there are no pixels
that are actually illuminated so this
really saves a lot on battery so it's by
design and it is also to make it look
better on the screen so every setting
really has this interface to it so we
can go to sound settings and everything
down to ring it uses the TouchWiz
interface very very nice very finger
friendly too let's go back and see what
else we have here
display and light we can change the
wallpaper and here we go into the photo
picker and you can choose pictures
you've taken or there's a nice selection
of very crisp looking pictures that look
great on the AMOLED display there's
something called large indicators if you
tap up at the top the notification area
you get kind of an HTC like well some
some HTC devices will do this so that
you can actually tap on certain icons
and here's the volume chooser which is
actually a little bit different and this
lets you change system volume and you
can go over here to ring volume okay
items on today well this is just the
standard Windows Mobile item that lets
you check and uncheck certain today
screen items we have the Samsung widgets
being displayed we can go to brightness
problem with the brightness control you
can turn on auto adjustment but the
polling frequency is way too high so if
I create a shadow on the top of the
device it'll dim the screen instantly
the polling should be less frequent so
that you know a little shadow won't
cause the screen to dim so I leave it on
manual brightness we can change the
design of the lock screen but not by too
much so we can go to edit lock screen
and we can change the design just a
little bit we can make it a little more
streamlined or a little more expanded we
still don't get next appointment which
is
see what else anything here we're gonna
go back general settings and here on the
bottom you can actually turn off the
Samsung TouchWiz UI so that when you
press the start button you're taken into
the standard windows mobile program
launcher the standard settings and
everything
I actually recommend probably doing that
because it gives you back some program
memory that's being taken up by the
TouchWiz interface and so we've other
things in here such as wireless manager
which looks just like a way to turn on
and off the various wireless radios we
gonna line the screen
this has TV out but it doesn't allow you
to do that out of the box doesn't have
the cable this can play DivX video right
out of the box I'll show you that in a
second change the language let's go back
and then we have some phone settings but
this is pretty much the stuff that you
get from your from your particular
carrier and some security things Network
memory let's go into memory and we can
take a look at how much memory we're
using right now and we have not that
much left and we're only running a few
programs I wish the omnia 2 had better
memory management or at least more
memory and we can go over here to the
second tab which is the standard windows
mobile stuff so and go into system turn
on and off clear type turn on and off
error reporting you know the stuff that
you're used to in terms of how Windows
Mobile actually looks so let me show you
some video right now out of the box the
omnia 2 plays a host of video file
formats so I'm going to go into my
storage that's the on boots onboard
storage on the omnia 2 and I'm going to
go down to an episode of the office and
it plays it right away this is DivX and
turn it over video looks beautiful on
the omnia and it's so great that it
plays natively many different file
formats that's really a breath of fresh
air of course you have play controls on
the screen you can pause it turn it off
that sort of thing so very nice with the
video playback if we go into phone we
get a nice big phone dialer right on the
screen that's very very touch friendly
and it's it works very well with one
hand so you can be walking down the
street and you type someone's name you
can call them quite quickly
now the messaging application has
actually been skinned a little bit which
is quite rare we really don't see this
on windows mobile devices so if I go
into my email
this is Outlook mobile it's a little bit
different than what you're used to and
so we can go into any message whoops and
read it just like we would except we do
have a lot of you know white on black
text here again taking advantage of the
EM OLED display and likewise SMS is also
skinned a little bit to be better for
the for the AMOLED display now one more
thing I want to show you is the
on-screen keyboards because obviously
the omnia 2 does not have a keyboard so
the on-screen keyboards are vitally
important let me show you kind of the
options that you have so I'm going to
actually go back in the email and I'm
going to reply to that email just as a
test and reply and you get two different
keyboards and you saw the landscape
keyboard there but you get two different
keyboards let me get to the top of the
message here I'm not sure why I went to
the bottom anyway here we are and so we
can type let me try the quick brown fox
and it's got t9 turned on so so the
quick brown fox so the keyboard works
quite well it's very responsive it's got
haptic feedback although I've actually
turned that off to save a little bit on
battery life in fact the whole device
has haptic feedback and actually it
makes a sound by default so when you tap
on a button it goes click and it
vibrates but again I turn that stuff off
because it was annoying and because it's
using battery life but let me show you
the landscape keyboard which is really
really awesome it's huge
takes a lot of getting used to because
the space bar is so small but it's quite
a large keyboard which really helps to a
quick and text-entry a lot so that's the
keyboards the keyboards work quite well
I'd say that they're on par with how
they how good the iPhones on-screen
keyboards are in terms of landscape and
the portrait versions and one more thing
the omnia 2 as CPU throttling the smack
CPU speed on the omnia 2 is actually 800
megahertz which is pretty high for a
mobile device now if the device were to
run at 800 megahertz the whole time
you'd think that the battery battery
would kind of run out pretty fast but
actually I've been running it at the
highest CPU speed and my battery life is
actually quite good I've been using it
for a lot of the day today and it's
about 77% so so far it looks like good
battery life on the omnia 2 here in
performance you can choose four levels
of CPU performance by default it's on
auto but I turned it on high and I'm
getting really good performance I'd say
on par with the touch pro2 which is one
of the fastest windows and mobile
devices in terms of going from screen to
screen and opening programs and that
sort of thing so that's pretty much it
for the software on the samsung omnia 2
we're going to have a full host of
screenshots and impressions pros and
cons and examples of how the camera
takes photos coming up in the full
review on pocketnow.com so watch out for
that if you want to know right when it
