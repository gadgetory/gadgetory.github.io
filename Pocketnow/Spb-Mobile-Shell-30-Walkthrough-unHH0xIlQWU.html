now calm and this is a video tour of spb
mobile shell three-point oh this is the
follow-up the brand new version of spb
mobile shell 2 point 0 which is the
extremely popular and very well selling
windows mobile interface replacement
what this does is it changes the entire
look and feel of windows mobile it
covers up the ugly interface that is
windows mobile so we're going to show
you some of the major features here with
the diamond too and I think you're going
to be super impressed they've really
made a lot of changes and its really
really great so I'm going to zoom in on
the screen here so this is a very
similar screen to what you're probably
used to seeing if you have mobile shell
right so from this screen you can see
your your appointments that are coming
up you can tap on any of the
appointments to see the calendar
although this screen is a little bit
different and it looks a little bit
nicer we can go to the next day and
scroll through or we can just use our
finger to scroll through kind of like an
agenda and just see the succession of
all of our appointments really nice
interface there if we go back to the
screen we can dial right into emails
nothing unusual there we can go into
missed calls if we have any we can go
into SMS if there are any or we could go
over here to volume and change the
profile that we have set now what's
really neat is that there are two
versions of this panel this is called
the professional panel and if we flick
our finger upward we get the lifestyle
panel and this is really really cool
it's fully customizable so what you can
do there's actually three panels one on
the left one on the right and one in the
center the one in the center I've
customized to have the weather if I tap
on it there the battery life over here
I've got the clock in the center where I
can have multiple city times if I'm
traveling which is great I've got the
calendar here so at quick glance I can
see my next appointment to the left I
call the girlfriend screen because with
one tap I can dial the girlfriend and to
the right I've got some miscellaneous
things showing up on the screen let me
show you how this is customized it's
really great in the bottom right corner
here I'm going to tap this
and from here I can add a widget or I
can edit the layout well I am going to
edit the layout now what we get here is
a grid selecting all of the items on the
screen we can either move things around
by tapping in the bottom left corner or
we can get options from certain
components of this screen by tapping on
this bottom right arrow and so here I
can tell a mobile shell to go put this
on the left page on the right page or
remove it I'm going to ignore that some
of the icons of different settings such
as this one will allow me to well not
this one but certain icons allow you to
change the size and so here we're seeing
pretty much the same icons and to set
that in place we do a check and let me
go to the right here and show you how to
add widgets so we go to add widgets and
you can add a lot of different ages
widgets we can have miss calls
voicemails indicators we can have links
to any program so if we want to do an
application link we can type we can
click on there expand the category we
can do history and here's that button
and we can actually change the size so
we can make it small medium or large we
can add text to it very very
customizable you can see how you could
spend a lot of time making this your own
and when you're done you press the check
mark down here and it is set that way
now here's something that's also super
super cool on the bottom left corner you
press this button then you get this
brilliant 3d looking display that does
an extremely good job at visualizing all
of the different panels that are
included in mobile shell so we can go
right to the weather panel also a little
bit different if you press the start
button you are taken to the spb launcher
so it shows you recent programs which is
great you can tap over to the right to
get kind of the old style spb mobile
shell interface so we can tap settings
we get the roll forward and let's let me
show you some of the settings that you
can do in spb mobile shell three-point
oh we can turn the animations on and off
it actually uses a quite a bit of
battery life I think using this the 3d
acceleration if we go to system we can
determine if it should be using the 3d
acceleration and we can also determine
if it should be overriding the start
button you can change the language there
in the weather setting you can have it
they automatically which is always a
good idea but if you have a data plan
that is not unlimited maybe you want to
turn that off and you can change the
temperature scale to Fahrenheit or
Celsius another thing you can do from
this lifestyle screen and remember there
is the professional and the lifestyle
screen is change the background which is
great so we can go to change background
and let's choose something a little bit
different let's choose this red
background and just it just changed
it'll change it a little bit a final
thing that I want to show you is all the
colors that you can choose for the the
whole interface right now there's kind
of a blue setting that i'm using so i
could go to themes i can change it to
something a little different so let's do
green and it takes you to the standard
today screen but we can go right back
into SB be home and let's get a
background that really works better with
this green background i'm going to use
the leave here that looks a little
better maybe it's a little bit difficult
to read i'll have to change that so
overall spb mobile shell three point 0
is a terrific successor to the program
that many revere to be the best windows
mobile interface this may turn out to be
one of the best-selling pieces of
windows mobile software of all time that
said it's going to retail for around
thirty dollars which may seem like a lot
but considering that it gives you a
totally new phone experience considering
that the performance is fantastic it
really may be worth worth it there's a
lot that we didn't get to show you here
such as the context carousel and you may
see some familiar faces here one problem
though while using the software my
battery life has taken a huge toll more
so than using you know touchflo 3d or
another interface SBB has made mention
that the early release version that
reviewers got may be different than
what's finally released so it's likely
this is a bug that will be ironed out in
the final release when this starts
selling so that's it for now for spb
mobile shell three-point oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
