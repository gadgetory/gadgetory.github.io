couple of more interesting startups with
products you might want to take a good
look at but Jules Wong on camera I'm
home it'll be better with pocket now and
this is flying to Gemini and this is
blocks Hana Gemini out of the UK nearly
raised one and a half million dollars
last year to manufacture a little piece
of tech nostalgia that may still have
relevance in the right persons pockets
the Gemini PDA while there is a cellular
version of the Gemini this clamshell
device is intended more as a miniature
laptop than a phone it has a six-inch
extra-wide touch display and SD card
slot and dual USB CE connectors for
peripherals but if you can't connect an
external keyboard and mouse at the
moment you need it there is a fold-out
keyboard well be honest it wouldn't make
sense for this device to be pocketable
as it would have to include a more
spacious keyboard some key presses
didn't actuate while others needed a
second try to output a character so
there is some trepidation in
recommending it for quick productivity
hits on this dual boot Android Linux
mashup this being said the planet Gemini
was one of the most funded IndieGoGo
campaign projects of 2017 and based on
some of our colleagues anecdotes
customers may get used to the travel and
pitch of the keyboard after just a while
longer shipments are underway to backers
but consumers can still get a discounted
price for another few weeks
moving up a couple of boosts we have
progress from blocks the late 2015
Kickstarter campaign that also raised
about a million and a half dollars to
bring modularity to smartwatches
customers buy a $259 core that runs not
Android wear but a customized full
version of Android Oreo and it also has
to be noted that blocks does pair with
iOS as well as with Android devices at
this stage these modules include an LED
flashlight GPS extended battery
heartrate monitor and a couple other
with at least a dozen more expected to
come in two phases
if you're wondering why it's taken block
so long to launch the company has told
us that it got a lot of negative
feedback last year on its implementation
and found performance issues to boot so
it took the bulk off the year to
relaunch with a thicker more powerful
base a simpler charging instrument and
improved module connectors those units
are headed out in the coming season so
yeah even if you're not necessarily
getting with blocks promised at the
beginning it is clear that the company
is doing everything it can to offer
users a reliable experience let us know

blocks in the comments down below and
