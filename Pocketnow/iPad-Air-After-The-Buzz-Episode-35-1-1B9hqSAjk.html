our new device launches the media gets
review units ahead of the official
launch and we get to use them while we
write our review then the press embargo
lifts every outlet posts their reviews
and videos at the same time writers and
commenters go back and forth and it's a
huge frenzy of opinion and buzz for
about a day and then it all goes away
sure there's some follow-up coverage but
after that initial blast almost no one
revisits the device to see how well it's
aged because we're all on to the next
big thing already so let's do something
about it let's have a look at a device
after a couple of weeks after release
and what it's not shiny and new anymore
I'm hey maybe then I will pocket now
this is the iPad air and this is episode
35 about robots
hello over eight months have passed
since the launch of the iPad Aaron at
times when Microsoft has launched the
surface pro 3 and when Samsung keeps
pushing the bar with the tablet lineup
or even more important that times when
Apple is already preparing for the
successor of the iPad air but it still
be worth it for you to buy this tablet
after the buzz let's talk about it I've
been using the iPad air since launch
date after my strong disappointment with
the iPad Mini and so far my experience
has been positive for the most part you
will remember that in my durability
report I reported that I had some
hardware issues with the display with
some dead pixels and Apple was nice
enough to replace it for free and the
Genius Bar and ever since then which was
February it still looks like new it's
hard to not acknowledge how thin and
light this tablet is and how pleasant it
is to use for content consumption so
we're sure that it'll age well for the
best majority of you aside from the
great build quality and design even
cooler is the fact that the market is
flooded with accessories to help you
take advantage of it
whether it's keyboards that merge
seamlessly or many other things owning
iPad hardware has some benefits for the
most part the fact that Apple also keeps
design cycles for at least two years
also ensures that whatever accessory you
invest on today will probably work on
the next model software is really where
things get mixed having a tablet running
iOS has its benefits at its caveats if
we talk about the good stuff I'm already
running iOS 8 beta on his iPad and
whoever isn't is already using the
latest and greatest version of iOS
without the drama of having to wait for
software updates this makes the use of
an iPad over time to be drama-free and
trust me that matters when of course the
Iowas 8 aside from some minor bugs it
runs on this tablet like a champ and
what I love the most about iOS 8 is that
it finally gives us some better stock
tablet applications which we criticized
a lot on iOS 7
even though yeah there is still no
split-screen multitasking after that the
cooler part about owning an iPad is that
the iOS has the best selection of tablet
applications in the market and if there
is no tablet application for the service
that you want the iPhone application
works on and just fine as an alternative
as yes the iPhone is the
device that has more applications as
well the downside here is when you match
the software with my overall user
experience and notice I said my sadly
not everyone can use an iPad for
everything and even though some of you
just use a computer to breeze the web
and yes the iPad can replace your
computer just fine if you just use that
my case is different and for many other
people it's the same case since
regardless of how powerful the a7 and
64-bit chip is the iPad is still just
the content consumption tablet for the
most part it is still just an iPad even
if you actually can get some work done
here it it's too cumbersome route 200
power to get most serious work done if
you just want to play a game surf the
web or watch a movie or you some
documents here and there you'll be just
fine but sadly in my case because of the
limitations I find myself using the iPad
less and less because I don't really
have much time to play now that being
said consuming content again has great
things and also has some challenges on
the good side I'll admit that I love the
long lasting battery life on this thing
it that's the full day pretty much and I
love the fact that this particular iPad
charges in no time I also love my choice
for this LTE model because data plans
for tablets can be quite cheap and it's
really cool to always be connected
sadly my biggest issue when talking
about the negative side is that if you
really want to use this thing for
content consumption you need storage and
I mean a lot of storage
after always buying 64 gig iPads I went
with a 32 gig model this time to make up
for the LTE upgrade and that boy am i
regretting this at times when the best
games away one gigabyte and purchase
movies WAV or gigabytes you really can't
get by with 16 gigs and in my experience
32 gigs is still little and again unless
you want to be syncing this iPad
constantly which makes your experience
cumbersome this is really what makes
using an iPad complicated the fact that
you have to buy the more expensive iPad
if you want to get the best experience
and that is really unfortunate as there
is no expandable storage and yes I do
have to talk about the camera because
that's part of the video and the iPad
has the same cameras that we've been
since the third generation iPad 5
megapixels and well they're good they
take some good photos and they also film
the video but you will look hilarious
taking photos with this thing and the
problem again is that if you don't have
enough storage it's really pointless for
you to film so much video as well and
that leads me to my final thoughts of my
experience with the iPad after the buzz
an LTE 64 gig iPad will cost you $900
which is too pricey for the product that
can only consume content and also too
pricy when you consider that the surface
pro 3 can be found for less money and
can get some more done yes for constant
consumption the iPad is the best you
really can't compare to the surface pro
3 but I do think that many people can't
really afford a $900 tablet and the
computer and that's really where the
problem is with the iPad and I'm sure
that Apple has been noticing this as
tablet sales have stagnated for the iPad
in the past couple of quarters mainly
because people have noticed that they
can't really use an iPad for work and
you can't really afford to own two
products most of the time so bottom line
what we recommend that you buy an iPad
air after 8 months of use it really
depends on you honestly the difference
between the next generation iPad air and
this one probably will just be touch ID
so if you really can't wait you probably
won't miss out on much with the next
generation iPad so yeah it could be a
good time to buy but then again we're
just a couple of months away so if you
can wait then just wait it off that
being said on the positive note I do
love this iPad for what it can do it's
great for content come suction it feels
great it is gorgeous it's really
beautiful and it's just fabulous to use
it again for what it can do but if you
really want to buy a tablet for work
this is not the product for you and
probably can get some work done but not
the best tablet for work and that's just
a reality unless you again can't
purchase two products and can use this
tablet just for content consumption it's
really hard for us to recommend this to
be your only complete
that's it for episode 35 of after the
