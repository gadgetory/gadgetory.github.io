let's go take a look at Firefox nine for
Android for those of you who are
interested in alternate web browsers for
your android-powered device Firefox has
been around for well a little while we
had some early fennec betas and alphas
and now we've got full-blown Firefox and
today they've released or earlier this
week they've released and today we're
going to show you firefox 9 which adds
some cool html5 stuff some speed but it
keeps with the flavor that we're used to
with Firefox for Android so first of all
let's go back to our home screen over
here the Firefox logo is the same as
what you'd expect on a desktop browser
opening and launching it is relatively
quick it takes a few more seconds to
launch the first time in this case it
was already in memory but overall it's
pretty quick now one thing you will want
to keep in mind this is about 15
megabytes it's going to take quite a bit
of time to download over a 2g and
possibly even over a 3g network so keep
that in mind you may want to do it over
Wi-Fi once it's downloaded and installed
it's pretty quick so let's come and look
at some of the basics first of all you
can see there's some ice cream sandwich
kind of interesting things I believe
it's ice cream sandwich you've got your
fav icon over here and your reload
button over there they don't really fit
this space it feels kind of awkward but
that's probably because this is a much
larger resolution screen this of course
being my gsm Galaxy Nexus running ice
cream sandwich or Android 4.0 if you
pull over to the side that was a little
gesture that you saw me do just pull to
the side now you can see your thumbnails
of the the tabs essentially that you
have open on the screen you can quickly
and easily switch between them so let's
come up here for example and load in
pocket now over on the other side we can
set that as a favorite okay add that to
the home screen if we want edit it all
kinds of cool stuff go back and forward
and get into our settings it's kind of
interesting I have a menu button down
here
the legacy menu button and then I have a
settings cog right here that do kind of
the same thing but kind of different
let's see that again so down here's your
menu you can get into preferences there
that's the same thing as if you were to
just hit that so a little bit of
redundancy kind of interesting while
we're here in preferences if you want to
go to the about page which is what i
showed you first you can select that
button language you can pre define or
have it auto detect essentially the
website you go to is going to tell you
what language it's in and that's what
this is going to use if you want to hard
code it to something you can do that of
course if it's not written in that
language that's not translation that's
just how it's going to interpret the
characters the start page you can come
in and set it to whatever you want your
current page a blank page or the Firefox
start I've got it set to the default
which is Firefox start and sinking this
is very cool you can sync your contacts
across essentially across the cloud so
if you've got Firefox's your browser on
your desktop computer and you have
favorites stored there you have
usernames and passwords stored there you
can sync this all across so that it's
the same experience on your mobile
devices it is on your desktop device
it's not two separate experiences you
have the same things on both sides
privacy and security what you'd expect
you can use a master password to get
into your password screen if you want to
be able to reformat the screen when you
zoom or the contents on the screen when
you zoom you can do that it's off by
default and it works pretty well being
off but if you run into some weirdness
go ahead and toggle that showing images
in the enabling JavaScript if you want
speed uncheck both of those and it'll
speed things up quite a bit and show
character encoding just for some I don't
even know why you'd want to do that if
you know let us know in the comment you
have a download manager now so if you
want to see your download so you can
look in the list here and this is what
sets Firefox apart from everybody else
Firefox has plugins and when I say
everybody else I'm talking mobile
devices because everybody on the desktop
has plugins and whatnot right so over
here you can look at what
current plugins or add-ons are I've got
my google integrated search installed my
Amazon integrated search twitter
integrated search and Wikipedia
integrated search all of those came
stock with the browser if I don't want
to get more I can search for them or I
can see some of the more popular ones I
can essentially get a tutorial what is
an add-on one of the most popular ones
out there is a block ad block plus if I
can pronounce that essentially this
blocks ads you might like that you might
not website to make their living off of
displaying ads you don't like looking at
ads so kind of lay that out and once
you've gotten over the the moral dilemma
make whatever choice you want there if
you want to make your text bigger you
can do that here you can also do that in
the settings for your your whole
operating system this handles it a
little bit better when you're looking at
it in web pages clear mobile history you
can add a clear history button to the
Firefox preferences so you don't have to
dig in an extra level deeper so kind of
cool and then a whole bunch of other
stuff and when I say a whole bunch now
keep in mind the more add-ins you add
the slower your browsing experience is
going to be speaking of browsing
experience how is it well that's kind of
two sides to a coin let's go ahead and
look at this verizon motorola droid razr
coming out go ahead and open that up now
i'm on Wi-Fi it's a 20 megabit
connection down you can see it is taking
a little bit of time to load in initial
page loads on firefox seem a little bit
slower than in the Chrome browser when
you scroll you're not getting kind of
partial page Scrolls you're getting
blocks of just black that then is filled
in which takes just a moment you have
your pinch to zoom and that's one of my
other homes if you take a look at this
again big black swath while it's loading
the text looks good it scrolls well when
you're doing it slowly just not when
you're jumping because you know you have
that big block so here's my other chrome
you look at this I now have something
that's too wide to fit on the screen so
I'm going to scroll to the side but I'll
eventually when I scroll to the side I'm
going
get that bar the bars essentially are
now way off to the side you can get them
by you know anywhere you are just by
scrolling in from well you should be
able to from scrolling in from the side
of the screen but you can't it's the
edge of the browser window so that makes
these kind of things hard to get at when
you are zoomed into a site not all that
cool but kind of a you know the other
side of the coin there once you get this
thing loaded it really excels in html5
and JavaScript if you've got any kind of
html5 on here it's fast blazingly fast
css3 transformations really fast I don't
have any good examples to show you
however just visit your sites and take a
look that's where it excels once the
content is on the device once the page
is loaded then interacting on it is
really really quick quite a bit faster
in fact then the chrome browser that
comes with the Android operating system
even the new one that comes with ice
cream sandwich so really quick look
showing off a couple things that you
guys want to see one more I always get
kind of in trouble in the comments for
only showing the pocket now website so
let's go ahead and show another one
here's Apple for example loads up pretty
quick in gadget and I haven't loaded any
of these so they're not cashed at all
this is just a straight load from the
web across the life I to the device so
engadget takes a little bit more time to
load it's a heavier site as far as
content goes again the big black block
while scrolling over although once it is
loaded the scroll is pretty good and
pretty fluid I like that quite a bit and
so we don't play favorites let's go out
to microsoft com so you can take a look
at that load there as well so
kind of quick still loading in a little
bit it doesn't even look like you'd
imagine it's supposed to be because this
is trying to be a mobile page and it's a
not doing really well at that so hey
Microsoft you might want to take a look
at that and see if you can make that
experience a little bit better because I
think it's supposed to look like that
anyway so showing off firefox nine if we
can get back to the wherever I found
that firefox 9 for android for pocket
out I'm Joe Levi
