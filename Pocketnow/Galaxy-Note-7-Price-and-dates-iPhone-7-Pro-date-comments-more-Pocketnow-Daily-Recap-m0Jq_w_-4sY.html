iPhone 7 EndNote 7 I know man this
season is crazy
is it his full name hime underscore
Nevada he said it pretty much on every
episode guy is funny very funny
tomorrow's video iPhone 12 unique new
dscanner
gotta love these comments on the recap
huh that's right it's that time of the
week I am he might leave it out this is
pocket now and this is the pocket now
daily recap for last week so on Monday
the topic was the iPhone 6s II as the
probable name instead of iPhone 7 I
asked you of you liked that name and we
had 1,100 comments thanks a lot I think
it should be called iPhone 7s Plus pro
se yeah I leave it to Apple for the
weird names and now that's probably not
gonna happen
shush guys that was about to innovate
what the word special means seriously
yeah Apple and its naming is a sort of
iconic in the way it kind of wants to
reinvent what names are that is so true
if you're the number seven galaxy s7 s7
edge and the upcoming note seven you
know this is rather interesting a lot of
companies have been doing that the axon
7 Galaxy s7 and Samsung jumping to the
Galaxy Note 7 but it's because a lot of
people have pretty much heard that this
year is iPhone 7 or shouldn't be the
other way around we never know on
Tuesday the topic was B are we heard
that Samsung is working on a new project
dream I asked you how often do you use
VR we had 527 comments I've never used
VR because my mom says not to keep the
screen close to my eyes mother knows
best yeah that law kind of went down the
drain ever since the first smartphone
came to town and computer and pretty
much everything else for that matter
I think the ER isn't on its full
potential yet wait another one or two
years and then we can talk about VR in
everyday life that's gonna be kind of
creepy mainly because of the social
etiquette but yes I do believe that VR
still needs a lot of work
no one wants 4k what we want is better
battery most of the comments have to do
with that because the topic is that
apparently this project dream has to do
with the Galaxy s8 with a 4k display and
yes I do believe that it'll be overkill
but then if you see the are right now on
a 2k display that it does need a little
more
then on Wednesday the topic was our
scanners there are rumors that Apple
will eventually work on one and I asked
you if you find that our scanners are
creepy or not we had 2037 comments I
think that's a record
Apple police F off and come up with your
own original idea for one seriously you
clearly don't know Apple Apple is very
famous for grabbing a very good idea
from another company and rehashing it
with a smarter appeal or approach sadly
the problem is that it always works for
the company they take it takes its time
and then it comes up with whatever it
should have been from the beginning
actually company should learn from that
keep products in R&amp;amp;D for a little longer
technology is becoming creepier not just
the iris scanner totally true you don't
know exactly what happens with your
fingerprint etc I don't think the iris
scanner is needed even if you consider
if you use gloves Nokia Lumia stuch
screen in her face which was pretty cool
danger goes with Samsung piece that's
kind of a convoluted comment but yeah
even not even though only Nokia phones
have that glove mode we also have that
with other devices like the HTC ten for
example the thing is obviously unlocking
your phone just makes it a challenge
with your fingerprint so I do find the
iris scanner to be useful in those
particular scenarios but not necessarily
something you need but on Thursday the
topic was the iPhone 7 we asked you if
you are waiting for that phone and if
that phone is making you wait instead of
considering any of the other smart
phones in the market we have 801
comments I'm just waiting for the next
Nexus phone if that's crap that Notes
seven for me then yeah that pretty much
sums it up for me as well note 7 will
destroy the iPhone 7 now many of the
rumors are pointing to the iphone 7 pro
r+ to be significantly different to the
typical one if that does happen then
there might be a compelling reason to
consider that but still my god that note
7 is gorgeous Apple is wait too late
into the game once that Samsung Galaxy
Note 7 comes out it would have already
taken out most of Apple consumers I do
agree there is a purpose for Samsung to
launch this note so early it makes all
the sense in the world let's just hope
it pays off good competition is always
great then finally Friday the topic was
the Galaxy Note 7 obviously it wasn't
announced back then and I asked you we
had rumors for the ETA and price tag and
was really important for me to know
would you mind buying the Galaxy Note
seven of the specifications were
identical to the s7 which they ended up
being we had 883 comments no why would I
spend an additional $100 for a point 3
to point to display increase and an S
Pen it turns out the differences are
quite significant I highly suggest you
watch our top 5 reasons to buy the
Galaxy Note 7 we pretty much sum it up
there this s no lineup is getting worse
every year
it's a galaxy assembled a bigger screen
and a new fool not a new flagship phone
a few Samsung I don't blame Samsung the
new Snapdragon 82 3 and 81 are not
available yet I don't think that the
company could have brought anything else
to the market not even Android n is
ready so I don't think that there was
anything else to do but I do agree with
you the problem is that the Galaxy s8 is
pretty much gonna overshadow this phone
yeah yeah I pay 800 for a 6 month old
phone with a smaller battery again not
necessarily please watch our top 5
reasons to buy the Galaxy Note 7 this is
a really good phone in many ways and we
have to move away from that topic of
spec increases obviously it will depend
a lot on Samsung and making this phone
future-proof from the beginning whenever
Android nougat comes out that this phone
gets the update it's really all in the
hands of Samsung right now for this
phone to not be overshadowed with the
Galaxy S because it's not supposed to be
the note should be a league of its own
not in addition to the lineup of Galaxy
S smartphones that's it for the bargain
