just living in it celebrating the 10
year anniversary of one of the world's
most iconic brands Apple took the wraps
off a trio of devices shipping this year
were there any surprises can Apple keep
the pressure on the premium market and
just what is the price threshold for an
expensive gadget we've got a lot to talk
about so make sure you're charged and
ready for episode 2 7-0 of the pocket
now weakly recorded November 14 at 10:00
a.m. Pacific this weekly podcast is
where we dissect and discuss those
gadgets that make our lives mobile
smartphones tablets and wearables with
all the stuff you wished existed when
you were a kid and you had to talk about
a unibrow it wasn't on a phone I'm Juan
Carlos bag now senior editor at
pocketnow.com joined as always by plucky
podcast producer mr. Jules Wong and in
the midst of a busy review season
joining us now we've got mr. high made
Iveta to jump into this discussion how's
it going out there on the East Coast sir
I'm trying to figure out how to a mute
my microphone hold it
oh you're unmuted we're hearing you now
so I think you're 5 by 5 good buddy I
apologize for the air-conditioner noise
it is hot no I mean I've got a
description fan like right on my butt
towards the microphone so we don't have
to hear that this is uh this is
podcasting 101 keep microphone by face
and fan by but and you will be super
comfy I promise note then by ok I'll try
to make some adjustments here
televisions rocket buddy all right now
jump into some real tight tomfoolery I
wanna I want to shout out this week's
sponsor it's a company I believe that
many in our audience will be familiar
with it is of course D brand now if only
with with this explosion of glass back
devices wireless charging all of these
fun features if only there was an easy
way to protect the the glass on the back
of your phone I keep it free of smudges
keep it free from getting scratched up
and then also a way to add just a little
bit more grey
so that you know when you're like me and
you're holding a phone over a freeway
overpass to finish your camera review
you're not as worried about dropping
this polished stone wet bar of soap kind
of experience and that's where Dee brand
comes in handy they've got a whole
collection of different skins different
textures different colors I used to
really like the carbon fiber I've got
that on my my razor blade now I'm all
about the dragon skin which I'm
currently rocking on my note eight and
in a variety of colors that you can
choose to customize your gadget add that
protection add that grip definitely want
to check them out we're gonna have a
link at the bottom of this video once
this video is done processing for the
podcast or you can check out d brand.com
slash note 8 or D brand comm slash
galaxy customized something cool for
your technology and we thank them for
supporting the pocket now weekly indeed
we do and we also would like to thank
you if you're going to participate in
this podcast because we definitely need
your feedback this show around
especially with all the Apple talk
that's going around so hashtag P and
weekly on that Twitter sphere we got
that going on hashtag P and weekly or if
you would like to write it in later
that is podcast at pocketnow.com the
email address that you would like to
send things to podcast apakah now compy
and weekly hashtag we've got it all
covered for you right now yeah and we've
already were already getting some tweets
in on the P and weekly hashtags we'll be
covering those later in the show people
definitely I mean the the iPhone X has
been a very polarizing discussion so I
think we you know it's like when you're
dating a nice girl and then you get
engaged and it takes like a month before
you go from saying girlfriend to beyond
today and it takes like another month
before you say oh this is my fiancee I
mean this is my wife this is the same
thing Apple has to give me at least a
week of screwing this up because it's
still iPhone Roman numeral ten well
Dirac's that's how I'm helping you with
the title of this show here you know you
see it's you're the only iPhone
but I think ten I see I like that that's
good Jules that was that's a good title
pun because I'm terrible at coming up
with the title puns it's a thing that I
get paid to do yeah you get paid very
well to do that I'm sure no we've got a
whole bunch of Apple news this this
whole podcast it's it's the Apple world
this there's no other news happening
this week
no one rightfully anyone who's trying to
get a press release out right now is
probably playing a pretty foolish game
but we've got a whole series of devices
that were were announced on Tuesday on
twelve we should probably just do a
quick little roundup on what else was
announced aside from the iPhone before
we jumped in there because we had Apple
watch Apple watch OS announcements and
then also Apple TV announcements some
pretty interesting stuff for that that
fruit ecosystem actually I might want to
start off with you
first of all just how did you feel about
the keynote this is you know this was
the first time that they had presented
in this amphitheater is the Steve Jobs
theater this was for the tenth
anniversary of the iPhone you know there
was a lot sort of riding on the
presentation do you think it captured
the sort of sense of of Apple Majesty
that they were hoping for this new line
of products and the sort of milestone
event for them that is a good question I
mean Steve Jobs was a wonderful
presenter I this is the first time that
the company has made homage to you Steve
ever since him passing there was you
know obviously they mentioned him on the
first keynote after he passed away but
then after that a lot of the elements
that made Steve Jobs presentations
popular were gone like the one more
thing you hadn't seen that since you
know Steve passed away I love that they
began the presentation giving him a sort
of an homage now I also loved you know
Apple is usually not one of those
companies that you know mentions any you
know any difficulty things that's
difficult that's happening around like
for example what's happening with
Hurricane Irma and everything right down
in Florida and so I love that part
was the presentation as good as I
expected uh I don't know I guess there's
just no way to replicate that 2007
presentation of the iPhone right and I
feel that there is no way to replicate
it because I think that what Steve did
that was unique was he presented an idea
like he literally sat us like if we were
in smartphone 101 classes in college
this is like your entry you imagine that
smartphones were a career he sat us at
101 and he gave us an explanation a very
direct distinctive explanation that any
human could understand over why they
were making such a dramatic shift from
curity keyboards from hardware from
Hardware keys from everything why they
were making such a dramatic shift into
you know flat slabs and that explanation
was just so remarkably made that even if
the iPhone you have to remember how
underpowered the first generation iPhone
was like there were already third-party
applications in the market the iPhone
didn't support them there was already 3G
in the market the iPhone did not support
it there were so many things that the
first generation iPhone did not have and
it was also going to be the most
expensive smartphone of its time at $500
plus a two-year contract it was with
whatever subsidy we were expecting it
was pretty exactly exactly in Bixby I'm
not talking to you by the way sorry you
know it's got the sensitivity but that's
another topic we actually have to talk
about but you know I feel that that was
missing in this presentation like why
would you so why would you say that this
is the future of smartphones like
getting rid of bezels you know I think
that Steve's principled explanation back
in the day of the first generation
iPhone was okay we're making a complete
slab because we can't change buttons
that made sense we're making a larger
display if you remember back in the day
this places were 2.2 inches 2 inches of
anything on your biggest smartphone back
then and so to make a jump to three
point five was insane
who I mean just all of all of those
great like you know a 3.5 inch screen
that's incredible that's incredible and
so okay we're gonna move into 3.5 inches
we're gonna do capacitive technology
okay so we have an iPhone now that
doesn't have bezels I think that there
is no phone right now that does less
bezels than the iPhone and this is great
coming from the bezel King I mean the
iPhone has always been the worst about
it I mean do you think so I mean was one
of the things that we put up on Twitter
this morning was you know I'm looking at
the the iPhone presentation and I'm
turning over and looking at my Galaxy S
a I'm looking at my LG v 30 and I really
do believe there are probably some LG
and Samsung designers that are feeling
more than just a little bit flattered
right now with the the iPhone X
announcement hold on I get it I sorry I
couldn't be myself I get it it's just
you know I feel that the iPhone is doing
the best job at no bezels right now and
that's all great but I feel that the
company didn't really harness the reason
why they were wanting to do this so you
know Jonathan Ive and his in his video
and I love the video by the way you know
he explains that forever since they
started the first iPhone they wanted to
make an iPhone that was all display that
makes all the sense in the world and
that's great
the thing about it is why are you
wanting to do an iPhone that's all
display I would have loved that during
the presentation that would have said
you know we did this because this phone
fits in one hand sort of like what they
did with the iPhone 4 with the iPhone 5
sorry you know we're making a taller
display but we're still making this
phone easy to handle in one hand and
nothing of none of that was ever
mentioned they're just making a full
screen display just for the sake of
doing it but not you know they didn't
provide any organ onyx over what the
purpose is or anything they're just were
adopting glass for wireless charging now
don't you feel that that's actually
becoming more of an eye I think that's
becoming more of a concern for keynote
addresses across the industry because I
left the note 8 event from Samsung in
New York feeling kind of the same way
this was a lot of really good feels a
lot of really good emotion behind this
event same thing for the iPhone but the
substance you know why we're tuning in
for a two-hour press conference
what these new devices are going to do
and getting into the details felt a
little surface felt a little yeah a
little light or a little uninformed yeah
again and that's the reason I'm telling
you I think that that's those are the
things that I loved about Steve Jobs
presentations Steve was a little more
detailed you know not necessarily over
specifications but over you know the
things you know you remember when he
like for example when he showed his
flick scrolling on the first iPhone like
you hear you hear the response in the
audience and everybody's like wow cuz
remember those things didn't exist back
then you know they were like we're not
gonna do a stylus we're gonna do
something that's different something
that's smarter and so no we don't have
that detail these new presence agents
you're right one and it's not like I
mean it sounds sort of infantine I'm not
like insulting it but like when those
infantile cools just come here is like
oh look at this it's all new you don't
have the advantage here of having Steve
Jobs come up to stage and say a phone in
an Internet communicator and I and you
know go through all that hydrate and an
iPod and that microwave exactly and
there's been this whole of you know
convergence and steep learning curve has
just flattened out recently and now
we're coming to a point where it's like
okay here's the newest thing it's face
ID and instead of having to press your
thumb to the thing you have to raise
your phone to your face and I feel like
a couple of takes from you know
satirical outlets you know there's this
a fake person that says so those 10
years of cultivating my home button
skills were all for nothing in part I
feel like you know that's kind of a
satire on not just like I and like
people are stupid and they have to
relearn things but you know it's just
like well no Jules I mean that's that's
an excellent point though is because one
of the things we've always talked about
with iOS devices is they typically
aren't the most exciting from a UI or a
hardware perspective but you could give
you could take someone from the original
iPhone and give them an iPhone 7 and the
learning curve would be pretty low you
know like so much of that has been built
on a consistent track record of
execution
very much what we were talking about
with I've forgotten his name the
gentleman from AARP change oh yes thank
you change for change sake can can
really get in your way from a design and
UI implementation and so now I mean
let's let's get into the phones because
I mean I think we keep talking about the
press conference and obviously the press
conference keeps leading us back to the
pins magical it's magical everything's
magical it's so Steve grab now unicorn
end of story
IIIi think this this press conference
for me has really underscored that the
phone Hardware probably doesn't matter
that much yeah looking iPhone eight
looking iPhone 10 and what we're looking
at for new products and new services
that to me is really gonna be the future
of what what consumers care about so so
let's get into those devices we're
starting off with the iPhone eight if
you were hoping for an iPhone 7s this is
it
it's gonna be very similar in design and
form factor now getting rid of the
aluminum back from the iPhone 7 the
iPhone 6
going back to a glass rear and that's
going to provide for wireless charging
hi mate
do you think that this strategy is
because now we've got a whole wealth of
devices Apple is keeping a catalog of
iPhone se iPhone 6s crazy iPhone 7
iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 we used to talk
about you know fragmentation and they're
not really fragmenting but they're
keeping a pretty wide stable for
consumers at a variety of price points
now how do you think the iPhone 8 fits
into that strategy now ah I don't
understand the whole purpose of keeping
of launching an iPhone 8 and then
keeping the iPhone 7 and keeping f1
success if anything they should have
just left the iPhone S II launched the
iPhone 8 and you know launch the you
know it here's the thing and I guess the
biggest point is well number one of you
want the latest and greatest iPhone but
you don't want to take a dramatic plunge
in a price tag then you get an iPhone
eight you know I guess that's the way to
see it and I think that this move is
genius for a couple of reasons
number one I don't know if you knew this
but if you watched my after the buzz of
the Apple watch series 2 there is a
problem with apples implementation of
7000 series aluminum it oxidizes very
easily um you know if you sweat your
phone constantly or or if you sweat your
watch constantly like the iPhone my
son's iPhone 6s looks like crap
like it looks it looks like if it's
feeling but it's not peeling it's
actually a different type of oxidation
provided by the holes I assume that it's
because of the zinc alloy and somebody
explained that to me at the essential
events actually explain to me the reason
why that was happening with iPhones and
the reason why a palak's aliy needed to
move to glass I think it wasn't just you
know the fact that they wanted to adopt
glass but I think that no company was
doing 7000 series aluminium you know
more I mean in the full body they except
for Apple Apple is the only company that
was doing it Samsung is doing just
mortars of aluminum with glass in the
back LG is doing the same but you know I
think that this is actually causing
Apple problems and so it made all the
sense in the world to make that shift to
glass I just I to be honest with you I
don't understand the purpose of the 7/7
and say you know seven seven plus
success is particularly the success like
what's the purpose of keeping them and
keeping the SE if not because the
company is left with inventory because
these phones haven't been top sellers
you know that the last time that Apple
sold well when it came to iPhones was
the iPhone 6 and then from 6s and on the
company has actually been selling less
than what they predicted so you know
they're they're I don't know I don't
know they're this is the most that Apple
has ever offered iPhones in history the
most yeah III have to agree I was really
happy to see the S II still maintain its
spot cuz yeah it's the iPhone se and
then Sony are the only company is
offering sort of a nicer experience in a
truly small form factor device the the
iPhone 6s I you know again we want to
see like what is the strategy and what
markets is Apple appealing to and maybe
this is a sound strategy for developing
LTE markets we're a premium device might
end up being something like an iPhone 6s
um but when you get to that last graphic
at the end of the presentation and there
are five phones up on the screen it
seemed to me does this does this start
to devalue the iPhone 8 does the iPhone
8 actually become something more of a
mid-range err for an upper premium it
ranger it's not it's just it's just and
here's the thing I one of the things
that I like about no it's not sorry one
of the things I don't like about Apple
and you know it's but it's what I tell
people is listen don't get the S don't
get the the launched product meaning you
know don't get the latest and greatest
if it's not an S model because you're
all you're getting the same specs as
last year but you're getting a new body
and really you're paying more money for
a new body but you're getting you're not
gonna get a better experience until the
following year
always the following year continues to
bring you know better things that when
it comes to specific specifications even
if there are any problems - it's the S
series that always fixes them so here's
the thing you have an iPhone 10 that
iPhone 10 has the exact same
specifications of the iPhone 8 so you
have a choice you can get the latest and
greatest with vessels and the typical
Apple design and you don't get to pay a
thousand bucks or you get the latest and
greatest gorgeous iPhone but you have to
pay the money but you're still getting
the same specifications and pretty much
nearly almost the same experience that
you get with an iPhone 8 see you know I
like that Apple is like okay fine you
know we're making a dramatic leap with
his iPhone and price tag and in user
experience with killing touch ID and
things like that and I know that there
are like for example my my
brother-in-law he's up for an iPhone
exchange he's up for an iPhone change
right now and he was like no I'm not
getting the 10 I'm actually gonna get
the 8 and I'm like really why are you
gonna get the a he's like well I'm
getting the same I'm getting the same
internals yeah I don't have to get you
know give up touch ID which is something
that I'm used to I guess I'm a little
skeptical and I'm hoping that this is
not another Applegate you know how about
I you know is this going to turn into is
is this going to turn into the new face
game you know people being able to
unlock phones with their face with
somebody else's face or things like that
and he's like I don't want to I want to
play it safe I you know I need my phone
my phone
is literally my tool so I would rather
play it safe and go for the 8 and I
think part of it is just due to the fact
that people have been talking about this
super cycle where people have been
waiting since maybe even the 4s to
upgrade and this is going to be the big
one and this is going to be something
that will blow your minds and to some
point I think some people might be
disappointed and Apple recognizes this
and they've made the widest spread of
options to them in the long you know
since forever they have options for 349
449 549 they've actually bucked up the
the main model price to $6.99 from 649
so your that Christ out there but that's
been relativity too when I was 8
like in $800 and then the you know $9.99
we were talking about after the note 8
launch 2 though is in a world with a
note 8 and an iPhone 10 a $600 phone is
now representing the upper mid-range
yeah that's that's shocking in this day
and age and that's where I'm actually
been really you know a lot more positive
on and the iPhone 8 then the iPhone 10
is first generation products from any
company make me nervous
this isn't a slam on Apple it's there's
a lot of stuff that Apple has never done
before in one phone and I mean to your
tier you said your brother or
brother-in-law I'm sorry brother-in-law
brother-in-law point like for a
mission-critical communications device
that we depend on every day that has to
be in our pocket along with our wallet
and keys Apple is actually introducing a
small element of risk for their fashion
brand you have to be in on this
experiment with them in a way that I
don't think we've seen from any Apple
product previous or especially any
iPhone product previous yeah and and you
know I love so I love that part of the
presentation where they were like you
know the reliability of touch ID is 1 in
50,000 like they had never shared those
statistics before and they felt the need
to share them just to be like listen I
we know it's risky but it's not it's
actually
better than touch ID and so I was
actually watching that part of the
presentation and I was like huh is touch
ID really that bad well and if it was
why were we relying on it for Bank
exactly exactly what did you just do you
one of the biggest selling points of the
of the Apple experience writing this
piece of hardware around one in 1
million that still means that 7800
people or something like that can go
ahead and unlock your phone well and I
loved it they were up front with like
all and if you've got family members
that's gonna reduce you know I mean
that's gonna increase the likelihood of
a false positive and they were even like
yeah you better keep your password handy
I'm like seriously III am very concerned
I mean this is one of the reasons why I
actually because I don't like any type
of hold phone up to face unlocking
system neither do I I like my phone is
unlocked as it's being pulled out of my
pocket before I even have to look at it
or wait for it or react to it but if I'm
gonna hold the phone up that's maybe one
of the reasons why I think I'm gonna
gravitate more toward Samsung's iris
scanning uh it's a smaller target you've
got to get your eyes lined up it's
probably less based on the geometry of
your face and more on the individual
characteristics of your eyes like I
think that and I I would love to see a
security expert actually go to town on
these two different systems Rhodes III
think they offer pros and cons that
where Apple is probably going to be more
consumer convenient I wonder if
Samsung's solution won't end up being
more secure you know I just I follow
with my point that Samsung Samsung
explicitly tried to kill the fingerprint
scanner with this crazy placement you
know they were like you know you're not
gonna meet it all you're gonna need is
the iris and then Apple just completely
killed it it was like yeah let's just
kill it let's do that and I wonder what
the whole purpose is I mean I agree with
you there are you know there are certain
scenarios where I could just see people
and this is not something that I do but
you know let's just agree on the fact
that people do this people are on their
phone while they drive yeah let's just
admit the fact that the
we'll do this my sister does it all the
time I see people driving and they're on
their phones in the freeway I despise it
but it's a fact that it's a reality and
dude can you imagine people just
grabbing their phones and having to look
at the damn phone to be able to unlock
it you know they're just adding even
more elements of risk to what people
currently do and and I I don't feel that
any company again I don't want to lay
all of the blame at Apple because I feel
that this is sort of industry-wide but
we still haven't really addressed I mean
to your point cuz I completely agree
with you I we still haven't really
addressed to the other car centric
issues or even just walking around I
mean we were we were walking around for
the note 8 event watching people almost
get hit in traffic because yes or
walking by staring at their phones yes
there's that not only a social etiquette
but also a social social safety issue or
something it's actually illegal in
certain countries now I hope it's ok
rightfully so hey at least we haven't we
haven't really addressed some of the
other usage scenarios things like better
voice or better audio controls and I
don't have a lot of confidence that you
know Android auto Apple car is an apple
carplay or Apple carpet called airplay
but but then also tying that in with
Siri and Google assistant they really
haven't addressed the number of times I
need to mix interface
I go from voice to something on the
screen to confirm something to tap to
reference to get audio back I mean all
of these things still take multiple
steps and you know company has done a
great job you really you really need and
here's the point that I was gonna make
you should start using Bixby no I'm not
talking to you I'm not talking to you ok
so ok so with the reason you're with the
reason that we did so I didn't
understand what the whole company meant
with contextual so it's literally like
doing macros on Excel like it literally
is conscience of the commands that are
on the display and whatever it's like if
it's not server based like if it doesn't
really need for Google Maps to be
supported by Bixby what it'll do is it
and I'm not
talking to you my god what it'll do what
it'll do is it'll literally if you tell
it I want you to give me you know
navigation home or or do this or do that
like it actually does commands with your
voice to the app even third-party apps
and so you know I think that that's
actually a very smart way to do your
voice assistance I I had no clue until I
started using it with the know date and
you've been back to your point I mean
yes there there is so much of a of a
protocol that needs to be addressed over
human behavior smartphones and and a lot
of this wants to be addressed by the
Apple watch series three and I think
they won't behave urine
go back to Steve Jobs and the whole
one-finger paradigm for using a
touchscreen smartphone Peter Hayden with
the P n weekly hashtag asks I guess
iPhone acts got rid of reach ability so
we'll dive under or have Apple forgotten
jewels did it to literally actually a
good point though because because hey
you you were a big fan of reach ability
I die am I am a huge user of reach
ability it's one of the reasons why I
was I consider it livable to use a seven
plus um so again I can't wait for our
iPhones end review unit to arrive and
see how usable the phone is with one
hand I have very real concerns over the
number of gestures happening yeah I
don't know about you but I find like
when we when we got used to having a
button you have a home button or you've
got you know the touch ID there's a very
positive specific feedback response and
you know that in action has been
completed so like you with reach ability
you've got that light double tap on the
home button it pulls this ring down and
that works far more consistently than
when you've got like an LG where you've
got a swipe across the software controls
at the bottom of the screen that I hate
that I hate that Esther is more prone to
and so now we exactly your first slide
to get into multitasking you've got a
gesture to get you back home instead of
having a home button if you slide from
the right layer of the cut out you get a
control center you get control center
then you slide from the left ear of the
cut out you get your this feels very
uncharacteristic of Apple to make it an
interface this busy which requires so
much learning so so much muscle memory
from the consumer yeah I don't know man
it's a that's gonna be interesting
particularly you know Apple just
continues like this is like the worst
fragments at Apple I have ever seen
we've got computers with 3.5 millimeter
headphone jacks computers that require
mac safe but then the others require two
USB see they're still all in the market
then we've got you know iPhones which
are gonna have different gestures to a
you know call on control center like the
iPhone 10 has away the iPhone eight has
another you know there are features in
one phone that are not available in the
other and so it's just like really
and then you've got 3d touch that
doesn't work on the iPhone S key uh you
know I have never seen Apple more
fragmented in my life and I I think that
it's gonna come back and bite the
company at some point because like for
example okay so I I like the fact that
your gestures are are you know working
around you know one side is gonna give
me one thing the other is gonna give me
the other if you remember this was
Android 4.3 I mean jelly bean was like
that if you slide from one side of
tablets you got what you got the quick
shortcuts and then if you slide from the
other you would get notifications that's
the right jellybean would work that's
all fine and dandy it's just okay you
know with the whole print the whole
purpose of reach ability is to be able
to reach things with one hand if you
want to call in the notification shade
you know you have to slide you could
call reach ability and slide the
question is I don't know if you noticed
but they instead of the home button
there's like a whole bar at the bottom
now yeah if you want to me at least like
it looks like the Samsung pay cut down
at the bottom
yeah like that
you know the edge coil thing - yeah
which is I actually like how you can
swipe between one app and the other by
just sliding one one way sliding back so
I wonder if that's going to have
functionality you know you can double
tap that and get reach ability or how
usable is that phone in one hand that's
my biggest question you know you didn't
have these problems with an iPhone 4
iPhone 4s but now you're gonna it's why
I lovely it's why my se is my favorite
travel device I mean when you're
carrying bags and you're rolling
suitcases around there is no better one
thumb yeah handset than the iPhone se
you can't you can't I have to agree so
there's this bin there's this one issue
that happened during the event itself in
introducing face ID and face unlock and
that was the whole thing about the phone
with the backup you know like oh I can't
I can't get in let me try this other
unit and Andrew Wallace was asking about
that and I would people in the direction
of the lockers David Cone Oh actually
Jules you got to read Andrews tweet
though PN weakly I was really hoping
that when face unlocked derped during
the event that his watch would chime the
heart warning those are I mean I don't
there's just one big feature high caste
but and it that error came up as just a
thing that happens like touch ID you
can't use touch ID if you restart the
phone you have to enter the passcode in
so you know and it showed the same text
except with face ng I just I love I love
how it's become viral
you know how it's become so they you
know and a couple of youtubers are
trying to piggyback on the whole concept
that it didn't work I'm like I'm sorry
the phone didn't unlock the phone
remained locked right if anything he
proved that it did work yeah you know
like I'm not gonna we can't we can't go
trashing Apple for something that
happens on beta prototyping live like
yeah as gracefully as someone couldn't
given the situation and that also gave
us a piece of data again
what happens when face on face ID
doesn't work and this is exactly what
we're concerned with my wife was looking
at this because she has to use an iPhone
for work she's not the biggest iPhone
fan but they're probably not gonna be
issuing iPhone tens at her job but she
was running like are they really gonna
get rid of like passwords like well no
I've you know if you're gonna still sell
these things to like government or to
business or other corporate institutions
you still have to have pins you still
have to have strong character-driven
passwords all of that's gonna stay the
same so if you don't want to use face
unlock you're still gonna have other
opportunities I mean you can put your
PIN and that's it you know which is the
way that everybody has been unlocking
phones up until the fingerprint scanner
arrived I just you know I hate that
Apple was reluctant to adopt the
fingerprint scanner at the back I mean I
do understand that your new iPhone is
horrible from the back I mean that
vertical camera is like you know I want
to sit down with Johnny have some coffee
and be like what are you thinking - it's
like I I want to have a conversation
about the iPhone 10 and ask what
happened to symmetry yes I mean why did
they put the cutout at the top putting
the camera way off to the side yeah I
really curious how they arrived
you're a collection of very emotional
and very calming and it is very nice for
you to hold
I'm sure Johnny would would absolutely
lomi into the Apple reality distortion
field if we could ever have that
conversation with him but this is a
company that built their reputation on
blending the function around form and
here we've got a one very clear in your
face at the top of the screen data point
where the function of the device is
overriding the design in the form and
this again this is something that we've
we're not used to seeing from Apple this
is something that I really felt like we
would have seen from like an HTC EVO
device right like we had that we want
this function so we crammed it on there
and it doesn't look super great but we
apologize of the phone looks whore
but you know this is it's the future
what about that sorry
the future is free I mean if while we're
at it why didn't we do that cut out at
the top of the phone and one angle and
make like the duo display of LG or
something like that I mean like like
seriously if working I don't understand
what the whole purpose is that phone is
gonna be a wonky nightmare on a table
it's just gonna force you to buy a case
just for it to not you know wobble and
then you know you have a couple of
concerns obviously one of them was gonna
be that stainless steel there are a
couple of benefits God Siri like really
alright so the biggest problem so
stainless a stainless steel has a couple
of benefits which is like I remember in
the case of the iPhone the iPhone 4 the
4 in the 4s when I remember that those
sides would scratch all you needed to do
was get like a 2,000 how do you call a
sandpaper yeah yeah very fine the grain
and you can yeah or or you can that or
you could get like soap scrubs and you
could you know polish it the problem is
this one is actually it's it's shiny
it's like yeah shiny stainless steel so
I think Dom Thomas Macedo has this
really cool video over over how to
polish it you know these are just things
you're gonna have to do with that you
know stainless steel scratches a lot
yeah you know it doesn't really matter
if it's 316l or whatever quality of
stainless steel you are going to scratch
it it comes with the territory so that's
probably you know that concern oh my god
Apple Care Plus if you break this iPhone
[Laughter]
so I I'm actually even considering
grabbing that iPhones end with that get
an iPhone every year plan from Apple
simply because Apple care is bundled
because dude it's like it's $200 that's
the entry point and then you know to get
like a replacement unit of the iPhone 7
plus that time that I broke that screen
to replace the unit was I I think it was
like a hundred
and it was like 110 so how much is it
gonna cost to get a replacement of the
iPhone 10 of you smashed that thing or
something you know yeah that's that's
gonna be an interesting question
especially for that one person who you
know is gonna drop it on launch day yeah
there's always that one news clip of
someone oh show me your new iPhone and
then they drop it oh yeah you never want
to be the first guy out of an Apple
store talking to the news crew because
they're gonna make you drop your phone
don't we and I wanted that's really you
know I'm going back to your point over
the existence of the iPhone 8 an iPhone
8 plus I guess one of the main reasons
why these phones exist is because I
think getting that iPhone 10 is going to
be a nightmare yeah I think it's going
there they're gonna make like the
they're gonna make like the the supply
of the 64 gigabyte there and be very and
they're gonna force people into buying
the 256 just because that's the only way
they're gonna be able to get an iPhones
and I'm like psychologically prepared
that that's the only way I'm gonna be
able to order it well and factoring on
this it's gonna take them a while to
really ramp it up again this is so
different from anything Apple's made in
the past that I would expect very long
lines on the iPhone 10 yeah I per round
this you know this whole release you
know they got that general buzz from the
tech blogs but they didn't get the
details because there was this someone
in the Sydney is George Street Apple
story they were coming out on Sunday and
that was before the announcement itself
you have to wait that your quotas for
the like a couple weeks for that and
then if he really wants to iPhone X he's
stuck there for a month and you know
three weeks or something so right good
luck with this the Apple watch though
because we're running short on Amir
philometor bump from the Apple watch
sales instant fail I mean who could ever
wear something like that point to five
million or do you think I've got like
gorilla arms come on Apple what are you
doing it does come in a bump on the
heart monitor which I feel like that
could like sort of the fun people out
just a little bit so here's the thing
for everybody that's wondering if you
want that series three well I'm
obviously gonna review it and I'm gonna
review it from a fitness perspective
just so you know series 2 continues to
be my favorite Fitness watch mm-hmm it's
between the polar m600 and series 2 now
bear in mind so long as you only use it
as a fitness watch and the watch and you
don't care about the apps you're gonna
love the Apple watch do not try to
launch any apps on that thing because
because they don't they just don't read
oh thank you no I process therefore the
Apple watch they create ok so this is
actually the only reason why I was I was
like okay yeah we need to review this
thing you know serious too is that it's
no longer even in the store you can get
series 1 which I do not recommend that
composite back is terrible it doesn't
work scratches horribly and so I guess
the only reason why I'm interested in
testing series 3 is not because of the
LTE but seriously can it actually run
apps this time do they actually work
with this new processor and I'm even
debating do I get the LT variant or not
obviously I need to get the LTE bearing
just to test that but I feel that it's
really pointless to do so mainly because
if you notice the battery stats and I
covered this yesterday in the parkin out
daily like yesterday's daily was about
everything that Apple didn't mention at
the event that you didn't know exactly
number one the battery life on the Apple
watch series 3 is still 18 hours but of
year but if you like to make phone calls
you know and I'll admit I've done a
couple of phone calls on my Apple watch
in the car you know I get a call I
respond from the watch and I
continuously have the call through my
watch the problem is that if you're
doing it through LTE directly from the
watch your battery will die in one hour
yep your bet I was like ok so you're
telling me that everything is just gonna
go it's three hours on series three with
you know connected to the phone it's one
hour directly through LT so this is
literally it's not like if you're gonna
be taking phone calls constantly on the
Apple watch you know not necessarily
because you know of the experience but
because you're literally gonna kill your
watch in one hour
well she has reported last year that
they Apple had concerns about battery
consumption last year for the Sirius
tier they didn't want they didn't
excited against introducing cellular for
series - this is the question I've had
with with all smartwatches that are
trying to shift over into this LTE
strategy is the talking point seems to
be you're gonna go on a workout you
don't want to carry your phone so now
you've got this LTE enabled device which
for what your workouts gonna be an hour
two hours three hours no so here's the
thing the Apple watch actually matches
Garmin and not just the GPS reliability
but they also match Garmin in London
Tiffany longevity of the battery when
you're running so the Apple watch can
pretty much last for five hours your
standard marathon is four hours you know
the average human will run a marathon in
for something hours so those metrics
make all the sense in the world you can
run and I'm talking about Garmin
smartwatches please I don't want to hear
the Khan in the comments it doesn't yeah
if you go for the cheap garments yes
they have more battery life I'm talking
about the Smart Watch it's five hours
and so and so you know it makes sense
for you to have a tool like if you're
gonna run a marathon dude you literally
just ran 26.2 miles you don't want to be
carrying a phone so that makes sense
right you want to be able to access your
music so that makes sense and I love
that whole I think that that was like an
awesome selling point for Apple music
you get all the Apple music that you
want on your watch if you go for the LT
Barry I think that was an awesome
selling point for Apple music so I sorry
Jules I couldn't hear you the carrier's
have to follow up though I don't think
any carriers really gonna be pumping the
brakes on that I think they're all gonna
want that as a value add on sale for yes
you think they'll jump on that pretty
aggressively that hasn't that's actually
saying I love the data and whereas other
people are just like I'm not sure
exactly what's going on out there
they have gigabyte blocks or they
they're like before the Apple watch it
this is this is what's kicking them into
gear at this point and this is what's
probably going to kick Android wear into
gear again a set point in the future
because if this is what's gonna make LTE
on wearables hot it has to be unlimited
because we're talking about 5g or
something like that
IOT like that asked me always is on and
unlimited even act like those minuscule
data consumption rates so I mean even
then I want that because it's it's it's
again it's a value add-on if you've got
an older plan and you end up with this
weird data block for your for your iOS
watch then you need to upgrade your plan
or you're gonna get charged overages or
all this I think is is is win-win for
carriers I think they're gonna be really
excited to be supporting this where
other LTE watches failed
well Verizon and t-mobile are giving you
three months for free of data if you
connect an Apple watch Series three so
and after that it's $10 a month added to
your data bucket so I just I don't know
if it's unlimited or not I just there
are certain things that I you know part
of my review is definitely gonna be okay
fine okay it doesn't really can it still
achieve those five hours and I'm not
gonna lie to you on and particularly in
my current status where I actually be
you know I've made a couple of changes
as of this week when it came to training
due to some fizzy you know some physical
conditions you know that we discussed in
Berlin and I just I really need to get
back into fitness so this is gonna be
like the perfect timeline for me to
review this watch so here's a thing for
me to be able to lose weight I need to
train at least three hours a day yeah as
exaggerated as it sounds I'm and the
more if I I sadly I my propensity to
lose weight is very difficult and
therefore I need to Train like a machine
so I'm gonna definitely be testing out
of that Apple music you know plus the
whole experience of LTE Plus you know is
the watch really usable on its own is it
usable because that's not the only thing
you care about if you're gonna leave
your phone at home maps have to work on
this thing like there's no tomorrow
you know messaging apps like we all use
messaging gasp and I'm like
really curious as to how things like
whatsapp we're gonna work on that thing
like it's not okay to say like you
you've got this limited experience
because you're gonna be focused on your
workout I need data
I need mission-critical information
service well the thing about it is the
average human particularly in LA it's
very common in LA for buildings to have
their own gym so these are company
executives that are going to be leaving
their you know their this their business
or whatever job they have they're gonna
go to the gym for an hour an hour and a
half whatever time they have they're not
just gonna leave the phone behind unless
the watch is like really good about
connecting and you know probably one of
it's not a concern I like the fact that
this watch is just fifty dollars more
expensive but then it also it also makes
me wonder how confident is Apple that
this watch is really capable of
replacing a phone yeah then I think that
they you know they didn't make it so
much more expensive just to not generate
bad publicity now I know we've got to
let you go here pretty soon so I want to
have we've been really critical about
Apple and there's something like I
actually want to bring up that I think
is something we should celebrate which
is Apple moving very aggressively into
the augmented reality space oh yeah the
iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone 10 really
leveraging we've been talking about a
our kit in previous podcasts they have
developers on board in a way that Google
hasn't seemed to inspire people with
project tango and their augmented
reality services and now we're seeing
this built directly into a consumer
facing product one of the most widely
accessible consumer facing products
moving in jazz here that has to move the
needle on what we can do with integrated
data in services using cameras and AR
this to me is probably the most
compelling announcement out of
everything again the phone's probably
don't matter as much as this new
generation of services that were likely
to see and I think it's genius I think
it's genius if you go to a stadium and
you point your phone at the stadium and
you're able to see what players what
you're able you're able to see you know
valuable information the question
exactly is you know how can we make a
are possible
the only way you're gonna make it so how
are you gonna make it popular sorry the
only way you gonna do it is if you make
this like so valuable I mean I think
that it's so cool if you're able to I
mean and we've been seeing this I mean
we've been seeing this from Nokia we saw
it from Nokia in what was the name of
the service where you would lift your
camera and you would be told what
buildings like what offices what I know
exactly what you're talking about and I
can't for the life of me remember this
is not new augmented reality is not new
and I think that Nokia was the pioneer
with Windows Phone back in the day I
just love that Apple was like you know
what we're not gonna make people buy a
crazy ugly pho that's either
underpowered or overpowered or
underpowered over expensive people are
not gonna buy an extra phone for AR
they're just not your net you don't own
a Lenovo fab 2 pro really is no much
friend you know III I actually have good
taste actually have good taste for my
phones but no I you know I have to agree
with you on that we're being a little we
were probably being a little too
critical of Apple I have to agree with
you on a are I I love the fact that it
looks really good I can't wait to
actually test it out I think that it
deserves its separate video over the
usage of AR and what you can do with it
and you know to be honest with you in
addition to AR I mean let's face it one
I just I can't wait for every phone to
look like the iPhone 10 going forward
because I'll let me if we also shift
that to say I can't wait for every phone
to look like the LGV 30 oh yeah I mean
or the V 30 or the or the you know I
love the shift that's happening right
now with devices like the essential
phone with devices like the B 30 the the
Samsung galaxys I love that we are you
know pushing the bar of design we're not
just making ugly phones and so we know
that every single om is going to start
following this trend yeah and and I
actually like that I actually like the
concept of hey what if face ID actually
is really good I mean I mean it's it's
level it's revolutionary from a
perspective that sure we've been able to
unlock phones with our face since what
was it
shoot Ice Cream Sandwich yeah we've been
able to do it since Ice Cream Sandwich
I've been using it on the v.34 a bit and
it's it's really good on the v30 but
obviously there is not be attention to
detail in all the technology that's
cooked into what you have on the iPhone
right well so again I'm so excited by
Apple's announcement for services so
face ID is one application of this
hardware that's on the front I mean the
the frivolous side of this is something
like an emoji right where it'll my face
and put it on an emoji and we can all
laugh and chuckle at that but that's a
really friendly soft around the edges
consumer application that people are
gonna enjoy using and it'll take the
edge off of that hardware you're gonna
tell me that you didn't watch the the
video of the iPhone 10 and you saw
Johnny I've talking when they put the
camera on him and then they got the you
know they've got the enemy inside of
dude that causes an emotional reaction
and whether you like it or not that
video was so well done it was so yes has
ever emoted for anything dude
I I think that that scene in particular
that video is genius there appleís
Apple has been trying to drive emotion
in the market ever since their thing
different campaign from their 15 17
years ago this is the way Apple does
marketing and I think that they're
killing it with the iPhones and I cannot
wait to see the batch of advertisement
for the iPhones and I mean think about
it I know that no parent is going to be
buying an iPhones and for their kids and
we know that the iPhone 10 is going to
be the you know it's gonna be the
juggernaut let's face it no parents
gonna buy an iPhone 10 for their kids
yeah that's that's not gonna happen so
forget about snapchat kids sorry you
know that whole an emoji for snapchat
but I think that 9:02 winners of komen
I'm sure we'll see a few kids rockin
okay but think about it you know
Apple Apple over sold the company if you
look at the 2007 presentation of the
iPhone 7 the company's target for the
iPhone
was to sell a million units I think they
sold four million units in a week yeah
they over sold so badly that you know it
just drove something and gifts what
Apple did with the iPhone 3G you know
the company could have been like okay
the company the market has already paid
five hundred dollars
they've already locked themselves to
AT&amp;amp;T no dude they dropped the price to
two hundred bucks and a two-year
contract with the iPhone 3G and nobody
can come here and say that they did that
because they didn't sell as many units
as they want it they over sold so I
think that the iPhone 10 is just as
usual that you know the it's the
vanguard change but that's that device
that you know what they're charging is
just going to be for you know to pay for
R&amp;amp;D and everything and I'm sure that the
I feel like the company has done it in
the past I'm sure that iPhones n is not
gonna retain that price tag another year
no I don't think it will but this is
also I think where Apple has always been
successful and especially I need to take
a call guys give me a second in being a
lifestyle brand is that they managed to
maintain a really healthy margin and
that's why their shareholders are always
so excited by these these new product
announcements and and I can't really
fault them for that I mean the market
you you pay or you price your products
at what the market can sustain and I
think we're seeing a trend where
consumers want some sense of exclusivity
again or they want to feel like your
product is special in a way that they
probably haven't felt over the last
couple years and this isn't again this
isn't just on Apple I think this is a
trend that we're seeing throughout the
industry you spend a lot of money on
this lifestyle companion gadget you want
to feel like it's special you want to
feel like it's you know unique or that
it's that it's that's nicer that it's
fancy at some point you have to fish or
cut bait and when you're walking into
AT&amp;amp;T Verizon it will sell your wherever
and you see that price tagging see
alright so I have to pay this is much
down and forty dollars a month for two
whole years I can I have a whole family
to we've been waiting for so long like
you know it's I don't know where
why does it matter like it's it's it's
you know groceries you're dealing with
those what I think that's also why I
think Apple and Samsung are going to be
successful here is that it's the lobster
pot effect you go from paying twenty
five bucks a month to thirty bucks a
month you go from paying thirty bucks a
month to thirty five you know this has
been a trend that we've been seeing for
the last what three or four generations
of smartphone especially is we've
started walking away from the two-year
contract you know an iPhone 10 on the
old school two-year contract would have
been a flop because it would have
returned us - you have to pay $600 up
front and sign on for a two-year
agreement here so many more people are
probably looking at more of a leasing
structure you're just you know and
actually gonna pay and here's the thing
really owned I was looking into the
leasing of you know that whole get an
iPhone every year dude it's 50 bucks
like that's nearly what you pay for a no
date yeah so you know I wish I really
wish that these you know these Samsung
devices wouldn't have gotten so
expensive this year when was the last
time that we've paid more than $900 for
phone so these companies have just made
it acceptable for you to charge more
money right and you know Apple just
wrote the lightning well and this isn't
necessarily a bad thing from a business
perspective because I think the era of
consumers trying to whittle down lowest
possible margins price deals cuts bogos
things like that is kind of giving what
in North America I shouldn't say this is
for the rest of the world into the rest
world has a much better perspective on
buying things like unlocked phones and
here in the United States especially
we're still playing the fashion game the
lifestyle game what's the new hot color
for this season what's the new design
accent for this season and that's
playing more into the emotional aspect
of spending so much on something nice
and then in the six months we're gonna
hear pretty much the same complaints
that we've always heard I wish my phone
had better battery life I wish it was
more durable I wish you know the screen
was brighter when I'm outside or any of
those other things but what actually won
the purchase over was the emotion of the
mole
when that phone was brand new I really
have to keep potions you know gentlemen
I apologize but my other call has just
begun so no we're actually gonna be
wrapping this up so I I appreciate you
sharing your thoughts thank you for
inviting me it's always a pleasure I
always feel so honored pleasure all ours
have a good one gentlemen
take care buddy you took the bite and
actually I mean I think that's probably
a fine place to kind of wrap this up I
mean we've got a number of tweets here
that I do want to cover using the P n
weekly hash tag from Peter hatin agree
100%
I wonder how Apple will help move a are
in general Google introduced lens at i/o
but will Apple help it I'm very
confident they also had a thing that I
don't remember the name of that they
just launched and that basically made
what they did in tango redundant and you
know just catching up to a arcade so I
mean it's it's a drag long process but
we'll have to see well but I'm very
confident that Apple putting this in a
mass-market device a Jaime's point and
my point when I was reviewing the Lenovo
fab 2 Pro is project tango has been fun
it's it's really cool especially you
start loading up some of those demos and
some of those games like I love the
little Domino's you stack Domino's and
you can knock them over and you can draw
these patterns and it works really well
but I'm not gonna spend four or five
$600 on a on another thing you know just
eggs because it has all of the right
project tango AR cameras on it the fact
that I Apple was able to pull off the
demos that they were showing with what's
gonna be a standard production grade
iPhone 8 or I mean iPhone 8 plus is is
really compelling and I think that's
gonna be the biggest push we've seen in
this kind of augmented service and I
think the apps themselves have to be you
know up and ready and easily loadable so
that you don't have to wait around for
them and that's you know they are kid
that's that's both device and
infrastructure and Eric or you know it's
kind of making it available to the 60%
of the world that doesn't have and I
found so yeah that those are the hope
that there's some talk
between them and we're very confident
that in 2018 we'll see an iPhone 8 at
$100 price cut that starts pushing AR
into sort of only $100 come on I mean
that's that's what it's gonna be from
Andrew Wallace we've got another tweet
from him using key and weekly it looks
like iOS is having the iPhone X's
widow's peak I believe it's called the
unibrow Andrew not the widow's peak
cover up video and UI elements went in
landscape no screen resizing I see so I
really believe that there will be
probably some kind of double tap on the
screen we shift the aspect ratio or the
screen size I don't think it's gonna
stay the cut out blocking everything on
the left-hand side of your video buffer
for that but there's no software for
reach ability so you give him you take
well but I mean like I think they were
only just showing off the full maximum
screen for these demos I don't think
that's gonna be the only way that you
can consume games like them to think
that that's you know that's sort of an
unsexy way to approach it because you
know you got the actual actual symmetry
if he were to pull down like the black
bar for the information and in reception
and all that and you know people have
been questioning that but that's not my
I don't have taste in art so I don't
have no we are but lowly geeks with no
taste in art and then also from Jasin
jing jing' co i pianned weekly why did
Apple go to the trouble of designing a
new taptic engine if they're ditching
touch ID anyway um I don't think taptic
engine was ever just for touch ID was
for force pressing or 3d touch I think
they call it and you know I mean if
you're able to implement it into things
like the LG 13 V thirties zoom and all
the other camera possibilities that you
have even with AR I mean we're still
talking about a device that you have to
handle yourself you can code those
interactions in there's still a whole
bunch that you can do with just haptic
engine so I think the kind of touch
feedback is really
when when you're just talking about and
we're talking about a premium device you
know something in that $700 plus
territory
it's nice having a little bit of extra
reassurance or feedback from whenever
you interact with something on the phone
very worthwhile and then from goat 78
the greatest of all time and I believe
he was probably born in 1978 are you
going to pay 84 dollars to unlock fast
charging the USBC cable it's like okay
join the club Android people let's do
this right the doctor really I I don't I
don't know exactly what the pricing is
but I'm sure it's not gonna be cheap
because this is this is one of the
frustrating things is they can they can
work but it does come with the phone and
yeah and we're still in this massive
USBC spec like what we're supposed to
3.3 for thunderbolt it's well and and
that up it's so up in the air that
you've got companies like Oppo and
Huawei designing their own fast charging
yeah completely circumvent all of the
confusion so what we're supposed to do
now is move back to full USB a is oh
yeah and just make sure that it's
totally waterproof to just do that and
you'll be fine
you know you know what's kind of
interesting and and maybe this is my
last point about iPhone is no one no one
mentioned anything about the headphone
jack anymore like apples apples
experiment here in whether or not
consumers would be negatively reacting
to things like the headphone jack has
pretty much been a non-issue or a
non-starter and they're not even talking
about additional accessories it's just
now you'll go wireless
you'll have bluetooth it'll be great
they don't talk about they had a passing
mention of the W one shit was they out
there there's that and it's business
subsumed and they expect their customers
to get along with that and I guess but
even for rumors like we were gonna get
redesigning air pods or some kind of new
earbud or headset
like it was it was such a non-issue that
they didn't even bring it up as a path
for accessories even for additional
sales they had nothing to talk about
when it came to headphones or audio I
think people are kind of resigned to
their fate as all right am I going to
search the carb seat cover for this or
the couch because I don't think yeah
this app is not really telling me where
they are anymore because there they're
not giving me the signal they're there
they're dead so um yeah thanks for that
Apple sorry I just think it's funny like
for something that people have been so
viscerally negatively discussing and
even in my circle of family and friends
like they get upset that there isn't a
standard headphone jack on their iPhone
and then they still go out and buy new
iPhones to complain about the things
that aren't on it and you're like well
there's a solution but basically you've
given Apple your money so there's no
incentive for Apple to ever address that
maybe they could redesign or bring it
back or do something different with that
CEO Tim Cook one infinite way Cupertino
California 9 that's it is if you gave
them their money it doesn't matter what
you tell them you gave them right you
voted in the best possible way for Apple
to continue on this track record is by
you know the financial aspect of of
buying one of their product best banana
republics oh yeah Apple has been in a
republic that's hilarious oh and oh
that's right we should probably mention
this really quickly from Justin jingo
you haven't talked about air power yet
haha Apple inventing Qi wireless
charging that's always exciting to see
Apple invent a completely new technology
that no one's ever utilized I think the
one best thing that they invented was
the sound that the phone makes when you
put on a new device to the same pad I
think that and the animation - it's so
it's so smooth and buttery
well no so this is this is one of those
things like again at the same time that
I can find maybe a little snarky and
critical of Apple like I'm glad they
chose Qi that's the that's the standard
I wanted them to support and of course
they've got to put their Apple spin on
it so if you want to charge your Apple
watch your air pods and your iPhone all
on one pad and have a really pretty
notification system for what the device
charge is on all of those gadgets then
you want to go with air power and I like
that bit of synergy I mean that's that's
an Apple ecosystem move that I can
support if you're in the iOS ecosystem
those are the kind of things you should
expect but then if you want to go to a
Starbucks and you even put your phone
down on a table the power mat has
actually put out a release saying oh
we're actually going to support Qi now
or well they actually they actually
talked to um Chris Davies our friend our
mutual friend from /ki that they're
charging pads it's more of a the magnet
in them is more of a universal it's it's
kind of they can actually program it so
I mean and I think that was the the
right move by Starbucks I mean they
supported PMA that is not the standard
that I wanted them to support but
everything they invested it in invested
in I think is only a software update
away from being cross platform across
compatible Starbucks IKEA all the other
places that have implemented these pads
so I mean it's Powermat that we're
dealing with here but I mean the public
face of it is Starbucks unfortunately
and there this is another great great
tweet I know I keep saying we're gonna
wrap this up but you guys are asking
some phenomenal coming in at podcast at
pocketnow.com do you realize that use
email I mean if you want to reach out to
us later but this is this is great for
the live broadcast from at Godslayer Ron
Ron the great iPhone 10 4k 60 frames per
second video may not be as game-changing
if the files are huge and run if you
have been paying attention in iOS 11 the
iPhone now will support HEV C h.265
video encoding probably to the chagrin
guys like mr. mobile since he didn't
like TVC on the the Huawei but our own
playing the final good yeah
well I'm your final caller sue but we
have no guarantee on that because Apple
doesn't like to make everything one
unified ecosystem anymore so if you get
HEV C on an iPhone and Final Cut takes a
you know a couple updates before they
properly support it that could be kind
of a headache no no I mean they are they
supported it starting from the summer I
thing like I don't so I mean well yeah
but it's still it's still a good step
forward in any case and I think Apple
should be applauded for that and in
every way that it bugs me that Google
has been you know slamming the brakes on
all kind of video encoding for things
like YouTube or Google photos that's the
one that really pisses me off is that
you don't get any notification from
Google that your videos are not being
backed up if their HEV see that is a
major oversight on Google's part and
Apple is probably the only company that
can again that they can move the needle
on this if you check out the iOS 11
betas now a 4k video recording on an
iPhone is coming in at half the file
size of h.264 I mean this is this is
huge this is a really big deal when
iPhones are gonna start with 64
gigabytes of storage and your 4k videos
are half the size that they used to be
there is no reason to not be shooting 4k
now I mean literally bandwidth upload
speeds consumption everything is on
point this is the right time to do this
if you haven't already been shooting 4k
all of the videos of my daughter over
the last two years are in 4k because I
want to preserve those memories at the
best possible quality I don't know why
you might hate your kids maybe you only
want to shoot your vision 20p that's
fine maybe you've just got jerk kids but
for those of us love our families and we
want to preserve those memories we've
moved over to 4k now if Apple's gonna
cut our file sizes in half at the same
quality that's win-win that's enormous
and on that now that will do it for the
pocket now weekly R stands for
wrong and our hosts today we're Quan
back now at some gadget guy on Twitter
and I can do this feel it's it's fine
I've calmed down now I feel like I can I
can respectfully address our audience
again go ahead another episode of the
pocket I weakly his this show is over
thankfully but the conversation
continues on Twitter where Jules is at
point Jules hi Mei is at I'm a
underscore Rivera and I'm humbly at some
gadget guy pocket now was around the web
on Twitter Instagram Facebook Google+
YouTube and our home sites pocketnow.com
and for Spanish speakers yes
pocketnow.com shows like this cannot
exist without your support sharing the
weekly with your friends who love mobile
technology and dropping reviews on
iTunes stitcher Google Play or wherever
else podcast reviews can be left once
again we want to thank this week's
sponsor D brand for helping us keep a
better grip on our phones keeping those
fingerprint smudges off of that back
glass but ultimately there wouldn't be a
show if it weren't for our listeners and
subscribers who have kept us on the air
