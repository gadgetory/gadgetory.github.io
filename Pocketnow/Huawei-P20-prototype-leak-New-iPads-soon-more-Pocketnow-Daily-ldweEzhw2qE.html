p20 that shows two cameras and no notch
we should expect two new iPads from
Apple in March as the company registers
them and the Android Oreo update for the
Galaxy s8 starts rolling out yet again
I'm Jaime Rivera
reporting from Barcelona our apartment I
apologize I know this video was from
yesterday but traveling was insane this
is PocketNow daily the official news
today begin with deals there are buy one
get one free options from t-mobile that
are interesting but also a little
confusing like for example you can get
an iPhone 10 iPhone 8 there are a ton of
options but it depends really on what
you do either you go for the buy one get
one free or you can get pretty much a
rebate depending if you trade in a phone
and I'm talking phones as old as the
galaxy s4 Galaxy Note 4 and a ton others
just read the description there are more
details on what you should look for now
let's turn about 5g as we're expecting
that to be a big theme here at MWC and
AT&amp;amp;T has pretty much already announced
that it will begin rollout of 5g in
Dallas Waco in Texas and also Atlanta
these three markets and they're rolling
out as soon as the end of this year the
only problem is that the Wacom
Snapdragon X 50 modem that's pretty much
capable of providing this 5g is not
necessarily going to be ready to roll
out until early next year so Wow yeah
you'll have the network you just won't
have the capability and for those of you
that were disappointed with the whole
rollout of the galaxy s 8 Oreo update
that that was the poll because phones
were having issues rebooting etc the
company is rolling out the update again
we're not exactly sure what changed or
what we should expect but given the fact
that were just a couple of days away
from the galaxy s 9 I guess they just
wanted to make this not look so bad now
even though iPads are not necessarily
people's favorite ticket they are for me
they enable this video and we hear that
Apple is considering two new iPads the
company has just registered them to the
euro-asian Commission we're not exactly
sure what the differences are but our
sources is claiming that we should
expect
many changes when it comes to the design
there's only so much you can do to a
tablet but most important apparently the
price tag is gonna get a major change
and benefit so can't wait to see that
because the iPad pro is terribly
expensive and finally the very
interesting news is they have to do with
the Huawei P 20 this is probably one of
the hottest keywords right now we hear
triple cameras not jet cetera that's all
great but the most recent leaks shows a
prototype that is probably early or
we're not exactly sure if it belongs to
either of the three models and this one
only brings two cameras and brings no
knotch
whatever the case may be whether the pro
or plus variance is gonna get the tree
cameras and then the other ones don't
you know today's question given the fact
that we hear that a ton of companies are
experimenting with a concept of the nod
for example when you consider it smart
for Android OEMs to do the same you know
to follow along and try out the notch et
cetera et cetera or do you think that
these companies should be smarter about
what to do and just come up with
something unique because that would be
my opinion but leave us a comment down
