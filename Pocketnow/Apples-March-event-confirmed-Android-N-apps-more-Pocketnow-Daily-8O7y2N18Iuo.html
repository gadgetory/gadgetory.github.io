right when the galaxy s7 launches google
has already begun to prepare apps for
Android n and fossil continues to take
smart wearables more seriously I'm hi
meri behna and the last thing you want
on a Friday is technical difficulties
before your drink this is parking out
daily the official news today begin with
fossil as the company continues to
demonstrate how important smart
wearables are the company has now
launched its new Q motion which reminds
us of the misfit ray the sleep tracking
and everything and will cost you $95 the
reason why it reminds us is because of
the cylindrical design which is actually
quite elegant you can learn more in the
links of the description and for those
of you that we're worried about
Samsung's performance during pre orders
of the galaxy s7 yes there were reports
and things weren't going so well in
Korea the thing is rather different in
Europe apparently the company sold to
one half times more phones during the
pre-order period than last year and it
seems that the most popular of these two
was the Galaxy s7 edge and we don't
blame them bundle notifications and
direct replies are probably the hottest
thing that we saw with the whole Android
and preview make sure you watch our two
videos regarding this topic but for
those of you that are wondering what
Google is planning to do with its
existing applications things are
actually already on the go as we hear
that hangouts eight point 0 is going to
reach devices very soon and it will
support just the two features that i
just mentioned right now obviously there
is a lot more to talk about what android
and we can wait to see more whatever
google i/o starts in the next few months
and if you remember many of the rumors
of the Apple watch before it launched
some of the features that were touted is
that this would be the medical device to
go for parent leupold was looking to
make this watch extremely useful for
physicians to diagnose to their patients
like if you had any sort of issue with
diabetes for example the family Apple
has just started editing that it seems
that future versions of the apple watch
will be able to detect if you're going
through some sort of a problem and
contact emergency services rather cool
let's just wait for it to happen and
finally the very hot news today is the
news that everybody's been waiting for
polls event announcement for March 21st
and yeah it's rather interesting that
Apple does that exactly one day before
the Samsung Galaxy s7 launched the
company is obviously trying to make a
statement it wouldn't be the first time
that it does it and obviously we hear
that the iphone s key is going to make
this event in addition to the new iPad
but hey we'd love to know in the
comments down below for the question of
today what r addictions do you have for
this event 12 what would you like to see
at this event in my case I do feel that
Apple needs to revamp the Apple watch
and I feel that that will be part of the
event but I'm also looking forward to
that ipad air three with better speakers
leave us a comment down below we would
love to know your opinion friends you
