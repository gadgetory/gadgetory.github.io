primarily but that doesn't mean we don't
often cover devices that may not come to
America I'm Michael Fisher with pocket
now we're having a look at the archos 53
platinum a new large device at Aoife
let's check it out now this is the
second big phone we've seen in about a
half hour we just came from Acer where
we were checking out their liquid s2 and
this resembles that device a little
smaller at 5.3 inch diagonal screen size
but the rounded corners are much the
same the earpiece is a little bit more
conventional it's a 2 megapixel camera
up front primary shooters an 8 megapixel
camera around the back and you can see
we just wipe this down folks you know
they this this is not hyper glazed
because it's not a Samsung product but
it might as well because you just
smudges up right right quick one of
those things you got to learn to live
with on some of these high-end devices
there's a volume rocker on the left
Tower standby on the right under the
thumb where it belongs three capacitive
keys underneath here's that 5.3 inch
screen running Android for 12 it is 10
min jump in the camera there it is a
very close to stock build of android
controlling this device radios for HSPA
don't not seeing any spec for LTE here
here's the notification toggles in the
drop-down tray we're in the German
setting but really not a whole lot to
see on the software side let's hop back
into that camera just to see what we're
looking at once again
not have not heard of any plans for us
release this is a quad-core processor
one point two gigahertz backed up by a
single gig of ram so this is maybe more
in the vein of the samsung galaxy mega
not spec for spec but just as a large
device that's not necessarily the
highest end around we might have more on
the archos 53 platinum where it's also
flanked by the 50 platinum the and other
metal inspired and element inspired
brand names but the free platinum is was
announced about four weeks ago so we
wanted to make sure to take a look at it
while we were here at etha and we're
looking a lot more at eva in the days
ahead so stay tuned to pocket now anton
denote doing his excellent camera work
as usual thank you everyone for watching
we'll see you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
