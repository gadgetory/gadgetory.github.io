broken once again one plus CEO TSYS how
good the camera on its next smartphone
will be and it seems that German
automakers want to snatch mapping away
from Nokia I'm hi Mary vera and I'm
wondering exactly how much money would
Apple have left after paying many
countries national debt this is parking
out daily the official news should i
start with apple as the company has
seated beta 4 of iOS 9 OS 10 El Capitan
and also watch os/2 now the company
hasn't really provided details as to
what bugs were fixed with the the
desktop operating system in the watch
operating system but in the case of iOS
9 we are getting the return of home
sharing in addition to picture in
picture mode for podcasts so yeah major
upgrades let's see when these changes
come to the public beta I even though
these news haven't really become
official apparently it will have it in
the next few days German automakers like
BMW mercedes-benz and all you want to
acquire nokia here master around 2.7
billion dollars which is very
interesting according to the source
these companies do not want to depend on
a Google Maps future and they also want
to work on their own self driving cars
and they will need software for this to
happen let's just see if it happens in
the end because these were the only
companies they wanted to acquire these
services for ebony but Apple wasn't
treated and the relative teasers for the
oneplus 2 continues as the company CEO
has just shown as a comparison of photos
between the iphone 6 and the oneplus 2
and the galaxy s6 and the oneplus 2 and
while we do see similar performance on
macro shots with the galaxy s6
comparison it's interesting that he
decided to compare it against the iphone
6 and nighttime photography and not the
galaxy s6 obviously the galaxy s6 is
much better performing in this
department and yeah it does seem like
the camera won't be as perfect as we
expect because obviously he could have
done a full comparison now retailers
have begun teasing what to expect for
next week's a probable announcement of
the new Moto G we're expecting that to
happen we've got so many leaks but they
kind of confirm the specs we've heard of
a 720p display Snapdragon 410 in
addition
they're things but what we hadn't heard
of yet was the price tag and it seems
that it will retail for 199 euros which
is a sort of around that amount in
dollars but we do expect for that to be
a similar amount meeting 199 dollars we
will see and keep you posted and finally
for the very interesting news of the day
apples q3 earnings are out and well the
company has broken records in some
departments sorry with the iphone the
company is up by staggering amount by
selling forty seven point five million
iphones for the quarter now where the
company is down is in the case of the
iPads they're down to 10.9 million units
which is extremely interesting but even
more is the fact that the company was
reluctant to provide Apple watch numbers
up to the point where they buried these
sales in the other department and even
though that department is up by 1.4
billion dollars which means and
according to them that a hundred percent
of that revenue came from the Apple
watch you could assume that they sold
1.4 billion dollars in Apple watch units
but the fact that they don't want to
provide any solid numbers leads us to
the question of the day why do you think
Apple continues to hide these numbers
from investors and everybody else in my
case I feel that it's because the watch
ended up disappointing in sales but
leave us a comment down below what do

drill if you would I get the nose
