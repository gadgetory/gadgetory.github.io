with another android quick tip this time
having to do with Google Maps let's go
take a look okay so this is the Samsung
Epic 4G and I'm showing you a Google
Maps version 5 and I don't know how long
this feature has been inside Google Maps
so if you know please let us know in the
comments below but let's just get a
quick overview so you can kind of pan
around here you can see where I am you
can see you know where's the freeway the
other side that the foothills you know
the mountains and whatnot over there so
it's great well if you look over here
you've got this little where am I
icon for lack of a better word you tap
on that and just like that it shows you
exactly where you want are in the map so
doesn't matter where you've gone where
you've navigated off to let you know
right there right where you are but now
if you notice it's changed to a compass
rose and this is something that I didn't
know before
so the compass rose now shows you you
know this is just your kind of fixed
right here North is up just like on any
map but when in this mode if you touch
it again immediately you get this little
on-screen compass it tilts the display
down into kind of a 3d mode and the
compass rose is now off kilter now what
do I mean by that it's not north is up
anymore in fact if you take a look based
on the digital compass inside your phone
it's going to orient north to north now
is that helpful well in this view
probably not that much but if I'm
walking or if I'm driving it's really
nice if the way that I'm heading is the
way that I'm heading and North really
doesn't matter because I'm just
interested in my next turn right left
turn around you know whatever it may be
now to go back very simply just touch it
again to get the old behavior just
scroll it off to the side and it's back
to the return to home just
really fast so really kind of cool
something you may not have known before
so with today's Android quick tip I'm
Joe for pocketnow.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
