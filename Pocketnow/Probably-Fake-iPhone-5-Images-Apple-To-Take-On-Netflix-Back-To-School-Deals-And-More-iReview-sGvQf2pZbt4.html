the scene Apple out to compete with
Netflix and rumors of an iphone 5 launch
push through October all the soon more
coming up right now hello everybody I'm
hi everyone and welcome to the pocket
now I review the show we go through all
this week's cool and not-so-cool inside
the world of Apple's iOS devices let's
start this week off with the cool all
right let's face it the only reason why
back to school is school is because of
the deals that you get around the iphone
is up for trading program and target
where you can turn in your old iphone 3g
or 3gs and get up to 150 dollars off
your next iPhone 4 which is really cool
depends on the conditions of your phone
and well that's after 2-year contract
obviously and well radioshack also has
the iphone 4 and iphone 3gs on sale
though you have to go to the stores and
find them and aside from that well II a
mobile has this really massive sale
where they're dropping the price tag on
almost all if not their best games for
eighty percent that includes games like
fifa madden risk and other really good
games that are costing you just the buck
but remember that's only for this
weekend animal number EA is not really a
fan of building universal applications
so your games that are purchased on the
iPhone one work on the iPad better make
sure you use this deal to get yourself
some iPad applications or iPhone
applications aside from that infinity
blade has been sliced to fifty percent
off so better make sure you get on top
of that too speaking of games the one
that finally made it to the App Store is
the one we were waiting for since last
year final fantasy tactics is now being
sold and if it doesn't ring a bell it's
because you probably weren't old enough
to use an old playstation back in 1998
and yes that's playstation 1 not
playstation nothing and while the game
is a universal application it works for
your ipad iphone and ipod touch and it
brings a full port of the game though
it's still a work in progress there are
still program updates that are coming in
and we do hope that they also plan to
downgrade that price tag because for 16
bucks it's a lot of money but
I know it'll bring back a lot of
memories for a lot of us so if you still
want to get it go ahead but I still
think the PlayStation 1 is cheaper on
ebay than buying this app seriously all
right so what's all this talk about
itunes replay many of you are
complaining that iTunes Match wasn't
really what you expected because you
wanted streaming and all apples offering
you is you know 25 bucks a year for
itunes to swap all your pirated music
and that's pretty much it but many of us
weren't complaining because when you
don't have unlimited data plans it's
really smart then you don't have to be
streaming your music all the time but
Apple seems to be cutting deals with TV
companies to allow you to pay a flat fee
for renting movies but wait a minute
isn't that what Netflix to us yes that's
what Netflix thus so it seems that Apple
is out to compete with Netflix in some
sort of way so since Apple is not really
famous and being cheaper than anybody
else it seems that apple will probably
bring some sort of Netflix service but
with a kick probably something different
we could probably see better TV shows
there or probably see newer movies if
Apple were ever able to pull off adding
music to the service for those people
that do have an unlimited data plan
it'll be a winner so let's see what
happens and as we get close to the
not-so-cool session let's talk about all
these weird images of a supposedly
thinner iphone that have been around
personally I don't believe that they're
real first of all his moto has it found
it in the bar so don't consider that
credible yet and also they seem to be
identical to an image that gets moto was
able to make in Photoshop so it just
ported from the old iphone 4s and no
given the ipad 2 in the ipod touch looks
so much the same right now we are
bidding on money on the iphone 5 looking
a lot like these devices with a curved
back and leaks of images and cases are
confirming that that's pretty much going
to be the case i mean these same case
companies were the ones that leaked the
ipad 2 imagery so we do see that is
going to happen and if you ask me are i
would love to see an old aluminum iphone
you know but with a new design so let's
hope and see what happens as long as
apple hurries up we don't care what they
come up with most probably it'll be good
but before we continue I'd like to thank
all of you personally for supporting our
windows phone view and Android
revolution shows that complemented this
I review as of this week we're working
hard behind the scenes to bring you
cutting edge content and everything that
happens in your smartphone platform of
choice aside from that remember to visit
dan Webster's iOS App Store pic Windows
Phone 7 app roundup and his famous
android application weekly all really
good shows that are programmed during
the week to bring you the best of
everything that's happening on your
smartphone platform of choice again
thank you very much for supporting us
and thank you very much for your thumbs
up ok so that does it for the cool let's
continue on with the not so cool Apple
hasn't confirmed when they're going to
launch the next generation iphone and
well even though most speculation has it
for august and sep tember releases all
things d seems to already have learned
that they'll be pushing the release to
october instead of these dates not sure
of apples having some sort of difficulty
in building the new phone but it strikes
me weird that apple would push their
September music event to an event in
October could it be that they'll
announce something in September and have
the phone release in October it could be
and you know whatever happens is better
than us having another scandal called
release gate after antennagate and glass
gate okay so not only does AT&amp;amp;T know
that you have a jailbroken iphone that
you're tethering without their
permission with an application called
mywi from cydia but they plan to do
something about it as of august eleventh
AT&amp;amp;T is threatening to cancel all
unlimited data plans of users that are
abusing my why to pull tethering without
paying extra bucks sadly though we also
have found out that AT&amp;amp;T knows that your
tethering through my why because my
white tells you or sorry tells AT&amp;amp;T that
your tethering but our advice to you is
to give a try to an application called
pdanet in cydia which is actually free
as opposed to my wire we have to pay
money and it has this option where you
can actually not tell AT&amp;amp;T that you're
tethering not really sure it works we
haven't confirmed it personally but it's
completely free so you have nothing to
lose our advice to you is give it a try
and see if you get that pesky message
from AT&amp;amp;T telling you that you're using
a joke
an iphone but if you don't get anything
most probably it's got your back so
let's see what happens probably my Y
will update their application in the
future but why that happens you might
was might as well prepare and to top the
week off with ridiculous news get your
hands on no wait get just get your Angry
Birds bra while supplies last I can't
believe I'm actually wasting a segment
on this I just considered it hilarious I
mean anyways that's it for today's show
thank you very much for watching I'm
high metal you better remember to give
us a thumbs up if you liked what you saw
that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
