every bit as interesting as we were
expecting the iPhone 8 also got
announced showing a refreshed approach
to old designs and the Apple watch
series 3 keeps the design but bring some
new features I'm Jaime Rivera this is
definitely iPhone day so let's just go
through all the hot things that were
announced this is PocketNow daily the
official news today are actually
everything except this piece which is
the only non apple news that we got it
has to do with the galaxy note 9 or
whatever that is going to be dubbed
we've got sources claiming that that
whole claim and project of Samsung
trying to bring foldable displays to
smartphones is actually what the company
is planning to bring for the Galaxy Note
9 apparently the foldable displays and
actually a foldable device is the whole
plan that we should expect and that's
actually a good thing as you know the
fact that the Galaxy Note 8 is a great
phone but it looks a lot like the s8 is
kind of getting boring let's see what we
get now let's move the spotlight over to
Apple and leave the spotlight at Apple
for everything else Apple just announced
a new Apple TV that now supports 4k not
exactly sure what took apples so long to
support the standard but yeah 4k HDR in
addition to pretty much every single HDR
standard is being announced today and if
you purchase the itunes movies in 1080p
you actually now get them upgraded for
free to 4k which is also great and there
are also certain benefits with the a 10x
fusion chip that's being added to the
Apple TV for performance starting with
gaming you can learn more in the
description and for those of you
wondering what exactly we were getting
with the Apple watch Series 3 it is
confirmed that we get an LT capable
Apple watch but that's not the only
Series three there is actually a non LTE
capable Apple watch as well for those of
you that want it and the benefits are
actually a couple starting with the fact
that Siri now responds to you the fact
that Apple music now streams everything
to your Apple watch if you want to the
fact that again because you have an LTE
capable Apple watch you have that
benefit that you don't need to be
carrying your iPhone but it actually
ports the phone number from your iPhone
to your Apple watch which is actually
also cool you can learn more about the
benefits the link in the description
the price tag is actually not any more
expensive which is even better and how
about if we cover the iPhone 8 and
iPhone 8 plus sure they look a lot like
last year's iPhones but they bring a
couple of benefits that are significant
starting with the glass backs now
supporting wireless charging and it's
actually the Qi standard which is great
not something proprietary from Apple in
addition to that we also get benefits
like better 12 megapixel cameras with a
refresh sensor it actually includes this
new lighting feature for portrait mode
which is interesting in addition to that
we also have this new 8:11 Bionic chip
that brings this whole neural benefit
that's actually only taking advantage of
with the iPhone 10 that we're about to
talk about surely yes these are new
iPhones that look a lot like old ones
but they actually add the benefit that
if you don't want to get the new iPhone
that's crazy expensive you can still
keep buying the iPhones that look like
last year's ones with the only thing
that these actually get $50 more
expensive that's interesting as well and
finally the very hot news that they have
to do with the iPhone 10 I was watching
the event and I was like Apple there has
to be one more thing and there was the
iPhone 10 is apparently going to be the
future of smartphones and it makes sense
I mean if you look at it it's all
display at the front that's the way
smartphones should be and we've got a
5.8 inch OLED true tone display that's
super retina in addition to the a 11
fusion Bionic ship and I'm even getting
confused
we've got 12 megapixel cameras at the
back that are actually fully both
optically stabilized and in addition to
that we've got more technology like for
example this new face ID which actually
has this new depth sensor at the
front-facing camera that also provides
the functionality of portrait mode
addition to that the home button is
dying we've got the benefit of a swipe
gesture to be able to use that as the
home button and it seems the face idea
state-of-the-art according to Apple it's
even better than touch ID when it comes
to reliability that's something we'll
have to prove in our review there's just
so much with this iPhone 10 that we
cannot wait to get our hands on it
surely it's crazy expensive the with the
price tag of every other flagship
phablet right now it kind of makes sense
that it leads me to the question today
I mean what do you think what do you
think about the iPhone 10 in my case I
don't remember the last time I was so
excited for a smartphone obviously we
will review it will let you know more
but I will tell you this much I can't
wait to give it a try
