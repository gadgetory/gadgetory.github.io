audio as aggressively as HTC most
noticeably pushing the boundaries on
speaker design but also creating
higher-quality experiences with the
internal phone guts for headphone audio
the u11 has finally arrived in my office
and while it looks to be a solid
all-rounder flagship phone I'm most
curious to hear what it can do with my
favorite music and movies now the third
phone from this manufacturer to omit the
3.5 millimeter headset jack in favor of
a proprietary USB solution as we
transition out of established audio
hardware the U 11 adopts a few neat
tricks which HTC hopes will impress
starting off with speaker performance
HTC is using two speakers but not in a
traditional stereo setup stereo features
left and right channels like your
headphones the u11 uses the smaller
earpiece for higher frequencies and the
larger bottom speaker for mids and lows
it's an overall more nuanced sound than
what you can achieve with a single
speaker but it does lack a little depth
compared to traditional stereo and
occasionally high frequencies will be
exaggerated
the headphone discussion also requires a
bit of unpacking there is no dedicated
headphone jack but happily HTC does
include a USBC adapter with a built-in
DAC and amp recognising that while there
are some quality earbuds in the box some
folks might want to bring their own cans
to the party
unfortunately this solution is somewhat
disappointing considering the
competition it faces at this price tear
the phone is more than capable of
playing 32-bit audio files but output
seems to be truncated to CD quality
against phones like the g6 and s8 we see
noticeably more noise and less dynamic
range and this is a significant step
back from the HTC 10 even opposite
another dongle player like the iPhone
HTC's quality numbers just can't quite
match Apple's lightning adapter DAC now
this can be masked somewhat as the amp
output lines right up with the LG G six
Galaxy S 8 and one plus three T some
good punch to drive consumer headphones
but not quite powerful enough to really
properly drive higher-end options once
the impedance of your headphones climbs
the u 11 sounds dull and it's seriously
outclassed by the axon 7 and LG v 20 HTC
solution is the u sonic system earbuds
in the box which work with software on
the phone to tailor fit your audio
playback while making EQ and noise
reduction adjustments based on the
environment around you a very short scan
adjusts audio frequencies to your ears
and it's fully automatic
unlike the hearing test Samsung puts you
through the scan works surprisingly well
the result might be a touch bright for
my tastes but sampling a variety of
musical genres I'm extremely grateful
you sonic isn't just trying to impress
me with a generic smileyface EQ or skull
rumbling mega bass the noise reduction
in environment sampling is a nice trick
as well a second after you push play
listening to that slight pop as the
phone adjusts for your location it's a
great combo passive noise reduction from
blocking the ear canal and active audio
shaping from the mics and software on
the phone
if you commute on public transit you're
gonna love this but it did make me feel
a bit detached walking around outside
these might not be the best option for
outdoor workouts and situational
awareness inner aural earbuds are very
personal accessories and I found this
edge here to be a touch uncomfortable
when worn for longer periods of time but
the shape should be a good option for
many folks in our audience the driver
housing resting on this part of the ear
right before the ear canal it's
difficult to try and deliver a
comparison with other manufacturer
included ear buds
we can't normalize for different phone
hardware in the htc ear buds only work
on HTC phones starting with the bolt
when viewed as a total package I like
the fit of the Samsung gear buds just a
little bit better but I prefer the
overall sound quality and noise
reduction technology on the u11 so this
is where I would normally say let's wrap
this up but I honestly had a bit of
difficulty writing the conclusion to
this review with the u 11 HTC has done a
terrific job of including a full phone
experience in the Box a snap-on case
great your buds and a headphone dongle
viewed in a vacuum you 11 owners are
pretty well stocked it's when we expand
our personal area network to include
other devices and we have some concerns
at a tablet or a laptop and now I need
to carry different headphones for
different devices or if I only want to
carry one pair of headphones I need to
put the really good use sonic earbuds
aside and use a lesser DAC dongle if I
ever lose these earbuds they won't be as
easy to replace as any pair of
traditional headphones
it seems that phone manufacturers will
eventually walk away from photo Jack's
in favor of digital interfaces for
cabled audio USB C is as good a
candidate as any other to get that job
done but this is a poor way to create a
new audio standard USB C is becoming a
common port but these headphones won't
work with anything else that has the
same shape connector I was frustrated by
this on the bowl and I still think it's
a recipe for consumer irritation will it
be a deal-breaker no not at all but
a tiny rock in your shoe whenever you
need to work around it
HTC remains a force for smartphone sound
though this transition has been
hamstrung by Google and androids
terrible support for USB audio I think
it likely that removing the 3.5
millimeter jack will do more to ramp up
bluetooth adoption than it will to help
usher in a new audio cable standard the
U 11 isn't vying for the power player
audiophile crown instead HTC is moving
mass-market with some surprisingly techy
features the execution of advanced audio
concepts is fantastically well done and
delightfully easy for the owner to
implement and that should be music to
most folks ears right out of the box
just don't lose any of these pieces as
