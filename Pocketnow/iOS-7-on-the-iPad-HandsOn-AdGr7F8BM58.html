couple of minor improvements you now can
also install it on the iPad now the
biggest question that everybody's asking
is is there really anything to be
excited about here so let's find out I'm
Jaime Rivera this is PocketNow and these
are hands-on iOS 7 on the iPad if you're
familiar with our video of Iowa 7 beta 1
the difference is between beta 1 and 2
are very minor except for the fact that
there are some performance improvements
that you can barely see it does seem a
little faster but it still has trouble
understanding gestures every now and
then then aside from that the other
unproven that you do get is that you've
now get the voice memos back which were
lost after beta 1 and well all you're
getting is actually a redesigned version
of the application but not necessarily
something better just the less
skeuomorphic UI if you could actually
call it that way now for those of you
that were expecting any dramatic
differences in iOS 7 on the iPad I'm sad
that this appoint you this is still the
same blown-up version of iOS from the
iPhone on a bigger canvas so you can
still slide from side to side
now you can swipe down just like you can
on the iPhone to get search instead of
going to the left which is significantly
better than before you'll notice that
you still get this textured keyboard
that adapts to whatever background you
have just like you can in the iPhone and
on the iPad you can still separate the
keyboard you can still move it up and
down some of the icons like for example
this keyboard icon on the bottom looks
terrible I think there are probably some
design enhancements that are still in
the works and it does port to other
portions of the iPad there this seem to
be more of work to be done here I'll
give you one example let's go into the
music application so for example if you
go into the music application on the
iPhone they try to move into it right
now notice that you get the normal UI
when it's portrait and then when you put
it on landscape you'd get this nice
Cover Flow version or cover tile version
of what music is now and if you try to
do the same thing on the iPad you all
you get is the same list it doesn't vary
it doesn't enhance you can go into song
to go into gen Donner's you can go
anywhere and you do not get a better
of the music application which is odd
since the music application on the iPad
on iOS 6 was actually superior to what
it is now on iOS 7 and I'll give you
another example we can go into calendar
for example and let me go into the
calendar on the iPhone and you'll notice
that on the iPhone there is very
efficient usage of the canvas you can
you have your dates you have everything
but if you do the same thing on the iPad
you go to the day view you'll notice
that everything is whiter but it's not
more efficient there is a lot of space
to do more here and still this doesn't
adapt to the left and you don't get
something better at the right it is just
a very lean and extremely white version
of the same application so if you asked
me was it better back when it was
skeuomorphic I'll say that it was better
I do believe that there is still a lot
of work to be done this beta 2 and I
don't feel that these are final
applications the photo application does
seem to be finished you can go into
collections and do the same things that
you can do in the past with iOS 6 it
doesn't vary there so I don't think that
there will be any major enhancements
here for example you go into the camera
application and here you get the same
features that you get on the iPhone you
can still slide for photo for video you
know you get square options
I still don't find the option to
actually be able to enhance the photos
with different scenes so it does seem
that this will be exclusive to the
iPhone or it probably Beach is not
available for this particular iPad
remember the iPad Mini is more of an
entry level tablet you go into contacts
again here you do get a pane on the left
and the pin at the right which is fine
but no major enhancements just a wider
version of the skeuomorphic UI that
existed before and well the only
difference back then was that that was
greater than this so I can't really call
it better another enhancement is the
fact that Siri gets a new voice but
let's listen to it how many kilometers
are in 23 miles
what do you think about that 23 miles
converts to about 37 kilometers
now hopefully you noticed this it sounds
like if the voice has a little more
pitch but then it's still series voice
just different and but it doesn't sound
any more natural like for example you do
get on Google as a voice search now on
Android and notice the UI if I had to
compare this to the skeuomorphic UI that
we had before the skeuomorphic you I was
better presented this text it's being
highlighted doesn't look any better or
more readable than it looked on the
previous version of how Sri handled
everything and yeah I am gonna complain
about the fact that we get dinged for
search one that does annoy me a lot is
the notes application look at it it
looks extremely white and this yellow
text looks extremely annoying as well
try to go into all of I clawed let me
look into one that has a link and notice
you have this yellow text you can barely
read it and for those of you that think
that this is not skeuomorphic well they
got rid of the notepad yellow but this
texture looks white actually like white
paper like real paper so it is
skeuomorphic and the yellow links are
costly terrible it does seem like if
this version on the ipad needs more work
reminders is just an overlay of whatever
is at the bottom but it looks exactly
like it did in the past without the
texture again going back to the same
problem photo booth again just the
different UI you can take your
photograph and you can't really enhance
it in any way so there's really nothing
significant here to show game center
takes a lot of time to load there does
seem to be a lot more work coming here
but it does look again just like a blown
version of the iPhone with no really
major enhancements notice how long it
took to load and then you can just touch
it and it'll give you different options
for Game Center nothing really out of
the ordinary
sadly I haven't loaded any magazines for
newsstand just yet to show them to you
some of them are really crashing on the
iPhone so I don't think it's even worth
it to show going into the stores for
example if you go into the iTunes Store
again all we're getting is a
less gray version of what we had on iOS
6 on the iPad at least nothing really
significant you can still flip through
everything here nothing was really
enhanced in the clock version again you
get rid of the Swiss clock style clocks
that they had before they got sued for
nothing really major in these changes it
just looks whiter not different just
whiter and even though there are changes
in the messaging application I'm sadly
not able to show it to you here you now
get photos of your contacts on group
messaging by it by the way it's not for
every message just group messaging
nothing major here as well you go into
the settings happen again this is just
the wider and greener version of
something that already existed in gravy
for nothing really significantly better
we go to Safari and you do get the same
tabs you do get the same fullscreen way
to load the website it is you know
interesting that it doesn't recess to
the top as it does on the iPhone I'm
probably waiting for this to come in a
future version you see we add new tabs
and you do get the tab browsing and you
see how fast it can load pocket now over
Wi-Fi this is an iPad on this is a Wi-Fi
only iPad so it's taking a little bit to
load the images but it doesn't stutter
while you're navigating let me see if
multitasking gestures work yes they do
you can still do the four finger swipe
to the top to multitask it is better
than the iPhone and detecting swipes it
is but so far it I can't really consider
it to be better than the iPhone now for
those of you that are rocking an iPad 2
or an iPad Mini you will be disappointed
if you want to launch an iPhone
application on this thing sadly you're
not getting any enhancements meaning
everything still all text looks jagged
it does notice that this seem that it's
not enhanced for the iPad like you do
get on the red of this play iPad and
that's really sad because you can
jailbreak your iPad and get this problem
fixed but you can't do it on the native
version of iOS you'll be going to
third-party
applications like YouTube which is made
by Google everything works as it should
like it that was working on iOS 6
obviously these applications will
probably be enhanced in the future for
the iPad depending on house you morphic
they were again iOS 7 on the iPad is
different you get a control center at
the bottom notice that it is a little
more minimalistic than it was on the
iPhone meaning that the icons are lower
but not really better another change is
notice that notification center now
bounces at the bottom instead of just
staying there that was something that
was not available on beta 1 but do you
want me to consider this better or worse
again it's just different
so bottom line iOS 7 on the iPad is
something that you're gonna get it'll
probably make the iPad work better as
the betas progress eventually and we
will keep you posted on these changes
but so far
iOS 7 beta 2 does not seem to be any
significant improvement to what we had
before and in the case of for example
the music application I would call this
like two steps back to what we had
before but we will keep you posted again
this is pre-production software
it'll probably be enhanced in near
future that's it for today's hands-on
