calm we're going to take a look at some
of the new windows live features right
here i have my pocket controller
connected to windows mobile 6.5 phone
and background i have a regular web
browser now you may have heard that when
it was live is going through way for
recently and just the other day hotmail
was updated but what you may not have
heard is that windows live home was also
updated if you look at this it may look
pretty similar to before but guess what
now i have facebook updates from all of
my facebook friends even if they're not
on windows live so these people don't
have Windows Live profiles or you know
windows live social accounts but there
are my friends on Facebook so they show
up here you can see I can even read
comments and I can post comments and it
will add them to facebook under my
facebook account and this is all from
the new windows live homepage you'll
also see if i can find any for myspace
updates in the air
as well as windows live updates we see
only Facebook ones right now but anyway
you can take my word for it also if I go
to my profile you will see my twitter
updates and Facebook updates
everything's right here so that's really
nice feature and the same happens when
you log in from a mold of ice so here I
am I'll show you the URL mobile.live.com
thats trying to load something and up at
the top it shows my latest status update
then I got the inbox and down here I got
the same thing facebook updates from my
facebook camp right here in windows left
so you can kind of get an idea about how
this might be integrated into future
versions of Windows Phone 7 and even
windows live messenger maybe even xbox
so here we hope pretty nice you got
comments here of course as well and all
the way at the bottom you can add photo
or update your personal message and from
the desktop you can set you know what
updates go where
so really nice you can also sort in
different ways
and you can get your profile from the
mobile device
so lots of great stuff here really cool
upgrading that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
