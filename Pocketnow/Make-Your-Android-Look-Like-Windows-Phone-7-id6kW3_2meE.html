pocketnow.com if you want the look of
Windows Phone 7 on your Android there's
an app for that
okay so this app is called launcher
seven and it is free in the Android
Market and it's actually pretty cool
what it does it is just a launcher so
basically you're going to get a bunch of
tiles on your home screen with not much
functionality you can't have live tiles
you can't have a tile showing you the
weather but it does work a little bit
with notification so for example the
phone tile has the number of missed
calls
you can also have certain tiles display
the number of missed SMS the number of
missed emails we'll cover that in a sec
but it looks pretty good it looks just
like Windows Phone 7 it's got the
physics of Windows Phone 7
you've got the swipe to the right and
the swipe to the left to access all of
your stuff we even have this zoom like
Windows Phone 7 like toggle which allows
you to switch between various
applications on your device accidentally
hit places there and so let's talk about
how you you manage this so just like in
Windows Phone 7 if you tap and hold on a
tile you can drag it around and the
animations are pretty much the same as
Windows Phone 7 we also have an unpin
button here so you can remove something
from the screen another new feature that
you don't get a Windows Phone 7 is this
ability to edit the tile so we can
actually change the color of the tile
have every tile be a different color you
can't do this in Windows Phone 7 so
let's do that let's make that a
different color so now camera icon is
blue other things we can do we can
actually change the size of the tile we
can change or integrate unread email
counts unread SMS count missed phone
count into the various different tiles
we can change the icon so we can have a
custom icon and so on and so forth and
let's see how it works if you want to
add something new so we tap and hold
hinto homescreen and here are all the
settings for the phone screen so we can
actually change the tile size we can
make it 2 by 1 we can change the icon we
can change the title if we want so we
can make this say hello
you can change the tile color some extra
options that you saw before and we click
press click to add tile and anything
that is a 2 by 1 or 1 by 2 you have to
add a custom icon so we're going to keep
it as a 1 by 1 tile tile just to keep it
simple
we scroll down to the bottom there it is
there's my hello tile I'm gonna bring
this up to where there's the blank spot
there are some a settings associated
with the whole entire launcher so if you
press the Settings button go to launcher
7 settings you can change the tile color
for the entire interface here so we can
choose any color in Windows Phone 7 you
get a choice of like 10 but in this case
you get a full color wheel you can
change to any color that you want let's
go with this kind of blue color that
looks nice and we can change some status
bar options use Windows Phone 7 style
and status bar transparent status bar a
lot of really cool options here that you
can choose from and if we go back you'll
see everything changed and now we have
Windows Phone 7 style everything so the
status bar has disappeared the launcher
has disappeared but this looks just like
Windows Phone 7 in fact I'm sure you can
trick some friends into believing that
you have Windows Phone 7 running on your
Android phone which would be kind of
cool by the way again it's called
launcher 7 really cool it's free it's ad
supported so you'll get an annoying add
everywhere but hey it's 0 of dollars
can't argue with that if you liked this
video please give it a thumbs up and
thanks for watching that's it for now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
