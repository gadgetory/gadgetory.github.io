I remarked at how much better the
headphone dongle worked over other audio
dongles and many folks in our comments
seemed to think that was us acting like
fanboys apologizing for Google where
we'd criticized Apple in the past I'm
not sure how much clearer I could have
been in that video when I said quote I
hate dongles
but apparently that still wasn't clear
enough
regardless spending a weekend with
Google's second-generation consumer
flagship and we're ready to report on
the overall audio quality of the phone
Apple II a lot has improved here's our
Google pixel 2 real audio review brought
to you by D brand starting off with the
speakers while the pixel 2 still has
sizable forehead and chin bezels at
least that area is put to better use a
somewhat Xperia like form-factor
front-facing speakers are always a nice
touch for videos and games very
competitive against similar stereo
solutions and easily besting all of the
mono speaker phones we've reviewed this
year
switching to the headphone game this is
a bit more nuanced the first pixel was a
poor performer last year circling the
drain alongside the LG g5 this year
Google could not be trying to emulate
Apple more if they tried even down to
dongle performance which is nearly
identical to the Jack supplied with the
iPhone seven and eight
that means while cable connections are
less convenient for keeping track of
this thing audio quality is
significantly better than last year's
pixel that also means that many quality
metrics are neck-and-neck with the
Galaxy S 8 and Note 8 this year the
major trade-off Samsung phones will
properly output the full frequency range
of 32 bit 192 kogo files where the
iPhones and pixel are closer to CD
quality but the amp on Samsung phones is
slightly weaker than those dongles aside
from its inability to reproduce
frequencies of sound that dogs cannot
hear the pixel 2 is a much more
competitive performer against this
year's flagships of course - the V 30
which handily stomps all over every
other phone released in 2017 a little
explanation of my comments from our
first impressions video is in order why
I am happier with this dongle well it
actually has very little to do with the
dongle I'm happy to see Google implement
a real universal solution that other
manufacturers can build products for HTC
and Motorola have proprietary dongles
sure they use USB C ports but only work
on HTC or Motorola phones
I cannot plug HTC's excellent earbuds
into anything else other than an HTC
phone
by contrast Google's dongle worked on my
laptop's Thunderbolt port and my LG v 30
Google's dongle not only worked on an
HTC u 11 but delivered significantly
better results than HTC's dongle so what
does this mean for the future of
consumer audio well why should we rely
on phone manufacturers to build good
I do Hardware not all phono jacks are
created equal right so if we consumers
invested in a really good pair of cabled
USBC headphones we're a well-respected
audio manufacturer was responsible for
tuning the hardware like Sennheiser
Audio Technica
B&amp;amp;O bearer dynamic Sony etc then it
would not matter what phone or computer
we owned we would always have extremely
high quality audio playing from
entry-level and mid-range fare all the
way up to $1,000 Samsung your headphone
purchase would last for as long as USB C
ports are still around ultimately yeah
it is frustrating that this audio
hardware isn't just built into the phone
there's nothing special about this form
factor which would have precluded
including a jack so I still question the
motives in removing it I still feel that
it's more a ploy to improve accessory
sales at the time of the phone purchase
more than it could be for any announced
consumer benefit but if we are going to
remove the 3.5 millimeter jack at least
now we have a real path for audio
manufacturers to follow a do that the
included support for high quality
Bluetooth codecs and that's a best of
both world situation better wireless
quality for the convenience factor and
for folks who still care about the
advantages of cabled connections options
for the audio files to Google has been
promising better USB audio support since
Ice Cream Sandwich
so we're long overdue actually getting
it the pixel 2 isn't special on its own
but for audio fans we finally have some
hope for a universally supported future
and when you're out there bumpin those
hot jams on your hot new Google phone
shouldn't you be looking to protect it
from scratches debrand has a wide
collection of custom-fit skins in a
variety of textures and colors to add a
bit more style and keep that paint
looking clean head on over to D brand
