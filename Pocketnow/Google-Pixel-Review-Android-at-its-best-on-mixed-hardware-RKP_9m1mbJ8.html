been a high-end brand from the card book
pixel to the pixel see each iterations
serve the showcase with Google envision
as the best hardware and as a result
none came cheap 2016 is when the company
draws the line with smartphones and it's
time for our final verdict I'm high not
even at with pocket now and this is our
review of the Google pixel 2016 is a
very tough year to compete for starters
Google pretty much created the premium
mid-range category with the Nexus 4
showing the world that you didn't really
need to spend the crazy amount of cash
to get a really good smartphone that's
forward three years and now the market
is flooded with great premium mid
Ranger's and by consequence raising the
stakes for what defines a flagship
Google's decision to call its new
smartphone lineup the pixel speaks for
itself this is the company's showcase of
what Android smartphones should be so
that'll be the main theme for this
review the less important story for a
software company is actually one that
Google got right to a certain degree
it's truly a delight to hold the goal
pixel this is not just any anodized
aluminum but a thicker texture I've
never held before the top is then
complemented by a sheet of glass that
provides a very unique accent from a
distance flip the phone around and the
light kind of ends see there's this
insane chin in the top and the bottom
and no stereo speakers to give that any
real purpose and about the only reason
why I don't complain is because I really
like the 5-inch 1080p panel that lies
within Google made a great decision to
stick to AMOLED providing a very
immersive experience through deep color
and then other great choices power the
pixel the device holds the latest and
greatest Snapdragon 801 processor
matched with four gigs of RAM and a
rather sizable battery considering its
footprint if it wasn't for the lack of
expandable storage and the higher spec
for its water resistance from IP 53 and
the single firing speaker that sometimes
relax with intense audio this would
truly be a close to perfect phone from a
hardware perspective obviously if you
forget about the chins now we do get the
logic behind that remember Google is a
software company first as such this
device showcases the best that Android
has to offer with version 7.1 and boy
does Google get a ton of things right
here I have yet to experience lag and
absolutely any operation that I throw to
this phone from navigating through menus
to running apps and multi-window to
playing the most graphics intensive
games this phone just really doesn't
stop surprising me the best way to
describe the experience is delightful
that's really all you really want is for
your phone to do what you're asking it
to do and Google really delivers here
the pixel launcher also plays a key role
I am a big fan of dense grids of icons
in the homescreen and this one takes the
cake
want your app tray just slide from the
bottom one shortcuts the tar goes slide
from the navigation bar want some more
toggles just slide a second time want
Google now just slide from the left
Google is really invested in reducing
the time you take from going from A to B
and I really like it if anything I
changed the weird circular folders but
in a nutshell if we forget about that I
really wish that every company would
adopt either the launcher or at least
this mentality now we have to remember
the biggest selling point for the Google
pixel is the Google assistant simply say
okay Google with the phone on standby or
press and hold the home button then
you're off the idea is that Google wants
to provide you with a tool that helps
you access information in a
conversational way ask it anything you
want and you get cards or web searches
and then you can continue asking more
questions about specific topics without
the need of phrasing base elements in
your inquiry this is a really cool idea
that has a lot of promise but it still
isn't perfect sure you can ask it to set
an alarm or remind you of something but
at the time of this review there is
still limited access to third-party
integration so while you can ask it to
find you a good restaurant
it's not capable of booking a table for
you and then there's the problem that
you have to continuously be saying okay
Google for every single time you ask it
a question so the ideal human like
conversation is not really there and
well you can't really call it an
assistant of it can't really do many
things for you yet all that being said
we have to remember that this is
software and Google continuously does a
great job at evolving as a daily driver
and absolutely everything else I have to
admit that I really love this phone call
quality is great and I'm a big fan of
project by for its affordable rates dirt
cheap roaming fees and the fact that it
relies on three networks to connect this
has really allowed the pixel to excel in
both reliability and also battery life
I'm really surprised at how well this
phone lasts throughout the day and how
the battery is almost not affected on
standby and how quickly it charges
another feature I really like is the
camera following the legacy of the Nexus
6p software plays a big role in making
this phone a delight you may think that
it lags behind because of its lack of
optical image stabilization or the sub F
2.0 aperture camera but just double tap
on the power button launch the camera
and prepare to be surprised the phone
does a great job during the day in both
color saturation and contrast and in
most cases it does an admirable job in
low-light I also love that you really
never know when hdr+ kicks in as this
camera is really fast at taking the shot
and you know a very surreal experience
happens when you record video as you'll
notice that you're walking and the
viewfinder isn't actually bouncing with
you it's asset that we're already
stabilizing the shot while you're
filming and remember there is no
hardware to back that up to conclude if
we were to judge the goal pixel in a
bubble then it would be very easy for us
to recommend this phone we've got a
device that's really great to handle
with a very delightful experience in the
software and lots of promise with the
Google assistant and obviously an
ecosystem that makes Android so popular
the problem is that sadly this phone
doesn't exist in a bubble this is 2016
and if they're the same $650 that this
phone cost the new flagship mentality
includes features like stereo speakers
or additional ip67 water and dust
resistance and then there are devices
like the oneplus three then that's the
pixel in almost every specification and
delightful experience but for a lot less
money Google really needs to think twice
about its price tag because it really
doesn't give you all the bang for your
buck that other companies are offering
still if you don't mind the extra cash
you want to forget about the problem
with software updates and you're looking
for a great experience using Android but
it really doesn't get any better than
the Google pixel at least for now folks
