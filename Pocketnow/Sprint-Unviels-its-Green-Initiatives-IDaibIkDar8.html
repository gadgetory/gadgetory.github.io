you here disappointing my name is Ralph
Reed I'm vice president corporate social
responsibility for sprint and I'd like
to thank all of you for joining us here
this morning this is truly an important
day for spread and we're pleased that
you're joining us here for this
announcement of a major step that we're
taking in our environmental
environmental responsibility efforts
spread has always been known for our
corporate citizenship we take much pride
in that we love to support the
communities who are employees little
work and we also support our employees
through employee volunteerism as friend
we like to say that to be a corporate
citizen is a part of our DNA and that
starts from the top at our CEO please
join me in welcoming our president and
CEO dan
well good morning everyone and thank you
for joining us at the cooper-hewitt at
the cooper-hewitt national design museum
civil chavez said i'd like to especially
thank over gone from samsung and
elizabeth elizabeth warren mike Andrews
from the Nature Conservancy for for
being here sprint has a comprehensive
and proactive approach to our
environmental efforts which I'd like to
share with you today being
environmentally conscious makes good
business sense consumers want to buy
products from responsible companies and
they are increasingly affecting
corporations to take an active role of
protecting the environment more than
half of consumers are calling for
businesses to use renewable energy and
sixty percent of Americans are looking
to purchase greener products for
reducing carbon gas emissions to
greening our business operations and
setting aggressive goals Sprint is a
recognized leader in sustainability
Sprint's 200-acre both Overland Park
Kansas headquarters campus is one of the
most environmentally friendly campuses
in the country eighty percent of the
campus power comes from when I like to
joke because there are executives are
but this helps sprint ranked number 20
on the EPA's green power partner fortune
500 list over sixty percent of campuses
green space and his water would
recaptured water so that no city water
is used sprint leads the wireless
industry in the development and use uses
of alternative energy in our networks we
have more than 250 hydrogen fuel cell
our network and more are planned cleaner
and quieter than traditional backup
power sources the only byproducts of
hydrogen fuel cells or water any sprint
was the only wireless carry the received
a grant for fuel cell technology from
the US Department of Energy at 7.3
million dollars the largest single fuel
cell technology grant or provided as
part of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act we've significantly
reduced our IT based power consumption
by retiring more than 30 and reserves
which is the equivalent of removing 3200
cards in the road sprint was the first
wireless provider to become an epa claim
leaders party Sprint's industry-leading
recycling programs have kept more than
17 million wireless phones of the waste
stream our wireless recycling rate is
three times the industry average and the
proceeds from our recycling program go
to protecting the internet for children
we are proud of our leadership efforts
today but we're challenging ourselves in
our industry to do more by setting
aggressive improvement goals last year
of Sprint set an ambitious industry
first goal against the Atheneum to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
fifteen percent by 2017 to put this in
context this is equivalent to removing
one and a half million cars from the
road for a whole year earlier this year
we set another industry first goal to
collect ninety percent of wireless
devices sold by 2017 reuse and recycle
I'm proud to announce new additional
recive goals regarding spreads
environmental stewardship Sprint will be
the first US wireless carrier to
establish a set of an arm
design criteria for future devices and
accessories we are partnering with our
handset reference likes perplexed
samsung to ensure that new devices
contain sustainable design elements
utilize more sustainable packaging and
adopt greener manufacturing processes
we're greening our stores by establish
acre establishing a green print for
every sprint store refurbishment and new
bills this includes incorporating design
elements consistent with lead that's led
design standards and sustainable design
elements such as energy efficient
lighting and low water usage plumbing
features the rollout of these
energy-efficient upgrades will reduce
the carbon footprint at each store by an
estimated 19,000 pounds of co2
equivalents lastly we will reduce our
paper usage by thirty percent by 2012
continuing to encourage customers to
sign up for rebuilding as part of this
effort this will save more than 60
million pounds of paper or nearly
800,000 treats Sprint is the only
us-based carrier to have publicly set
such measurable and aggressive long-term
goals this approach makes our
environmental platform actionable and
holds us accountable as further
demonstration of our commitment to the
environment I am particularly pleased to
unveil the most full-featured
eco-friendly device in the United States
purple the reclaim from Samsung and spur
eighty percent of the replay is from
recyclable materials forty percent of
our phones casing is made from
bioplastic a renewable and biodegradable
resource the retain the reclaims
packaging is an eco-friendly designed
that is seventy percent recycled and one
hundred percent recyclable the phone's
charger
consumes 12 times less powerful than the
Energy Star standard there's even a
helpful alert which encourages users to
unplug the device when it's fully
charged the reclaimed is the most
full-featured free phone launched by
sprint at less than fifty dollars it
provides the latest in wireless
technology with Sprint's award-winning
one foot user interface of all the
must-have features to stay connected the
reclaim provides one-click access to
green content from discovery and from
all things green social sites like
Facebook MySpace and YouTube can be
instantly accessed by one point
experience reclaimed for yourself later
today we are proud of the reclaim of the
progress it reflects combining
eco-friendly materials with the very
latest technology finally I'd like to
announce prints collaboration with the
Nature Conservancy to support land and
resource conservation programs with cusp
with custom and customers purchase a
reclined two dollars from each device go
to the Nature Conservancy's adopt an
angle program which supports land
conservation across the United States
our partnership is an example of how
private organizations and companies can
join forces to do good thank you for
joining us today to hear about our
journey toward greater energy efficiency
and now I'd like to invite homework on
from Samsung up to the stage to unveil
for you
Oh
alright
thanks Dan good morning everyone it's
exciting to be here with everyone to see
the reef flame come to life as you just
saw the unveiling and from vans Commons
the reclaim is a powerful innovative
egocentric device based on all the
features that has packed inside it but
more importantly what it doesn't have
first let's take a look not repeat some
of these features at what the rican
ingrates that's it first and foremost as
Dan mentioned reclaim comes with a
hardware casing that's made from bio
plastics to write from corn thereby
creating a smaller carbon footprint also
it comes with an energy star recruit
charger that comes that is complete with
a reminder light that reminds you to
disconnect the charger when the battery
is full it comes with a full qwerty
keyboard for that destroyed in messaging
and email user it comes with a 2
megapixel camera and camcorder to
capture those important moments of your
daily life it comes with one-click
access to those eco centric websites a
dimension as well as your favorite
social networking sites where you can
upload and share those moments directly
from your reclaim it comes with
one-click access over it consumer and
calendar email and finally it comes with
an outer box and an inner phone Trey
that's made from seven percent recycled
materials now let's take a closer look
at what the reclaimed doesn't have
reclaimed doesn't come with a bulky
printed user name instead you can log
into sprint com to find an electronic
version de manuel it doesn't come with
the traditional inks instead we use
soy-based inks for all printed materials
it also doesn't have polyvinyl chloride
following the recommendation of leading
green electronics industry experts and
finally no bulky packaging because of a
lighter packaging it has not only less
waste but also smaller shipping
footprint and a lotta metal smaller and
lighter shipping costs these design and
packaging innovations add up to make the
reclaim not only good for you but good
for the environment the reclaim is a
good example of Samsung's commitment to
becoming or to being a responsible so
conscious or environmentally conscious
company but it's not nearly the
beginning of those efforts Samsung's
efforts to becoming an environmentally
conscious company an environmentally
friendly company began nearly 20 years
ago in 1990 Samsung established a policy
provide eco centric products develop
those products and design those products
in an energy-efficient eco friendly
manner to deliver those products using
an efficient supply chain and to
minimize the inclusion of hazardous
materials and chemicals included in
those products we've our commitment to
developing and being an equal gendered
business as source has served as serves
samsung well Greenpeace International
recently recognized Samsung as the
number two most eco-friendly electronics
company in the world works based on our
continued commitment and efforts our
goals to become number one we've
achieved that status globally through
products made without harmful harmful
chemicals such as roman ated flame
retardant and polyvinyl chloride Samsung
is building phones such as the
replanting with bioplastic extracted
from corn that increase that enable our
ability to deliver phones the recyclable
and biodegradable Samsung incorporating
technologies is consume less power and
are more energy efficient Samsung is
investing in software that increase user
efficiency and further enhances battery
life fast forward to today and Samsung
has a new vision of how to become an
even better partner to our world for
samsung recently announced our eco
management 2013 plan it's an aggressive
and comprehensive set of initiatives
designed to make Samsung an eco centric
leader among all companies around this
world the plan is made up of four core
green management principles and
objectives number one reduce greenhouse
gas emissions normalized by sales for
manufacturing facilities by fifty
percent and come in direct greenhouse
gas emissions from all products 84
million tons number to ensure that a
hundred percent of our products are
eco-friendly
and exceed global eco mark standards
number three invest more than 4.3
billion dollars in eco management
initiatives and finally enhance read
alliances with our suppliers and our
partners today samsung mobile is proud
enhances alliance with sprint are great
carrier partner and we're proud to
announce am semi-final thank you thank
you Dan and Omar as Dan mentioned in his
remarks spread will be contributing to
dollars from every samsung reclaim
device sold and those dollars will go to
the Nature Conservancy's adopt an acre
program here in the US we're pleased
today to have with us not one but two
executives from the Nature Conservancy
to talk with you about our involvement
with them and the great work that they
do around the world to project to
protect the environment please welcome
Elizabeth the war chief marketing
officer and mike andrews senior
conservation fellow at the nature and
servicing Thank You Ralph on behalf of
the nation
I would like to thank sprint for its
commitment to protecting vitally
important land and water through its
support of the Conservancy's and adopted
eco program since its launch in 1999
over the 30,000 people schools and
organizations have raised 22 million
dollars to protect 600,000 acres in
South America Asia Central America the
Caribbean Africa and the United States
when you give to adopt an acre you're
helping to ensure the lasting protection
of important lands and waters through
the Conservancy's efforts to replant
trees and natural vegetation higher
heart guards and train them to protect
against illegal logging and coaching and
working with local landowners to
establish permanent conservation
business the the design for living world
exhibition which I hope all you get a
chance to see upstairs is the perfect
setting for this announcement the
designs explore the transformation of
organic materials such as wool plants
and wood into beautiful and useful
objects and each project tells a unique
story of a place a way of life the life
cycle of materials and the power of
conservation
design but most importantly it really
felt about the power that we have as
consumers by selecting or choosing
sustainable materials rather than those
that complete our national resources we
have the power to transform our global
economy we have the power to advance
global conservation effort and we have
the power to preserve the lands and
waters that sustain always thank you and
now I like to invite interview so my
canvas my colleague who has served at
both the chief conservation officer for
the Nature Conservancy and chief
operating officer and now as vice
president enjoy our partnerships with
versions of and thank you very much Omar
most but thanks for the introduction it
is it is really an honor to be here I
have worked with H Conservancy for 26
years and those who don't know a couple
of words it's the largest conservation
organization under standards in the
world we've more than a million members
in the United States and around the
world we work in 30 countries we work
uniquely in all 50 states we have
problems in all 50 states in the United
States and our mission is to preserve
the diversity of life that's so
important to assault not just to our
aesthetic values but we've discovered
all of this more recently to very much
to the human life on earth without a
healthy functioning systems around the
world we as a species do not survive so
it's come as a challenge to us as we've
developed as an organization to
understand about our ability to
cooperate more effectively with human
communities but also with aspects of
communities are so important to us
particularly corporations to generate
the resources products the functions of
our lives that we all so much depend on
so it's a particular honor to be here
with Samsung and particularly with
sprint to recognize their
contribution understanding the need for
sustainable productivity I'd like to
just say another word or two about the
Conservancy is adopting acres one of our
programs in total with partners around
the world corporations communities we
have been able to protect more than 120
million acres but that is just to start
the protection of the diversity of life
on Earth is really a job for all of us
and it is so inspiring to see
corporations take that charge to realize
that it is part of their social
responsibility to communities so again I
applaud the Simpson and spread to thank
you the last thing I just want to say is
that it's a nice mix for me to be here
you heard for show upstairs fun for
living planet talked up the use of
design of products of technology to
enhance our lives and I don't think
we've got a better example and on myself
looking forward to seeing and using this
phone and I also have to say thank you
for the button that says my chargers
home under my phone is full I had a
great violator of energy using up regard
I'll do my best to be better but this
linkage of design of usefulness of
practicality with the aspirations we all
have for a better world more sustainable
future for our children all comes
together when we have the leadership of
organizations like sprint samsung work
with us and work with our partners to
make the world a better place so very
much i want to thank you a little longer
ongoing relationship
Thank You Elizabeth and Mike this
concludes our formal presentation we
hope that you will all stick around for
breakfast enjoy the breakfast that we
have for you and also stop by the demo
stations that we have so that you can
check out the samsung reclaim for
yourself in addition we want to remind
you as what might an Elizabeth just
mentioned the design for living exhibit
it's upstairs and we hope that you go by
and visit that it's open just for this
group until nine thirty this morning the
gallery is located upstairs and the
exhibit features the work of ten leading
designers who have been commissioned to
develop new uses for sustainable league
grown and harvested materials as you
leave the museum today please make sure
that you stop by the registration table
to pick up the press kits that we have
for you there that talks about our
announcements that we made today and in
addition you will also find information
in there about our new environmental
initiatives that we've outlined today
