if X phone is better than the other so
if we had picked some of the best
offerings in the head-to-head battle
you're kind of looking at them I'm how
you matter even I will pocket now here
with iPhone 7 plus vs. Galaxy s7 edge
brought to you by D brand Parker now is
iPhone 7 coverage is brought to you by
deep brand to buy the best fitting skin
for your phone or tablet visit deep
brand comm in most cases calling one
phone better than the other is
subjective
some products say that they do more than
the other in paper but not all features
matter to all users so don't let that be
the reason for you to buy a product the
case of the iPhone 7 plus and galaxy s7
edge is interesting though as both
products are designed to compete against
each other directly but approach the
market in a very different way both
devices are designed to be the larger
and more in charger phablet of a
flagship lineup both have certain
features that better those are the
smaller sibling and yeah you can bet
that both are the most expensive cream
of the crop they represent the
difference is an approach start with
hardware the iPhone 7 plus is literally
taller wider and thicker than the Galaxy
s7 edge but you'd ask yourself would
four if both devices have the same
screen size you even wonder how Apple's
legacy in design could allow a plus
that's not even ergonomically enhanced
for even large hands like mine to reach
the power button the S of an edge by
contrast is a large phone designed to
feel smaller the buttons are easily
reachable and the curves on the sides
make it seem like a smaller phone that
it really is I do have to give props to
Apple for the great feel of the aluminum
construction doing a better job at
handling fingerprints than the glass and
metal on the Galaxy but if I had to pick
which of these is a better looking phone
than the Galaxy wins by a longshot and
as for those screens the galaxy
continues to take the cake with its quad
HD resolution versus 1080p and AMOLED
technology versus I
yes now the added pixel density isn't
really noticeable for the average eye
the wider color gamut of the iPhone
allows for very accurate color
reproduction but it doesn't provide the
saturation of AMOLED nor useful features
like the always-on display sure the
iPhone then swings back with its
pressure sensitive display enabling an
added layer of interaction through 3d
touch but it's not like if the galaxy is
a slouch with its edge display menus and
shortcuts now the cake the content
consumption
I would really incline more to the
iPhone 7 plus the stereo speakers
included are not just significantly
louder than the galaxy s of an edge but
also more immersive the galaxy you
actually have to learn how to hold it
and not muffle the speaker sure the
galaxy includes a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack but the amp on the iPhone
is superior to that of the galaxy
providing far louder audio through
lightning headphones if you have to now
we're definitely going to skip the spec
argument because while the galaxy has
more power the iPhone is more efficient
you notice that the minute you play
graphics-intensive games where doesn't
matter if you're powered by Vulcan on
the Galaxy or metal on the iPhone the
experiences move and the phablet size is
perfect for this endeavor and what
matters the galaxy offers the advantage
of starting at 32 gigs with expandable
storage while the iPhone remains at a
starting point of 32 gigs the galaxy
also doubles the size of the battery of
the iPhone but in our preliminary
testing of both devices and during
running videos at mid brightness for 30
minutes the galaxy burns through that
battery faster than the iPhone and it
could just be because of the added
pixels on a display the galaxy s better
is in Fast and wireless charging going
from 0 to around 45% in 30 minutes where
the iPhone can barely scratch 25% in
that same time frame
the ip68 water and does resistance of
the galaxy also means deeper submersion
up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes compared
to 1 meter over 30 minutes with the
iPhone another argument that's not worth
our time is the story of software
calling Android better than iOS or
vice-versa as a matter of taste but in
this particular case I do prefer
Samsung's approach to a phablet mainly
because the software allows for multi
window support over various applications
the iPhone might not have any of that
but one thing that I do appreciate about
iOS is how reliable it can be even with
the added power of the galaxy minor
stutters dropped frames and clunky
launch times are common deal after a few
months of using the galaxy s7 while the
iPhone is famous for doing less but
doing it better or at least doing it in
a more reliable fashion and then there
are those little things that actually
matter were both devices include
capacitive buttons but you can trust
that the iPhones button will not work
unless you actually press it because it
does have pressure sensitivity whereas
in the case of the galaxy it's just
quite common for you to be yanked out of
your application because of the
multitasking buttons people also hate
the thick bezels of the iPhones display
but I'm more inclined to love the fact
that at least these do a better job than
the palm rejection or the lack thereof
on the galaxy s7 edge where sometimes
you don't really understand why an
applications not working and it's
because you're holding it the wrong way
it's pretty much that better
implementation of features that
sometimes wins props for Apple over
doing less but doing it better the
camera competition is where things get
tricky both devices support 12 megapixel
cameras the Galaxy at F 1.7 aperture and
the iPhone at F 1.8 both devices are
capable of amazing color saturation in
detail during the day and both are quite
comparable at night the galaxy wins the
battle thanks to its face detection
autofocus but the iPhone swings back
heavily with its separate 12 megapixel
telephoto lens that 2 X optical zoom
does come in handy in many situations
and even if both devices have digital
zoom capabilities the iPhone comes on
top because of the added
zooom of the telephoto lens the selfie
Department the iPhone is capable of more
detail thanks to its 7 megapixel shooter
compared to five but you don't need a
selfie stick with the galaxy thanks to
the wide-angle lens and the wider
aperture at F 1.7 compared to f/2 point
to where the iPhone continues to use the
most atrocious and dated field of view
in smartphone history civilization and
video is top-notch on both devices but
optical zoom on the iPhone gives the
experience of an added kick when
compared to the galaxy so at the end of
the day finding a winner is actually a
matter of taste and paper and in many
added tricks the Galaxy would win this
one without putting much of a fight but
as we began this video doing more is not
code for doing better if you value looks
Horgan ah mcc's expandability and the
bevy of features your money should be
placed on the galaxy s7 edge hands down
now if you want a phablet you can rely
on for other things that actually matter
like the camera features be added
endurance and the consistency in the
experience of software then the iPhone 7
plus is the way to go regardless you're
buying into two of the best phones that
2016 has to offer
