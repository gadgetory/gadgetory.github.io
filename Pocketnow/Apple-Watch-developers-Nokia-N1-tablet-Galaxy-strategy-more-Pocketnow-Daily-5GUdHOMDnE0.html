android tablet Samsa commits to making
the galaxy brand less of a washout and
Apple is already preparing developers
for the Apple watch I'm hi meri behna
and aside from the storm that's outside
let's start hitting the news even though
a little late this is parking out daily
today is all about official news
starting with Samsung we all know that
the company has been struggling when it
comes to its quarter results its
smartphone division hasn't really been
performing as a company expects and as a
result of company has sort of made it
official that they will stop washing out
the galaxy brand currently there's a
galaxy everything right now and as it
turns out the company's apparently going
to cut back on its projects by just
one-third or should I say you'll only be
getting one third of what you currently
get next year in 2015 so projects like
the Galaxy Note edge will apparently
take a backseat for the company to work
on things that really do sell let's see
if that works now a company that has
been having a good time when it comes to
sales almost in every quarter this
year's HTC the company has made some
great headlines with its sales in
addition to that the company plans to
make things good for its customers they
are now offering significant discounts
and accessories and that's for a limited
time or as supplies last so LIXIL
description make sure you go to the HTC
website and get a dot view case of your
own and well the company that has
nothing to complain about is Apple they
have had great results all year and they
are already preparing the world for the
Apple watch they have just pushed iOS
8.2 to developers and within this update
we have watch kit which allows
developers to port applications to the
Apple watch or extension of existing
applications to work with the Apple
watch we still don't have any dates for
this wearable but hopefully that is
sooner rather than later Facebook is
another company that's up to another
underwhelming surprise it's funny but
every project that Facebook has ever
launched has failed and then every
project that they've bought has not and
we've seen place book paper we've seen
the new threaded messaging forum thing
which I even forgot the name just to
give you an idea of how important it is
and the company has now launched
Facebook groups it separately
launched the separate application for
you to chat with in groups which is not
necessarily bet some of these groups can
be meaningful to you and it's great to
have them in a separate application that
takes you away from facebook advertising
which is not necessarily bad let's just
see if it actually works it was a
comment down below and tell us what you
think about it and finally for the very
hot news of the day if you were
disappointed with Nokia and thought it
was dead think again the company is
reviving as a mobile devices company
even though we are sure that it will
take them some time to builder for
smartphone because of the whole
microsoft thing but what they did was
build an Android tablet and a rather
good android tablet we're talking about
a two hundred fifty dollar tablet that
looks identical to the ipad mini in
every way which is actually a good thing
aluminum chassis 64-bit processor 2 gigs
of ram good options for storage we have
this new Intel processor on it as well
which is great a great display
resolution so far it seems that this
could be a winner that we should be
expecting by early 2015 set that we're
not getting it earlier but then again
tell us what you think of the comments
down below as this leads me to the
question of the day would you buy the
nokia and one tablet because in my case
honestly for two hundred fifty dollars
why not I mean the tablet is gorgeous
it's got everything and then again it
would be great to see Nokia revive
itself as a mobile devices company
finally with an operating system that's
actually able to give a traction leave
us a comment down below what do you
think friends you know the joy if you
want to get the nose earlier before this
video with snow machine follow us on
talking out comment subscribe change
channel as well you'd also follow me on
Twitter hi managers quarterly better
