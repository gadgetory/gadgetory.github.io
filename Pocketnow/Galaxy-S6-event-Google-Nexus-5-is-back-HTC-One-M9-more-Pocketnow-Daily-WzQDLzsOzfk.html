teaser of the galaxy s6 google has just
decided to bring back the Nexus that
we're all missing and we land some
conflicting rumors on the HTC One and 9s
design I'm hi Mary vera and as the
Valentine's month begins please join me
in welcoming our first sponsor this is
pocket out daily brought to you by Linda
calm the official news today have to do
with Samsung mwc and probably the most
anticipated events of the year at least
early 2015 we've been wanting to see
what the galaxy s6 is going to be like
and the company has already sent out
presentations for their event mwc and
guess what there is a very interesting
curve in the design of this present bite
and if you follow licks of the
description and look at all our comments
we've got all the renders you need to
make sure you know this is an edge
galaxy s6 so stay tuned as we learn more
about it and days to come another one of
the most anticipated devices of the year
is the HTC One m9 and we've got some
conflicting rumors we heard that the
dual cameras were going to be gone and
that we were getting a 20 megapixel
sensor with this phone but no credible
sources claimed that no we are getting
dual cameras and apparently they will
play a different role to the current one
we have with the 1i mate it seems that
they will actually build you a 20
megapixel shop but you're not really
getting a 20 megapixel sensor which is
interesting let's see what the purpose
is this is more like what Huawei does
with some of its smartphones right now
let's just see if it does a better job
than anything that's already out there
we also get to hear some very
interesting rumors on the iPad air pro
or iPad air plus we still don't know
exactly what the name will be but
reports claim that we are getting a
boost in display resolution which makes
all the sense in the world since Apple
wants to keep their retina display
mentality apparently we're getting a
quad HD display on this tablet with the
purpose of again going around those 250
something megapixels in order to give
you the retina display resolution and
probably they're going to call it the
retina HD HD display just because it
confined to a current standard which is
great you just don't know exactly what
it will happen but hopefully soon now if
you remember we discussed a couple of
days ago over how interesting Qualcomm
is currently handling the
publicity of the Snapdragon 810 first of
all because the LG G flex 2 announcement
was mainly focused on that Snapdragon
810 as it turns out the company has
already gotten OEMs like Sony oppo
Motorola even Microsoft to confirm that
they were next smartphones will include
the Snapdragon 810 so yeah we already
know what spec we're getting let's just
hope the whole heating issues are not
going to be an issue and finally for the
her ray news of the day if you want to
get your hands on a nexus smartphone as
of today you no longer are forced to buy
a phablet yes the Nexus 6 is humongous
it is a sham move remember the code name
but if you're interested in a smaller
Nexus the Nexus 5 is now back and retail
in the Google Play Store you can get it
in the 16 gigabyte variant for the same
price 250 bucks 32 gigs for need dollars
great price tags this is definitely not
the best smartphone in the world and
lead but it is your opportunity on
getting a nexus right now for a very
decent price unless you pick up on the
deals of Motorola and the Moto X deals
four hundred forty bucks that we talked
about a couple days ago that starts
today but anyways that leads me to the
question of the day nexus 5 or nexus 6
now that you have a choice if you had to
pick even if you already bought a nexus
6 if you have to pick which one would
you get in my case ooh that is a very
good question i think i would go nexus 6
just because i love the moto x's design
but leave us a comment down below what
do you think and folks if you want to
learn how to play music instrument build
