pocketnow.com and I am tired I was going
to wait until tomorrow to record the
host segment of this video so that I
could appear a little bit fresher and
maybe not get so many comments about how
I look Spacey in my videos but then I
thought no no this is the perfect
allegory for what we're talking about
today because humans get tired I'm tired
you know what else gets tired
smartphones alright I know it was a
little bit of a weak comparison but this
is the Samsung Galaxy s3 I've been using
it for about a week and I've found its
endurance to be on the high side of
average for an Android smartphone it
does better than my Galaxy Nexus LTE
edition every smartphone does but it
doesn't quite reach the point of the HTC
One X that I was trying out a couple
weeks ago which had pretty good battery
life so we're going to check out today a
few ways to get the most out of the
battery on the samsung galaxy s3
it's pocket now let's take a look
so there are certain steps that we've
all become accustomed to taking when we
really need to maximize every last
second of battery life on our smart
phones sure there are some third-party
apps out there that'll do the trick for
us but for this video let's stick to
stock some of these measures include
steps like shutting off as many radios
as possible that includes things like
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and NFC and GPS some
of these radios have more effect on the
battery than others but they all impact
at some what other things are good to do
like checking your email polling
interval to make sure that it's set to
medium or long and make sure that you're
not automatically syncing in the
background with a service you set up
back in happier days when you had more
power things like Facebook and G+
polling in the background can really
demolish your battery another huge drain
on your power reserves is the display
the sgs3 uses an AMOLED panel so it
doesn't suck as much juice as an LCD
with a backlight but it's still bound to
be the biggest energy hog on the phone
turning down the brightness is a big way
to cut back on that consumption and
while we're on the display killing any
live wallpapers will definitely save you
some clock cycles and therefore power as
well finally there are the accessory
features on the galaxy s3 that includes
things like s-voice smart stay the LED
lamp and more standard elements like the
vibration motor all these can be tweaked
manually but the galaxy s3 makes life
easier for us in two main ways the first
is the dashboard of toggles in the
Android notification bar up top these
allow us to quickly and easily enable
and disable features that we only need
at certain times like Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth and GPS and it also lets us do
some triage if we really get into a
critical phase giving us a means to kill
notifications mobile data and sync as
well you'll notice it also lets us jump
right into something called power saving
that's the second way the galaxy s3
makes life easier on those looking to
conserve battery as on most Samsung
phones there's a handy little readme
file hidden away in the
our saving menu that tells you all about
what the mode does in brief enabling
power saving mode does four main things
it reduces the maximum clock speed of
the CPU which does slow down the device
a bit but it saves power and won't
cripple you unless you try to play a
graphically intense game or load a
really heavy webpage it also reduces the
frame rate and lowers the brightness on
the display switches your email and
browser backgrounds to black to reduce
the number of illuminated pixels on the
AMOLED display and it disables haptic
feedback to stop the vibrate motor from
wasting amp hours to really get the most
out of the device you'll also want to
hop into settings and then display and
make sure auto adjust screen power is
checked and also that your brightness is
set to a low level using smart stay is a
good idea to keep the device paying
attention to when you are and are not
looking at it if you're really trying to
squeeze every second out of the phone
you can adjust the backlight on the
capacitive keys down here to time out
sooner as well you can even go as far
down as 1.5 seconds finally and for now
this is specific to the galaxy s3 you'll
want to hop into s-voice get on over to
settings and make sure that you've
either disabled the wake up command or
set it to only listen while charging
Samsung goes out of its way to tell you
that s voice may drain the battery so
this is a step you don't want to miss
and if all else fails there's always
airplane mode turn it on then turn it
off periodically to check for messages
then turn it back on it's the
time-honored tradition of power starved
smartphone owners everywhere if you've
got some more tips for saving power on
your smartphone be it a Galaxy s3 or
something else drop us a line in the
comments at the post at pocketnow.com
otherwise give us a thumbs up if you
liked the video stay tuned for the next
one it'll be coming probably sooner than
you think and thanks a lot for watching
i'm michael fisher with pocket now i'm
gonna go get some sleep see you next
time
