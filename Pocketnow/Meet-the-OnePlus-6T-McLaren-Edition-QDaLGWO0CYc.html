unboxings were actually a cool
experience yes it's been widely rumored
and it's finally here meet the one +16
McLaren Edition and I'm sure we're not
new to one plus special edition
smartphones but this one is not just the
different coat of paint
I'm he might be better with pocket now
and let me tell you what makes this
phone so cool let me begin with the box
to be honest I've unboxed so many
products never one with a box this heavy
and I had to travel with it for around
2000 miles the unboxing experience is
separated into three parts to begin
we've got the McLaren's signature papaya
orange in an interesting texture with
the oneplus logo in one corner the
McLaren logo and another and a salute to
speed dead center
McLaren is famous for its use of carbon
fiber and race car designs so expect to
see a lot of that going forward starting
with the interior box we left open the
flap and a lot of heft starts to make
sense there's a booklet at the top and
accessories at the bottom there's a
carbon-fiber one +16 case with a McLaren
logo and below it is a neat and
exclusive surprise encased in a glass
box is a McLaren speed mark logo
recreated an original McLaren design f1
double-a grade carbon fiber and the
company claims that this is the same
material used on the MCL 33 2018 Formula
One car to the right we have one plusses
new charging standard now being dubbed
warp charge 30 the company claims a day
of power in just 20 minutes on a charge
all without slowing the charge down if
you use it because again this is a
salute to speed the USB C to USB a power
cord comes with a braided papaya orange
finish and yes even the infamous dongle
got the same love and it's rubber finish
now part two of the unboxing experiences
this booklet which celebrates the
history of both companies both McLaren
and oneplus from their respective launch
to where both companies are today with
different stages being portrayed on each
page and there's actually an extra layer
to this booklet that I'll discuss more
on part three what's most important is
on the final page we've got the goods
let me do the honors of tearing apart
this plastic first and don't judge me
you knew that the screen protector was
coming off you know I don't like these
things now this is a very interesting
color for the oneplus 60 at a glance it
looks like the typical mirror black but
it's actually a very different finish
there's a papaya orange accent found at
the bottom borders that fades into black
at the top under the glass a carbon
fiber finish that's quite nice but sadly
not easily visible in this light best of
all not sure if there's some sort of
coating on this finish for the dis fight
fingerprints well now for part three you
actually have to set up the phone and
while nearing the end of the process
there's an invitation to experience more
of the booklet through AR point the
camera of the oneplus 60 and nearly
every page includes a video that details
the beginnings of McLaren and also the
beginnings of oneplus quite the
nostalgia boost for any true fan of
either brand or both once the set up is
over there are some unique wallpapers
exclusive to this phone and a McLaren
theme in black and papaya orange and for
those of you asking what the salute to
speed is between your 1 plus 60 McLaren
Edition and a typical one plus 60 it's
got everything to do with what's inside
we've got your typical qualcomm
snapdragon 845
but then this phone starts at 10
gigabytes of RAM 10 and since project
boost on oxygen OS uses leftover RAM to
speed its performance this is what they
mean by a salute to speed it helps this
phone be faster than anything our unit
has 256 gigs of storage and the rest is
the same powerful bells and whistles
that we've already praised the oneplus
60 in our full review so yes this is the
one plus 60 McLaren Edition not just the
hot coat of paint over the phone we knew
this is actually one of the fastest most
powerful phones money can buy and it's
not even priced at a special edition
level
the whole experience is quite
irresistible at just 699 bucks
expected to launch on December 13th in
North America Europe and India but China
following soon after so let us know what
you think about the oneplus sixty
McLaren Edition in the comments down
below and while you're at it make sure
