pocket now calm and today we're going to
do an unboxing the Samsung Galaxy Tab
7.7 from Verizon so sit back relax and
enjoy the show the box for the Samsung
Galaxy Tab 7.7 from Verizon pretty
straightforward just black box it's got
a little simulated view of the device on
the front here let's go ahead and just
open up to take a look we've got the
device itself wrapped up in plastic with
instructions about what to do with the
LTE sim card which we'll get to in a
second and notable notice here that says
do not insert the microSD card into that
same slot and then underneath this
little piece of cardboard here we've got
the LTE and the wall warts which
attaches together some information and
then the Samsung proprietary charging /
data cable as well oh that nothing well
left in the box and let's go ahead and
peel the plastic off and get this thing
started starting on the left side of
device we have the sim card slot here
and I'm just going to go ahead and pop
in the verizon sim click it in there
it's got a little kind of loose tab here
that rolls back and forth and then
further down on the left-hand side is
the microSD card slot there's not one
included but it is expandable which is a
nice feature functionality it's got kind
of a smooth edge here rolled up on the
side very lightweight in the hands on
this side we've got the power button and
the volume rocker and then this is kind
of a neat feature here we've actually
got a ir blaster and there's supposedly
some software in this as well that will
allow us to control I our devices so
that's kind of a neat functionality to
include on a device this size so here we
are booting up the device the front of
the screen is a seven point seven inch
Super AMOLED display looks really good
and it's got 1280 x 800 resolution with
197 PPI full range of sensors like the
accelerometer and the the proximity
sensor and etc etc 2 megapixel
front-facing camera here and then we've
got a small bezel around the outside
edge nothing too surprising there and
it's got a nice feel on the edges here
as far as the handheld it doesn't feel
like there's a whole lot of like would
rub on your hand the wrong way moving
around to the back we've got the rear 3
megapixel only does 720p as far as video
content it does have a flash it's got
brushed aluminum back here a little
separation between the brushed aluminum
the plastic and then down here we've got
the samsung logo which is raised and you
can actually got a little bit of a
sticking point there and the texture
isn't really enjoyable touching this
part of the device but really with it in
your hands you're not really going to
touch it there anyway top of the device
here we've got the headphone jack right
there and nicely when you hold it in the
landscape format versus of the portrait
format we don't have any buttons in the
way to accidentally turn the device off
when we're actually using which greatly
appreciate especially compared to the
10.1 samsung galaxy tab from verizon at
the bottom of the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7
we find these speaker ports and the
charging / data port for the pituitary
cable that Samsung chooses to use so
it's got a 1.4 dual core Exynos
processor from Samsung which is a really
snappy processor same processor as is in
my galaxy s2 the gig of ram a 16 gigs of
storage in this particular device
expandable with the micro SD slots it's
running honeycomb unfortunately and ice
cream sandwich is supposed to be coming
for this but we'll see it and then
really honeycomb isn't that terrible
it's just not as nice as ice cream
sandwich could be it's got CDMA 800
1900 LTE band 13 blue 230 Wi-Fi it's got
GPS mentioned order the I airport and
we'll take a look at the the app for
that I airport when we do the full
software review as far as battery life
on the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 from
Verizon it has a 5100 milliamp hour
battery which is supposed to last with
Ltd on about 12 and a half hours we'll
see how that actually turns out you know
with Wi-Fi and 3G services turned on and
off otherwise it looks exactly like the
as far as the interface goes the galaxy
tab 10.1 even with this little quick
shortcut launcher down here and the
screen capture button still not sure why
they include that for a device such as
this but really it just looks like a
miniaturized version of the galaxy tab
10.1 other than the fact that the device
feels more solid it doesn't have on the
back here it doesn't pop and click as
much although you can see it's got a
small dent in here from probably a
previous person who used the device
since this is a review unit it's got a
little ding right there as you can see
otherwise it seems to be pretty nice
looking and I'm fairly impressed with
the the screen resolution it feels
really nice in the hands we'll take a
closer look at the hardware and the
software in future videos that wraps up
our unboxing for the Galaxy Tab 7.7 from
Verizon if you have any comments or
questions please leave them below we'll
try to address them give us a thumbs up
if you liked the video and thanks for
watching
