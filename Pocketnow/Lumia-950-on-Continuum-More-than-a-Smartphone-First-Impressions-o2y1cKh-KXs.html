Windows Phone back at Microsoft's new
york city launch event what we haven't
seen is how well it performs on the big
screen
i'm michael fisher with pocket now and
i'm here to give you a quick look at the
lumia 950
the smart phone that's also a computer
unboxing our press kit is a little
different than what the typical buyer
will experience Microsoft has bundled
the display dock and its accompanying
cables with our phone to make using
continuum a little easier and it's also
thrown in a folding Bluetooth keyboard
we picked up our HP monitor and
Microsoft arc Mouse separately the rest
of the included accessories are your
pretty standard fare because this is an
AT&amp;amp;T device our unit came with an
activated AT&amp;amp;T SIM and the usual death
start a - let's talk about the phone
itself real quick its light coming from
the BlackBerry Prive and the oneplus X
before that I feel like it's almost too
light the polycarbonate body Vokes the
feel of my trusty old Lumia 1020 but not
the presence and it also lacks the few
luxury touches of metal we saw in the
8:30 and 9:30 twosome that'll be a
disappointment
others might like the simplicity less
debatable is the Lumia 950 s significant
spec bump microsoft says it built the
phone to satisfy longtime Windows Phone
fans first
and it's quad HD display really does the
new Windows 10 interface and justice the
new windows might not be as edgy or as
bold as Windows Phone 7 was when it
debuted five years ago but on an OLED
screen like this it really pops with
smooth animations and slick new apps
like the redesigned outlook couple that
with a removable battery and memory card
a really promising camera with
professional-grade controls old friends
like wireless charging and new additions
like the iris scanning windows hello and
you can understand why Windows fans are
pretty excited for this sucker the real
excitement though starts when you let
windows break out of this tiny little
box plug the display dock into a monitor
plug the phone into the dock and pair it
up with a keyboard and mouse
and the Lumia 950 becomes essentially a
Windows 10 computer this is continuum
and if you use it for a few minutes you
start to understand why Microsoft is
positioning it as a key differentiator
getting some work done in Word or
OneNote checking the calendar and
outlook and and taking a break with some
Bob Ross on YouTube and controlling all
of it with the same interface you're
used to seeing on a PC all that is great
and when you realize it's all being done
through the smart phone sitting on your
desk with its little Snapdragon 808
processor it's freaking mind-blowing and
it's fun to find means of getting around
the still serious app gap like running a
Google Hangouts session in the browser
or using the same feature to watch
Netflix on the big screen
even though the Netflix app isn't yet
continuum ready it's kind of amazing
what you can do with just a browser
that's not to say it's a perfect
experience not by a long shot
I've only been using the 950 for a day
or so and already I've got a pretty long
list of complaints memory cards won't
mount screenshots won't save there's no
double tap to wake and 25 minutes of
reading a text only article in the
browser busted my battery down by 11
percent also not all of the continual
workarounds work out those hangouts
conversations only lasted a volley or
two before the page had to be reloaded
making it basically useless despite its
high number to brand name the lumia 950
is in some ways a prototypical product
thanks to the still young Windows 10 the
in depth criticism and analysis will
come later on as we make our way toward
the full review but you don't need to
spend much more than an afternoon with
this phone to understand why some people
think it's a game changer we've been
calling smartphones pocket computers for
over a decade at this point but I don't
think I ever fully appreciated that
appellation until I saw the Lumia 950
morph from handheld to desktop right
before my eyes to borrow a term from
another computer maker out there
it felt kind of magical and to see that
coming from Microsoft and that's pretty
cool
we know you've got questions for us
folks to join us for the pocket and
weekly podcast on Friday November 20th a
few hours after this video goes live
we'll take your questions live on the
air if you miss it not to worry we'll
host it at pocketnow.com for later
playback follow us on social media so
you don't miss it pocket now is that
pocket now and I am at captain two
phones till next time this has been
michael fisher who wrote this whole
script on the lumia 950 using continuum
what a world
thanks for watching folks we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
