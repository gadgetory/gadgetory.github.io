Apple's face ID using alternatives
google has begun to experiment with
photography apps after the success of
the pixel 2 photos and ever was just
acquire Shazam and I'm still scratching
my head over why I'm Jaime Rivera and
I'm back in studio number 2 I would
switch this for Hawaii
any day I highly recommend Maui this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with deals if you're in the market
for an iPad Best Buy is probably the
best option right now nothing on which
iPad you'd go for you can get up to 150
dollars off and that's the case of the
12 point 9 inch iPad pro I don't
necessarily recommend the model that
large but I know a few people that
actually prefer it because for them size
doesn't matter that's what she said now
it's all about Andy Rubin as we've got
some official reports that he has now
returned to essential as of Friday
according to a statement
it seems that Rubin confirms that you
know he did have a relationship with
somebody within Google and that
everything was under consent and that
there shouldn't be anything to worry
about which is really the reason why he
had left the company temporarily so it's
great to see Andy Beckett essential we
can't wait to see what he does beyond
the essential phone even if I'm actually
using an essential phone and I actually
like it and speaking of Google the
company has a few new applications that
deal with photography specifically three
one of them that mimics a cinema graph
and interestingly is exclusive to iOS
and then other applications that allow
you to take other advantages of
photography Google seems to be pushing
this really hard after it's a 6 for the
pixel to excel and it's photos and yeah
these apps are free as usual let's see
how long they last being exclusive to
certain platforms let's talk about Apple
as the company has just acquired Shazam
4 according to certain publications 400
million dollars for a company that was
evaluated 1 billion dollars back in 2015
that is an incredible steal and it makes
a ton of sense as a obviously Apple
really wants to push its Apple music and
the smarter the service becomes the
better it will be for the platform I
just wish they would have acquired
SoundHound because it's more
practical at least for me but which one
is your favorite service and finally the
very hot news is they have to do with
the Samsung Galaxy as in Lion for those
of you wondering if we're gonna get a
face ID competitor actually no according
to trusted sources face ID has so much
technology it'll take competitors a
couple of years to catch up but Samsung
is not going to be sitting on its
laurels it's actually going to boost the
megapixel count of its selfie iris
scanner from 2 megapixels to 3 in that
50 percent boost should allow it to be
faster at picking a buyer scanning so it
makes all the sense I mean I like the
iris scanner as it is I just wish that
it were faster so this would solve the
problem that be great but it leads me to
the question today do you think that
iris scanning should be the way that
Samsung continues to push her do you
feel that the company should bring face
ID in my case I trust iris scanning a
lot more than face ID I feel that this
is what Samsung needs to push in my
opinion leave us a comment down below
