get every Windows Phone flagship at the
same time we don't live in that world so
we get devices like these they seem very
similar and in fact they are very
similar but they're not identical so
let's put them head-to-head I'm Michael
Fisher this is PocketNow and this is
Nokia Lumia 928 versus Nokia Lumia 920
Nokia's Lumia 920 picked up the example
set by the Lumia 900 and ran with it
establishing a beefy well made Windows
Phone with an excellent camera and a
premium suite of Nokia exclusive apps
and it was exclusive to AT&amp;amp;T now six
months later Verizon Wireless finally
gets a crack at a high-end device from
the world's premiere Windows Phone
manufacturer but there are some
differences here besides carrier radios
so let's dive in and take a look
as you can see Nokia and Verizon have
taken the opportunity to introduce a
significant change in design language
with the 928 gone is the Nokia smile
that palm kissing backside married to
rounded corners on the 920 in its place
a much boxier build with brutal right
angles and only the barest concessions
made to curves in the form of the
Gorilla Glass to display protection
beneath the glass the display itself has
been changed the size and resolution
stays the same as does the very high
pixel density of more than 330 PPI but
the Lumia 920's IPS LCD has been
replaced with an AMOLED panel on the 928
there's always been debate about the
merits and shortfalls of each technology
but we think Windows Phone is very well
served by AMOLED the almost perfect
blacks on the 928 make the tiles seem to
float directly on the glass and because
the clear black polarization process is
different or absent on the 928 there's
far greater sidon visibility here also
the annoying color fringing evident in
bright sunlight on the 920 is thankfully
absent on the 928 unless you really hate
the rich color saturation of AMOLED
you'll find yourself loving this display
underneath that display things get
familiar again these devices are powered
by the same Snapdragon s4 at 1.5
gigahertz backed up by the same gig of
ram and they offer the same non
expandable 32 gigs of on-board storage
the battery remains NAM
it's capacity remains 2000 milliamp
hours and wireless charging stays put as
well around back the hardware
differences re-emerge where the Lumia
920 features a completely uninterrupted
expanse of polycarbonate the 928 has
penetrations galore the speaker has been
moved from the bottom edge to low on the
backside and the camera bezel has been
extended the LED spotlight enhanced with
a xenon flash there's also a noise
cancelling mic up top flanked by another
one on the top edge the USB port has
also been relocated here an awkward but
not unprecedented choice and the sim
tray is now removable with just a
thumbnail but it feels much more fragile
cheaper than the one on its predecessor
that's true also for the devices plastic
side buttons which offer much less
satisfying travel and click than the
920's metal keys in sum while the 928 s
hardware is slightly slimmer and also
more than 20 grams lighter than its
4runner standing next to the 920 it
doesn't look like an evolution of the
design it looks more like a step
backward to a less developed prototype
version now some people will prefer the
928 more aggressive look and we're not
suggesting Nokia should be afraid of
deviating from its existing design
language bold moves are good we're just
not sure the 928 exemplifies the flavor
of bold the company should be exploring
because with the exception of the
display from buttons to back lights to
bezels the whole thing just feels and
looks cheaper comparing Windows Phones
is always a fairly consistent experience
in terms of software because the
platform is optimized so well that it
runs smoothly on pretty much any
hardware you throw at it as you might
expect that's doubly the case when that
hardware is flagship grade and identical
and indeed metrics like app launch times
and benchmark scores confirm that these
devices are very similar in terms of
ones and zeros we did experience the
occasional hiccup or stutter on the 928
but that's not unprecedented on some new
carrier builds of even the normally
buttery Windows Phone so it doesn't give
us too much pause really the biggest
takeaway from the software angle is just
how consistent Microsoft has managed to
keep Windows Phone with the exception of
the typical carrier load
the best example of useful software
customization is the inclusion on the
928 of Microsoft's data sense metering
and limiting app a staple of Verizon
Windows Phone 8 devices that we'd like
to see make it to other carriers soon
Verizon's advertising push surrounding
the 928 has been surprisingly robust
here in the northeastern US and
unsurprisingly almost all of it focuses
on the devices camera the Lumia 920
already offered the best low-light
shooting experience on an American
smartphone and the 928 only improves on
that by bringing a xenon flash to the
8.7 megapixel PureView sensor that flash
is more powerful and more befitting a
high-end smartphone shooter and great to
have in a pinch most of the time though
unless you're trying to capture
fast-moving objects or people you're
probably going to want to shoot without
it the 928 night shots continue to be as
stunning as the 920 s and both phones
continue to shine in the daylight as
well our only real complaint is in the
occasional softness of focus and the
Spartan viewfinder software which still
lacks a stock HDR option and still
suffers from an absence of a shooting
mode indicator otherwise these are both
outstanding class-leading smartphone
cameras some of the other changes nokia
made to the 928 have proved less than
stellar as mentioned in hardware moving
the speakerphone to the back resulted in
an aesthetic compromise but it's one we
would have been ok with if it had
resulted in superior performance the
thing is it doesn't compared to the
Lumia 920 the 928 produces a louder
sound but a raspier and tinnier one as
well and we're not talking a minor
difference here it's really much worse
than the 920 s bottom edge output and
the fact that it's now on the wrong side
of the phone just stinks the sound
problem continues in terms of voice
calls at least on one side every single
caller we spoke to during our test
period said we sounded cleaner with less
clipping on the Lumia 920 than on the
928 well that may well be a network
effect of Verizon CDMA versus ATT's GSM
it's one you're gonna have to deal with
if you pick the 928 over the 924 tchen
Utley callers on our end sounded quite
clear in the 928 with nice rich side
tone on
our side and background sound
suppression on the newer phone is
stellar with its dedicated dual
microphone array
finally the 928 beat out its predecessor
by 17 minutes in the WP bench battery
test and our real-world experience bore
that out with the 928 more likely to
last for a night on the town than our
Lumia 920 that may be because we've been
using the latter as a daily driver since
launch day last winter but the divergent
performance is also reflected on Nokia's
own estimates it's not likely to be a
terribly significant difference for most
buyers but it's worth a mention while
the Lumia 928 is very much a quote Lumia
920 for Verizon unquote there isn't
exact parity between the flagships some
of the differences like the brighter
more vibrant display xenon camera flash
lighter weight build and superior noise
cancellation favorite Verizon's version
others like better voice call quality
richer speaker phone sound and a
higher-quality feel in hand favored the
older AT&amp;amp;T flagship it's just a matter
of choosing what compromises you want to
make on each side and viewed through the
lens of that contest it looks like the
original flagship edges out its newer
cheaper competitor by just a bit over
