pocketnow.com here at Aoife in berlin
still checking out the toshiba 8270 not
a very creatively named the 7 inch
tablet stands for android tablet 270 is
what one of the guys told me last night
from toshiba but very much like a to my
eye like a nexus 7 designed and built
very differently to take down a little
bit of a hardware tour here this is the
power standby button up top a lock
slides which i believe volume up and
down little microphone there take it
around to the side / bottom the
headphone jack USB port with microsd
expansion down there on the bottom
stereo speakers dock connector there
nothing on that side on the back here I
believe this is double check the specs
here this is an 8 megapixel camera real
story though of course up front on this
display this is a an AMOLED display not
sure if it's super amoled or not it
doesn't get quite that specific but the
color really really plays very nicely
very deep blacks amazing color
saturation this is what caught my eye
checking out the device last night it's
running Android 40 not really sure if
it's dot 4 or 3 because we're stuck in
demo mode here low battery consumption
is one of the touted advantages it runs
on an NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor and with
a what they're calling a fifth battery
saver core but of course that's standard
high performance 12 core nvidia GPU as
well comes with one gig of onboard ram
capacity up to 64 gigs so in many
respects a whole lot like a nexus 7
designed and built differently and in
this case by toshiba feels really great
in the hand lightweight without feeling
chintzy
the only may be detrimental thing about
it is the price point Toshiba's quoting
a price point around 500 euro which is
really really not like the Nexus 7 at
all whether that's going to be worth it
for you is going to be up to you of
course but for even for build quality
like this I think that's a little steep
weld a little bit more on this if we can
for you there's Michael Fisher at
pocketnow.com Tony's behind the camera
stay tuned for lots more from Aoife here
in Berlin thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
