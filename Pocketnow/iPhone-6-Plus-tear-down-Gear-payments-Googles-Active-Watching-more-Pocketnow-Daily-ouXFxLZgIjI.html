details on its internals Samsung is
reportedly working on fingerprint
scanning technology and payments for its
gear lineup and Google's new active
watching technology is kind of creepy
I'm hi Mary vetta and I will be out all
of next week but I will figure out a way
to get you the pocket out daily this is
parking out daily let's begin today with
what's official as the iPhone 6 has
already begun shipping to customers
people are already picking it up and
even though somebody already showed us
how to not unbox the phone links in the
description we also get details are the
internals of the iphone 6 plus first of
all twenty 915 milliamp hour battery
which is small and we also get one gig
of ram which is amazing for a phone this
big but links description for full
details on everything you're getting
with the iphone 6 plus because it's
bigger than it seems now talk about
apple and specifically iOS 8 it seems
that customers are not going crazy for
this update when you compare the
statistics between how many people
updated iOS 7 and how many people
updated iOS 8 on the first day we are
down fifty percent and if you're
wondering exactly why well so many
people are asking themselves the same
question as iOS 8 is actually a maturing
version of iOS 7 but then again I'll
tell you my experience my phone is still
restoring two days later and that's
because Apple servers are working
terribly so we'll see if things get
better in the next couple of days I was
moved to spotlight over the Samsung and
specifically the Samsung Galaxy a5 we
talked about this phone a couple of
weeks ago because we thought that this
was going to be the metallic galaxy
phone and it turned out to be the galaxy
out but though a5 is pretty much just an
alpha iteration and it could be that it
is because this is a metallic phone but
with watered-down specification
Snapdragon 400 720p display like so
Swisher for full details let's see what
Samsung brings to the table here and
speaking of Samsung a company's
executive at just revealed the plans for
their gear lineup and it turns out that
the company is going to bring
fingerprint scanning and mobile payments
third gear lineup because the Apple
watch is also going to be doing this uh
this was expected that's the way samson
behaves but really interesting we're
wondering exactly why we would want
fingerprint scanning on a watch and then
again for mobile payments that would be
one of the cool features
that Apple is actually not bringing to
the Apple watch we wonder exactly how
Apple is planning to do it with the
Apple watch indeed so let's see what we
get from Samsung as the gears are due
for an update soon and finally for the
very interesting news of the day google
has just filed a new pet for active
watching technology if you remember in
the case of the Moto X the old variant
the part of that phone is that if you
said okay Google now all the Moto X is
on the table would wake up the new Moto
X has a new technology that actually
detects where you are and follows that
which is great but Google's patent even
though cool because it would bring this
technology to other phones apparently
will also use the camera for shooting
video of who's around you which is cool
but also could be creepy we don't know
exactly what is going to happen with
that video hopefully we can opt out but
that leads you to the question of the
day would you agree with Google doing
things like this for example shooting
video just for it to know where you are
or who you're with because in my case
sure the technology sounds cool for its
purpose but it is creepy leave us a
comment down below what do you think
friends you know the drill if you wanted
it was earlier before this video is
filming she follow us on pocketnow.com
scripture youtube channel as well you'll
also follow me on twitter Jaime
underscore iveta please give this video
a thumbs up if you liked what you saw I
am hi Mary later thank you very much for
watching and hopefully we will see you
next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
