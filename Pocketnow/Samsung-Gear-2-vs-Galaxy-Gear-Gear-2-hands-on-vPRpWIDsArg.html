that's the new hotness I go fish it with
rocket pound Samsung unpacked five let's
check it out so alongside the original
Galaxy gear you can see the gear 2 has
indeed undergone some slimming if you've
watched our gear 2 neo hands-on this
will be familiar you can see the screws
have been removed from the newer device
the display size remains identical and
it remains an AMOLED powered but the
addition of a home key neither makes
this better or worse depending on your
own personal views the original Galaxy
gear had a power standby key on the
right hand side that has been removed
entirely from the gear 2
its function is now fulfilled by that
home cave which turns it display both on
and off you'll notice a bit of a lag on
this device that is because this is a
pre-production device it is powered by
Tizen we don't think that that is the
reason for the additional leg it's just
a pre-production sample these will be
out in April so they're not quite ready
for primetime yet but you can see the
interface is quite similar we will have
new watch faces for the entire gear line
but you can see that when we go into the
menu options there we actually have
graphics behind them stay
not much going on what else is new here
on the hardware let's see the camera has
been moved from the band in its giant
volcano wart on the original gear to
this recessed smaller module on the
actual body of the watch on the gear 2
alongside the IR blaster which was not
present on the gear also moved the
speaker from on the original gear from
the back of the wristband to the body on
the new gear to making this entire thing
a whole lot slimmer the device as a
whole is slimmer and because all of the
important stuff has been moved into the
body it makes the band switchable very
very important speaking of
customizations like that this device is
available in three colors and you can
see the emphasis on fitness in the
software even more so than on the
original because on the back instead of
just being a bunch of poco ports on the
original vocal ports and a heart rate
sensor which looks into your body and
tells you how fast your heart is beating
now mine is being very quickly because
we've been doing this real long time
the pr2 will be available in April I
believe artists said that will be
compatible with 17 Galaxy devices with
an open SDK so developers can have a lot
more fun with it
Samsung is claiming up to 3 days battery
life the ip67 rating and making this
device impervious to dust and a bit of
immersion in water quick look at the
gear 2 Michael Fisher with pocket now
Adam Lane doing the fancy stuff behind
the camera stay tuned for a lot more fun
