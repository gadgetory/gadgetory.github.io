the motorola event
and on the battery on this 300 milliamps
that's HD the difference in size just
literally if you place two credit cards
on the back of the HD that would be the
difference in size in terms of HD HD
maps but very minimal to feel a teeny
bit and
wait
all have a Super AMOLED HD display 4.7
inches
ice-cream sandwich at lunch so we are
probably with the software but it will
be
jellybeans before and
the difference in battery life and then
it's fine
twenty-five maryam's right
have a differences with HD and RAZR MAXX
all of Accession features
a very little
very fast
okay there's a quick hands-on of the
Droid RAZR MAXX
HD the build on it we actually have the
Kevlar backing the front we have the
Corning Gorilla Glass that's gonna make
it scratch resistant we also have a nano
coating on the outside and the inside of
the device so the nano coatings going to
make it splash resistant so if you get
caught in a rainstorm or anything like
that you're good to go
hit a wipe right off a bit for the
screen we have a 4.7 inch Super AMOLED
HD screen with HD color so it's gonna be
a really really nice experience say you
go onto YouTube watch any videos
anything like that it's gonna look
really nice on the screen it will be
very similar to your HDTV then we have
it actually eight point four millimeters
thin so this is going to be your
thinnest shortest and most narrow 4.7
inch screen out on the market right now
you can add from this one also uses ten
to the center panel right on the left
and then you can also add no panels you
can start with a blank page or you can
take a template and add more stuff
template
can you go to like media or you can be
like OpenOffice
so now you are there so now that is that
this kind of the panels are kind of move
customizer
we have an updated help app so this
actually gives swipe by swipe tutorial
so exactly how to do different things in
the phone so if you have somebody that's
not as familiar with Android it's going
to be a much nicer experience for them
to learn it 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor so it's going to make it very
very quick very fast hey Becca please
camera full HD video
very much iachino performance and all
the stuff that we talked about believe
me pretty much applies here this one
comes with an extended battery is 3300
milliamp hour battery and I saw it
can you hold them side-by-side to see
the thickness different so yes this
one's eight point four millimeters Ben
this one's nine point three millimeters
then and like he said battery life so
the max HD is an 3300 milliamp hour
battery this one has 25-30 noticeable
yes very very small okay thank you so
you get what you're looking at again it
said so you've gotten rid of all the
edges that crews existed on the device
right
they've done that by going to metal
housings so you've got an aluminum
housing on it all supported structure
the other thing about this phone is
compact so it's a qHD Super AMOLED
display same as the original RAZR
but again into a much smaller housing mm
milliamp hour battery so basically a two
thousand milliamp battery battery will
give you the full day of usage out of it
you want to show me my own assistance
and then I'll show you some simple
simplified features so you look at the
size to slide over to the side again
very little on the side you've got your
micro USB you've got a port here for
accessing side of that your SD card and
your SIM card
back is again it's a Kevlar back gives
you that feeling of strength it's an
eight megapixel camera and on the front
we do have a two megapixel for looking
camera for for the one of the things to
show you about the device going back
home single screen device so to hold the
whole concept of this box out of the box
is single screen one swipe this
direction gives you access to quick
settings something that everyone always
wants to get to you don't go four layers
down into your thing always sitting
there if you feel the need for more
panels you can always go over and add
more panels the ability to add more
panels but they're not pre-populated
with anything else so you have that
ability to do that introduce the folder
or that way later this folder and so
what you get is folders so I don't need
to have panels with shortcuts populated
where I can have in a folder I can
organize things into folders now one of
the features is foam it's designed
around converting feature phone users
over smart phones we've got is help
tutorials so these simulations will walk
in the user through parts of their phone
what that is you can walk through
different tutorials on how to do stuff
you know how to use my touch screen
it'll tell you how to swipe and scroll
how to move around stuff so it gives you
practice moving around and doing stuff
on your phone so that the end do it the
new user through Android doesn't have to
feel like they don't know how to use
they can walk through these various
tutorials to help them get accustomed to
it
yeah 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon 810 ternal
memory about 1/4 about 4.5 available to
the end user gig of ram and then again
32 gig expandable on the outside
it is thin it is it is a desirable phone
and the big thing is its edge to edge
display take a big display put it in a
very compact design just try let's play
here you said you just you feel you so
we're familiar with Razer original RAZR
a little bit yeah so it's the same
display that was on the original razor
but they've taken it to getting Shrunk
the housing down quite a bit for you
it's nice
alright thank you very much and then if
you stay in the family
you're saying a family you doing with
these devices yeah where they got those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
