of power and a lot of resolution it
seems that the galaxy s7 active is real
and we get additional details and after
taking ages with iOS 9.3 beta Apple
pulls the plug on the official due to
issues I'm Jaime Rivera I seriously
considered taking the day off today but
it's just boring to spend the Friday
without your Friday comments this is
PocketNow daily the official news today
begin with Apple the company took
forever to launch I oh s 9.3 from the
beta and after that it seems that users
from the iPad air 2 have had significant
issues up to the blue where they can't
activate the iPad in some cases or in
others where they have issues with night
shifts so if you are on the list
Apple has just confirmed that they will
be launching a fix very soon but judging
Apple it'll probably take a week and for
those of you that are still waiting for
project ara google has kept that very
silent they launched the tester in
Puerto Rico we learned nothing about the
tester or its results and we are still
waiting to see when to get a product the
company has a now decided to tease that
something is coming but obviously no
dates were provided stay tuned and
speaking of Google it seems that the
company is planning to do something to
boost its social media presence Google
Plus is terrible and now the company
wants to try something out with
periscope competitor and this is rather
odd as well periscope is not necessarily
the most popular service out there I'm
not really a fan of it now we also have
Facebook live and Google now wants to
come out with a me-too product let's
just hope that they figure out a way to
do it better cuz again Google Plus is
just something that people don't really
hear about and there was a lot of buzz
over the galaxy s7 active we thought
that the galaxy s7 and galaxy s7 edge
with water resistance we're gonna be
enough but it seems that there is a
project coming for inactive and the most
interesting part of the project is its
name apparently it's called the Samsung
Poseidon so why is this phone going to
be the god of water regarding to Greek
mythology I can't wait to see as of yet
they fully come with a
waterproof phone that also looks as good
as the galaxy s6 active they're on to
something really good here and finally
the very hot news that they have to do
with the oneplus 3 we have some leaked
benchmarks of what to expect
it seems the Snapdragon 820 is making
the cut in addition to four gigs of ram
32 gigs of storage we can not confirm if
expandable but it seems the camera is
getting a boost and the display
continues to be 1080p I know a lot of
people will complain about that but
still this is a great phone or it's been
a great legacy of phones it's disrupted
the premium mid-range since day one so
we would love to know for today's
question what do you think about these
specifications for the oneplus three do
you think that the company should boost
something or should drop price tag in my
case I wish they would keep these specs
and drop the price tag but leave us a
comment down below I'd love to know your
opinion as well friends you know the way
