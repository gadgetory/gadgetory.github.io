pocketnow.com as you may have already
seen Daniel Webster gave us some great
coverage on the Samsung Galaxy yes
including his final review and now I'm
also gonna compare the Samsung Galaxy S
to my beloved HTC EVO the first video is
going to be a software review followed
by a hardware review yet another
software overview basically comparing
the speed of the Evo versus the speed of
the Galaxy S as well as the general
hardware makeup so let's go ahead and
get started hi everybody we're back and
as you see here we have the HTC EVO on
the left in the samsung galaxy s on the
right and one of the first tests that
I'm gonna run is actually the startup
time the Evo takes quite a long time to
start up in my opinion so let's see
which one of these starts up faster I'm
gonna pick them both up and just kind of
town three one two three and they're off
now one of the I said one of the things
that I have noticed is the Evo does take
quite some time to turn on in my opinion
it'll get by this menu once it does
it'll sit on the 4G logo for Sprint for
quite a long time galaxy s in started
showing its nice little animation video
looks like the Galaxy S is gonna pull
ahead by a far margin now this may have
something to do with the fact you know
the hummingbird processor versus the
Snapdragon processor but also does have
to be part of the bloatware that the Evo
has to start up you know being on Sprint
has to load the Sprint navigation the
Sprint TV all that fun stuff whereas the
galaxy s technically does not have to do
that so the galaxy s is now fully
working and you see here and the Evo is
still waiting we're still on the white
splash screen so that's not a good sign
that's exciting that you know the Evo
the Snapdragon may not perform as well
as we thought at least on the startup
process so now it's starting to go and
again it's gonna sit in the 4G logo for
a little bit
alright and the Evo is finally booted up
it's still initializing the SD card as
you can see here the Mario background
it's currently frozen while it is
initializing that card but I would say
the Galaxy beat it by about a minute
minute and a half that's pretty bad on
the Evo side so I would say in that
sense hummingbird definitely shows off
and once again the blow wear from Sprint
could have a lot to do with that it
could also be the fact that sense has to
love HTC Sense which is a skin for
Android granted the Galaxy S does have a
skin on the injury as well from Samsung
but it does seem like it's a little
lighter so that could have a lot to do
with it
alright so the next text we're gonna run
is going to be just a browser comparison
we're gonna go to your pocket now calm
on both Lee's at the same time so I'm
gonna do here is I'm going to start the
browser and this one is for some reason
in landscape mode now they should be in
my recent history
all right so now what we're gonna do is
gonna start both days at the same exact
time and we'll see which one is faster
so pretty close I'd say this based on
the status bars the Evo was winning but
that doesn't always mean it all right so
the Evo did load that faster mind you
the Evo also did load the flash now
technically the Evo was still loading a
loader a few extra things passed there
so all in all the galaxy did load a
little faster because the Evo had a load
a few scripts after the fact but
something to keep in mind here is Eva
loaded the flash as you can see up here
the banner ad do you have a mission in
life is not showing up on the galaxy
browser these are the stock browsers so
I could use a different browser and
possibly get the flash but once again
this is loading flash by default whereas
the galaxy s is not alright now I'm just
giving you a basic run-through of each
of the phones menu systems the Evo uses
HTC Sense and actually has this up arrow
to bring you to your menu scrolling
feature where all of your apps will be
so on and so forth whereas the Galaxy S
has the applications button here and you
press this and it will actually scroll
left and right so it's gonna give you
the same functionality a different setup
though and you know kind of it's gonna
be your own personal preference
this one again will scroll vertically
this will go horizontally the galaxy s
and this menu Scrolls much much smoother
almost like the iPhone in my opinion
it's very smooth or as this seems a
little choppy whatever you may think
going into the settings menu here the
settings are going to be the exact same
for the most part so the skin really
doesn't take out any of the features
however you will see some of these icons
and the left on the Evo wears you really
don't have those you know bright and
flashy icons on the Galaxy S again I'll
let you make your own judgment here as
far as if you think the Evo is choppy or
smooth here whereas the galaxy in my
opinion a little smoother so again I'll
let you make your own opinion there I'll
reserve my judgment on that sense but
the next video I'm gonna show you is
really gonna kind of give an in-depth
look at the Google Maps application
we're actually gonna see which one
actually locks faster on the GPS
standpoint in the software standpoint
we're also gonna take a look at some of
the gaming asphalt 5 comes on the Galaxy
S and I do have it on my Evo so we're
gonna see which one performs
laughter there once again this does use
the HTC Sense whereas the Galaxy S uses
Samsung's little own skin that they have
on there as well so this menus a little
different here but you can still
download these same apps from the
Android Market that you could be for but
now you also have the benefit of these
samsung apps as well so once again guys
be sure to stay tuned for the next
videos that are coming up we're gonna
have a little bit of a showdown on the
hardware between these two guys between
the Evo and the Galaxy S as well as the
part two of the software comparison
between these two devices and you guys
can make your own opinions of you know
which one you think is a better phone if
you're trying to make that decision so
be sure as always to give us a thumbs up
here feel free to comment and ask any
questions you have and stay tuned thanks
