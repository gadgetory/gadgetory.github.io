now calm as you may have already seen
Daniel Webster gave us some great
coverage on the Samsung Galaxy yes
including his final review and now i'm
also going to compare the samsung galaxy
s2 my beloved HTC EVO the first video is
going to be a software review followed
by a hardware review yet another
software overview basically comparing
the speed of the evo vs the speed of the
galaxy s as well as the general hardware
makeup so let's go ahead and get started
hi everybody we're back and as you see
here we have the HTC evo on the left in
the Samsung Galaxy S on the right and
one of the first test that I'm going to
run is actually the startup time the evo
takes quite a long time to start off my
opinion so let's see which one of these
starts up faster I'm going to pick them
both up and just kind of town three one
two three and they're off
now one of like I said one of the things
that I have notices the evo does take
quite some time i turn on my opinion
it'll get by this menu once it does
it'll sit on the 4g logo for sprint for
quite a long time galaxy s ansari
showing its nice little animation video
looks like the galaxy s is going to pull
ahead by a far margin now this may have
something to do with the fact you know
the hummingbird processor versus the
Snapdragon processor but also has have
to be part of the bloatware that the evo
us to start up you know being on sprint
has to load the sprint navigation the
sprint TV all that fun stuff whereas the
galaxy s technically does not have to do
that so the galaxy s is now fully
working and you see here and the evo is
still waiting we're still on the white
splash screen so that's not a good sign
let's assign that you know the evo the
Snapdragon may not perform as well as we
thought at least on the startup process
so now it's starting to go and again
it's going to sit in the 4g logo for a
little bit all right and the evo is
finally booted up it's still
initializing the SD card as you can see
here the Mario background is currently
frozen while it is initializing that
card but I would say the galaxy beat it
by about a minute minute and a half
that's pretty bad on the evo side so I
would say in that sense hummingbird
definitely shows off and once again the
blow away from sprint could have a lot
to do with that it could also be the
fact that sense has to load HTC Sense
which is a skin for Android granted the
galaxy s does have a skin on the injured
as well from Samsung but it does seem
like it's a little lighter so I could
have a lot to do with it alright so the
next text we're going to run is going to
be just a browser comparison we're going
to go to pocket now calm on both legs at
the same time so I'm going to do here is
I'm going to start the browser and this
one is for some reason in landscape mode
now they should be in my recent history
alright so now we're going to do is
going to start both days at the same
exact time and we'll see which one is
faster so pretty close I'd say this
based on the status bar as the evo is
winning but that doesn't always mean it
alright so the evo did load that faster
mind you the evo also did load the flash
that technically the evo still loading a
lot of a few extra things past there so
all in all the galaxy did load a little
faster because evo out a load a few
scripts after the fact but something to
keep in mind here is evil Oh to the
flash as you can see up here the banner
ad do you have a mission in life is not
showing up on the Galaxy browser these
are the stock browser so I could use a
different browser and possibly get the
flash but once again this is loading
flash by default whereas the galaxy s is
not all right now just giving you a
basic run-through of each of the phone's
menu systems the evo uses HTC Sense and
actually has this up arrow to bring you
to your menu scrolling feature where all
of your apps will be so on and so forth
whereas the galaxy s has the
applications button here and you press
this and it will actually scroll left
and right so it's going to give you the
same functionality a different setup
though and you know kind of it's gonna
be your own personal preference this one
again will scroll vertically this will
go horizontally the galaxy s and this
menu scroll is much much smoother almost
like the iPhone in my opinion it's very
smooth or as this seems a little choppy
whatever you may think going into the
settings menu here the settings are
going to be the exact same for the most
part so the skin really doesn't take out
any of the features however you will see
some of these icons on the left on the
EVO whereas you really don't have those
you know bright and flashy icons on the
Galaxy S again I'll let you make your
own judgment here as far as if you think
the evo is choppy or smooth here whereas
the galaxy in my opinion a little
smoother so again I'll let you make your
own opinion there I'll reserve my
judgment on that sense but the next
video I'm going to show you is really
going to kind of give an in-depth look
at the Google Maps application we're
actually going to see which one actually
locks faster on the GPS standpoint in
the software standpoint we're also going
to take a look at some of the gaming
asphalt 5 comes on the Galaxy S and I do
have it on my EVO so we're going to see
which one performs
Master there once again this does use
the HTC Sense whereas the galaxy s uses
Samsung's little own skin that they have
on there as well so this menu is a
little different here but you can still
download these same apps from the
android market that you could before but
now you also have the benefit of these
samsung apps as well so once again guys
be sure to stay tuned for the next
videos that are coming up we're going to
have a little bit of a showdown the
hardware between these two guys between
the evo and the galaxy s as well as the
part 2 of the software comparison
between these two devices and you guys
can make your own opinions of you know
which one you think is a better phone if
you're trying to make that decision so
be sure as always to give us a thumbs up
here feel free to comment and ask any
questions that you have and stay tuned
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
