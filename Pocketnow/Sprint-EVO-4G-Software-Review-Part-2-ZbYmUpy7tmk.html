pocket now calm and this is part two of
the software review of the HTC EVO 4G
now if you missed part one be sure to
check it out I'm going to put a link up
here a little annotation so you can jump
back take a look at that and then come
back to this video in this video we're
going to talk about some of the built-in
programs on the HTC EVO 4G some of the
Sprint add-ons the camera and the
YouTube functionality with the higher
quality setting and a few other things
let's take a look okay so let's take a
look we're gonna unlock the device what
I'm gonna do is show you some of the
programs that really aren't common for
other Android devices out there starting
with the mobile hotspot application I'm
actually going to show you this in use
in the next video now what this does is
it pulls down 3G or 4G and spits out
Wi-Fi for up to I think it's eight
devices and this will actually cost you
an extra thirty dollars per month to use
because Sprint figures you know you
should be buying a my5 which is fifty to
sixty dollars per month but they'll save
you ten bucks if you buy it in a phone a
really cool feature if you find yourself
traveling a lot if you have your laptop
on you take this out of your pocket you
have an instant Wi-Fi router and like I
said it does work over the 4G although
the 4G is another ten dollars a month if
you want to use that so a lot of added
fees here to get the full-fledged
hotspot application it's going to be
about forty dollars per month for the 4G
and for the application itself again
I'll show that in the next video I'm
going to sweat to the right because we
have some sprint specific things here
we've sprint TV which they've been
pushing for a while now it's ten dollars
per month and I'll tell you right now I
don't think it's worth ten dollars a
month because there are just so many
free video offerings out there like
YouTube and Internet video so I'll just
give you an idea of what it's like I'm
gonna go to live TV we'll go to say ABC
Mobile TV and let it queue up and you'll
see what it's like
okay so presumably this is live TV it's
not filling up the full screen and it's
also not high-definition it looks pretty
much like it would on a tube television
it looks like I skipped to another
channel I'm not sure what's happening
let me go back back again and we can go
to recommended there's some on-demand
stuff there's some live stuff again I
don't think it's worth an extra 10 bucks
a month but you can be the judge of that
so I'm going to get out of here and go
back to the home screen okay
there's also some some sports
applications included on here like
sprint football and what you can do is
click on your favorite team and it will
load up certain bits of information like
the draft prospect you can get a
schedule for some of these teams
I just exited the application and it
keeps going out and if we tap somewhere
around here I think we can get back your
change your favorite team go it over
here and again it gives you the logo as
the team's you choose a team and it
gives you a variety of information so
kind of cool if you like to keep up on
your hunt football so I'm gonna get out
of this go back over here we also have a
NASCAR application okay so here's the
NASCAR application you can get live
video you can get leaderboard stats I'm
not very much into NASCAR so I can't
tell you much about this application
although it looks pretty cool if you are
interested in this sport let's go back
to the home screen see what else we have
here sprint navigation which just links
to the navigation panel and then
Sprint's on which will show you your
statistics of your account how many
minutes you have it'll just launch the
browser so let's jump into YouTube and
now with the Evo 14 you get a new high
quality setting which really brings HD
like a video to your device which is
quite nice so I'm going to go down the
list and I'm gonna search actually here
for pocket now video
here it is and here is the sprint Evo 4G
hardware tour that we put up and it's
going to load up and I'll switch it into
HQ down here's the HQ button when it's
red its high quality when it's great it
is not its queuing up right now let's
let it buffer okay so I'm gonna turn on
the high quality now okay so here we go
it's hard to see on video but the
quality is right good it's not amazingly
better than the standard quality but
it's definitely a big improvement let's
just jump over to sort of a middle
section here does he can get a better
feel for this okay so here we are and
this is the high quality set of stuff so
very nice very good video quality and
this is why I wouldn't get the sprint TV
option because YouTube's high quality is
awesome and you couple that with the
awesome kickstand you've got a really
cool video player for your device and of
course you can load on movies on the
micro SD card so that helps tremendously
- now I want to talk about the camera
because you can actually record video in
720p so I'm going to change the mode
here to video mode and you're going to
see that if I go down to settings and
resolution we get full 720p video
recording in the for view and pocket now
calm where I'll talk more about the
quality of this but as a hint it's good
but it's not amazing it's not like you
in are using an HD camcorder but it's
definitely a step up from what you get
on a lot of other smartphones and if we
go to photo we can dial down to the full
eight megapixel resolution which is
about 3200 pixels by 1900 pixels that is
a lot of resolution and again there's a
little preview the camera on the Evo 4G
creates a lot of noise when it takes
pictures even though it has that dual
LED flash to light up subjects I find
the be the camera to be kind of noisy
but you know this is a this is a camera
four quick shots not necessarily to you
know win awards and so here so here's a
photo I took of my dog I'm gonna try to
zoom in on her fur and so you can see
there's pretty good detail here you can
see her little nose and the 8 megapixels
makes a lot of resolution a lot of
detail but if you were to look at this
on a computer monitor it's it's noisy I
can tell you that so let's jump back
here and I'll go through a couple other
applications that come here and of
course you can download any application
that you desire from the marketplace so
we've got some other things here
standard calculator the calendar
footprints which is an HTC feature which
will allow you to take pictures certain
locations and geotag them and then you
can you can rate the place you can show
it on a map so a nice little feature for
those that travel we gmail photo gallery
friends stream which I've shown in the
previous video we have a little bit of a
user manual on the device this links to
HTC's website go down the list the
Amazon mp3 store PDF viewer from Adobe
the quick which will allow you to do
two-way video chat from an Evo 4G to an
Evo 4G it's difficult for us to test
this because there aren't many people
out there that have an Evo 4G right now
in fact if you want to test this with me
leave a comment I love to check it out
and see what the live video chat is like
speaking of live video chat something I
forgot to show you is that you can
actually switch cameras here on the
camera application so if we go over here
there should be a setting in here to
switch cameras to the front camera and
see there I am that's what it looks like
when I'm looking down and at the camera
there at the device and you should be
able to do this for video as well yep so
you can record video using the
front-facing camera very handy feature
to have on a device and the word on the
street is that Skype is coming out with
an application for smartphones where you
can do video chat so that'll be awesome
because other devices like the new
iPhone presumably and some other Android
devices coming out in the future will
have front-facing video cameras so
you'll be able to do this video chat
with more than just people
that have an evil 4g going down the list
we have you know the other typical
things here's a really cool racing game
I just want to show you so you get an
idea of how the graphics are on this
device I'm gonna have to tilt the camera
so I can use the accelerometer okay here
we are this is a free game by the way
club regent thunder I use it quite often
to test the graphic prowess of the
device and it just looks awesome on the
on the screen and the frame rate is just
ridiculous it's very good so I'm gonna
keep playing this please thumbs up the
video if you liked it and subscribe to
our Channel coming up soon we're going
to have a video about the 4G coverage
and show you what it's like to browse
the web over 4G that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
