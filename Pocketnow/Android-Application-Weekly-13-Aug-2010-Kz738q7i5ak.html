pacquiao calm and this is another
episode of the android application
weekly in which we review five
applications in 30 seconds each that we
think you should install on your android
device so these are the best of the best
application so let's get started so this
application is called a car and it
allows you to keep records of all your
service Phillips and all of your other
sort of information for your vehicle so
right here I have my toyota tacoma so if
i look at my reminders i can see that my
oil filter is due in three thousand
miles or two months and 25 days so i can
also go back I can get statistics
management charts at a different vehicle
foot if I'd like and import an export I
can also view the service records this
application is free on the android
market this is a puzzle game called
alchemy and what it allows you to do is
combine different elements earth air
fire and water to create new objects so
if i want to create alcohol all i have
to do is move the water to the fire I
can move air to the earth and create
dust I can just double tap to create
more dust or I can double tap here to
create new elements this application is
free on the android market but it is an
adware program to unlock that ad where
it does cost around three dollars this
game is called caroom 3d and it's a
pretty powerful billiard style game
there are many different styles of
gameplay and you can move the board
around if you like and you can also zoom
in or zoom out to shoot the ball all you
have to do is hit here and move your cue
stick back after you've aligned hear
your cue ball with the lines on the
board and then hit shoot and it will
move your ball the application is free
on the android market for 15 days and
after that it is just two dollars for
all you stargazers out there you may
enjoy google sky maps which is kind of
like google earth but with the stars
constellations and planets so the
program uses the onboard components to
move in proximity to where your location
is located so you can also change this
by adding it to manual and now you can
move the sky around if you'd like you
can also search for objects by clicking
out here we
search for Mars and now we'll locate
Mars this application is free on the
android market this application is
called rock player and it has a built in
divx encoder as well as many other video
encoders to use to play video files on
your Android device so I have a little
sample video right here and if you saw
that this is an ad-supported application
so we'll go here and you can view the
entire video if you like and this is a
divx file and all i have to do to remove
this happily this ad here is just tap on
the screen unfortunately this little red
are over here unless you purchase the
full version which is around ten dollars
so this wraps up this episode of the
android application weekly and stay

more great applications and to get the
