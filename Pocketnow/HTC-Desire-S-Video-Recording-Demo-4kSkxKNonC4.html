I'm showing you at the HTC Desire s
tamra now we like to go ahead and run
through a whole bunch of stuff and you
guys have already seen the unboxing in
the first boot but we also like to show
you what the camera can do on it so
here's what the video can do now this is
set at 720p and I'm showing you right
now flowers
cuz I know how much you guys like
flowers let's go ahead and do a a kind
of a zoom if you will this is going to
be an analogue zoom meaning I'm moving
the camera closer just so you can kind
of see how it does in macro I'm about an
inch and a half away from the flower
right there pull back and do kind of the
same thing with a digital zoom so that's
what it looks like digital zooming and
back out and back in now digital zoom
you lose some of the resolution because
you're not really zooming the camera
you're just zooming in on the pixels so
you lose a bit of quality when you do it
that way rather than you just actually
go in and get closer so I want to show
you what that looks like we'll pull back
and do a little bit of action shots here
we'll do a pan across the flowerbed this
is really early spring so there's not a
lot of color come over here and see if
we can get some color contrast in the
shade a little bit come out here out
into the Sun now this is at about arm's
length away from me so you can see kind
of what it looks like on screen it looks
great even in this bright sunlight we'll
see what it looks like so we'll go ahead
and upload this to YouTube without any
video processing at all just whatever
that they do on there and so you can see
what it would look like if you were to
to be the one who'd actually record and
upload to YouTube so far I'm pretty
impressed the camera is fast its
lightweight the picture looks good on
the screen that I'm looking at right
here so overall pretty good make sure
you tune back in to get the full review
of the HTC Desire s that's going to be
coming up in the next couple days
and if you want to follow along with
that that's over at pocketnow.com make
sure you subscribe to our video series
so you can see the other videos we still
have a software review to do on this
phone as well for pocket now
I'm Joey by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
