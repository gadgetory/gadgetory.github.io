cheddar News team their team who
broadcasts tech and business news they
streamed from the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange it would seem there's
another round of companies trying to
juice their benchmark scores for those
of you who follow our channel you're
probably well familiar with benchmarks
are these little apps you run from your
phone which try and judge the overall
performance of different handsets a
benchmarking Apple run your phone
through a series of tests at the
completion of which you'll receive some
kind of relative score you can compare
with other devices to see who has the
bigger team who has the more powerful
phone and in the past a number of
companies have been caught juicing those
benchmark scores going about your daily
activities it's pretty rare the times
you'll need to tap into the full
processing power of a modern smartphone
when you go about checking your email or
reading your Twitter you don't really
need all of that power most modern
smartphones will engage in some kind of
behavior to scale back and also help
preserve battery life while also keeping
the phone running cooler so what does it
mean to juice a benchmark well those
benchmarking apps are very limited run
scenarios it's really unlikely you're
going to be tapping into that apt
multiple times during one day or over
successive days and you run the test you
get your score you get on with your life
for companies trying to make their
product look as powerful as possible
however we do find little pieces of code
that when a benchmarking app is
identified on your device when it's
being run that the phone will tap into a
reserve of power really launching into
the fastest possible clock speeds all
cores on board in a way that users
typically won't be able to access that
kind of power in their own daily
activity you fire up the benchmark and
the phone will run as hot as it possibly
can but then you flip over into
something like trying to shoot uhe video
from a camera or playing a really
graphics-intensive game and you probably
won't be able to utilize all of those
resources for your own activities
smartphone manufacturer gets that great
score then a bunch of bloggers run off
to write stories about what the most
powerful devices are and somehow that
translates into a word of mouth or
perception of a product being really
killer and that should equal more sales
the two companies on the hook right now
my 2 and 1 plus definitely frustrating
for one plus here in the United States
is this is a company that has built its
reputation through word of mouth
and through advertising really bold
statements never settling flagship
killer and has been criticized about
performance in the past especially in
terms of things like RAM management on a
personal note every time one of these
stories breaks it just serves as an
opportunity and reminder that we
probably shouldn't be putting too much
stock into smartphone performance as it
pertains to synthetic benchmarks if you
really like your phone should you like
your phone less if another gadget
outperforms it by 3% in some type of
synthetic app is that really going to
impact your Instagram usage but as it
pertains these manufacturers in the fact
that I would concern myself a power user
for all of the low power modes that we
have on our phones I kind of wish we had
a user accessible super awesome mode I'm
a grown-up I'm a big boy I know what's
going on with my technology I make a
conscious choice to say I need to run my
phone as powerful as it can go fully
realizing that it's going to have a
drastically negative impact on battery
life I should be able to make that
decision knowing that these gadgets can
surge to a higher tier of performance
there are times I wish I had a little
like nice buttons like really kick in
that turbo and get that compression
going bad car metaphors we're talking
about consumer electronics and of course
we want to hear from you when one of
these stories breaks how does it affect
your perception of that manufacturer 1
plus a samsung how much do those scores
really influence your purchasing
decision strap is a comment down below

kinds of conversation as always thank so
