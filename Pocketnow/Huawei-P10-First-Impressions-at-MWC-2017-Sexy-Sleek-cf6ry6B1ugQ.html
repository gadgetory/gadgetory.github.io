right now so I'm trying not to yell and
be that douchebag American who's making
all kinds of racket if you've been
following me on Twitter you would know
that there was a little bit of drama in
trying to get our hands on the phone
that we're talking about right now but
finally came through and we finally have
this beauty to talk about here this is
the huawei p10 already the initial
impressions that I've had in setting
this phone up and playing with it pretty
positive talking about some of that spec
stuff the P series this year is really
focusing on trying to bring a more
fashionable approach to some of the
horsepower and features that we really
liked about the May 9 if the mate nine
is a big ol heavy duty diesel truck then
the P series the P 10 should be that hot
battalion roadster this is a 5.1 inch
1080p display powered by that Kiran 960
chipset absolute screamer and of course
the dual Leica cameras which we really
liked on our May 9
this thing out of the box of course
you've got those papers that you're
never going to read we've got a USBC
cable we've got headphones we've got the
supercharger which is going to charge
this thing up pretty quick and we have
to continue praising Huawei and
companies like Huawei for delivering a
pretty complete out-of-the-box
experience even providing a little
plastic snap cover to keep your phone
looking clean once I'm out of this video
my p10 is going to live in this little
plastic shell just like my main mine
does ok immediately out of the box that
first impression we can definitely point
to some design inspiration from other
companies they're also working on
rounded corners smooth-edged and 10
aligned phones in black but I do
appreciate some of the little attention
to detail like the chamfered edge which
runs along the front face of the phone
the power button having that red accent
you know the speaker port grille the
USBC port having their own little
distinctive Huawei touches and of course
from a design element standpoint it is
pretty impressive to see a dual-camera
sensor phone with hardware optical image
stabilization that is perfectly flush
with the rear casing of the device it's
not really proven a simple task to
accomplish from other phone
manufacturers the first boot on the p10
was lightning quick setup process was
about what you would expect from a
premiere Android handset and in terms of
customizing the phone I did two things
one I brought back the app door that's a
new part of EMU i-5 you can have any
more Android like layout between your
home screens and a proper slot to keep
all of your apps hidden away and then I
also got rid of the on
screen controls the p10 is introducing
to the phone market something that we
played with on the media pad their
tablet we're a single tap on your home
button is the back button a long press
is your home button and a gesture swipe
will bring up the multitasking menu on
Android it's a unique implementation for
controlling an Android phone I'm not
sure if I'm going to like it or not but
I want to give it a run and if nothing
else that'll save me a few pixels on my
screen for not having those software
controls this is very early days for
testing I mean where it really it's very
early day for testing I've had this
thing for less than 24 hours but
immediately I'm liking a lot of what I'm
seeing here in bringing those make 9
features over into a small form factor
just in general this is going to be a
pretty good show for me MWC definitely
bringin me some toys that I'm going to
like playing with I'm not the biggest
fan of phablet so to see the LG G 6
bringing some of my favorite v20
features to a smaller form factor and
now the p10 bringing some of my favorite
mate features into a smaller form factor
I'm definitely excited to be rocking
these phones in the beginning of 2017
we're going to have a ton more coverage
and comparisons on p10 on g6 and
wrapping up all of our MWC videos for
this show in Barcelona this was a
beautiful spot to find this to kind of
shoot a little extra footage and get
some fresh air not being cooped up in
that air B&amp;amp;B with those stinky boys Tony
and Jaime thanks so much for watching be
