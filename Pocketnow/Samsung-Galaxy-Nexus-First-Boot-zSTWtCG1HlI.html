our last couple videos we showed you the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus in this video we're
going to show you the first boot and
just initial software impressions of
what comes with the device and what you
can expect when you get your very own
Samsung Galaxy Nexus okay to get started
what we need to do is press and hold the
power button just for a moment you'll
have a slight vibration and then the
google logo will show up it's very crisp
very bright on this black screen that's
soon going to go away and now we've got
a very nice boot animation very similar
in color and kind of feel to that on
honeycomb tablet of course not in the
other honeycomb shape we then have this
Android is upgrading the message and now
we're at a different a different style a
different a different way of getting
started if you can see this here instead
of having the touch the android to begin
we have a nice welcome screen with the
honeycomb light blue and then it's
detected that i'm in the united states
and is saying hey this is english us do
you want to change that if you want to
change your locale you can just drop
that down you can choose a whole bunch
of other stuff now of course this is the
UK version which is essentially that the
worldwide english international version
if you will but specifically for UK
we've got this nice line art Andy you
can place an emergency call from this
screen if you need to hope you don't
need to and then we can start by tapping
on the start arrow from here if you want
to make this google you can either sign
into your existing google account you
can get a google account meaning set up
one now if you don't have one already or
skip this and come back later and of
course you've got this little
information box that tells you what this
is what you can do with it why you might
want to do it will okay on that let's go
ahead and sign in now the first thing
that we're going to do here is sign in
with our email address and password and
then after that we're going to do
something kind of interesting so let me
type that information in and i'll show
you the really cool new feature in ice
cream
sandwich so now I'm input my username
and password and I did it wrong
deliberately so you could see what
you're going to get if you've forgotten
it or type in something wrong again very
nice conversational messages to help
tell you in this case my username and
password didn't match and I need to try
again if I've lost my password for
example I can now go to that address on
a desktop browser or if I want to I can
skip this let's go ahead and try again
and we'll get that set up right this
time having corrected that password now
let's go ahead and sign in signing in
can take a few moments generally not
that long anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds
it is not uncommon at this point we're
asked if we want to backup and restore
which we do we'll go to next this is
restoring the phone it's restoring all
of your settings and restoring your apps
this can take a while if you've got a
lot of apps that take advantage of
google storage next we're at the use
Google location we'll go ahead and say
yes to that or next to that reading from
my google profile you can see that my
first name and last name or Joe Levi
right there and it has this phone
belongs to just so you can personalize
some apps say next to that and setup is
complete and ready to use now if you're
doing this without a high-speed internet
connection for example the last time I
did it I had my sim installed but I
didn't have a really good connection for
some reason the phone thought it was in
airplane mode so it asked me if I wanted
to do this all over Wi-Fi and it set
that up first and foremost for me we
didn't see that in this boot but that's
ok because we do have hspa+ and as you
can see up here we're now downloading
some apps so let's get to this really
quick we've got a message that says make
yourself at home it's showing me where I
can see all of my apps by touching on
this app drawer circle I don't know if
we call it an app drawer anymore we'll
say ok to that here's our desktop so
let's go ahead and flick around a little
bit very nice
now I just tapped on that drawer and
it's showing me if I want to choose some
apps to add to the home screen I tap and
hold it and that will help me add it to
the home screen so just little hints of
tutorials in case you haven't used the
phone before and really this might seem
like it gets in the way for power users
but it really doesn't because ice cream
sandwich has a new way to add stuff to
the desktop whether that is an app an
app that you want to put in a folder or
even a widget it lets you do this all
very fluid all very very nice and it
tells you how to do that right here
because in all honesty it's new for all
of us will say okay to that and then
here is our drawer it is a horizontal
one now very nice with our screen
indicator on the bottom quick access to
the market at the top from there those
are my apps if I want to add one let's
say I want to add which one should we
pick guys let's do latitude I want to
pick latitude I tap and hold and then I
can drop it right there now I've just
made a folder that has inside of it
gallery and latitude and it's telling me
how I can organize a folder so very nice
I can even rename that folder we're
going to call it stuff just for kicks
and giggles and there we go we've got a
folder named stuff was just that easy if
I want to add stuff to it add more stuff
to stuff I can just drag and drop just
like that very nice back to the drawer
once we get to the end of our apps then
we switch over to our widgets now if
you've got a lot of apps that may go for
page after page after page so you can
jump right to widgets by tapping up
there very nice if you want to add say
bookmarks this is a widget now tap and
hold and drop it wherever you want it to
go and there we go we're back home and
if we want to see that we can just wear
did we put it I forgot where we put it
let's try that one more time guys going
all over the place here so back to
widgets I didn't have enough room on
that screen that's why it complained at
me so we've got an empty screen here
we'll just drop it right there and
that's what I want now
there we go there is my bookmarks first
time I've done that so it's doing an
automatic Google sign-in for me we'll go
ahead and go back but you can see just
how easy that is now to go ahead and
drop widgets and apps right there now
we're going to get into a lot more
detail about how you can how you can
customize Ice Cream Sandwich how ice
cream sandwich is different from from
gingerbread so make sure you subscribe
to the video channel so you can keep up
on those all right so that was the first
boot and software impressions of the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus the hspa+ version
which is currently only available in the
United Kingdom hopefully it'll make it
across the pond to the states to AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile in the near future if you
like seeing this kind of stuff make sure
you give the video a big thumbs up if
you haven't already subscribed to our
