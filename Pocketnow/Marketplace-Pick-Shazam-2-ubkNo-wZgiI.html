paco calm and a program that's been
around for quite some time is Shazam the
programming now is very intuitive
actually I was playing around with it
and it does some pretty incredible
things so I'm of course going to tag a
song so I'm just going to click tag now
and I'm gonna have to run over my
computer and play a song real quick and
it's a pretty unknown song so we'll see
if it actually picks it up
oh wait we'll see if it actually
recognizes that song that wow it
actually worked fireflies by owl city so
it's a pretty new song it hasn't been
around too long so if I want to look at
my other tags all I have to do is flick
over and we'll show them I was just
listening to some Christmas minute
before playing around with this program
and if we want to get information on the
specific song all we have to do is click
on here and we can get track review
album review biography and discography
if want to get track review and click on
here and actually open up your internet
browser for your windows mobile device
so as you can see when the page is
loaded it actually gives you quite a bit
of information about the song and what
now you can also of course like I said
pick track information and discography
and all that great stuff so close this
we can go to this middle button right
here which will look for similar tracks
to that song it wasn't exactly what
we're looking for and here's a few other
songs that kind of sound like that we
can also share this Shazam tag if we
want with our friends so we can either
do it through SMS or through email so if
we want to share a song with our friends
we can do that it's pretty simple can
also eggs outta here if I want to delete
this a particular tag can do that so
going to some of the settings here so if
I wanted to look and see what other
people around the world are actually
tagged and I your tag chart and this
will show what songs people are
tightened so apparently the lyrics on
these songs are not that great oh that's
interesting fireflies number four oh
well apparently it is a new song go back
into menu into settings and we can go to
general settings we can tag on startup
so if I just wanted to immediately tag
the song you just click tag on startup
and once I launch the program it will
automatically start so click OK payment
status so right now i'm using a trial
where version of this program and the
full where version program does cost
four dollars and ninety-nine cents click
back check for upgrade
latest version of course and I can
delete all tags and about information so
this is Shazam version 2.1 for windows
mobile devices and the full version
program does actually cost four dollars
and ninety-nine cents on marketplace and
this is another marketplace pick where
you pick some of the best and most
useful programs on windows mobile
marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
