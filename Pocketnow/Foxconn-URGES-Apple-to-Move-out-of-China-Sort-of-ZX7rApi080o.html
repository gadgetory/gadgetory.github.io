production out of China but it seems
that the reasons for this are not what
we expected we have new leaks of the
Google pixel for sort of and that camera
module is looking good and if you want
it to buy a Google tablet it looks like
it won't be a good idea to consider
these right now I'm high metal Iveta and
yeah TGIF for this Friday we've got a
ton of comments to cover in the recap
tomorrow it's gonna be crazy
this is firing out daily brought to you
by the honored twenty series the
official news today begin with deals
iPad pro I love it and well if you're
looking for the twelve point nine inch
iPad pro currently it's on sale on
Amazon for hit eight hundred and twenty
four dollars shipped then if you also go
to walmart.com you can find it up to 120
dollars off and then if you're looking
for the eleven inch which is the one
that I use in that I prefer that one is
two hundred and twenty dollars off there
are a ton of deals for Apple products
right now which is actually becoming
something of a problem for the company
that we're gonna discuss soon anyways
link in the description because yes it's
clear that Apple is not selling as much
as the company expected or as much as
its suppliers expected for example in
the case of Samsung and we know that
Samsung is the manufacturer of OLED
displays for Apple's iPhone 10s and 10's
Macs and I don't know what the deal was
with their contract but apparently Apple
is looking into a penalty because they
have not met the demand that Samsung was
expecting and I believed there was some
sort of clause that the to find that but
thing about it is apparently
negotiations are in Apple is offering
Samsung that they are gonna get the
business form listen to this Mac books
and iPads with ohlet's this all it
displays in the future which means that
this pretty much sort of confirms the
rumors of that 16 inch macbook pro in
the 15 inch chassis with an OLED display
and also the rumors of an iPad pro
coming with outlets soon so it seems
that Apple already has a supplier we
don't know exactly how the deal end up
though and speaking of deals we've been
covering rumors on the Nintendo switch
for quite a bit that apparently there
are two models coming one that
smaller one that it's larger and
apparently the smaller one is going to
be a more budget-friendly device think
about it as we now have renders that
obviously come from case makers because
these guys are awesome they help us do
our jobs and well we've got this case
and chosen showing us renders of the
switch the smaller less expensive
variant that seems to not have
replaceable joy constant control seem
the same the screen seems pretty much
the same but it seems like if you won't
be able to replace these and I am down
by my third joy con replacement guy so I
am concerned that buying this smaller
less expensive Nintendo switch is gonna
end up being a problem for consumers
probably a Nintendo has come up with new
technology that's gonna make it more
durable but look at the link in the
description and let us know what you
think about this design and for those of
you that are in the market for a Google
tablet right now the only one is pretty
much the pixel slate and Google has
pretty much pulled a plug it started as
a report and now we've got Rick Arthur
Lowe confirming that yes Google is
leaving the tablet market when it comes
to Chrome tablets no word on Android
tablets it just said tablets and Chrome
and mention that they're still gonna be
working it's not that the platform is
dying we're still gonna get tablets with
Chrome OS they're just not gonna be made
by Google and obviously we are expecting
to see better products in the pixel
slate because you know I really wanted
to live that product I actually wrote
the script part of the script for this
video on the pixel slate just me wanting
to go back to it so remember it and I
put it back in the shelf
I'm sure yeah we get why Google is
putting their business in the shelf as
well and we'll see what happens to the
feature of Chrome OS tablets given the
fact that I actually like the idea to
have a more powerful tablet than just an
Android one and since we're talking
Google those of you wondering what the
possible look and feel of that final
pixel for is going to be like it's funny
how some people were saying that these
were reports notes these are concept
designs following all the leaks that
we've seen over what this device might
look like I mean we pretty much don't
necessarily have schematics but we have
dimensions we know that the camera hump
is going to be almost a millimeter
thicker and stuff like that and so we
get to see what it looks like in white
mint and black and I'll tell you this
much it does a
look that ugly I'm not saying that it's
great but stay tuned it seems that this
could probably be the design I mean
Google pretty much kind of confirmed it
and finally the hottest news that I have
to do with some very interesting reports
that just emerged and a clarification
over what we've learned because the
report claims that Foxconn is urging
Apple to leave China but the more you
dig into the information the more you
realize that this is not necessarily for
the reasons you think the report rates
that fox khan's founder is urging Apple
to move production out of China and it's
actually for two reasons the first one
is the main one which is Trump's 25%
tariffs which Apple is worried about
because according to them it would hurt
competitiveness globally
however Terry Gao is urging them to move
to Taiwan instead of India which the
reports had that this is where Foxconn
was going so this is very interesting
because he just stepped down from the
chairman position of Foxconn because
he's running for president of Taiwan so
this has become very interesting because
of true there is a purpose for the move
the tariffs and everything but we heard
India and sure Foxconn is a Taiwanese
company but isn't it rather convenient
that now that there's a political
campaign involved we want to bring jobs
back to Taiwan and money and stuff like
that this is interesting in today's
question let us know I mean whatever you
buy a product do you really care where
it's manufactured or do you just care
over the prestige of the company that's
selling it to you because I'll tell you
this much I honestly don't
I don't care where it's manufactured I
mean it's still gonna have the same
warranty I really just want my product
to perform as it should but this is just
me we would love to know what you think
