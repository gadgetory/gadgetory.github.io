packing.com and today i'ma she rolled
dice 2.0 g version and what this program
allows you to do is play board games
without the use of actual dice so you
can use this program to roll dice for
any number up to pretty much an infinite
amount and the dice range anywhere from
three sides up to 100 side dice so if
you like to play certain board games
that require strategy like Dungeons and
Dragons or any of those sort of games
this will be a great program for that so
let's say I'm just going to play a
regular game of dice with to die that
are six sided each so right here I have
a six-sided dice so I can click the
number here and we're going to change
that to two and this is the modifier
allows you to add a certain number so if
I wanted to add a number to the nut to
the total of the dice rolled I would
could add any one of these numbers or i
can scroll over to the left or right and
change the modifier for that so we're
just going to click 0 because i don't
want a modifier and I click click role
or if you have an HTC or Samsung device
you can actually use the accelerometer
in your device to shake and it will roll
the dice for you so click roll again and
here you can see that the dice have
rolled a 1 and a 62 total a 7 so we'll
just go back and let's say that I want
to roll a 12 sided dice let's say I want
to roll it like six times or something
who knows and I can click on roll and it
will show me the numbers on the dice and
give me the total for that role so we
can go back and we can go into some of
the settings here and this allows you to
change the language between Spanish and
English you know the sound on vibration
on g-sensor on whatever you want you can
also go down here to pax editor and what
that allows you to do is to change
certain dice configurations for various
games so right here I have one set to
Yahtzee which uses a six-sided die so
dice of six
and I have three separate roles so i
have 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 of course I can also add
new so if i want i can change the name
here let's say just will try game and
change the faces of the dice so let's
say that I wanted a 10 sided die and
number of roles i'm going to change the
number of roles to three and we can add
that there and as you see it customizes
it so i can change this side let's say i
want to play with the six as well and if
i can add that and if i add any time I
need to change the modifier can go down
here let's say that I want to add 10 to
that six sided dice just click on there
and it will add to my packs editor so
i'll click ok and so now I have this
game pack editor go back click OK again
and now from here I can actually load my
game pack so there it goes and as you
see I have the number of dice here
number of sides and the number of roles
Fluffles to roll this one it shows me
that I have a 164 and the toll is 11 and
this another marketplace pick and the
perm is called roll dice 2.0 G version
and its application is free on windows
mobile marketplace thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
