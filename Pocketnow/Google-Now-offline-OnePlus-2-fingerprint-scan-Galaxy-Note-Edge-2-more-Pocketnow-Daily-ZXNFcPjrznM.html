project by some leaks we find and get a
1 + 2 teaser that claims a fingerprint
scanner and rumors claim offline
functionality is coming to Google now
I'm Hina iveta and after a seven hour
drive it is time to hit the news let's
do this right this is pocket out daily
the official news today actually
happened tomorrow as iOS 8 dot 4 should
reach iOS users with compatible devices
and one of the things that's being
included is Apple music remember you get
a three month trial and then after that
you pay ten dollars if you like it's 16
bucks for a family of six which is a
great deal so stay tuned for iOS 8 dot 4
and we will be reporting on what will
happen to iOS 9 beta users other
official news have LG the company has
become famous for its battery technology
since the LG g2 because they figure out
ways to use of all the space for the
battery and now it seems that the
company has announced a new design of a
battery that takes advantage of round
smartwatches and even though we don't
know if other smart watch brands will
make use of this or how many milliamp
hours were able to be fit on this
battery stay tuned as the next battery
for the LG smart watches that come with
Android wear should be quite interesting
else are about same thing we were losing
hope in a Galaxy Note edge for this year
but it seems that project Zen as the
original Galaxy Note was called has
evolved that's now being called Project
02 maybe remember project zero we were
talking about the galaxy s6 so this even
the company is looking for a completely
new rebound to the Galaxy Note lineup
and it could start with the Galaxy Note
edge now we don't know exactly when to
expect this product and the leaks only
talk about battery life a larger battery
but the same size display so there will
be a lot to see Editha hopefully now a
very cool change that seems coming in
that was revealed by dissecting apks
from google is the fact that Google now
will apparently now bring offline
functionality and the way this will work
is obviously if you want to know the
weather it won't be able to tell you but
if you want to turn on Wi-Fi turn on
bluetooth and toggle every other thing
that actually resides in your device you
won't need an internet connection for
this to work this is really cool it
would just be even cooler it become
would figure out a way to store data
from the last time it got connected and
allow you to access that information as
long as it's still relevant let's see if
google brings that to the table soon as
well and probably for the very hot news
of the day even though we're pretty much
one full month away from the launch of
the 1+2 on july 27 the company continues
to tease things and this time we have a
fingerprint scanner and the reference to
security now even though yes fingerprint
scanners do bring reference and security
we have to remember that the api's on
android and bring better functionality
to the fingerprint scanner we're not
saying that it's going to bring Android
M but it does seem that the company is
poison to do something really quick
which is great news but it does lead me
to the question of the day how important
ah is a fingerprint scanner to you will
you pay more for a device just because
of the fingerprint scanner because in my
case I would for me it's just peace of
mind you don't have to worry about
remembering passwords your stuff like
that but leave us a comment down below
what is your case friends you know the
drill if you want to get the news
