compared with Samsung's Galaxy Note 3
let's find out I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is the boost max
versus a samsung galaxy note 3 the
galaxy note 3 is considered by many to
be the king of the extra large
smartphone space competitors have all
tried their hand at making so-called
phablets if you have truly stood a
chance when compared to Samsung's
oversized super phone but practically
everyone to date has tried to beat
Samsung at its own game packing the best
of the best into a slim trim lightweight
package then slapping a premium price
tag on it
ZTE while breaking into the u.s.
smartphone market aims to change that
enter the Boost max on Boost Mobile
we're here to see if the boost Mex is a
worthy phablet contender can the boost
max be to the note 3 with the Moto G is
to the Moto X where does price make all
the difference in the oversized category
let's find out as the boost Max and
Galaxy Note 3 go head-to-head we don't
need to harp on the hardware and design
of these two phones too much the Galaxy
Note 3 like most Samsung devices is made
almost entirely of lightweight plastics
but this particular model was the first
handset with the faux leather backing
and stitching that we've now seen a
takeover Samsung's product line of late
the chrome light plastic trim odd
navigation button configuration in the
s-pen witch tucks into the lower right
corner of the device all come together
to make a top-tier phone the boost max
does a decent job of mimicking that
top-tier look and feel while still being
made mostly of plastic but let's be
clear there's a significant difference
in the level of finish of these two
phones the Galaxy Note 3 feels premium
and rigid the boost max may not be
flimsy but it feels Hollow and it just
doesn't feel as premium as the note its
visibly cheaper though when you factor
in the price ZTE deserves some
commemoration for making a device of
this caliber and selling it for so cheap
an unfortunate side effect of cutting
costs to keep price down however is
visible in the physical footprint of
these devices the note 3 is considerably
smaller in every dimension despite
featuring the same display size it's 8
millimeters shorter 2.1 millimeters
narrower
1.1 millimeter thin
and thirty-three point three grams
lighter and that makes the note three
markedly easier to willed and use the
story grows a little more bleak when we
take a look at the bits and pieces which
come together to make these phones and
if you get down to the nitty gritty the
differences in cost and likewise price
are apparent throughout the galaxy note
3 is widely accepted as having some of
the best specifications on the market a
gorgeous 5.7 inch 1080p Super AMOLED
display 3 gigabytes of RAM 32 or 64
gigabytes of fixed storage and of course
the monster Snapdragon 800 chipset with
the quad-core Krait 400 CPU clocked at
2.3 gigahertz the specs of the boost
mechs are more in line with those of the
Moto G than its phablet counterparts it
only comes with one gigabyte of RAM and
eight gigabytes of fixed storage and
it's fitted with a Snapdragon 400 SOC
the CPU is dual-core and clocked at 1.2
gigahertz the two phones do share the
same battery capacity 3200 million
powers both also come with microsd card
slots but the note 3's camera is rated
at 13 megapixels to the max s8 the back
says no NFC while the note 3 does and
band support limits the max to boost
mobile or Sprint's Network here in the
US while the note 3 is available in
several flavors globally but arguably
the largest difference between these two
handsets are what makes them so large in
the first place the displays little
needs to be said about how vibrant sharp
and gorgeous the 1080p Super AMOLED
panel on the note 3 is it's fantastic
but the 720p LCD on the boost max is a
totally different story
at first glance and at a distance it
doesn't look so bad but upon further
inspection we quickly noticed pixelation
around the edges of icons and text light
bleeding issues narrow viewing angles in
the temperature of the display for what
it's worth the boost max has built
exceptionally well when you consider the
price but after just a few minutes with
it in your hands the amount of
sacrifices made to create this device
are quite clear and it should come as no
surprise that the note 3 has much more
to offer for over double the price on
the software side both shipped with
jelly bean
however the note 3 is running version
4.3 and the Mac ships with 4.1 the
Samsung device of course comes with
TouchWiz meaning is packed to the brim
with both useful and some not so useful
features all of the things you may never
use such as smart scrolls
mark rotate and air gesture are there
for better or worse but features like
multi window and air command for the S
Pen are what truly set the node
experience apart we've said it time and
time again a phone of this size is
understandably more beneficial if it has
the softer support to make use of the
additional real estate
fortunately ZTE has stepped up to the
challenge with Smart View which is very
much like multi window except any
application works within Smart View and
it has a few tricks up his sleeve to
boot such as a window specific mute key
and the ability to toggle orientation
separately for each window outside that
the boost max appears to be running a
mostly stock version of Android the home
screen and application drawer looked
mostly untouched the exceptions are the
custom icons or ZTE specific apps alarm
clock calculator etc the toggles in the
notification shade in the recent apps
menu which is accessed the long pressing
the HOME key
it also features ZTE s lock screen which
we're still not quite fond of the boost
max does come with its fair share of
bloat - like boosts on music store boost
zone and a handful of other
pre-installed apps most of which can
actually be uninstalled
performance is we're buying a $299
smartphone can really make a difference
the Galaxy Note 3 is notorious for
posting stellar numbers and benchmarks
and slicing through just about
everything you can throw at it with
utter ease the Snapdragon 400 found in
the Boost mechs while far from the worst
SOC ever isn't geared towards power
users or heavy gamers while the
Snapdragon 400 manages have power the
boost max through games like asphalt 8
just fine the differences in the level
of performance are visible both inside
and out of synthetic benchmark tests
applications take more time to load on
the boost max and have to fully load
more often due to only having one
gigabyte of RAM whereas the note 3 has
three gigabytes and the more you through
its boost max the more sluggish it gets
however we noticed that this particular
phone is more sluggish than other
Snapdragon 400 powered handsets we've
used and that's quite unfortunate
Samsung's Note 3 of course is still just
as snappy as it was months ago we
haven't quite had the boost max long
enough to fully test its battery
performance but we can say this and our
testing so far it seems to be draining
slower than the Galaxy Note 3 which
would make sense considering they both
come with 3,200 milliamp hour batteries
and the max is only powering a 720p
display with a Snapdragon 400 stay tuned
for a full look at the boost Max's
battery life in the for review we also
can't really compare network performance
since our note 3 is on Verizon and it's
available on all major US carriers while
the max is limited to Boost Mobile this
sort of comparison would vary from
street to street across the US the boost
max has a large grille for its rear
speaker
it's powered by Dolby Digital Plus sound
which you can activate through a
pre-loaded application basically it
works like an equalizer which you can
customize to your liking the Max's rear
speaker provides a fair amount of volume
but the sound is muddy and nothing
terribly amazing the Galaxy Note 3
speakers seem to be comparable in volume
that creates a much sharper sound
finally image sensing this is a slightly
redeeming area for the boost max
in some ways but the quality of its
Imogen Singh doesn't fare well against
the note 3 the pictures taken with a
boost max aren't always bad they're
relatively sharp and the auto mode works
pretty well but some photos err heavily
on the cool side often making them look
nowhere near true to life the note 3
with its 13 megapixel camera is capable
taking sharper images and it's auto-mode
seem to offer more realistic colors more
contrast and a better overall experience
in more situations obviously the galaxy
note 3 is a far superior phone its price
tag field quality specs and the name
brand told all of us that before the
boost max even arrived and even with its
price tag it's a better value than the
boost max simply because the experience
it offers is so much better but that
doesn't mean the boost max is a bad
phone or even a bad deal
it's simply targeting a smaller
demographic those who want a balance
between a smartphone and a tablet and
really don't want to spend a lot of
money at all when you're looking to only
spend $300 on a no-contract smartphone
you have to manage your expectations if
you do you'll see the boost max really
isn't all that bad
it's a far cry from the galaxy note 3
and the like and it isn't quite the note
threes moto G since the performance is
so spotty but for the price it's easily
