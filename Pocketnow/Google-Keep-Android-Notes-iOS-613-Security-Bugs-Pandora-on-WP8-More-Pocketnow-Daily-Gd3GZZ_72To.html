tasks for Android and the web iOS 6.1
point 3 doesn't seem to fix the lock
screen bypass issues and Pandora finally
makes it to Windows Phone 8 I'm hi Mary
ivetta looking at you Joe Belfiore
where's my VPN support for windows phone
8 this is parking out daily
Google key you know there was actually
no way for us to write that down on the
post and not make it sound like if we
wrote it wrong but that's google's new
service for note-taking on Android and
the web it allows you obviously to sync
notes on the web and take photographs on
notes and obviously also get voice notes
and almost everything that Evernote
already does for free but the cool thing
is that on Google keep you'll also be
able to turn these notes into tasks
those of you have ever heard of the
application called awesome note it's
sort of the same functionality obviously
this also brings you a very cool google
like new UI and it's obviously free so
make sure you download it and you know i
do believe that Joe Belfiore was
watching our pocket now daily just a
couple of days ago Pandora for windows
phone 8 was finally released and it's
got a really cool design and even better
it gives you a full year of the premium
service for free make sure you watch
Michael Fisher's full walkthrough on the
service though obviously you are limited
to only 40 hours a month them if you
think of it that's actually not that bad
but obviously Joe Belfiore a when are we
getting our VPN service on Windows Phone
8 just think about it I think even dumb
phones have that service now and we
still can't get that on the corporate
giant smartphone and then let's move on
to iOS for those of you that are still
on the ropes about iOS 6.1 point 3 do
not update it has just been confirmed
that the service does not fix the lock
screen bypass issues that people were
complaining about for it came to
security apparently all it did was
really cancel a jailbreak so if you're
out there to still jailbreak your device
make sure you wait for iOS 6.1 44 to get
out there to actually fix the lock
screen issues and also give you a
jailbreak if the dev team can figure
that one out but also for those of you
that were wondering when Google now will
make it to iOS well Eric Schmidt just
came on record to state that the only
reason it's not there well he wasn't
that specific but he kind of mentioned
that it takes a long time for Apple to
actually approve applications and that's
the reason why it's not there so stay
tuned now let's continue talking about
iOS products usually iPads are launched
by the end of May or early april and
then we've got the iphone that's
recently being launched in the fall at
least for the past two generations but
recent rumors
that Apple will be launching their
iphone 5s and their iPad 5 at jun 29th
and since we still don't know the dates
for WWDC that could make sense though
again these are just rumors and that's
probably just Apple trying to return to
the spotlight after all the Android news
this week and finally for the skeptical
news of the day a lot of people are
worried about Android merging into
Chrome OS after Andy Rubens departure
from Android and well the reason why is
because chrome OS hasn't really taken
off and the current pretty much VP of
Android is the VP of Chrome OS that
operating system that's never taken off
and obviously for those of you that are
worried Eric Schmidt also came on record
the state that this is not happening
Android and Chrome OS are going to be
separate but that leads me to the
question of the day would you like
Android to merge into Chrome OS or the
other way around in my particular case I
would love it for Android to work on
computers I would love it for them to
figure out a way to make it work on
other architectures and have Android
applications and Android services and
the hole mobility of Android comes to
computers in the future and not turn it
into a web browser because chrome OS is
a web browser so leave us a comment down
below what would you prefer and yes as
always for an earlier scoop of
everything that's happening in the
smartphone and South Laurel make sure
