future of the Galaxy S lineup and boy
does it look good Apple is trying to
give us a truly wireless phone but it
seems that user acceptance is in the way
and Instagram TV was just released
yesterday and it's pretty interesting
I'm Jaime meadow Rivera and let us know
in the comments what you would like to
see on Instagram TV we want to do unique
content and our first video is already
live this is PocketNow daily the
official news today begin with non deals
I don't know what's going on with
companies lately but none yesterday or
today Xiaomi me8 has just been confirmed
to be launching in Europe very soon set
your wallets this is actually a very
beautiful phone we saw that whole
approach to the possible translucent
back the people are still debating if
it's real or not most interesting part
is that for those of you that are
looking for that end display fingerprint
scanner that's only on the a gigabyte
variant and apparently that's not gonna
make it to Europe sadly now this one's a
spotlight over to Sony and it's Xperia Z
and X Z 2 as well we've got users
complaining about issues with the
display where they get like bars on the
display and everything and it's just
funny when users started complaining in
forums and everything it seems that Sony
actually responded to them and they
responded something that I find just I
don't know it's hilarious by the way our
Xperia z2 review is coming soon it's
coming this week but I'm not having
these issues and yet Sony says that this
is a feature like Sony really a feature
now let's talk about Instagram as IG TV
is now live and you can choose how to
play with it you can actually have a
separate application only for TV or you
can enable the feature within your
current Instagram account I find that
interesting just how much Instagram has
been able to add to the original just
photo sharing service that I fell in
love with I feel that it's gotten better
but obviously it's been following on a
couple of trends and this one would be
pretty much competing with YouTube only
this is vertical video let me know in
the comments what you think about the
whole idea of vertical video I find that
interesting I just I don't know how
we're gonna format this video in
particular into IG
TV so I'm thinking we should do
something different now let's talk about
Apple and the future of iPhones and also
the past mark Berman is very famous for
his tips and his rumors we hear that the
company was actually working hard on
going fully Wireless with the iPhone 10
no connectors whatsoever and the only
reason why the company didn't do it is
because apparently consumers didn't
really like it it was gonna be a strong
transition killing the headphone jack
and then also killing wires and then
also because wireless charging is not
really as fast as the company would like
even though Samsung figure that out a
while ago for those of you wondering how
long it will take apparently Cupertino
is working hard on doing this for the
near future probably the next couple two
generations and that's the thing
apparently we are getting fast charging
on the box of this next generation
iPhone through USB see two lightning
no not USB see to the phone lightning is
still going to continue but yeah let's
stay tuned as to what the company will
do over time and finally the very
interesting news today and I think I've
used interesting more on this video than
on any other so no need to remind me
that in the comments Galaxy S 10
concepts have just emerged you know that
I rarely cover concepts unless they're
really cool these definitely are we've
heard about the company working on bone
conduction technology and figuring out a
whole approach to I think the
fingerprint scanner is just gonna
continue and probably the company will
just not continue what it's our scanners
currently doing which is not necessarily
the best I'm not sure if the fingerprint
scanner is gonna be at the front of the
back but yeah this is an all display
concept that looks gorgeous I would like
to think or at least in the comments I
would say that it's not really possible
for this to happen as there is a need
for some sort of a bezel at least a
small little chin for the connector of
the OLED display but let us know in the
comments do you think that this is
possible and if it were what would you
think of a galaxy like this because
again I feel the bezels are still
necessary at least a little for the
connector and everything else but leave
us a comment down below we'd love to
know your thoughts
