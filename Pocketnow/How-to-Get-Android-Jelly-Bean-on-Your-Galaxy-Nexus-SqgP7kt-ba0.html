you android 4.1 jelly bean running on
our phones it's been really cool and
you've mentioned that you liked it a lot
but how can you get it on your phone I'm
Joe Levi this is pocket now we're going
to show you how to do that right now so
this is my samsung Galaxy Nexus it's the
GSM variety I'm going to go ahead and
boot this up into my special boot up
mode here you do that by holding both
the up and down buttons on that side and
the power button so we'll press both of
those buttons will press and hold the
power button wait just a minute and
there were you go now I should let you
know this is already unlocked which is
called OEM unlocked this is also pre
rooted okay so make sure you go and do
that now different instructions are
going to apply for the Sprint in the
verizon versions of the phone we're just
going to cover this they're kind of the
same but you can get some more specific
details the GSM one it's easy cheesy so
let's go ahead and do this right now
we're in fastboot mode we're going to
use the down arrow to come down into
recovery mode okay we'll go ahead and do
that and then press the power button
this is going to now reboot you can see
it is unlocked as evidenced by my little
unluck icon down at the bottom it's a
google phone if you didn't already know
that and this is booting me up this is
clockworkmod recovery version 5.8 point
0.25 point just about anything will work
i like this version because it's
touch-enabled i'll show you what i mean
by that first of all what you're going
to want to do is back up your current
ROM that's if you want to be able to go
back to it if you want to be daring go
ahead and skip it I wouldn't well I'm
going to but that's only because i
already have backed it up so we'll skip
that for now you definitely want to do
that the next thing you want to do is
wipe data and factory reset so we're
going to go ahead and do that we are
going to say yes to delete if i can tap
ah yes we're going to wipe and then this
time we're going to say yes instead of
no and it's going to go through and wipe
the data do a format of data format of
cash it's wiping this whole thing out so
we're going to be as stock as we can get
of course with all the modifications
that we've made data wipe is complete
I'm returned back to my menu the next
thing that we want to do is install a
zip from the SD card we'll go ahead and
do that we want to choose a zip and I've
got these in my download folder now when
we did that factory reset it did not
erase this something to keep in mind
otherwise you'd have to push the files
over and it gets painful luckily this
was not erase it wasn't deleted so we're
good to go the first thing that I'm
going to do is flash this it's the cwm
radio for the i 9250 jb go ahead and
flash that that is an updated radio goes
hand in hand with this jelly bean build
just takes a moment and I'm returned
back to my menu it says down here that
the new baseband was flash and the
flasher has completed so go ahead and
choose another zip from my SD card again
this is in downloads and what I'm going
to do here you can see I've got a CM 9r
see one nightly we don't want to do that
one instead we're going to do this this
is the big XE to the jrn 84 d it is
rooted and it has busybox already built
into it it's also deodexed go ahead and
select that one say yes it's going to go
ahead and do this this process takes a
little bit of time not more than a few
minutes but be patient here it might
also be worth mentioning at this point
you want to make sure you've got a good
deal of battery because at this point if
you lose battery you're kind of stuck
you can probably dig yourself out of it
but you don't want to lose battery while
your phone is flashing I'm not going to
make you sit through all of this and
wait I'm going to through the magic of
television let you fast-forward to the
good parts so we're approximately one
minute later and you can see I've been
returned back to my menu I'm done
install from SD card was complete we're
going to go back and then we can reboot
the system once we do that we are
booting up into jelly bean told you that
was easy now how can you tell it's jelly
bean first and foremost you're going to
notice a new boot animation right here
it's not your old weird one it's now
just the very basic X with the glowing
legs the first boot does take some time
so that process took about three minutes
go ahead and start do I have a Google
account and it kind of hints this is a
gmail icon if you use gmail answer yes
go ahead and do that it's going to ask
me for my sign in now I'll go ahead and
do that off-camera for you we've got our
first legal prompt that says by signing
in we're agreeing to the terms of
service of all of those different places
will say oh ki topi setting up can that
take a few minutes now what it's doing
here is that signing in with my
credentials if my credentials are wrong
this is where I'm going to get an error
message coming back and then it's going
to start incorporating some of my
settings over here so it's asking me if
I want to restore from my google account
to this phone and if I want to keep this
phone backed up with my google account
well that's great because I don't want
to have to go through and manually
redownload all of my apps and Riaan put
all of my settings so we're going to
keep those checked and hit the next
button you'll notice that the arrows are
very simple now it doesn't say next and
previous or next and back it's just a
simple arrow going forward and an arrow
going back much more Universal that way
now what we're doing here is we're
restoring some of the settings that was
quick it's going to use my google
location if i tell it to i want it to so
i'll leave those checked and we'll go to
the next screen very user-friendly just
a sec that doesn't say please wait just
a sec it's finished and ready to you so
we'll hit finish and now we've got a
quick tutorial it says okay and we'll
just come through from here you can see
it's already downloading apps we've got
the new settings everything looks great
and we'll go ahead and come down here to
about phone and you'll notice that we
indeed are on 4.1 right there jrn 84
d that's it you've got jelly bean
running on your Galaxy Nexus okay so see
how easy that was now of course we
didn't walk you through the OEM
unlocking we didn't walk you through
rooting or any of that stuff for
flashing on our custom recovery rom but
there are some things that we just can't
do in a video make sure you head over to
pocketnow.com read the article
associated with this video will give you
some very helpful links on how you can
do that and how to get started but if
you've already got an unlocked phone
you've already got clockworkmod or your
other favorite recovery image on there
you're good to go just download the
files that we mentioned in the video now
that's two things that's the jelly bean
ROM and that's the radio as well we'll
have links for those over at the article
at pocketnow.com as well so what did you
think did you like it if so give the
video a big thumbs up if you have
questions or comments head over to
