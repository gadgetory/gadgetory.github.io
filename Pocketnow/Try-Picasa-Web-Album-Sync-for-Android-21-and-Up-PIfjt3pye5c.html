pocket now calm Picasa Web Albums sync
was a feature added to Android 2.1 that
a lot of people probably don't know
about it's a really fantastic tool to
keep your photos synchronized across the
cloud and on your Android phone and
we're going to talk about it now let's
get to it oh you are so the setup for
this is super easy if you go into
settings of your Android 2.1 phone and
you've already added your Google account
so that you can download applications
from the Android Market you have this
item here called sync Picasa Web Albums
and what that means is that using your
google account and logging on to picasa
web you can upload photos and have it
sync with the cloud and in turn sync
with your device also if you're using
Picasa the desktop application which is
free you can do one touch upload of your
pictures to the cloud which makes it a
lot easier you get 1 gigabyte of storage
space to start you can pay a little bit
extra to get up to a terabyte of storage
space if you have a ton of pictures the
way it works is quite simple you don't
even have to do anything that the photos
are synchronized to your gallery so even
if you have multiple folders I only have
one here that I've uploaded to the cloud
through the web interface called test
album and quite simply it keeps the
photos synchronized across the cloud and
your Android phone which is great so
you're not always having to transfer
photos back and forth from your computer
to your phone very useful feature
present in all Android 2.1
and above devices and it's a great way
to to keep synchronized please thumbs up
