pocketnow.com new Microsoft Store new
Microsoft logo they both happened in
Boston this morning you want to see what
that was like the venue Boston's
Prudential Center shopping mall beneath
the iconic Prudential building at nine
this morning the new Microsoft logo was
sheeds in a semi-secret shroud and the
crowd was waiting eagerly if drowsily a
DJ was on hand providing a party-like
atmosphere even as bleary-eyed people's
sipped coffee and after a few
announcements the official countdown
began
the Microsoft employees and their multi
colored shirts look like a spilled bag
of Skittles and that's not a bad thing
that artificial seeming long jolt of
excitement was important because it
carried us forward into the store itself
which was of course a mob scene
customers played kinect based games on
the wraparound video display at the
stores perimeter while on the sales
floor laptops of every brand imaginable
a shared space with interesting
computers like hybrid desktops some
xboxes and tablets running both
old-school windows 7 and demo units
running early builds of the new windows
8 both available to customers to play
with windows phones were represented as
well though they weren't being pushed as
hard as you might expect maybe thanks to
the forthcoming Windows Phone 8 still
the Windows Phone challenge was in full
force and according to the official
microsoft store twitter account and a
handwritten list i spied a glance at
there was at least one non Windows Phone
winner today so Microsoft is still
playing fair finally Microsoft is still
playing up the customer service angle
with this retail store as in the rest of
them with a genius bar like Service Desk
featuring all the customer care you
could ask for it and that kind of
one-on-one customer interaction combined
with a wide array of available products
is the combination Microsoft is going to
be banking on to keep this store
successful and they're off to a great
start there's a lot of smiling employees
here everybody asking if they can help
everybody in a great mood and when I
packed up to leave long after the gift
bag seekers and concert ticket grabbers
had left there was still plenty of
customers interested in seeing what
Microsoft had to offer so at first
glance it looks like this particular
location and maybe Microsoft's retail
chain as a whole has a pretty bright
future
that's going to do it for me everybody
