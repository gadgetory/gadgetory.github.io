while Jaime is tackling the main review
I got to spend a little time taking a
listen to what this phone has to offer
audio files the older one plus three was
a surprisingly solid performer and we're
happy to hear that this refresh is
largely improving on its predecessor to
our ear little has changed in terms of
speaker performance we're kinda at the
limit for what a single bottom firing
speaker can produce and one plus is on
the positive side of that limit
performing better than average for
ringtones and alerts
you'll probably block this speaker wall
gaming but it's plenty fine for a little
casual video consumption what we really
want to dig into is this headphone
performance we see some big steps
forward with one concerning step
sideways first up this is a
better-than-average amp easily
outperforming the galaxy s7 and falling
just behind the HTC 10 you have to climb
up to axon 7 or LG v20 territory to
really get louder the 3t should do a
better than average job of driving
higher impedance headphones we're
talking I phone 7 territory here at a
significantly lower cost looking at the
audio quality we know oneplus has
improved something here the three
t-posts better noise floor and dynamic
range numbers than the original op3
we're always going to be happy with
cleaner output while maintaining true
24-bit playback in this regard the 3t
now easily bests our fee okay one USB
DAC this is a small USB powered audio
device which we use as a baseline for
these comparisons it can improve the
playback on some of our phones but if
you buy the 3t you're not going to need
it so for all this good news why are we
still a little concerned
well the 3t seems to always manipulate
your audio taking a look at the
frequency response graph see how the 1+3
stays flat and the 3t wiggles all around
its artificially boosting some
frequencies over others to enhance what
you hear and we couldn't find a way to
disable this you can also see in our amp
test the phone is all over the place in
terms of signal reproduction what does
this mean for your music honestly the
phone sounds pretty good but man it's
juicy
sometimes delicate mid-range information
can get stomped on to give you that
fuller bass
and highs can sometimes land a bit
brittle most folks are probably going to
like this more aggressive output but
those who prefer a flatter response will
be disappointed
all in all we're looking at good news
the 3t is a better performer it's got
better hardware this is a better DAC at
four hundred and thirty nine dollars its
nipping at the heels of phones that we
consider gold standard performers we're
just hoping oneplus will deliver an
update where we can disable some of
these software shenanigans as always
