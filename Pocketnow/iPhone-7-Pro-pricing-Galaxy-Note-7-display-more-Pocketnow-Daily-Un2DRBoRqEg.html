with the price tag speculation if it
ever happens the galaxy note 7 rumors
claim a larger display and battery in
tow and Google now does as a favor of
providing data for when your Nexus we
just end of life I'm hi Mary vera and
for the price tag of certain technology
end of life should just not be a thing
this is parking out daily the official
news today are rather sad as we've got
official confirmation that Peter Chou is
no longer at HTC he was the CEO that
pretty much fraud HTC from being nothing
to the company that we've respected but
obviously that company went downhill
eventually up to the point where
chairman chair Wang and owner had to
take over he was being sent to a
strategic role but that role apparently
is another company now we will keep you
posted as we learn more because he was a
very innovative genius part of the
company I want a rather interesting turn
of events believe it or not the iOS 10
kernel is unencrypted something never
before seen from Apple which could mean
either one of two things number one it
could be that somebody's losing their
job right now at this moment or two it
could just be that it wasn't an accident
that Apple is deliberately trying to do
this as some sort of a strategy after
the whole FBI San Bernardino and how
easy it was to an encrypted iPhone
paying some other company we will keep
you posted as we learn more a bubble has
just launched an update to its Google
support website for Nexus devices and
within the things that are included is
the end of life date for Nexus devices
those of you wondering exactly how long
you'll be getting security patches
that'll be three years but when it comes
to the versions of Android it's pretty
much just two years up to the point
where if you're currently using a nexus
6 or a nexus 9 it might be time to list
them on ebay as they'll reach end of
life in October of this year you can
learn one of the link of the description
now even though all the rumors that
we've heard for the galaxy note 7 have
to do with the curve display in addition
to specifications today we learned that
the device might grow up a little in
size because apparently it'll sport a
five point eight inch display which
makes a lot of sense of its curved
because curb devices actually feel
smaller in the hand and another changes
that apparently
are getting a 4000 milliamp hour battery
just like in the case of the galaxy s7
active this is a tremendous change true
it may not be a you know a removable
battery but anyways who cares as long as
the battery is huge and it lasts a lot
you'll think about that active as it
takes a while to charge that power pack
fully Samson figure something out in
that department and finally the very
interesting rumors today have to do with
the iphone pro we're still expecting one
iphone to be called pro or something
because you know the smart connectors
are at the back that's apparently going
to be priced at a very steep level
because well according to some huevos
sources it might start at eight hundred
and twenty dollars and go all the way up
to 1350 that is a crazy amount of money
for an iphone especially if it starts at
32 gigs which is the case of the ipad
pro lineup and that would be terrible
given the fact that Apple really needs
to regain its limelight for the iphone
which leads me to the question of today
what do you think about this scheme from
Apple where they're renaming products
into pro raising the price tag but not
really providing crazy great features in
my case I will admit I do love either
iteration of the ipad pro they are my
favorite tablets but i don't think they
want the amount of money they cost and i
think that's going to be the case with
the iphone leave us a comment down below
