wants to give meaning to its slogan in
putting people first with everything
that was announced today reporting live
from New York City this is Adam Lane and
hi Matt Iveta with pocket now and here
is what we saw Microsoft's have been
today had two primary focus points that
had everything to do with enabling
creators starting with the new Windows
10 creators update that we'll see in
spring and in addition new hardware the
new Windows starts with a new focus on
3d the company plans to bring the
technology for everyone with new tools
that allow you to scan an image from
your phone and the legacy Microsoft
Paint application now evolves to paint
3d allowing you to very easily blend the
images you scan in addition to the ones
that you can quickly create or even
download from the community 3d is also
expanding to services like PowerPoint
and if you're thinking that this all has
to do a lot with microsoft hololens yeah
you're getting the point there are other
major evolutions in the realm of
performance for 4k gaming and game
broadcasting and the collaboration that
others can have in your games etc the
company also made a big deal about
having windows help you connect with
friends through shoulder nudges or what
have you but we've seen competitors
strike out at this mainly because of how
distracting it is hopefully it tell us
but anyways the second pillar has
everything to do with being able to help
you create this 3d content and Microsoft
has made a big leap here sadly devices
like the surface pro 4 didn't get an
update here but the surface but got a
major one in its performance base the
new surface book i7 has twice the
graphics capabilities of the old model
which also means three times more than
the 13-inch retina macbook pro there's
an extra fan for cooling which also
meant that the base got Viktor to
accommodate the new thermal envelope but
the most whopping improvement is that
microsoft claims 16 hours of battery
life and yeah i would really love to
test that to believe now even if our
scope is not the desktop the new surface
studio is really the highlight of this
event we're not gonna bore you with
specifications of a 3,000 plus dollar
desktop computer as this is really a
product designed for creators mainly
just a niche but seriously when you
watch the video and when you see this
product for the first time the simple
way you can just easily lay this
gigantic 28 inch screen flat for
drawings is genius just genius but hey
more genius has everything to do with
this new surface style it's compatible
with any service that's older than the
surface pro 3
it'll cost you just $99 and it's
designed to complement creation with the
pen as a dial the way to scroll through
menus and yes even ruler put the sky's
the limit really it all depends on what
developers build for this product
Microsoft has clearly outdone itself in
today's events and the highlight is that
the corporate giant is now wanting to
help you become a creator whether that's
true or not will be defined soon as we
test this products in our future reviews
