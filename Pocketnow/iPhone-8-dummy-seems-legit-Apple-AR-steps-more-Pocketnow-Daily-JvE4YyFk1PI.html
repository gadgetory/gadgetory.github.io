everything you'd like to know about
these leaked cat images we get more
information on the hurdles that Samsung
is facing with Bixby and that will make
some move to reportedly do a R on its
own I'm hiding that leave it on and I
admit defeat I was not supposed to drink
yesterday but that kind of didn't work
this is bogging out daily the official
juice today starts with new developments
as Apple has apparently acquired an eye
tracking company by tracking sensing
companies and Soma toric instruments is
the name of the german firm that apple
has just acquired for an undisclosed
amount of money and for those of you
wondering exactly why Apple want to do
this remember Apple made a big deal
about AR at WWDC this is clearly the
feature that the company wants to push
and it did it a big way with the iPhone
so yeah it seems that this is the next
frontier Apple glass now let's move the
spotlight over to VEVO which is one of
the companies that's co-owned by one of
the parent companies of Oppo that
somehow also has a stake in 1 plus V Bo
is mostly famous in China but we've got
this teaser of the x9 s that shows us an
embedded fingerprint scanner on display
this should be announced over the next
couple of days so sorry Samsung and
Apple another company figured it out
first
and speaking of fingerprint scanners
let's talk about Qualcomm the company
has just seized a couple of things that
are interesting in China starting with a
snapdragon 454 mid ranger to low-end
smartphones this is not dragon aware
1200 but even more interesting is
display fingerprint scanners yes welcome
is also wanting to compete here the only
problem is that OMS will not be able to
see the technology until the fall of
this year so we could start a 2018 full
of this technology and we cannot wait
for those of you wondering exactly when
Bixby is going to extend the beta for
other countries and other languages
apparently that is not going to happen
anytime soon we've got some trusted
sources that claim that Samsung doesn't
even have linguists for any other
language right now they're pretty much
just working with a limited amount of
resources to extend big speed to other
languages and it's not even actually
working on more friendly for now we'll
give you posted as soon as that extends
in which of the probable languages that
it will expand to whenever it actually
works as its supposed to
and finally the very interesting news
that they have to do with another video
a more expensive video that shows us the
iPhone 8 a full dummy it's obviously not
working but it's filmed from every angle
it looks gorgeous I mean if you look at
the craftsmanship of this dummy you
could say that this is the final deal I
still hate the camera humph I love that
pebble design on the borders and
everything I love that display
definitely but you know it's rather
interesting the more they flip the
camera around that thing the kiwanis on
glass finish it looks beautiful but the
question today for you is do you really
think that glass is the way to go for
the future of smartphones like really
should every smartphone in the future go
glass because in my case I hate that
worried that I'll end up breaking that
thing and it happened to me a few times
lately
leave a comment down below with up to
know your opinion friends you know the
way it goes if you want to get to me
