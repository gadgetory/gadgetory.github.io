a lot of fun hanging out with me and her
because of that now we're live we're
live everybody no country for old but
what it's it's got the notification I
don't know I have no idea
I love I love it when I love it when the
live like turns on and we're in the
middle of like a quick thought okay
it's episode 342 of the weekly front
pocket our next date developers recorded
on Friday January 25th 2019 we're back
as you can see in the virtual chat room
not able to feel our respective auras in
the same Airbnb now Brandon you weren't
there it was a smelly one at first yeah
but you know what we are still able to
feel our respective remote tech or I
guess and also we got so many air
fresheners no need for those work yeah
they did not work as Joel says here we
are a family but we're always ready to
talk about more mobile tech I'm Josh
Megara what's going on everybody
and I still got with me from gadget
match I someone who likes her hot
chocolate with bourbon
that is true then defining me by that
instance
so what something we thought yeah Jose
Jose because I posted an Instagram photo
of us at that lantern festival where I
had the hot coffee and hot chocolate
Java and the caption was the cup had hot
chocolate babies well it sees it's it's
Issa said i was i called you by your
history meadow it's ISA Rodriguez
I made a venez back in Honduras
forecasting luncheon as it were no no
are you ok t you chew your tea
something's wrong with your teeth I do
some weird things with my tea ever since
you taught me there we go there there ok
that's a whole different podcast and
over on the east coast is our pal
Brandon minimun we haven't seen you a
little in a little while associate post
CES yeah well I'm glad we got the chance
to hang out today
yeah it's good to see you again alright
so we're all back in our hangouts live
it's not one of our stories but I do
want to say that there's nothing that we
can really say about changes to the
podcast or anything like that but some
of you out there might know and you
might be mentioning in the live chat
that hangouts is going to die soon like
that and also just came out like a day
or two ago hang out yeah but but it's
gonna die at Microsoft time meaning it's
gonna take like seven months for it to
die exactly it's gonna be I think they
said by October yeah it's a painful slow
thousand cut triad or as I would say the
time it takes from a product from
Microsoft to be announced and then for
it to be launched true very true when
Google decides to kill another product
because they've done it so many times
where they cut off millions of people
from using a surface do you think they
have like a dial that they flipped off
and it just they have a dial at 10000
notches on any one person that's using
and Google kills off so many like useful
products like you remember the reader
the RSS feed thing yeah that's a good
one but you know what Google News is not
that bad in its place but an RSS reader
is pretty dope I remember we all used to
use that back in the day feedly I don't
remember some other ones but anyway
we're we're digressing already we
haven't even gotten to the stories yet
all right so this week we have quite a
lot to talk about and also there's a lot
there's a lot of news that's coming out
some leaks everything leading up to
Mobile World Congress just after the
Consumer Electronics Show of 2019 we
have Mobile World Congress 2019 so
there's a lot happening right now and
the leaks are just rolling out right now
we have a story coming out of Italy
saying that the Galaxy S 10 II as it is
called may actually go under 800 euros
while a 5g enabled s 10 plus could hit
1600 euros
now the collective gasp from everybody
yes must breathe the I'm already
breathing I reported on this yesterday
and I was like no like forget it
well this comes out of Italian
publication tutto Android who claims to
have sources stating that there's going
to be an entry-level Galaxy S 10 which
to me is kind of the news here like the
prices and all that stuff I don't know
if I G should cost that much but the
fact that there might be an entry level
of a flagship phones being as empty
level are entry level phones that they
now look I mean in Asia it's always been
a thing because there's really that
market mm-hm who needs that segment
right it's the only thing they can
afford it's it's not the richest market
but now it seems like everyone's going
like flagship a cheaper flagship yeah
well I'm a you are like you said you
reported on this yesterday on the daily
so what were your thoughts on this no
it's just think about it like right now
I'm I wish that would what's happening
right now with iPhones would have
happened with the 10 so that we wouldn't
have had like the whole last year of
crazy price tags mom but I feel that the
iPhone is just proof of concept like
right now there have been deals on iPads
MacBooks and iPhones like crazy for the
past like week or so and so it's that's
just gonna be a trend going forward
people are not crazy enough to pay $1600
for phone and you've got the oneplus
sixty McLaren which costs 700 bucks like
you know a limited edition phone like
seriously why would you pay so much for
a galaxy like what does that galaxy do
that's worth $1,600 well that's the
question like Brendan do you think 5g is
meant to be this expensive no well it's
1,600 euro which is $1,800 and over my
life I've spent the equivalent of a
house on phones and technology but 1800
I can't get there it's just it's too far
off I mean even like I mean what-what
would justify such a price I can't even
imagine $1,800 is the price of like two
laptops and like two great laptops two
great dollars is like three round-trip
tickets oh my god you can see where our
perspective how long do I you know I
don't I just don't think it'll happen I
just don't and and even if it does like
they'll probably launch it at that price
and then discounted
month later because nobody bought the
damn thing yeah exactly
Jules has a good point here as well why
not just get on to 5g in the sort of
mediocre fashion first I kind of like
ease it in and if there's an expansion
to three-year payment plans they even
justify this kind of cause could you
imagine paying this for thirty six whole
months no you'd have to pay like $65 for
that thing a month still doesn't even
what three years right yeah yeah no it
would three years it'd be like close to
fifty okay but it just it doesn't make
any common sense like why would you like
think about it what is the I get that 5g
is gonna be great but it's gonna take
years for that so what's gonna happen in
the interim like it's not they're not
gonna be able to launch 5g right now
like even if you bought the damn phone
where are you gonna use it it's gonna be
an LTE phone for the longest time yeah
in our chat Rick Bearcat it is the
manufacturers trying to desensitize us
over the years well I mean that now that
we're desensitized that's the reason why
we're starting to get all of these
different phones that are coming out in
the same exact range you have the s10
Plus which potentially might have 12
gigabytes of RAM and a whole terabyte of
storage and then you have the the lower
end models which are gonna be called the
entry levels but still have six
gigabytes of RAM and 128 gigabytes of
storage specs that are even eclipsing
the pixel 3xl so you still have these
specifications that are gonna be called
entry level when in reality they're
gonna be at least $800 also these very
expensive phones are the halo devices
that get people to say I'm not gonna get
that one but I'll get the mid-range or
the low-end and it kind of has the
flavor of the higher-end one that is a
very good point Brendon why are you
actually make this point in the previous
podcast it's like what is the purpose of
these flexible phones like nothing more
than a publicity stunt
they'll nobody cared about flex buy
before we saw this thing come out yeah
so it's the only reason why people are
now yeah people are now wondering what
nobody cared
and even at CES people were like oh it's
a flex pay I guess I have to go and
cover that yeah
wasn't really a oh look at that it's a
flexible forward like we need to check
it out it was always a I sort of have to
because it's the first one every single
publication walked by that Royale booth
and they look down and they see this
flexible device and it's not oh crap
that looks dope it was more like damn it
I got yeah I mean we left it last if you
remember I'm like Josh if you have time
to stop by the Flex Bible and you can
record it go for it and if not I totally
get it dude don't that's right Josh it's
like whatever yeah well speaking of
foldable devices we do have one that
might be coming out from not only a
brand that we're all very familiar with
but also from a line that is a throwback
in and of itself motorola is purported
to be reviving the razer brand with a
limited stock foldable phone now this is
coming at the heels of Xiaomi even
Donovan himself like I know Donovan from
from Xiaomi he was showing off the
foldable device that Xiaomi apparently
has in development but Motorola wants to
kind of bring back the Razer brand in
their own way so we can talk about both
of these kind of at the same time so
have you you you guys have obviously
seen the Xiaomi concept right yeah oh
yeah okay so let's start with that one
Xiaomi with this like wing design and
the videos over on Jules's feed right
now I think this I think everyone agrees
this is the way it should work I think
this is dope like the flex pay in
general is a weird fold upon yourself
type thing that feels really weird in
the pocket at least this can have some
semblance of symmetry and if there's
anybody I mean I I like I like Xiaomi
phones generally so I I'm actually
really excited to see this thing in the
flesh I don't know what you thought he
said I it's lucky yes I agree with you
when you say that this looks like a
better execution but the thing is it's
it seems like it's the same material as
the flex body I don't like that I'm very
particular without my phones feel and if
that's the only way exactly yeah
glass don't bend only well thank not
even with me mm-hmm well I guess that at
this point I'm really just not into the
whole idea unless they can figure out
how to make it at least feel a little
bit more premium I just I just I can't I
lose myself this is one of those devices
were the thing it does is the premium
that's the thing though not going for it
not my thing
how about you guys go for Grandma yeah I
was gonna say these foldable phones are
so funny because people don't understand
why and how you're going to use it but
to me it's so obvious a foldable phone
is two devices in one when you want it
to be pocket friendly and one hand
usability and use it as a phone you have
the phone but when you want to show
grandma a picture or you want to read an
article like a book
or you want to you know browse a web
page like you have a full tablet it's
just the ultimate and versatility
two devices in one I could see so many
times when it might be helpful the
Xiaomi demo there the Xiaomi examples a
little bit weird because you know it's
gonna be it's gonna be so thick a lot of
these are gonna be so thick but I can
imagine the future when they're not
thick it's the ultimate two-in-one that
will it'll be amazing you want to know
how often I see grandma never because
like one of those things like I feel as
my opinion is it's a solution in search
of a problem
I like the Xiaomi approach because it
makes the product look like a regular
phone when you flip it from the back
completely yes like that's one of the
main reasons why like if you're still
gonna fold the thing so does it if you
flex it in half a large tablet flexed in
half we'll make this like really wide
smartphone whereas if it's two bends on
each side and you can have a large
tablet and then have like a really slim
smartphone in my opinion mm-hm
yeah that's why technically the real
infinity screen you think about it it
looks like the sideways in a way the
thing is like I I already liked what was
being shown in that video because the
the flick spy
had one very big problem it didn't know
what to do with the Android interface as
you folded it this one it's more obvious
he's holding it in a portrait
orientation Lin bin is he's holding it
in a portrait orientation then turns it
over it goes landscape folded it becomes
portrait again it's obvious what Android
should do
meanwhile the flick spies trying to
segment its big screen into three
different sections that way like
notifications are in the middle if you
fold it and then on the back you could
use it as a selfie cam stuff like that
so like it's it's it's fairly more
obvious with this Xiaomi concept what
Android should do and I think it's I
think it's great a foldable screen will
mean okay Vicky Mehta foldable screen
will be a fingerprint fest oh yeah
the problem is it's made of plastic so
you know you you know the micro
scratches on that thing are gonna be
like really epic after a bit mm-hmm oh
there won't there won't be any phone
cases that's true yeah yeah well so show
me does a really great job especially
with like their me UI and what not to
like so to get the opinions of the fans
and of the people they're actually
asking for ideas on names and names like
the me dual flex or the me mix flex have
been coming out and the may vaporware
yeah let me buy the vape the meet me
meet me port where if I wanted to have a
case easier for the flexible device you
could just get like a ziploc bag and
stick it in there
I would also dress a dress another
potential problem with foldable devices
and that's waterproof think about it
once upon a time what device was that it
was an Apple device that when they
showcase they pulled out of that Brown
[Laughter]
for me I'll be honest with you I don't
really like I feel that that's the
better concept that
from Xiaomi but I I think that the only
phone that I've been I'd be willing to
use that's fled that would be flexible
as that razor so let's talk about that
yeah that would be just I don't know man
anything like that would be just
bragging rights I think or like that's
the one moment where I'm really gonna
geek out be like I could give two craps
of this thing is useful or not it just
looks really cool that looks really cool
I mean I had a v3 I would love to carry
that thing I'm looking at the concept
patent right now it's affair it's like
the most portraitist of portrait
orientation screen here's the thing the
razor phone was my dream phone which I
never got oh you never got one no I
wanted one I was begging my dad I'd she
wouldn't get me one but the phone was
crazy expensive back in the day of you
thinking that then it wasn't like oh
it's powerful phone back then there was
the be at 635 which had expandable
storage and stuff like that so is it was
really it was a really hard sell because
it was an underpowered phone with a
crappy camera back in the day more
importantly heimer there was an orange
one and there was a pink one Oh God the
wrong people we like to that slate black
and no oh yeah and then we made the
slate black was great and then they came
up with that the B third the v3 I have
you guys remember that one had
expandable storage and it came out of
this like really crazy purple that was
really nice oh those were the glory
motorola days the problem is just like
back in the day Jules is pointing out
right now just like back in the day and
now that thing back then was crazy
expensive right now the rumours are
fifteen hundred dollars which which I'm
never getting my Reiser
it better have twelve gigabytes of RAM
and one terabyte of storage I'm telling
you right now that camera would have to
be crazy insane I won't for me to care
about it that's that's the problem
that's where I'm like god I'm so glad
I'm
phone review right now multiple devices
are just gonna have that premium because
of the fact that we fold which is gonna
be crazy
like and it's interesting because we
have all of these different trends that
are sort of appearing at the beginning
of this year and here's a new one coming
out of China from two particular
companies we're talking about first
Amazo zero what is happening remember
when I asked you when this is a weird
phrase by the way perfection cannot have
openings no I was telling you this
morning that sounded weirdly sexual I
think it's because like it's translated
from whatever the Chinese phrase was but
I actually was looking at their live
stream when they launched this and I was
like I remember showing you and I was
like what is going on they said they're
launching a phone but everything's a
Chinese I don't understand but it was is
there some weird Jolla strand in China
because we're seeing two phones in in a
week coming out from China they'll be
the greatest thing if this was a whole
lot less phone and it still was an IP
sort of I feel like this would be an
important trend oh wait that's a throne
before you fully transition to that we
didn't hear what Brandon things about
that razor oh I'm sorry oh yeah oh I
love the the flip phone form factor and
there hasn't been a good one well you
have that Samsung flip phone don't you
are the galaxy folder yeah
oh it's garbage I mean it's got like
last generation software and hardware
and it's it's basically useless I want
to try wait is that the one they gave to
Jackie Chan do you guys remember that
story wait is that what is the folder
that expensive yeah the super expensive
all right
that's cool I want to try that one I'll
send it to you Joshua just remind me
that's a great yeah I have a phone that
Jackie Chan has but what I like it what
I like about the razor is apparently it
has the external display as well so you
can still get at leas notifications and
then you can you know open it and use it
for
as a phone I just the the reason why I
don't agree that foldable smartphone
should be more expensive as if you think
about it appeal that technology exists
has existed for a while like these
screens have been able to flex for a
while so why is it that just because
you're now giving me a display with
plastic because you want to flex it and
it's cut in half and you've got the
battery separate well are you gonna
charge me more for that it's not like
the product hasn't been able to flex for
a while
that's that like I said it's it's just
because it's a feature like something
can bend you you spend more on it yeah
true I recognize that my iPad pro is
expensive but you know will it been can
you imagine all those youtubers who are
going to get these bendable phone did
you like will it Bend 60 second video
it's not gonna be funny anymore
but I I have reaiiy have one question
about this and this has been so if they
come up with the razor phone I'm sure
that they legally own that name but this
has been like in my head confusing
through razor
especially now that there's a razor
phone I know the one letter off but like
it's what happens old arrays yeah and
the razor name the the razor of III was
like what a decade prior Chen razor no
not a decade but it was far away yeah so
you know the fact that razor made their
you know their brand around gaming and
they started with the mice and
everything that's you know that's their
thing you know they I don't think they
made the company back then with the idea
of making a phone they just drifted to
it because that's where technology's
going yeah
and do you okay so before we get too far
into this let's get back into the meters
so let's say well it is literally called
a proof of concept so it's completely
made of ceramic which is something that
we see from like Xiaomi and well meizu
has done it quite a few times in the
past as well but basically there's you
know there's no holes or no ports
there's no nothing
and so it's wirelessly charged with the
snapdragon a 45 dual cameras that
wireless charging is 18 watt so you know
there's probably not gonna even be any
fast charging involved in this one
and then also you know just just to add
it in we have sort of like dual stories
coming in the same topic vivo did the
same thing as well with the apex 2019 so
they have a fingerprint sensor that's
covering the entire display a magnetic
port which to me makes a lot more sense
like a magnetic port for data and power
transfer and then a Snapdragon 855 which
potentially will have the 5g so it does
have file transfer yes there was one
phone again we were talking my vaporware
earlier there was one phone that did try
that concept and that was the Turing the
original Turing they are yep so they
said like there are no ports but there's
this magnetic connector over on the side
that just snaps right on and you can use
that for data transfer and for well dr.
waterproof the magnetic that toy should
be I mean meizu is no stranger to weird
things you had that that podcast you did
while driving with Jaime and I sleepy at
the back you were talking about a phone
I was trying not to call out oh yeah you
were talking about the phone with a tiny
screen on the back that was amazing
phone oh that was yeah that was amazing
phone so that was a pretty cool one but
it never really took off because me
series of Chinese like mainly mainly
focus on in China in the Chinese market
but I mean I have no feelings about this
phone except like why why was there a
need to create the whole s phone well
okay that's nice Brendon real quick like
Brendon you pick up a phone it's kind of
full screen maybe a hole punch let's say
it maybe it has that but it's for the
most part all screen no holes no nothing
it's literally just you're holding a
screen in your hand on eboshit that says
them
that sounds really fantastic and as long
as it doesn't compromise usability like
for example you would think that you
would need a power button to turn the
phone on but no tapped awake is really
good or even lift awake if you remember
when Android made the change from
physical buttons to on-screen buttons it
assured in a whole
form factor of devices and it was so
futuristic because you didn't need that
stupid search back and home-button it
was all on screen and that was a really
big deal so we have the technology now
to not need any holes or ports and it's
gonna make for a super clean super slick
device what do you think I'm a aside
from the delays that I'm having in my
feed like I hate my internet right now
I'll get it fixed but anyways I don't
know man it has written a lot of things
but then again I I sometimes miss the
tactility of buttons so I it's just the
way things have to go the last moving
parts the better but that's not I don't
necessarily feel that it got better over
time that's just me I wanted to check on
the live chat loose a real quick
do-do-do-do-do so like wireless charging
though like if it's it it's going to if
we're going to dive so deep into
wireless charging have you bendin in
particular have you have you come to
rely upon quick fast or warp or whatever
you want to call it charging um for me
it's good to have the convenience to be
able to top up quickly with a fast
charger and Americans but but honestly
like every day at night I plug in my
phone and when I wake up its full and
when I go to bed it's it like twenty
thirty percent so charging doesn't
matter that much to me except the added
convenience if you're going out at night
to be able to pop it on the work charger
and get like thirty percent really fast
someone named Goku okay says in the
comment section how to charge my phone
out wait no that wasn't the one how do i
play my game and charge my phone at the
same time on the wireless mantle is bad
i guess for me because i'm not so much a
fan of wireless charging yet i haven't
gotten to the point where it's something
that feels natural to me and it annoys
me too
because i what I charge my phone while
on the go a lot
I always have power banks you know this
user and with a wireless power bank has
always been problematic to me because
you can be on your phone and I like
being on my phone as it
like while I'm in a car while I'm on in
the mall or whatever if it's a it's if
it's a cord it's fine I charge but
because I get this all what LS power
bank like the contactee is a movie and
it's like what yeah cuz if it's on the
wireless charging you kind of like tip
it just a little bit on the sudden
that's not drunk yeah and it's not that
like I've been and I've seriously
decided to go full wireless charging for
the past week or so
I can give you so many cases where I
wake up in the morning and my iPhone is
not charged mom because the phone
vibrated it moved from the pad and so
it's not charging anything
Wow and so it's like the stupid oh my
god it's so annoying it's like so like
right now I have the iPhone charging
here on the side because it didn't
charge last night you know just like I
feel that the wireless charging doesn't
just need the component to be able to
charge but also needs to be magnetic in
order to ensure that it snaps fully into
the product or just get a wireless
charging pad that has some grip on it on
the time it's also it's also um I've
fallen in love with fast charging lately
um I've been on the Oppo Lambo which is
like zero to 100% in 35 minutes
I can literally yeah and I said this is
the last podcast right but makeup on and
the battery would be full and if
something is that fast and reliable
I don't there's I have no problem being
tied down yeah it's just like Jill said
oppa made a Lambo yeah find X yeah the
find X which I keep watch I keep con the
fine ten it's it's on this it's in the
same vein as the the oneplus McLaren
which has the same it's a it's the same
thing has the warp charger yeah I'm
using a clarin right now yeah and I am
as well okay so we have one more story
before we get to our little break all
right
Jaime I'm gonna I'm gonna use you to
kind of segment into this a little bit
what do that right how-how-how into
nokia are you right now
like that you're enjoying everything
nokia is putting out and it looks like
Nokia's gonna do more yeah so I did that
7.1 review it's so the funny part is I
brought the phone but then obviously
checked over and crazy November in stuff
like that and so I left it the Sam Sam
that our Spanish video and then I'm like
are you done with the 7.1 yes sir and so
I had not noticed that I had already
updated to PI I had not noticed that the
interface is literally a pixel it is a
Google pixel 3 Excel in absolutely
everything but the fact that you can
switch out the pixel pill and switch it
to buttons if you want and so oh my god
like if it weren't and the camera during
the day is good camera during the night
is terrible it's just wow I I'm really
impressed I had no idea these phones
were so good I was so surprised how
happy you were about that phone I so was
it was like so you're at so I actually
wrote the script down and I was
expecting the camera to actually be
worse than it was but I sent the script
over to Brandon for him to help me
condense it and so it turns out that I
would have to take more photos and then
when I pull them into the computer I'm
like I'm gonna have to change the script
this camera is actually not bad like
what do I have to bash on this phone I
have nothing there's nothing wrong with
it mm-hmm like if anything just slow
light photography which is expected not
because of the it's just I hate it when
when entry-level phones are like yeah f
1.8 aperture that's all great but if
you're if you're DSP is your it sorry if
your image signal processor is terrible
it doesn't matter what aperture your cat
your camera has the photos will not
perform period and you know and so
that's the biggest problem with
entry-level smartphones that's the
reason why the proko phone takes such
great photos because it has the isp from
the 845 mm that's true and isn't the the
poco just went global recently right
just yet another thing that uh that
they're doing look you didn't see that
sweet he had wasn't it was not if it
wasn't but anyway they had like you know
polka phones going global and to
celebrate we're giving away like
hundreds of me band threes Oh
anyway why can I get a me van three
dammit I wanna try good me van three I
want to try to be bantering have I
literally been the only person in this
chat that's been using the me but yeah
okay well we'll try to fix that yeah
anyway back to Nokia um so apparently
Nokia is going to be bringing more
mid-range maybe lower low respect
smartphones to Cricket Wireless which is
to be expected this one in particular is
the Nokia 3.1 plus a six inch HD plus
displayed not full HD HD Plus display a
Snapdragon 439 which I didn't even know
existed two gigabytes of RAM and 32
gigabytes of storage
it's a $159 I mean Nokia is finding its
way back onto its finding its way back
stateside and the reports are saying
that the reason why this is happening or
rather one of the reasons why this might
be happening as you guys know kia saw
such great reviews and sales of the
seven as it's it's it's it's worth the
money man and that I mean of nokia nokia
started that push if you guys remember
what they made the whole partnership
with Foxconn hmd with Foxconn like they
started initially in China and the entry
to mid-level market and I mean you guys
remember in that podcast that we were
doing with Nicole where she was like
this company I sold so many phones like
I forget what the number was but the
number was just crazy they're selling a
ton more phones than most companies out
there and so if the entry to mid-level
range just what's gonna get Nokia to
show as a flagship soon which I'm I hope
that's gonna happen I'm all for it man
companies that this is just the way to
go like even if even if they need these
like Vanguard crazy awesome spec phones
to help for bragging rights and
everything it doesn't really matter the
the ones that sell the most are the mid
rangers
well I'm Jose Jose Jules just said where
is he what Danny's in the chat Danny's
upset because he never got the Nokia 7.1
you just owe me you just owe me a Super
Nintendo classic in a Nintendo classic
we could totally
but boom thank you it's funny I actually
have the SNES classic I gave it to my
brother because he was such a fan of
Mario RPG and I told them while you're
trading while you're day trading play it
again he has even opened it yet but
Danny shouts out to you men and to
everybody in our chat thank you for
being in the conversation with us we are
actually at the end of our this new
segment so I think what I'll do is we'll
go ahead and get a little bit of a break
and then we'll check in with ie hold on
my bad there's one more thing we got to
talk about all right who's ready for the
craziest phone case of all time I love
this oh my god
all right this is like this is the jewel
set it's like a week they actually need
a segment like that in yeah we're scared
to sever so this is a crowd this is a
crowd-funded product called the spoon
fork have they already gotten more than
12 backers because I assume that's all
they have in their payroll anyway poor
woman happy you came and she's like why
am I doing this how much like I'm only
getting I'm only getting paid $15 for
this it's humiliating I'm a model so
it's basically it's it's a phone it's a
phone case as an iPhone case the dad
basically has in it a freaking spoon and
then it's missing a straw yeah so to
anybody watching the the feed right now
we're gonna get into our break what I
want you to we want you to caption that
gif that you're seeing right now and
we'll say what it is and after the break
so let's go ahead and jump into our
break rate alright
the pocket not weekly is brought to you
with support of caseta by Lutron today I
want to talk to you about casita by
Lutron brought to you by Lutron pioneers
and smart home lighting with casita you
can schedule your lights to come on at
dusk so your family always comes back to
a well at home and you can tell Google
assistant alexa or siri to turn the
lights on or off bright or dim or
anywhere in between these are dimmer
switch
we're talking about after all coming
from Lutron the company with over 60
years of experience with illumination
and you can integrate them into your
smart home routine by connecting them to
your sono sound bar your nest camera and
thermostat and plenty of other devices
and you don't even have to physically
press the switches Jules our podcast
producer extraordinaire has been telling
his assistant to turn the lights on and
off as he moves from room to room
throughout his evening eating dinner
watching TV and then going to bed it's
effortless it's smart lighting the smart
way you can get it to search CAS CTA or
head to Lutron comm to learn more casita
by Lutron welcome home to peace of mind
alright I wanted to be sure we went we
got through that break as much as
quickly as possible cuz Brandon as usual
has to get out of here in a number of
minutes so I've got a sorry for the
earliest but I've got a childcare issues
I was not that big of an issue really no
it's okay one of the kids is sick and I
have to pick up the other one you know
how it is oh yeah we we we don't yeah
where are the kids
[Laughter]
so I wanted to get two things from you
because we have a we have a number of
stories that are coming out of Mobile
World Congress before we look forward to
Barcelona Brandon so sure it's your
first podcast back we've had two cents
well we had two wandering in one since
CES how did you feel about the way CES
went um you know as usual I kind of wish
there was more phone news but that is
shifted to Mobile World Congress and
individual phone launches but back in
the day there were you know more
interesting things made to phones not
just plastic foldable devices that have
you know have no merit Oh US carrier
just tone down that I remember in the
past you would want to go to the Verizon
booth to see what phones they had you
know yeah something something to do
right yeah but now like US carriers I
don't even see them the US carrier
booths let's see yeah like at all I mean
it was it's such a general tech show at
this point that I even did an ad spot
without an insurance
company that's how general it is I love
this es because there was so much beauty
which I'm understand isn't something
that interests you guys are Josh who
left me at the event but you know but
that's a good point like a lot of things
have shifted from CES like it's it's
literally the TV show now though the car
show the and you know that's for me I
you know just go go to it as a geek and
stop looking for phones it's not the
show yeah and yeah you can totally move
away from that gif of somebody doing any
good captions you get a look at that one
and while I was branded real quick what
was your watching from afar one
highlight from CES and then we'll get
into some quick MWC talk before you
sorry I was gonna um after this comment
I'm just gonna drop off um my favorite
tech from CES would be 8k which is it's
so funny because for case not even
established yet and but like the the TV
manufacturers need a reason to increase
dica monetize their TVs and increased
prices and 8k is like the thing I just
want to I just want to see a 16 K TV
which maybe next year over all right
well we'll pay we will pay special
attention to whatever phone you say you
want to see the most at MWC pick one
real quick
let's go LG g8 I want to see what
gimmick LG has this year to make to make
it you know I think we should I think we
should start with that one yeah so okay
so Jules is already scrolling through
the leak that that broke from XD a about
the LG G 8
I'm dropping off guys peace on earth
yeah see you later Brandon thank you
thank you yeah there you go so that yeah
the think you branding of the ton she is
gonna be staying the same but we really
have a leak now of the LG G 8 we might
also be the only couple who get that
joke when like someone says thank you
the other
automatically goes nobody at least at
least we were in the dinner where
somebody actually explained to us would
think you meant if you remember I had no
idea like I had no idea that the whole
idea was think you like you uh you know
I would have never thought like I think
it got lost at something that's cheeky
that made sense in the cultural Korean
context because like LG is Korean
but like eventually got lost as it like
snowball into normal mainstream indeed
yeah Jose do me a favor put that link of
what you're looking at right now in the
chat cuz I don't have that tab up
because I want to bring this up the the
LGG eight is is is here like this is
this is literally the leak and okay I
have to give some quick like beginning
like be like like like preliminary
reactions to this like I have always
been a fan of LG they pioneered the
white angle on a smartphone not like
really like LG is gonna be behind the
times once again on their flagship
smartphone cuz like yeah this thing's
we're just gonna be like what do you
mean they always are of course why okay
well I mean again yeah that's what I
mean like they're gonna be once again
behind the times a little bit and like
Brandon was saying there's going to be
some sort of gimmick on this phone that
somehow differentiates it but then
they're also gonna be moving five steps
back because they have something like a
notch when pull punches are supposed to
be the 2019 trend so I'm already kind of
disappointed to be honest like I need
obviously I need to use the phone to see
what it will be like but just these
leaks already make me a little
disappointed because it looks like last
year's phone yeah so I don't know any
any quick reactions from you like I
think that the last LG phone that I
really liked was the beef 30 to a
certain degree the g6 were phones that I
really liked but then you know if you
remember devices like the g4 were like
really innovative when it came to there
camera technology like I remember
comparing the g4 to anything it was
great and then now you grab the g7 and
it looks just like the g4 meaning they
kind of need to work on catching up with
everybody else like they can't continue
playing that game where they continue
using smaller microns and do everything
based on software I think LG was the
first company to to innovate camera
technology with software but they like
they're like four years late now like
they really need to catch up and it's
not just a wide angle like the gun I
remember I remember there was this time
when hua was like yeah no that's the
best phone it's the best fun and smells
like all right fine
so I'll go with my bead 20 of the
Vatican 2 you know film everything my
vlog from the Vatican and then when I
saw the video like it my computer is
like what yeah they they doctored the
video so much and it used to be it used
to be something that looked good at the
time until finally manufacturers figured
out how to make detailed video yeah that
going too crazy on it so LG needs to
sort of go back to the drawing board a
little bit and if they're going like
honestly like the company is that
partner up with large camera companies
tend to be the ones who make really good
footage and photos so LG could do that
you know I know Zeiss is taken out
freaking like us taken out maybe they
could Olympus Panasonic might as well
but the other thing too we have another
announcement potentially from LG that
it's may be less of an LG announcement
more of like a sprint announcement
because 5g is gonna be coming to an LG
phone but it's probably gonna be on the
Sprint network so we're getting a larger
vapor chamber imagine that the LG vapor
this is so weird because in tech right
now you want to stay away from the word
vapor
I mean from someone who does a lot of
lifestyle tech this is just like what is
a vapor why would you want to keep it
cool I mean right now hangouts has my
computer about to take off
I completely get it it's just I why are
we calling vapor changers chambers a
feature is the thing you know well okay
so here Jules has to this quote year
algae found in a survey of 1,000 US and
Korean correspond or respondents rather
74% have expressed a desire for 5g
surface I think that everyone wants 5g
but no one quite understands what it is
they just want faster that's what you
mean
so yes Sprint has announced its first in
the country carry carrier agreements to
have the LG 5g phone this may be it
mm-hmm so who knows the fate of the
vapor chamber the vapor chamber because
it's gonna get finally that we have this
amazing feature yeah it's a cooling
system you won't be able to see like I'm
like whatever like like if there's one
thing LG does not get as marketing I I
have proven that like thank you like
using somebody in a subway to the
feature off Jordan which was it you know
Joseph Gordon like he was let's have
somebody play music in the subway and
that's gonna be our ad campaign like
yeah sure I mean it already has me sorry
about the LG whatever thing whatever you
you know and so now let's talk about a
vapor chamber my god Jules I have no
idea that I didn't know I'll be plaza to
something with yrg well look at that up
later but yeah you didn't see those
advertisements on Joseph gordon-levitt
would use the V 30 or the B 30 30 he
would use the V 30 in a subway it mean
the one thing that that commercial did
right was on the very bottom corner it
said hold this entire commercial filmed
on the LGV 30 that was that was a good
thing but then it was just a silly
commercial of people playing instruments
with with like how many snap-on's and
like special lenses and probably product
and whatever because my god you take
that be 30 and low light and that's
trash yeah it was bad and then there's
something like low light when it comes
to
recording on a smartphone is always
gonna be like subpar but that was
something else you're looking it up
right now
hey I just scan through it it's not the
best ad if it it has 23,000 views well
that's on YouTube this was this was
actually a TV spot Oh
but anyway LG probably going to be
taking quite a bit of the news beat when
it comes to Mobile World Congress but
that's not to overshadow the many
different companies that are gonna be
coming up at Mobile World Congress after
all Sony uses MWC as one of its
mainstays for announcing the next xperia
smartphone now what we have here's last
year yeah not years before oddly it's
just Sony the year before they use CES
for some weird reason yeah they did yeah
but they always have the same it's
always the same thing like kind of
peeking behind the veil a little bit as
being tech journalists or tech tech
creators and whatnot
they never have an actual press
conference in a place their press
conference is always at their booth yeah
so which i think is so funny we just
sort of pile in which in Berlin is the
worst have you ever tried to get into
those press conferences in Berlin like
you can't even walk in so the other day
their PR was like are you gonna join us
for the Berlin press conference I'm like
are you will you be able to walk in
along with not even gonna waste my time
you guys got a free recall join but not
I'm not gonna go crazy in there forget
it you know I don't think I've ever been
in a pre briefing for Sony like I just
don't know who they do it with you know
I have oh yeah but it's something new
it's because they change their PR agency
and so now they're like oh we're doing
pre routes I'm like Oh finally oh
alright well what we have potentially at
MWC is going to be the sony xperia xz4
okay according to just benchmarking now
this is this is not a surprise because
experience tend to have the highest
possible specifications and like I say
on multiple occasions Sony is the only
company that takes something like the
newest Snapdragon processor and says
turn everything on nothing turn
everything on we're going to have they
were the first ones with the super
slow-mo recording they
first ones with 3ds and those are all
processors those are all processor level
activities and they're the only company
that tends to turn everything on so I
call Sony experience like the proof of
concept and of the year but yeah
apparently this one uh leaks and rumors
will state that it will probably have a
really tall display that will take over
a lot of the front of the phone so maybe
we're not going to get the huge bezels
anymore like so I'm just tend to have oh
there might be the triple camera setup
obviously killer specifications with a
Snapdragon 820 five six and eight
gigabytes of RAM 256 gigabytes of
on-board storage invites have been going
out for a February 25th events I'm
guessing hi may you did get one for
Pocket now right yep okay
and yeah clearly it's going to be a big
part of Mobile World Congress so how do
you do you mess with xperia phones are
very often I did features you know me
and I like the cutesy stuff so the last
phone they exist was it X III or éxito I
can't remember I did um 3d or a feature
on 3b 3d scanning face scary face candy
I mean it was fun it's just that it's
not as easy as they purport it to be
like literally it was an afternoon of me
and chai just trying to get one scan
right and you know it look it looked
weird and either look weird or really
really cool so okay fair enough
what was the less experienced out weird
for you do you remember are the eggs e3
last week does this week yeah last no
dude I mean I had it since October I
just you know we're all in that boat
like I'm finally over at GV I'm finally
doing the one plus 60 and the one plus
seven is like weeks out apparently like
like people are just sort of speculating
that's gonna be very soon anyway so we
have the sony xperia
the then we did talk about xiaomi a
little bit earlier and yes they are
doing media briefings at MWC or prior to
it so obviously
gotta get in contact with whoever you
know that me mix three is in is in my
hands at least I have me mix three that
I'm having fun with right now yeah he's
been he's been but he call that he's
been flipping the screen at everyone
like like literally at everyone he
wouldn't a sound effect that like so
every time he flips it it sounds like
some swords are being drawn and he's
been flipping at that people's faces he
slipped that in my face of his mom stay
funny the first like five times
yeah like a million anything when
somebody's mugging you alright oh yeah
exactly make it make it make it gunshots
I don't know if they have in any way
better Nick's three which is gonna be I
don't remember that you Parker now as a
unit right hmm the park cannot have a
unit of the mimics three you have it but
this was no this was this was this is a
JV unit technically there were supposed
to give you are you never remember I
couldn't go to that Shanghai trip oh
well they only gave me one so I don't
know what happened there but in any case
like okay so potentially I'll do a dual
review but anyway the mimics thirty
potentially over at MWC there might be a
5g version of this bad boy and I have to
say I'm glad that there are certain
there are certain phones that you are
glad you don't review right away this is
one of them because that did not happen
until two weeks ago the global ROM
finally went out and me you I localized
for stateside it's actually really nice
what's the what are the changes aside
from the sound effect because that sound
effect like the whole you need
they know we've had from the other I
didn't I don't like me why I got it's
it's really smooth like I can see why
people may not like it but I have to say
it's it's really smooth it's it's
looking quite nice and honestly like
they're certain I'm not gonna say it's
on the level of an oxygen OS but I get
that sort of feeling of smoothness from
it and
and I know it's I don't like it visually
it's too cartoony for me but then again
I can see that my my last my last the
chamois phone was the me mixed to us mmm
which wasn't the worst like that was a
pretty good that's pretty great phone
also and again like we were saying
before Xiaomi one of the only phone
manufacturers that actively use a
ceramic so you have ceramic right here
but anyway no rhythm this neumann in the
next week makes this this particular
mimics is probably the first mimics that
I'm actually interested in because I've
always had a problem with the camera
being at the bottom oh yeah we have
we've had before like flip the phone
around I'm like right there's one
problem with this though when when it's
when it's open like that
I can't clip the lens up here it just
won't fit so no more wide-angle front
for me yes but I mean it's a small price
to pay for that for for this you are
what you're part of the 0.1% who use the
we use clip on line oh yeah alright so
going from xiaomi to yet another company
that you know these companies are ones
that we didn't really see too often at
MWC would they would all they what they
would be they would have a presence at
the show but they wouldn't have like a
booth yeah yet another one oppa oppa was
going to be it's not even up MWC true
but they're gonna be there
yeah I'm sure they're gonna want to
showcase it on the floor well they're
they're teasing something zoom really do
you remember that periscope camera a
module but they showed off two years ago
yeah so remember you were talking about
Microsoft slow death this is and and how
they they actually release stuff like
this was what two years in the making I
remember asking Opel everything they
launched like what happened to your 10
times zoom though but I don't I don't
blame them like the technology if you
think about it we we barely get to see
motorized selfie cameras on
phones up until last year and you know I
guess they needed to prove that they
could mass-produce the that motorized
system no so I I don't blame him like
nobody it's not like if anybody caught
up and did it first in them I see I feel
that it's a it's a cool idea I would
rather use the same lens with the same
aperture and just zoom in and out you
know use the mechanical portion of it
then the other way around but we'll see
mm-hmm yeah I mean it kind of makes
sense that a ten times optical zoom
would be called the find oh good my mind
yeah okay so Opel might already be using
a smart phone with this new technology
but their car no show off a they're
potentially gonna show off a working
prototype with later availability at MWC
I feel like so that that was at MWC two
years ago or was that MWC three years
ago that was a I remember cuz it was the
time like their booth was like - like a
block away from the Nokia booth and it's
when Nokia did that official launch of
the retro phones I remember yeah this
was my first-ever MWC I mean I wasn't
there but the first MWC I covered and
there was a tiny um prototype like there
was a there were buildings and stuff
tiny little building France he tested
the zoom on yeah they showed off a lot
of stuff like I was there for a bit I
actually went twice to their booth but
the thing about it is the phone was
really thick like the device literally
reminded me of the razor phone so you
know Oppo like Oppo you know they don't
do phones that thick so obviously I
think that they've been refining ever
since okay all right so one of our last
stories for us that another big hitter I
mean we're gonna see something come out
of hallways camp and lord knows they
have had a crazy year so maybe they're
gonna pull out all the stops for MWC I
remember oh no always remember the p10
launch that was the crazy launch they
brought out a that was when influencers
were just becoming a thing so they
brought out so many Instagram /youtube
people who
nothing to do with tech had they talked
about matcha for so long the Pantone
color in such yeah this was also my
first coverage I remember mm-hmm um
sitting at HQ watching this and I'm like
what is going on says remember this was
my first major tech coverage and I'm
just like what are they talking about
the color green for so long like what is
a p10 what is it they had they did they
literally spent the entire press
conference we're trying to convince us
that green is a good color you know like
I really I remember that PETA and I
missed that fun I was such a and I just
love that experience of like being like
damn like we didn't go to the press
conference and it was out of choice like
because the previous two always press
conferences can get in there and then we
learned that they were giving out the
Huawei watch too and the p10 at the
event that I'm like damn it and so I
walk into their booth and they were like
yeah we realize you didn't join but
we've got your products feared oh my god
that's so nice that by the way a tiny
anecdote I'm not gonna go into any
details that p10 launch was when I met
Lexy Panterra so sexy and well I'm gonna
let our audience Google you're welcome
yeah she's dope she was really friendly
too and I think you have that's the me
book 13 in your hands isn't this is a
review that's coming out next week um
rather interesting mm-hmm but ya know I
throw such a good computer it's like can
you believe can you believe that Sam's
been editing everything in Spanish like
I gave him like I gave him my old
MacBook Pro and then the make buckets
Pro he's not using an e GPU and that
thing still flies man like like he's
like no I don't need that i I probably
will leave it like it's like yeah it's a
seven minute render versus for like I
won't die in those three but it's it's
fine you know
mmm yeah the chroma key full everything
yeah the the maple gex Pro a great for
for editing I'm super happy with it you
know that's for
this is this and that may book their
team my foray into actual computing so
it's great to be able to branch out a
little bit
anyway we totally got off track here
Huawei app it potentially will come to
MWC with their own foldable device
apparently so I'm not surprised lollie
has everything he's just gonna be like
I'm gonna do that to ya a 5g foldable
smartphone will make its debut he said
that while on stage announcing always
belong 5000 chipset yeah and you know
what like hey we maybe they've been
working so hard to make their devices as
sleek as possible because this one's not
gonna be bulky Valda one but yeah 5g
enabled with their own chipset which is
obviously the alternative to everything
that we've heard from Qualcomm and
Qualcomm is like the are you ready for
5g it's coming company so I mean it's
it's amazing how Huawei seems to be
unfazed just churning all these new and
different things despite all the stuff
that's that they've been going over yeah
like there was just an article on was it
time about how and well like the
significance of that Huawei executive
being arrested the and apparently in
China they call her a princess because
this is literally the daughter of the
Huawei owner who's about to succeed the
whole like when that person like passes
or something no the thing about it is
it's just political stuff I yeah it's
it's not even worth wasting time on that
because it's just it hey once you dig
that rabbit hole it's like extremely
complicated in there if you think about
it I find it funny how they're making so
much publicity over the adoption of 5g
when we've been using 4G LTE technology
from Huawei and ZTE for how many years
mmm-hmm so it's like you're making a big
deal out of five meeting now you do that
years ago I mean what powers our 4G LTE
right now take that up and we had we've
had a lot of these
we've had a lot of these discussions
that basically come down to like there
have to like that there's a sort of like
scapegoating happening yeah so there's a
lot of that going on but we're not gonna
get into it this is PocketNow not
democracy now but you know what I think
that actually does it for all of our
stories so you know what on that note
we're gonna go ahead and call it on this
