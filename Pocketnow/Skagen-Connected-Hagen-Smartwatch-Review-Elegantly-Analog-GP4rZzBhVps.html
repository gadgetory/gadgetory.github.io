continues leading up to Christmas a coin
flip literally decided for me between
adding this Scogin hybrid or a vector to
my wish list so we'll chalk this up as
one of the luckier chance decisions I've
made in recent memory truth be told I
was leaning towards the hybrid as I've
been a fan of Scogin design in the past
but never thrown in the cash to own one
adding some nifty features to a simple
stylish watch face was just the push I
needed so I'm glad the coin flip worked
out this way the connected line of
watches is a clean way to deliver basic
notifications while tracking activity a
secondary dial on the faces
multi-purpose giving you a percentage of
your step goal and offering four zones
for notifications which we'll talk about
more in just a sec three buttons
activate functions on the watching can
be customized for some simple phone
controls the whole affair is sealed up
and powered by a single replaceable
watch battery estimated to run for up to
six months though the more often this
watch vibrates for alarms the faster
that battery will run down this allows
for a water resistance depth rating of
up to three atmospheres or roughly
thirty meters a very nice piece of mind
feature there it's a stainless steel
casing which thankfully doesn't interact
with my skin issues and the watch uses
standard 20 millimeter straps on
quick-release pins to easily swap the
band out for replacement all very
traditional and watch like in the best
way possible using a low-power Bluetooth
connection the Scogin connects to an app
on your Android or iOS device for
managing watch features and fitness
tracking the watch face is so simple
you'll be using your phone to get all of
your options and controls there are
three buttons on a watch the top shows
you the date the middle button can
toggle between time zones and your alarm
and the bottom button is user
customizable it can be used as a leash
to locate your phone or is a toggle for
a music player which is what I've set
mine to do in the app you can set your
activity goal and then as you move
around you'll see your progress here the
opposite side of the dial points to four
regions in the app you can select up to
six people and up to 6 X to correspond
with those four regions and when you
feel a vibration and look at which
region the arm points to you'll know
which alert you're receiving a somewhat
important drawback to the system there's
an odd collection of apps which are
compatible it doesn't seem to support
every
app installed on your phone so this is
definitely an area where we hope the
developers can expand support in the
future as it stands now it's an
interesting exercise in forcing the user
to simplify their digital lifestyle
I don't believe Skagen really approached
these limitations with any kind of
philosophy but it did force me to
examine what I considered
mission-critical communication now this
isn't the kind of watch I would normally
wear as a fitness tracker
spoiler alert will soon be checking out
a qua weight fit but adding activity and
sleep tracking to a nice watch is a nice
touch a minor concern here that the
Scoggin seems to slightly overestimate
activity
we'd never recommend using a product
like this for medical grade tracking but
this watch consistently delivered about
100 extra steps per thousand when
compared to my misfit ray totally
helpful for tracking your general trends
though the connected app will sync with
google fit up by jawbone or Under
Armour's record
lastly the system could use a little
polish with Android 7 I regularly open
the app on my phone to find the
connection between the watch and the
phone had been severed the app seems to
be shuffled off when in the background
and ignoring battery optimizations on my
v20 helps keep the connection alive with
more consistency not necessarily the
fault of the developers but this should
be addressed during the watch setup or
app installation you need to be able to
trust a wearable notification system so
let's wrap this up where's that leave us
with the Scoggin connected I'm really
glad I took this gadget out for a spin
and it'll easily take over the duties as
my dress-up watch where my pebble was a
jeans and a t-shirt daily driver a
digital plastics watch watch which fit
in perfectly with a hoodie the Scoggin
will now compliment dress shoes and an
ironed button-up shirt evenings where
I'm dressed up like that are usually
social and my awareness for every little
online interaction is usually a lower
priority Plus this comes with the
benefit of blending in wonderfully it's
just a nice looking watch and even if
some of these issues aren't ever
properly addressed I still get to wear
an attractive timepiece in a world where
vinyl is out selling digital downloads
this Scoggin is elegantly analog but I
still don't feel like I found my daily
driver all in one master of
notifications and background health
tracking so the search continues
as always thanks so much for watching be
sure to subscribe to this channel for
more wearable coverage like this and
help us out with some social media
sharing for pocket now I'm Juan Carlos
bag now so I'm gadget guy on Twitter and
Instagram and I will catch you all on
the next review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
