everyone meaning the current iphone
success you're probably using can
already do a lot of what the 7 will
offer with the added benefit of a
headphone jack I'm hina believe it I
would it now and let's run down the
hottest reasons why you should hit the
software update button
iOS 10 is one of apples most complete
software updates and years we have a
separate hands-on video where we go into
detail on its features but some of these
being greats and others not so much
here's a quick rundown of what we've
used the most after testing the beta for
almost three months the new lock screen
is probably the most useful you can now
slide to the left to see your widgets
and slide to the right to launch the
camera Apple has also addressed a huge
complaint where touch ID would be just
too fast for you to see your
notifications as you can now simply
raise the phone to view them speaking of
notifications these now take advantage
of 3d touch for quick interactions
simply hard press to expand and respond
to your messages while on the go now
probably what I love the most is to be
able to use 3d touch that clear all
notifications which was another major
complaint and speaking of 3d touch Apple
has finally made it useful press on an
application icon and notice widgets
populate with important data on the fly
without the need of having to launch the
application third-party apps still have
some catching up to do here but this is
one of those features that I've used the
most particularly for launching things
like my reminders or my calendar the new
control center is now less convoluted
than last year with paints the control
toggles on the phone your music on
whichever application you're using and
even hump it whenever you get IOT
gadgets that are compatible we'll look
into home kit on a future video as there
aren't many options available to
showcase this in its full potential and
yes since we're talking full potential
serious one of those services that now
gets enhanced to connect with
third-party apps but sadly that part
isn't quite complete just yet Apple use
lifts as an example on how it works on
the keynote but that functionality is in
there yet there's a list of applications
supportive in the app store if you want
to start giving it a try
and then there are some major overhauls
and important applications like photos
which now groups people moments and
things in a very intuitive way and that
level of simplicity has also reached
Apple music with more basic approach to
building an experience based on you even
I message grew to look more like every
other messaging platform in the market
now being able to convey a little of
emotion and with new sticker options
that you can buy separately on the app
store unless you go free with the Mario
ones for example now I'm not going to
lie what I'm excited for mostest Apple's
new swift playgrounds which is available
today for the ipad if you've ever had
the curiosity to learn how to code for
iOS it really doesn't hurt to try or to
give this application to your kids again
there is more to iOS 10 that once
mentioned here but these are the ones
that have gone lists most excited during
our testing period watch one separate
video for a full list of all the updates
