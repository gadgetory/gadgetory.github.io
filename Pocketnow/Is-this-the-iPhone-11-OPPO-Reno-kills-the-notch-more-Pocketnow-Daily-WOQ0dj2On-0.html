confirms that this is the iPhone 11 or
what it might look like we get new leaks
of opal and we have an interesting way
of how to get rid of the notch
apparently and Razer CEO has pretty much
just hinted of why the razor phone 3
might be delayed I'm Jaime Rivera and
this is definitely a pre-recording as
I'm flying across the Atlantic to get
you the news this is PocketNow daily the
official page today begin with the some
interesting offerings from Spotify
they're trying a new duo service that's
focused on couples where you're gonna
pay less than the family plan and you're
gonna be able to Frankenstein playlists
that are focused on both of you as a
couple it's not available in every
country right now there are only 5s they
give it a try and probably the price tag
it's nearly close to a family plan like
why not just go for that now start with
the LGG eight thank you for those of you
that are wondering when that phone is
gonna be available I'm one of them
well pre-orders are gonna begin by the
time you watch this video with sales
beginning on April 11 definitely three
color variants the pre-order price is
819
on other devices yeah let us know if
you're getting one now start about
razors CEO and their plans for the
future when it comes to smartphones
they've pretty much like go of the
smartphone division it seems that
they're still working on one and
apparently the reason why we are not
gonna get a razor phone three to see yet
is because they want 5g on this phone
one exactly that's gonna be I don't know
but I think that it's a good idea for
Razer to not leave a smartphone market
but to also rethink their strategy now
start off the Opel Reno as one more time
we get more teasers as to what to expect
and I think this is going to be this I
don't know
pop-up camera that's the weirdest ever
as its slanted it looks like this a
weird eyebrow that's looking at you and
I wonder if there's a purpose that could
probably bring what a resistance or
whatever the case may be
obviously god we still don't know a lot
about this phone and I can't wait to
learn more because Oppo has been really
killing it with their flagships lately
and finally the hottest nurse that I
have to do with the iPhone 11 we're
hoping
as if there are some leak schematics
that are showing up and the funny part
is that these schematics are actually of
the iPhone 10 R or 11 R or whatever the
number is going to be but we see three
cameras in that weird array that we saw
so apparently this is gonna follow the
design of the Bay 20 throw whether
that's going to be the case or not let
us know in the comments what do you
think do you like this design for the
iPhone 11 or not do you think that this
is really the iPhone 11 arc because in
my case I don't know man
if they're gonna launch three phones
they better include three cameras on
each or at least two on one and three on
the others but that's just me leave us a
comment down below we looked at your
opinion friends again if you want to get
the news early or follow us on parking
out our common scriptable to our
channels English and Spanish for more
videos like this one and follow me on
Twitter Highlanders were together on
Instagram it I never leave it up please
give this video a thumbs up if you like
what you saw I'm Jaime meta-data thanks
so much for watching we'll see you next
week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
