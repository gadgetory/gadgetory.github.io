as resilient as Apple paints it to be
samsung decide to say could squirt
debate with apple a step higher and yeah
while we just launched another flip
camera phone I'm hi Mary vera and as I
said yesterday today will be me tequila
and Friday this is sparking a daily the
official news today start with Huawei as
the company has just announced that's
honor 7i which would be the typical
mid-ranger that we really wouldn't cover
in the show you know set dragon 616 not
something hot except for the fact that
it's got this 13 megapixel flipping
camera that tells the opal and three to
do it in a different way it's again a
very interesting perspective it's going
to start in China let's see him it
reaches our shores at some point and for
those of you still interested in the
dates for when the next-generation
iphone will be announced I get this on
my Twitter all the time well we've got
another now French carrier saying that
they are preparing for an announcement
September 9 pre-order September 11 and
it seems that the phone will be launched
on the 18th again so yeah this is the
second time we got the same rumors it
seems that this is the way it's going to
be if you just bought a Windows send
computer or have upgraded and notice
Windows cologne its biometrics services
and you don't trust the face detection
feature because you think it's as bad as
androids well think again the Australian
has just published the full video where
it tested it with six pairs of identical
twins and look at the article the twins
are fully identical and out of the six
tests well it failed in one so fairly
no.1 is yeah it is bad it should be a
hundred percent good but it's far better
than anything out there and it's not
like if all of you have a twin so it
does mean that the service is pretty
much reliable let's see how microsoft
plans to address that sixth one problem
but hey so far so good microsoft and
it's time for your favorite soap opera
up to date apple vs and shane you know
that Samsung's been working on the court
of appeals to get the the amount of
money that they have to pay to Apple
removed from their requirements as yet
they've dropped five hundred million
dollars and they've still got another
five hundred million dollars to go
since the Court of Appeals pretty much
said that they're done Samsung is now
taking things to the Supreme Court so
you can expect a lot more drama coming
very soon to your favorite channel and
finally for the disappointing news of
today you remember me complaining about
scratches on my Apple watch recently
well I'm not the only one there are full
Apple discussion forms in addition to
people on reddit complaining about their
Apple watch is particularly the Space
Gray model losing the text at the bottom
others complaining about the watch band
just looking terrible after a couple of
weeks which makes you wonder if it's
really worth it for you to pay four
hundred dollars for the sport
entry-level variant just because you
want to save some books and still have
an Apple watch so hey it leads me to the
question of the day what do you think
about Apple what do you think Apple
should do with these Apple watch units
that have all these issues in my case I
do hear that apple will be replacing
some of the people that have plans with
a space great unit but then again what
happens with all these other issues like
for example in the case of the washburn
just buy another one and have the same
problem leave us a comment down below I
feel that Apple should make a
replacement as well friends you know the
drill if you want to get the most
earlier before this video was filmed
machine full was unpacking out comment
subscribe to our YouTube channel as well
you follow me on Twitter hina
underscored any better on instagram at
high medley better please give this
video a thumbs up if you liked what you
saw I am a meta meta thank you very much
