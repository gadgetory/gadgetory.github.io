look like it makes any sense and we were
skeptical too but then we took a look at
the most often searched YouTube Nexus 5
strings and this comparison is up there
and that makes a certain degree of sense
if you think about it despite their
obvious differences these are two of the
highest profile devices out there right
now the phones getting most of the buzz
really so of course people want to know
how they compare let's find out I'm
Michael Fisher this is PocketNow and
this is Google Nexus 5 vs samsung galaxy
note 3 right up front probably the
biggest difference between these devices
is philosophical the Nexus 5 was built
to be a flagship phone at an affordable
price point while the note 3 was built
to be a premium phone offered at a
premium price more than that the devices
differ in just what they're trying to
accomplish the Nexus 5 exists to
showcase the best of pure Android or
more precisely perhaps pure Google the
note 3 sits at the exact opposite side
of the spectrum with so many
modifications that at times it hardly
looks like an Android device the gulf
between these phones becomes apparent
the minute you set eyes on their
hardware where the Nexus 5 takes the
form of a rather minimalist almost
featureless slab the Galaxy Note 3 is
meant to catch the eye there's a lot of
imitation stuff here
imitation metal imitations stitched
leather and whether that comes off as
high-end or tacky will depend on your
taste in terms of in hand feel the note
3 is 38 grams more massive than the
Nexus 5 and it's significantly larger so
much so that it's pretty tough to use
one-handed that's primarily because of
the 5.7 inch AMOLED screen on the note
nearly three-quarters of an inch larger
on the diagonal and featuring a Wacom
digitizer to sense input from the
devices included S Pen
the screen is the same resolution as on
the Nexus it doesn't offer as much pixel
density due to its larger size but it
does bring deeper blacks and better
viewing angles whether you like the
added pop it's AMOLED technology brings
two colors will depend on you under the
hood the differences keep piling up and
that's evidence starting right at the
back panel the notes is removable
granting access to the replaceable
battery and expandable microSD storage
the Nexus features neither of those its
battery and 16 or 32 gigs of storage
sealed up in its casing and while each
phone is powered by a Snapdragon 800 SOC
the note 3 takes things a step further
by bumping up the RAM by 50% and tossing
in an IR transmitter for controlling
your home entertainment system as well
as a higher resolution camera despite
the Nexus 5's inclusion of qi wireless
charging a touch we rather like and the
favorite feature from the nexus 4 it's
pretty clear that the speck beast in
this contest is the samsung phone but at
least part of the reason for that is
because the note needs pretty intense
hardware to run Samsung's software the
TouchWiz third-party UI is one of the
heaviest around and it enables the
special features we covered extensively
in our note 3 review everything from the
s-pen note-taking multitasking and
scrolling to the multi window mode that
lets you run two apps side by side at
the same time in exchange for this added
functionality though you're forced to
deal with samsung's idea of what
smartphone software should be an
environment which really isn't as mature
or as reliable as what Google is doing
on the Nexus which is namely providing
the smoothest tightest
cleanest Android experience to date with
no third-party UI to tangle with the
Nexus 5 may not bring as many features
but what it does it does very well its
Android in its most optimized form
giving you a direct line to a very very
powerful back-end of services and
features and almost all of it is simple
and
enough to use with one hand it's the
perfect combination of simplicity
aesthetic beauty and utility so while we
can get more done with the note 3 we
like the software experience as a whole
better on the Nexus 5
fortunately Android is customizable
enough to allow custom launchers to
replicate the best of both worlds for
those who like to get adventurous
elsewhere the note 3 and the Nexus are
more similar than you might expect the
camera is a good example we found the
Nexus 5's optically stabilized shooter
pretty inconsistent during our testing
but it keeps up nicely with the note 3
in terms of still shots delivering a
wider field of view than the Samsung
device and also producing more
true-to-life colors under certain
conditions the Nexus 5's camera is a
lower resolution unit but it's
stabilization helps it deliver better
shots particularly in low light and it
also does a better job at attenuating
the shakes and jitters that come from
shooting video while walking otherwise
these cameras are comparable on video
each delivering a nice picture with
excellent audio I shall have him I'll
chase him round the moons of nippy and
round and terraces until strong and
round perdition's flames before I give
him up there's a wider gulf in terms of
battery life with the user-replaceable
power pack the note 3 is already more
flexible than the Nexus but that
removable battery is also significantly
larger that means the note 3 is much
more likely to last a couple days away
from the charger then while our testing
showed the Nexus 5 is really no slouch
in that department the note 3 is still
our pick for you road warriors out there
call quality is roughly equivalent in
normal voice conversations but switch
those calls to speakerphone mode and the
bottom firing speaker of the note 3
handily out shouts the weak unit on the
Nexus that holds true for media playback
as well
in short if the Nexus 5 is the small but
quick sports car that's easy to just
fire up and drive the note 3 is the
finicky SUV that takes more time and
attention but allows much more
flexibility and power on your trip and
you know that would be that if we didn't
take costs into consideration as we made
very clear in our Nexus 5 review a huge
part of that devices appeal is its price
at between 349 and 399 off contract in
select markets through the Google Play
Store the Nexus 5 is between three to
four hundred dollars cheaper than the
average cost of an off contract note 3
that's a big deal from any perspective
and it makes the nexus something to
seriously consider if you're on a budget
or if you're looking for the best
possible Android experience in a
conventional sense if instead you're
looking for the added utility that only
the combination of a huge screen a
stylist and class-leading Hardware
versatility can provide or you're in the
market for a phone that can also serve
as a tablet replacement well seek out
the note 3 no other phone fits the bill
like it does just be sure to save your
pennies beforehand and don't begrudge
your Nexus 5 carrying friends their
excellent value
