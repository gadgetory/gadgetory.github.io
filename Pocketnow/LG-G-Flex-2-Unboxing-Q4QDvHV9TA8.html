a special thing because it gives
manufacturers a rare opportunity the
second chance to make a first impression
sure we already took a look at LG's new
flagship back at CES 2015 but now we get
to see it as the end user will on day
one of ownership I'm Michael Fisher with
PocketNow and this is our unboxing of
the LG G flex 2 like the box for the
original G flex the G flex 2 is
packaging subtly suggest the curve of
the product within it calls out a few
specs on the exterior but that's not the
focus the swooping lines and soir√©e
paint job are here to say that the phone
inside is a hot rod opening the box I
see that analogy is an apt one for LG
has sent us the red G flex 2 awesome
underneath we've got the usual product
information and power adaptors for
non-us markets revealing this is the f5
10 s model and at the bottom of the box
included for your listening enjoyment LG
quad beat 2 earbuds with flattened
noodle-like cables and finely machined
metallic housings how they sound as TBD
but it's always nice to see earbuds
bundled in the box especially with a
high-end phone such as this speaking of
the handset let's get back to it so we
can expose that five and a half inch
screen to the air for the first time
this is serious business
so silence please the G flex 2 is just
as I remember it from CES glossy
lightweight and super modern looking
with its self-healing skin coating
metallic trim and of course this 700
radius curve it's also much smaller than
its trailblazing predecessor marking it
as a more mainstream device as you can
see it's a moderately sized phone that's
bigger than some competitors and smaller
than others and say what you will about
the practicality of the curve it makes
it more pocketable than most phones its
size LG has also retained the love it or
hated rear key arrangement though
without the after mounted notification
this time and powering the unit on we
can see the familiar LGU I poured it
over from the g3 LG informs us that it's
made some major adjustments to the user
experience since CES and we'll look
forward to finding out exactly what they
are we'll share details on those and
every other aspect of the new G flex 2
