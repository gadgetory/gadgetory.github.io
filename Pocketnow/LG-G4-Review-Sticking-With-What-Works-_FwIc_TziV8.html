an impressive smartphone from the
original Optimus G to Google's Nexus 5
to the pixel packed g3 the company's
legacy is substantial but still it
always seems to be a step behind the
competition in some way or another with
its 2015 flagship LG looks to change
that and it just might I'm Michael
Fisher with PocketNow and this is our
video review of the LG g4 small
confession I'm huge into leather
smartphones and while we've also checked
out the plastic and ceramic versions of
the g4 it's the leather one I've spent
the most time with
and I'm glad above all a smart phones
hardware should be comfortable and the
soft full grain leather on our braun g4
is just that minimizing the harsh
corners and giving the slightly curved
phone nearly the same high-end feel as
the Moto X though it's a shame LG didn't
follow Motorola in going with a metallic
side rail to bolster its premium cred
the result is exposed corners on the g4
which are already starting to discolor
from what I can only guess is denim dye
from taking it in and out of gene
pockets the center stitching seems
durable enough though doing a nice job
of accentuating the rear key control
collective while also providing a
comfortable anchor point for the finger
and look that beautiful back cover comes
right off meaning you can swap it for
another flavor if you want also rather
than follow the competition in
eliminating expandable storage and a
removable battery LG has retained both
for the g4 making it the most extensible
flagship on the market sadly last year's
g3 battery doesn't fit even though it
looks like it should but this year's
pack is just as beefy 3000 milliamp
hours for the global version 2900 for
the t-mobile US variant that battery
powers a 5 and a half inch quad HD
display that builds on last year's
successes and ferrets out some of the
shortfalls the new so-called quantum dot
IPS screen is more colorful offers more
contrast and most importantly it's 25%
brighter than the g3 it still wouldn't
be my first choice for outdoor use in
direct sunlight
samsung's galaxy
a six gets much brighter but it's
definitely an improvement over last year
and in moderate light it's got some
pretty beautiful colors going on power
up that big display with the push of the
rear key or a double tap on the cover
glass and you get a look at android 5.1
with LG's new interface which looks a
lot like LG's old interface you get a
smart notice widget dead center of the
homescreen that flashes occasional bits
of info it'll now let you know if a
certain app is drawing too much memory
or battery power in the background which
is nice but it doesn't do that often
enough more on that in a second and
mainly it just serves to give you
long-winded weather forecasts it still
doesn't go far enough to supplant the
Google now service it emulates same for
the smart settings suite which lives on
the leftmost homescreen and offers
automatic functions based on your
location it's nice to have your phone
turn on Wi-Fi automatically when you get
home for instance but it doesn't do much
more than that and in my testing it had
trouble knowing when it was and wasn't
home this is non final software so
hopefully that will improve with time
and speaking of improvements while this
skin looks a lot like previous
generations it's well if it were a car
I'd say it drives different while the g3
often felt like it was over burdened
trying to push too many pixels and
getting really hot doing it the g4 is
solid and slick in everything from the
lockscreen animations to the dual window
functionality thoughtful features like
the notification toggle and resizable
keyboard are still here also LG has
thrown in more color than last year and
softened some of the previous versions
sharper edges on the whole I like these
changes but I also think the skin lacks
cohesion it feels like I'm using one
phone one second and another the next at
the end of the day I don't think the LG
UI brings enough benefit that I'd choose
it over say stock Android but it's also
pleasant enough that I wouldn't go out
of my way to replace it either the LG UI
is fine nothing more nothing less
if you're looking to be impressed look
no further than the camera the specs
tell us it's a 16 megapixel sensor with
an F 1.8 aperture and a 1 / 2.6 sensor
size optically stabilized across three
axes to correct for up to
two degrees of motion and the result of
all that lingo bomb is this excellent
photos as Adam Lane noted in a pocket
now feature post the g4 isn't without
the usual smartphone handicaps namely
digital noise and aggressive artificial
sharpening but these defects really only
show up beyond 100 percent zoom at
normal sizes the g4 camera performs
admirably even against the fabled king
of smartphone cameras the Lumia 1020
colors are rich with good dynamic range
in contrast and the wide aperture
combined with optical stabilization
means that even as the Sun gets real low
the camera keeps it school instead of
hulking out in a near dark room I shot
the same photo with five phones on
automatic settings and the g4 produced
the best of the bunch for a quick photo
you can double click the volume down
button to launch and snap but with such
a short time to get focused these shots
aren't the greatest to really fine-tune
for exactly the picture you're looking
for LG gives you the most elaborate
suite of manual controls we've seen on
Android out of the box complete with a
level gauge histogram and raw support so
any effect you can dream up you can
probably execute the lustre fades a
little bit in video mode it's not bad
but in full HD the auto focus and
exposure tend to wander a bit colors get
a little washed out and the framerate is
kind of choppy too
the g4 does offer UHD recording and a
slo-mo mode for what it's worth switch
on over to the front and well I can't
speak for Adam lane but this is
definitely the best selfie I've ever
taken
whether it's thanks to the 8 megapixel
resolution the beauty face post
processing or the ease of taking a photo
with a hand gesture the g4 has become
one of my favorite selfie snappers
combine that with the quick response
time and easy-to-use viewfinder on the
main shooter and you've got a smartphone
camera that outstrips much of the
competition Bravo LG
we've tested the g4 on t-mobile us
between New York and Boston for a week
and as a phone it's great the slight
curve of the chassis combines with that
soft leather backing to make the g4 very
comfortable to talk on and reception
seems to be on point with t-mobile's
network only disappointing in super
dense urban areas like midtown Manhattan
or very rural settings like the Blue
Hills reservation in Massachusetts for
conference calls the speaker phones rear
firing placement is a bummer but at
least it's loud and that goes for music
and sound effects and games to which the
Snapdragon 808 processor runs with
aplomb any concerns I may have had about
the 808 vanished by the end of my first
day with the device it's very smooth
really though most modern processors can
run even high demand games the real
performance measure is in the daily
grind how it feels on the day-to-day
here the g4 shines in most areas but
despite its three gigs of ram it suffers
in memory management put simply and
crudely multitasking on Android lollipop
sucks because apps left in the
background are often forced to close or
hibernate if you do almost anything else
in the foreground which obviously has
implications for everything from fitness
trackers to podcasting apps
this isn't LG's fault it's androids
problem but this is an Android phone and
it's too frustrating not to mention that
aggressive memory management doesn't do
much for battery life either while I was
able to get to about four-and-a-half
hours of screen on time over an
eight-hour day that hasn't been
consistent probably thanks to phantom
apps sucking up milliamps in the
background when I got into a habit of
closing all background apps on a regular
basis battery life improved do this and
the g4 battery will almost definitely
last you a full day while it's handy to
be able to swap out that battery it
would also be convenient to fast charge
it as you can on most new phones sadly
there's no quick charging built into the
g4 so you'll have to wait about an hour
and 45 minutes to take it from zero to a
full tank
well powered off
despite those shortcomings the LG g4 is
modern its powerful and it comes in
trims for the showy as well as the
conservative it retains the customizable
hardware that many of its competitors
have left behind and it packs a whopper
of a camera if you're looking for an
alternative to the Galaxy S six that
doesn't sacrifice photo quality or you
want a phone that lets you change up its
look while you're swapping in a fresh
battery the g4 is the smartphone for you
and it's almost certainly the best LG
smartphone of all time for more on the
LG g4 check out Adam lanes camera
shootout at pocket now and be sure to
stay tuned here on YouTube for our
Galaxy s6 and HTC One m9 comparisons

phones on twitter grateful that leather
isn't just for motorcycles and
Motorola's anymore thanks for watching
everyone we'll see you next time
