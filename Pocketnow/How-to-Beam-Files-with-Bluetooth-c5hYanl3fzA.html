pocketnow.com and in this video I'm
going to show you how to beam files with
over Bluetooth so you can send pictures
and contacts and ringtones and that sort
of thing from one device to the next and
I'm using an Xperia x10 and a touch pro
on the left but you can also do this
from a windows mobile device to a
standard dumb phone as long as it has
the obex standard built in alright so
let's take a look I want to turn on
bluetooth first on both devices and turn
it on there and turn it on there okay so
now I'm going to go into the settings
for Bluetooth on the device that I'm
sending to and I want to make sure if I
go into mode that make this device
visible to other devices is checked so
that I can get them connected to each
other so I'm going to go over to the
Xperia this is the device that I will be
sending from and I'm gonna click add new
device cool so touch pro comes up and I
tap on that click Next
it asks for the passcode which was just
usually defaulted to 1 2 3 4 and then on
the touch pro it says or you want to
connect to the x1 I and I'm gonna say
yes and it will also put in the passcode
on the touch Pro and click Next and
there we're connected it says your
Pocket PC has connected with the touch
pro and this is connected with the x1
it's funny they still call it Pocket PC
Microsoft stop calling it that a long
time ago
anyhow so I'm gonna go into file
explorer and go into my storage card and
well here I am already and I'm going to
so I'm in my storage card and I'm gonna
select one of these pictures they're all
about 1 megabyte so I'm gonna see how
long it takes to transfer so I tap and
hold on any picture here or file and I
do
beam file and then it's going to search
for devices that I can beam to and touch
pros gonna come up in a second and it
says unknown device but we know that
that's the touch pro so I clack click on
that to send and I'm going to get
something on the touch pro screen you
are receiving data to stop receiving
press cancel so right now it's sending
one megabyte and let's time this and
after it's done transferring that was
about 23 seconds for 1 megabyte it says
you want to save the picture to your
device and I'm gonna click
and by default it goes to my document so
if I go up to file explorer and here we
are in my documents and look on the
bottom here is the file which is
actually like I said a picture so about
23 seconds for 1 megabyte which is
pretty fast again sending over Bluetooth
is a really quick and easy way to send
pictures and contacts and ringtones and
other files while you're out and about
and you don't have syncing cables and
that sort of thing so that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
