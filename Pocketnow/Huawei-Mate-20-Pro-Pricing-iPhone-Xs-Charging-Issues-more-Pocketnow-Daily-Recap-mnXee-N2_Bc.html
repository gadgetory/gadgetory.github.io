finally the hottest news today have to
do with and can you imagine how I look
now that I'm kind of sick oh my god why
is your name Jaime Riviera
named gasm I don't know that's a good
question I I guess I should ask my mom
veto should do the parking out daily
video that is actually a fantastic idea
that's right it's that time of the week
I am hi metal you know this is PocketNow
and this is the pocket knife daily recap
your comments for last week so on Monday
the topic was the iPhone 10s and 10's
Macs and the whole charging issues that
people are having before iOS 12 point
0.01 I asked you if you're having those
issues or what's the case and we had 495
comments it's just the new tap the
charge feature godlike seriously it
seems like if Apple comes up with a
stupidest thing sometimes but yeah
definitely not Apple is experimenting
before removes a lightning connector too
you know I actually thought that that
was kind of a conspiracy theory to see
how many people would just go out and
buy wireless chargers and I hope that's
not gonna be the future it looks like
Apple needs to hire the Energizer Bunny
amen
then on Tuesday the topic was data
speeds there was a comparison that we
even conducted on our own where we
compared the Galaxy Note nine to the
iPhone 10s in data speeds and the note 9
smoked everything out there and I asked
you does data speeds and capabilities
affect your buying decisions we had 412
comments no not really but I'm always
going for Samsung's in the no line which
has no problem with data speeds it's
pretty much the same isn't it I think
that any phone that costs $1000 they
should be great at anything I have to
totally agree definitely I mean 1000
bucks man there's no excuse for there to
be any issues with the phone a phone
capable of fast data speeds doesn't
matter if the carriers don't offer those
speeds no the problem is this the iPhone
claims gigabit LTE so I tested it on our
gigabit LTE network with the same SIM
card on both phones in separate times
and they just didn't perform so you
I'm saying this is a phone that's
capable of providing it this is a
carrier that's capable of providing it
in the phone didn't deliver and then on
Wednesday the topic was the LGV 40 thin
QR overview went live and I asked you
what do you think the announcement was
there we had 321 comments LG phones are
full of features but not the Polish ones
I have to agree in certain parts of that
yes the battery on the v40 is really
disappointing pass guys please don't let
yourself be speck heads I mean seriously
this phone does not have the numbers but
it does have the performance I don't
care if a phone has 4,500 milliamp hours
in the battery if they don't if they're
not able to deliver the v40 does that LG
be 40 is the real real deal
yes definitely it is a very good phone
not necessarily my favorite right now
but it was very impressive in the tests
that I conducted in the review period
that I had it and then on Thursday the
topic was the oneplus 60 the company
launched a teaser I asked you if you're
holding out for the phone
we had 558 comments oh my god I was
gonna get the oneplus 60 why are
companies being so stupid by removing
valuable pieces of the phone
you mean the headphone jack I agree
stupid as the word 1 plus 6 is a better
choice than the 16 because of the
headphone jack who knows man we'll see
I think the headphone jack defenders
will hurt 1 plus when you cater to a
niche you shouldn't turn your back on
them I'll wait and see I have to totally
agree with your comment the company has
catered to that particular mention then
they're starting to remove things that's
not a good way to do business totally
agree with you and then finally on
Friday the rumors were that the huawei
mate 20 Pro that Trump I'm about to get
on a plane to go see in London was going
to cost more than $1000 I asked you what
do you think about these crazy price
tags that we had 497 comments question
why companies charging 900 to $1,300 for
a phone that's insane I have to agree I
don't understand that I mean computers
which have more complex parts you know
like your typical new MacBook how is it
possible that a phone is more expensive
than a computer that doesn't make sense
to me either
1,100 I could buy a high-end PC for that
price exactly that's the thing I don't
feel that phones are worth that amount
of money and I don't feel that you'd get
your money's worth when you pay that
amount of money
for certain products out there this
price trend can go forever once their
sales start to fall they will hopefully
reduce the prices of the phones and you
know I have to totally agree I thought
that that was going to be the case I
felt that the iPhone 10 was not going to
sell because of how expensive it was you
know what the problem is the problem is
that it's sold and it proved all of us
wrong I thought that the market was just
gonna be like no I'm not gonna pay that
much for phone but it went the other way
around that's it for the bakken out
