with some devices from Oppo but this
morning
this phone arrived on our doorstep here
at the offices so it's time to get out
of the box I'm Taylor Martin this is
PocketNow and this is our unboxing of
the Oppo find 7 a so some of the smaller
manufacturers in the Android marketing
space are more interested in pushing the
market along in developing new features
and truly innovating whereas some of the
bigger players are starting to sit back
and focus on different things like user
experience that's not to say Oppo isn't
focusing on user experience but in terms
of specifications Oppo is very boldly
pushing things forward
not necessarily with this device this is
the Oppo find 7 a the Oppo find 7 is the
device that really pushes things along
with a 2k display and the 2.5 gigahertz
quad-core Krait 400 cpu part of the
Snapdragon 801 this one is a step down
from the 7 in just about every way but
it's still on par with some of the best
flagships out there so that's what's so
impressive is the step down version of
the phone is comparable with something
like the HTC One m8 so without too much
delay we can get inside the box and see
what this thing's about and as we do
it's actually got a nice pull tab there
for us just rip it open and they do some
clever stuff with their their boxes and
their packaging which is really
interesting so I don't think we're gonna
see anything too terribly neat here but
they sent out a teaser to some outlets
with a really cool light display this
one just seems to be a plain black
pretty boring box and if we can get into
the packaging I might have to grab a
knife always have a knife nearby some of
you say that's creepy but uh comes in
handy especially when you do unboxing
videos so this the Box actually feels
really nice I don't know how to explain
that through words or show it on video
with them the box is not your standard
box it's it's plastic which is
interesting so we'll set that aside
here's the phone which it has a
five point five inch display so it's
it's a pretty big phone we'll get to
that in a minute inside you're gonna get
some ear buds so nothing fancy they look
just standard ear buds with some extra
tips of course a microUSB cable which is
nice and you get this dedicated charger
which is something you don't see much
anymore
this giant power brick with a built-in
micro USB cable and of course I quit
fumbling stuff here you have some
reading materials and the battery that's
gonna be helpful but it felt a little
heavy so you put all this stuff back in
here push it out of the way to get to
what we really care about this is the
Oppo find 7 a and this one has a 1080p
5.5 inch display so the the defined 7
has a 5.5 inch 2k display that's 2560 by
1440 this one is 5 by 5.5 inches at 1920
by 1080 that is an overall pixel density
of 401 pixels per inch inside this one
has 2 gigs of RAM and 16 gigabytes of
storage it also has the same 13
megapixel camera around back that is a 5
megapixel camera on the front and this
battery if I'm not mistaken is gonna be
2800 milli amp hours so actually there
it is it's 2700 milliamp hours so this
one is still a pretty pretty large size
better we've seen larger but this is
also a very thin phone so they're kind
of constrained with size I suppose if we
can look at this close to the mic don't
think it's gonna give us anything
no noise sorry about that but if we can
figure out how to get this battery door
off
there we go it just pulls off in a
really weird way if we pop the battery
in you're not gonna put a sim in it just
yet pop this back on and it feels really
solid it doesn't exactly feel or look
like the back comes off which is nice
it's something we want to see but it
does feel really light even with the
battery inside like I said earlier this
one has a Snapdragon 801 chipset that is
a 2.3 gigahertz quad-core Krait 400 CPU
and the Adreno 330 GPU so the specs are
really quite great for this sort of
device especially considering that this
is not the top tier model this is the
the step down from the flagship the
seven so this very interesting the other
cool thing about this phone and what I'm
really interested in and getting to try
out is the camera so it's 13 megapixels
but it's capable through a feature a
poco calls super zoom it's capable of
taking 50 megapixel images and this is
what the display looks like so at 1080p
this one looks very very nice and this
is going to be what most Oppo previous
fo owners are gonna know as the color OS
UI so it's a little different we'll get
into that once we get to the review and
comparisons with to really tinker with
that and play and see how it's different
and similar to other versions of Android
so that's gonna do it for this unboxing
if you enjoyed it be sure to click the
thumbs up button below and of course
stay tuned for more Oppo finds have an A
coverage over the next week or so we're
gonna be comparing it with some other
similar devices and of course digging
into some of the finer details of this
phone like how the camera works in all
of that and we'll be giving it the full
review treatment as well so we'll see
you'll see a written and a video review
from us on this phone and stay tuned for
that I'm Taylor Martin and I will see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
