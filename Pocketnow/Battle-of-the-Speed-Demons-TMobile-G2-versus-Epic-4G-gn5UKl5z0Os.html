today i want to show you just how fast
the t-mobile g2 is compared to the
sprint epic 4g now over here 1 gigahertz
didn't hit this phone this is 800
megahertz but it's got kind of a newer
processor over here you've got the
samsung processor at one gigahertz but
let's see just how fast they are
okay over here on the right I've got the
g2 running android 2.2 and on the left
is the epic 4g running android 2.1 now
that may be the dealbreaker right there
so it's not a true comparison but when
you talk about 2.2 being faster than 2.1
that's absolutely true when you talk
about 1 gigahertz being faster than 800
megahertz well that's technically true
but there's a lot of other parameters
involved there we don't really rate
speed by processor speed anymore by
megahertz and gigahertz anymore but
let's see just how fast it runs so I've
got quadrant standard running it on both
of these right now and I'm going to try
and launch these at the same time and
let's take a look right off the bat the
g2 has passed the cpu test a lot faster
than the epic 4g even though it's a
slower processor megahertz wise and it's
gone on to the 3d graphics test before
the epic 4g you can see both devices
look beautiful in fact the epic 4g
probably wins out in how how smooth the
graphics look and how pretty the
graphics are a little bit better shading
and lighting
most of the way through the test right
now and right there looking at it we've
got a score 15 32 on the g2 right out of
the box and a score of 9 13 so very very
big difference in speed and you can see
based on this test alone the 800
megahertz processor in that g2 is not
any kind of a slow device in fact the
stock score for the nexus one running
android 2.2 and above scores below the
g2 so anybody who thought that the g2
would not be a replacement or a
successor to the nexus one there's your
results right there definitely a fast
phone very very quick and I think
everybody's going to impress be
impressed even the naysayers who were
saying that 800 megahertz was going to
be its downfall so obviously lots more
videos are going to be coming up
regarding the g2 we've got speed tests
to run comparing the hspa+ versus the 4g
speeds over here so you'll want to make
sure that you have subscribed to our
video channel if you have not done so
already obviously if you like to see
these kinds of videos we need to know
that and we do that by you giving a
thumbs up to the video to share that
with your friends comment down below if
there's anything that you'd like to see
that we didn't cover or like to see
covered in a little bit more detail so
showing off the speed of the g2 compared
to the sprint epic 4g for pocket now i'm
