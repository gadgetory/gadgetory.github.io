pocket comm and say we're unboxing
Motorola flip-out which is somewhat of a
budget phone on AT&amp;amp;T which is running
Android 2.1 so let's get started okay so
we'll cut this package open real quick
from FedEx see okay and then we'll just
slide the box out of the plastic and
let's see oh it's kind of a small box in
terms of AT&amp;amp;T usually they have somewhat
larger boxes and it looks as though the
flip-out is somewhat of a small box
let's go look on here we can see that we
have the Android and a Wi-Fi GPS and
Internet of course let's see on the back
we have platform 2.1 quad-band GSM with
Wi-Fi B&amp;amp;G let's see up to 32 gigabytes
for a memory card 320 by 240 touch
displays so that's a rather low
resolution display for an Android 2.2
device which has come uncommon
especially for a QWERTY keyboard device
let's see we have a GPS Android Market
all that great stuff and a 3 megapixel
camera with a digital zoom so let's open
up the box and we'll get to the device
itself let's see here
some literature not too much there let's
see I can set the phone over here for
just one second looks like the battery
cover comes off with the course this
phone comes with extra battery cover so
you can customize your own personal
colors if you like so let's just set
that to the side for just one second
and I'm more garbage we have the
microUSB to sync cable and we have the
wall charger and that's also a USB port
on the side so you want to use both of
them if you're in charge your device on
the wall and let's see we have the
battery covers here we have a orange one
any black one that comes with the device
inside the box and we have our battery
let's see what size battery this is this
is a eleven hundred and thirty milliamp
hour battery so that's a pretty good
size for such a small phone so let's
look a little bit closer here as to
the flip out so it's pretty small I'm
surprised it's actually quite small in
hand in comparison to some other devices
I'll show you in just a second it's ooh
that's actually kind of cool to flip it
out which is probably why they call it
the flip out the quarter keyboard seems
pretty usable I could actually see
myself using this as a texting device
okay so I put the battery in and police
the battery cover on the back and it's
pretty thin as you can tell if we
compare to some other devices which of
course are a little bit thinner than
this phone here's the Nexus One in terms
of size it's a small phone I'm surprised
how small it is it looks way bigger in
the pictures but then again of course
they are just photographs it's pretty
small I mean you could carry this in
your pocket pretty comfortably and have
a device with a lot of features right at
hand for for such a small compact size
so we can pick a pair it to the Nexus
One it's a little it's mean it's a lot
smaller than the Nexus One of course the
screen is almost half the size just from
the portrait position here so if we look
at it at another device of course then
hd2 is going to dwarf
this smaller phone and then we can look
at the iPhone 4 of course it's also
going to look a lot smaller than the
iPhone 4 and much thicker than the
iPhone 4 maybe about twice as thick if
we compare it to a dollar size object we
have a $20 bill here it's a pretty small
I mean if you look at that it's like
less than a half the size of the dollar
bill and here we have a credit card size
object it's a little bit higher than a
credit card but it's not by much I mean
just like maybe centimeter larger than
the width of a credit card and about a
two centimeter and a half the length of
a credit card size object so that is the
unboxing of the Motorola flip-out and we
will show you more when the hardware
core comes up and also stay tuned to
watch the software tours and if you like
our video let's make sure you give us a
thumbs up I guess I someone said I
should use my left hand since the
insignia on the bottom shows that it's
the left thumb which is up and also
leave some comments down below we'd like
to hear what you're saying
and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
